Jonathan Van-Tam, England’s deputy chief medical officer, described the situation as “grim, depressing and perilous”.The Big Ben, which is undergoing repair since 2017, will come alive at midnight to herald the New Year, but there will be none of the iconic fireworks around it that would normally be watched by tens of thousands along the Thames and telecast live to millions across the globe.‘Covid-19 loves a crowd, cancel parties’ was the key message on a public information campaign on Thursday, urging Britons to usher in the New Year at home. Millions more Britons moved to the top Tier 4 Covid-19 alert system with the toughest restrictions on Wednesday night.Johnson said: “(As) as the sun rises tomorrow on 2021 we have the certainty of those vaccines. Pioneered in a UK that is also free to do things differently, and if necessary better, than our friends in the EU. Free to do trade deals around the world”.“This is an amazing moment for this country. We have our freedom in our hands and it is up to us to make the most of it. Leading both the G7 and the COP 26 climate change summit in Glasgow, And an open, generous, outward looking, internationalist and free trading global Britain, that campaigns for 12 years of quality education for every girl in the world”.He added: “2021 is the year we can do it, and I believe 2021 is above all, the year when we will eventually do those everyday things that now seem lost in the past. Bathed in a rosy glow of nostalgia, going to the pub, concerts, theatres, restaurants, or simply holding hands with our loved ones in the normal way”.Johnson, however, insisted that the UK is still a way off from that situation and warned that there are “tough weeks and months ahead”.Meanwhile, the Brexit agreement reached with Brussels last week received royal assent and became law. Several aspects of everyday life are likely to change as new post-Brexit realities unfold.This will include higher prices in supermarkets and changes to Britons visiting EU member-states. There will be a 90-day limit to their stay in any 180-day period, using queues for non-EU citizens at airports, and being asked by immigration officials to show return tickets and funds for their stay.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/an-amazing-moment-for-uk-says-british-pm-boris-johnson-as-country-moves-out-of-eu/story-WXE4odAZCVOewDFz7B6QxO.html

It will go through the southeast of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, one of the world’s most geologically active areas.The Sichuan-Tibet Railway starts from Chengdu, capital of Sichuan Province and travels through Ya’an and enters Tibet via Qamdo, shortening the journey from Chengdu to Lhasa from 48 hours to 13 hours.Linzhi, also known as Nyingchi, is located close to Arunachal Pradesh border.Last month, President Xi Jinping instructed officials to expedite construction of the new railway project connecting Sichuan Province and Linzhi in Tibet, saying it would play a key role in safeguarding the border stability.With a designed speed of 160 km per hour, the 435-km rail line passes through 47 tunnels and 120 bridges, according to its constructor Tibet Railway Construction Co., Ltd.Construction started in 2014 on the railway connecting Lhasa, the regional capital, and Nyingchi in eastern Tibet. It is the first electrified railroad in Tibet and is slated to begin operations in June 2021, the Xinhua report said.So far, a total of 31.2 billion yuan (about USD 4.8 billion) has been invested in the project, according to official data.With more than 90 per cent of the railway built in areas more than 3,000 metres above sea level, the high altitude and complex geological conditions have posed great challenges to the project, the report said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-finishes-track-laying-work-for-sichuan-tibet-railway-line-close-to-arunachal/story-qVNAjCbLTNoVT9Kyb1jYaN.html

31-12-2020||World||China plays down envoy’s visit to Nepal amid political crisis||China on Thursday played down the significance of the visit of a top official of the ruling Communist Party of China to Nepal to unite the warring factions of the Nepal Communist Party, saying the Chinese delegation’s talks focussed on enhancing inter-party interactions.The high-level Chinese delegation led by Vice Minister of the International Department of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Guo Yezhou visited Nepal this week and held separate talks with top leaders of the warring factions of the ruling party to patch up differences between them.The Chinese delegation returned home on Wednesday after concluding its four-day visit to Kathmandu while the political crisis continued in Nepal.Asked to disclose the outcome of Guo’s visit at a media briefing here, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin skirted any references to the present political crisis in Nepal and China’s efforts to bring about a rapprochement between Nepal’s feuding leaders.Wang said the Chinese delegation met the leaders of both the ruling party and the opposition in Nepal and exchanged views on conducting inter-party interactions and mutual learning, advancing practical Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) cooperation and other issues of mutual concern.“The Nepalese side congratulated the CPC on the upcoming 100th anniversary of its founding and expressed willingness to deepen traditional friendship,” Wang said. Nepal plunged into a political crisis after Prime Minister K P Sharma Oli, known for his pro-Beijing leanings, in a surprise move, recommended dissolving the 275-member House on December 20, amidst a tussle for power with former premier Pushpa Kamal Dahal ‘Prachanda’.Acting on Oli’s recommendation, President Bidya Devi Bhandari dissolved the House the same day and announced fresh elections on April 30 and May 10, sparking protests from a large section of the Nepal Communist Party (NCP) led by Prachanda, also a co-chair of the ruling party.The Chinese delegation held talks with President Bhandari, Prime Minister Oli, NCP chairs ‘Prachanda’ and Madhav Nepal, former prime minister Jhana Nath Khanal and leader of the Janata Samajbadi Party Baburam Bhattarai.During his meetings with Oli and Prachanda, the Chinese leader is learnt to have told them to make efforts for reunification as the split in the largest communist party of Nepal will weaken communist movement in South Asia, according to a senior leader of Prachanda-led faction of the NCP. The Chinese delegation has suggested two possible solutions to resolve the current political crisis in Nepal, a senior NCP said in Kathmandu on Tuesday.Under ‘Plan A’, the dissolved House could be reinstated through the Supreme Court verdict followed by re-unification of the two factions, he said on condition of anonymity.The Chinese leader has advised the senior NCP leaders to give alternative to Prime Minister Oli if the Parliament gets reinstated. If the first option is not workable then the ‘Plan B’ would be to contest the mid-term election through electoral alliance among all the communist forces of Nepal, the NCP leader added.The Chinese team also met main opposition Nepali Congress chief Sher Bahadur Deuba and discussed the latest political developments in the country.China’s political profile in Nepal has been on the rise in recent years with billions of dollars of investments under its multi-billion-dollar Belt and Road Initiative, including the Trans-Himalayan Multi-Dimensional Connectivity Network.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-plays-down-envoy-s-visit-to-nepal-amid-political-crisis/story-keXybsRgrgF0Np3X2oM5RO.html
31-12-2020||World||Covid-19 pandemic meets 500th anniversary of 1st global voyage||Disease, mutinies and uncharted waters nearly sabotaged the global circumnavigation of the expedition led by Portuguese mariner Ferdinand Magellan. Five centuries later, the pandemic looms as a Spanish navy tall ship sails to commemorate the feat.The Juan Sebastián de Elcano, named for a Basque captain who completed the 1519-1522 circumnavigation with 17 of the roughly 240 crewmembers who began it, docked around Latin America after leaving Europe in August. Visitors were not allowed on board and the crew disembarked in just a few places, including the Chilean island of Dawson in the Strait of Magellan and San Lorenzo island in Peru.“This was possible after confirming that the environments were completely free” of Covid-19, Lt. Luis Martínez García, the ship’s public information officer, emailed from the vessel. The ship departs across the Pacific from Mexico on Friday.Magellan’s expedition for Spanish trade and imperialism opened a westward route from Europe to the Spice Islands, the Maluku archipelago in today’s Indonesia. The epic story invites appreciation for conflicting, overlapping perspectives on history as well as the rewards and perils of a connected world.It was “the first action humans took on a literally planetary scale,’’ said Joyce Chaplin, a professor of early American history at Harvard University and author of “ Round About the Earth: Circumnavigation from Magellan to Orbit.”“Only by the 19th century was it a safer kind of journey, and this was when it became a popular pastime, as in Jules Verne’s ‘Around the World in Eighty Days,‘” Chaplin said. “Now, we worry, like those early circumnavigators, that maybe taking on the entire planet is a deadly business, given how our collective impact on the globe is destroying species and ecosystems.”Magellan crossed the strait between the Atlantic and Pacific oceans that has his name in modern Chile, where President Sebastián Piñera recently said the voyage was about “knocking down walls and building bridges where today ideas, people, knowledge and culture flow freely.″Magellan, a daring navigator with Portuguese military experience in Africa and Asia, was later spurned by Portugal, Spain’s rival, and distrusted by Spanish sailors in his fleet. While Magellan’s expedition exploited Indigenous people, Christopher Columbus is a far more divisive figure today for his role in the violent colonization of the Americas.Magellan’s interpreter, an enslaved ethnic Malay called Enrique by the Spanish, has been commemorated in parts of Southeast Asia. Malay writer Harun Aminurrashid wrote “Panglima Awang,” a 1958 novel about him that contributed to regional identity as Malaysia broke with British rule.The interpreter should “move out of the shadows of Magellan,” said Ahmad Murad Merican, a professor at the International Institute of Islamic Thought and Civilization of the International Islamic University Malaysia.Portrayed in European accounts as subordinate, the interpreter has since been discussed as a “diplomat and a linguist” who sparked interest in “Malay navigation skills, boat building and the expanse of Malay travels across the oceans,” Merican said.Some speculate that the interpreter may have been the first person to travel around the world, in separate stages. That might have been possible if he continued west to his Malay homeland after Magellan died in an April 27, 1521, fight with warriors in what is today the Philippines. Some accounts from the time say the interpreter betrayed Magellan’s expedition after his death, though that narrative has been questioned.In 2018, President Rodrigo Duterte of the Philippines designated April 27 as a national holiday to honor Lapu-Lapu, the chief whose men killed Magellan. Lapu-Lapu is admired for resisting foreign intervention and is the namesake of a widely eaten fish.Magellan is credited with introducing Christianity in the Philippines, now the largest Roman Catholic nation in Asia. Yet he is lampooned in late comedian Yoyoy Villame’s song “Magellan,’‘ whose lyrics imagine his last words: ‘’Mother, mother, I am sick/Call the doctor very quick/Doctor, doctor, shall I die?”“We don’t aim to rewrite our history, far from it,” Celia Anna M. Feria, the Filipina ambassador in Portugal, said a year ago at a Lisbon conference on Magellan and the Philippines. But, she said, “We are taking the elements of our history apart’ and studying them.Feria described “magnanimity and humanity” during Magellan’s time in what is now the Philippines, saying he was received on woven bamboo and palm mats by dignitaries (not including Lapu-Lapu).History is about perspective, said Ambeth Ocampo, a Filipino professor who attended the Lisbon meeting. In a column in the Philippine Daily Inquirer, he said few details were recorded about Lapu-Lapu and so “history recedes into wishful or aspirational images of the hero” on monuments, in films, comics and even an advertisement for disposable baby diapers.Jesús Baigorri Jalón, an academic at the University of Salamanca in Spain who was a United Nations interpreter, said Muslim, Jewish and Christian coexistence in what became Spain showed that cultural mixing was common long before Magellan’s expedition.“The idea of ​​classifying ‘multicultural’ societies as a novelty of our times reflects ignorance or obliviousness of our history, that of the colonial powers and that of those that were colonized,″ Baigorri Jalón said.By showing that anywhere in the world was reachable over water, Magellan and his crew inadvertently demonstrated the connections shaping humanity today, said Laurence Bergreen, author of “ Over the Edge of the World: Magellan’s Terrifying Circumnavigation of the Globe.”“There was this singular event of 9/11 which the whole world reacted to, and you have the sense that the whole world was in some ways connected and vulnerable in some ways as well,” said Bergreen, who worked on the book around the time of al-Qaida’s Sept. 11, 2001, attacks in the United States.“Well, now it’s 20 years later almost, and there’s a pandemic, but it’s sort of the same thing that there are events that occur globally that affect everyone,” he said. “And so there’s a sense of a kind of a shared destiny among people who would otherwise not be aware of other people, or really wouldn’t care much about them.″The Spanish navy vessel on the commemorative trip is a “small city″ with engine power, a satellite system, garbage and wastewater treatment, a medical team, fresh bread every morning, and movies and other leisure activities, deputy commander Fernando García said in a Dec. 13 blog post.Referring to pandemic disruptions, García said that ″while other nations have canceled or postponed similar trips, Spain keeps it going, emulating the great feat completed 500 years ago.”Currently docked in Mexico’s Manzanillo port, the four-mast ship is scheduled to return to Spain in July, ending an 11-month circumnavigation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-pandemic-meets-500th-anniversary-of-1st-global-voyage/story-svm4Mifq2Nifz11WzUvW1I.html
31-12-2020||World||No reason given for Trump cutting short his Florida vacation amid tensions with Iran||President Donald Trump is cutting short his Florida holiday vacation and returning to Washington on Thursday, one day earlier than expected for reasons the White House didn’t explain.The White House announced the abrupt change in the president’s schedule late Wednesday, hours after Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., said he will raise objections when Congress meets on Jan. 6 to affirm President-elect Joe Biden’s victory in the November election.The Republican challenge is a futile attempt intended to keep Trump in power, and a path the president has pursued after his campaign lost scores of legal challenges to the election outcome, including at the Supreme Court, and the Electoral College certified Biden’s 306-232 win.Trump’s early return comes as tensions escalate between the United States and Iran in the final weeks of his administration. There is concern in Washington that Iran could order further military retaliation for the US killing last Jan. 3 of top Iranian military commander Gen. Qassem Soleimani. Iran’s initial response, five days after that deadly US drone strike, was a ballistic missile attack on a military base in Iraq that caused brain concussion injuries to about 100 US troops.Iranian-supported Shiite militia groups launched a rocket attack on the U.S. Embassy compound in Baghdad on Dec. 20. No one was killed, but Trump said days later that Iran was on notice.“Some friendly health advice to Iran: If one American is killed, I will hold Iran responsible. Think it over,” Trump tweeted on Dec. 23. He added, ”We hear chatter of additional attacks against Americans in Iraq.”His stand won the support of a key ally in Congress, Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C.``To the Iranians, if you’re going to try to do something on President Trump’s watch, you better be ready for a big pushback, so be careful what you do with Trump,’’ Graham told “Fox & Friends” on Thursday.Trump, accompanied by his wife, Melania, arrived at his Mar-a-Lago home in Florida after dark on Dec. 23 and spent practically the entire vacation focused on trying to subvert the voters’ will from last month’s election.Iran was an exception as he stayed mum on many other major developments during the holiday break, including a Christmas Day bombing in Nashville, Tennessee, the discovery in California and Colorado of a new and apparently more contagious variant of the coronavirus, and the death Tuesday of Rep.-elect Luke Letlow, R-La., from Covid-19 complications.Trump’s schedule change means he will miss the glitzy New Year’s Eve party held annually at Mar-a-Lago.Neither Trump nor the White House explained why he decided to shorten a vacation that had been expected to end on Friday.Trump, accompanied by his wife, Melania, arrived at his Mar-a-Lago home after dark on Dec. 23 and spent practically the entire vacation focused on the futile attempt to overturn the election as Biden’s Jan. 20 inauguration approached.Despite the plan by Hawley and group of Republicans in the Democratic-controlled House to object on Trump’s behalf during the counting of electoral votes, the challenge will not prevent Biden from being sworn in as president, and Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., a Black woman of South Asian descent, from becoming vice president.During his vacation, Trump also took near daily swipes on Twitter at Georgia Republican Gov. Brian Kemp and other state elections officials over his loss to Biden in that state.Since losing the election and beginning a campaign to overturn the outcome, the usually chatty Trump has avoided engaging with reporters, even those who accompanied him to Florida. He went as far as barring them from his Christmas Day remarks to US troops, which is the type of event the White House typically opens for news coverage.Before he left Washington, Trump stunned Capitol Hill by objecting to spending — much of it sought by his own administration — in a government funding bill that had been paired up with a fresh round of needed coronavirus relief that included $600 payments to most individuals.Trump jeopardized the financial aid and flirted with a government shutdown slated for last Tuesday by implying that he wouldn’t sign the legislation unless lawmakers increased the payments to $2,000, a sum sought by most Democrats and some Republicans.Trump eventually signed the bill Sunday night after several days of uncertainty in exchange for congressional votes on his aid demands. He also wants Congress to lift certain protections for social media companies and investigate his unfounded claims of fraud in the election.Former Attorney General William Barr and other administration officials have said they saw no evidence of fraud on a scale massive enough to have changed the outcome of the election.The House voted this week in favor of increasing the payments, but Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., all but shut the door Wednesday when he declared that Congress had provided enough pandemic aid. McConnell blocked attempts by Democrats to force a vote in that chamber on the higher payments sought by Trump.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/no-reason-given-for-trump-cutting-short-his-florida-vacation-amid-tensions-with-iran/story-ecmVHbpvivSOswew40oCfN.html
31-12-2020||World||Covid-19: Govt pushes for budget relief to help small businesses, middle class||India’s ruling party has urged the government to put more money in the pockets of middle-income families in the next budget and cut the costs of raw material for small and medium-sized businesses, a party spokesman said on Thursday.After the coronavirus impact shrank the economy in the last two quarters, Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government wants to boost spending on projects for roads, ports and pipelines in the next fiscal year to revive businesses and generate jobs.Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) feels that while the poor received free rations and businesses got state-guaranteed loans and other concessions, the economy will benefit from slimming the tax bill for the middle class with more generous standard deductions.“The middle-income group is feeling a lot of pinch, and they need some support,” said Gopal Krishna Agarwal, who handles the BJP’s communication and coordination on economic affairs.“Incentivising consumption by them would also help the industry,” Agarwal told Reuters, days after meeting the finance minister to discuss budget suggestions by party members. “I can say the budget will take care of the middle class.”The government ranks more than 300 million of India’s population of 1.35 billion among middle-class consumers.Finance ministry spokesman Rajesh Malhotra said no ministry official would comment on the budget for the new fiscal year, which begins in April, until the document was unveiled in parliament on Feb. 1.Another proposal is to raise the depreciation allowances on items like cars, plant machinery and consumer durables such as refrigerators so that consumption increases and tax outgoings of businesses fall, Agarwal added.For medium-sized and small businesses, the government could also look to lower the import duties on some raw materials such as copper and base metals.“Raw material costs are rising not because of demand but because of supply constraints for consuming industries, and they are asking for some relief,” Agarwal said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-govt-pushes-for-budget-relief-to-help-small-businesses-middle-class/story-ODZfVjYF8m92JboEroCbZO.html

31-12-2020||World||World begins welcoming locked-down New Year||The world began ushering in the New Year Thursday, with pandemic controls muting celebrations for billions of people eager to bid farewell to a virus-ridden 2020.After a grinding year that has seen at least 1.7 million people die from Covid-19, fresh waves of infection have sparked renewed lockdowns and forced would-be revellers to extend their 2020 tradition of watching events from the sofa.The eagerly awaited first seconds of 2021 fell on the Pacific nations of Kiribati and Samoa from 1000 GMT, with the uninhabited Howland and Baker Islands the last to tip over into the New Year, 26 hours later.New Zealand, which has won plaudits for its handling of the coronavirus, followed an hour later with large crowds gathered in Auckland to watch a fireworks display.Although still isolated by international border closures, months of zero recorded cases in the community has let life in New Zealand return to relative normality.In Australia’s largest city, Sydney, fireworks lit up the glittering harbour with a dazzling display at 1300 GMT, but few spectators watched in person.Plans to allow crowds were scrapped amid a cluster of around 150 new infections that have seen travel to and from Sydney severely restricted.“I think everybody is looking towards 2021 as a fresh beginning and a fresh start,” Karen Roberts, among the lucky few who were allowed past checkpoints around the area, told AFP at a bar nestled under the Sydney Opera House.In Tokyo, which will see in the new year at 1500 GMT, residents face the prospect a state of emergency being imposed after a daily record 1,300 new coronavirus infections were recorded in the last 24 hours.Italy -- where shocking images of makeshift morgues and exhausted medics awoke the world to the severity of the crisis -- is on a nationwide lockdown until January 7 and a 10 pm curfew is in place.From France to Latvia to Brazil, police and -- in some cases -- military personnel are being deployed to make sure night-time curfews or bans on large gatherings are enforced.In hard-hit London, 74-year-old American singer-songwriter Patti Smith will ring in the New Year with a tribute to National Health Service workers who have died from Covid-19, projected on the screen at Piccadilly Circus and streamed on YouTube.Social gatheringThousands are expected to attend a fireworks and a laser show in Dubai at the Burj Khalifa, the world’s tallest tower, despite a slew of new cases.All those attending the event -- whether at a public place, hotel or restaurant -- will be required to wear masks and register with QR codes.In Beirut, a city still reeling from the August 4 port explosion, authorities are also cutting loose. A night curfew has been pushed back to 3 am. Bars, restaurants and night clubs have all reopened and are advertising large parties to mark the turn of the year. On the banks of Lake Baikal in Siberia, where temperatures plummet to as low as -35 degrees celsius (-31 Fahrenheit), around a dozen Russians emerged invigorated after a new year’s eve ice dip.The swimmers, known in Russia as “walruses”, ran several kilometers (miles) through a snowy forest in swimsuits and festive costumes before plunging into the world’s largest freshwater lake.“It’s invigorating. It stings a little!” Andrei Bugai told AFP after climbing out of the water. “It’ll make you feel 10 years younger,” said Ksenia Novoseltseva, another swimmer, with a wide grin on her face.Chancellor Angela Merkel on Thursday used her New Year greeting to warn Germans the “historic” coronavirus crisis will extend into 2021 even if vaccines bring some hope. In Brazil -- which has already recorded more than 193,000 Covid-19 deaths, the second-largest number in the world -- fearful medics await a new wave.In recent days, social media has been filled with videos showing mask-less revellers enjoying a night out and television channels have even shown live images of police closing bars full of customers.“The pandemic peak was between May and July, which was when there wasn’t a lot of movement and we looked after ourselves more. Now there are many cases and people are acting as if there wasn’t a pandemic,” said Luiz Gustavo de Almeida, a microbiologist at the University of Sao Paulo.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/world-begins-welcoming-locked-down-new-year/story-Iak0UHAg5RD407PaPM14BJ.html
31-12-2020||World||UK Covid-19 variant growing rapidly, affecting more people under 20: Study||The new variant of SARS-CoV-2, which is believed to have originated in the United Kingdom, is growing rapidly and affecting a greater proportion of people under 20, according to a study. A collaborative team of researchers from Imperial College London, University of Edinburgh, Public Health England, the Wellcome Sanger Institute, the University of Birmingham, and the Covid-19 Genomics UK Consortium evaluated the relationship between transmission and the frequency of the new variant over a period of time.“There is a consensus among all analyses that the VOC (the Variant of Concern or new variant) has a substantial transmission advantage,” the study said.According to the study, the reproduction number for the new variant is currently between 1.4 and 1.8. It stated that the estimated difference between the reproduction number of the mutation is 0.4 to 0.7 higher as compared to other variants of the virus. The reproduction number reflects the number of people expected to get infected by a single individual in a homogeneous population. UPDATE #COVID19 new variant VOC202012/01 in England➡️VOC growing rapidly➡️Transmission advantage for VOC of 0.4 to 0.7 difference in reproduction number compared to non-VOC variant➡️VOC affecting a greater proportion of under 20s👉Report https://t.co/wZkdw9fCIj pic.twitter.com/YlffZnyPMlAlso Read | California announces first confirmed case of new Covid-19 variantThe study also found that individuals under 20 years make up for a higher proportion of coronavirus disease (Covid-19) cases infected with the new variant. However, the researchers said that it is too early to determine the mechanism behind this change. They suggested that it may be partly because the lockdown was in force in some places but schools were open.“These analyses, which have informed UK government planning in recent weeks, show that the new variant of concern, B.1.1.7, has substantially higher transmissibility than previous SARS-CoV-2 viruses circulating in the UK,” Professor Neil Ferguson of Imperial College London said in a statement.Dr Erik Volz, a co-author of the study, said that very rarely a virus will change in a way that requires us to re-evaluate public health policy. Volz added that there is overwhelming evidence of a change in transmissibility of the new variant that should be taken into account while planning the Covid-19 response in the new year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-covid-19-variant-growing-rapidly-affecting-more-people-under-20-study/story-k7iQ9nNA9g6xIPGLdwegiO.html
31-12-2020||World||Fireworks explode over empty streets in Sydney, Christchurch as 2020 slinks away into history||Blue and gold fireworks soared into the sky above the Sydney Opera House as they do every year, but the harbour below was a ghost town, a fittingly creepy send-off for a year that will not be missed.No light show will illuminate Beijing from the top of the TV tower. The lions of London’s Trafalgar Square will be barricaded off, as will Red Square in Moscow. In Rome, crowds will not assemble in St Peter’s Square, the Pope will lead no Mass, and revelers will not make their yearly dive into the Tiber.The New Year’s Eve ball will drop on Broadway. But in place of hundreds of thousands of New Yorkers packed shoulder-to-shoulder into Times Square, the audience will be a small pre-selected group of nurses, doctors and other key workers, their families kept six feet apart in socially distanced pens.Good riddance, 2020. Hello, 2021.With more than 1.7 million people dead and 82 million infected around the globe since last New Year’s Eve - yet hope that new vaccines can help tame the pandemic - this year’s end is like none other in memory. Angela Merkel, in her 16th New Year’s Eve address as German chancellor, said as much.“I think I am not exaggerating when I say: never in the last 15 years have we found the old year so heavy. And never have we, despite all the worries and some scepticism, looked forward to the new one with so much hope.”“I can only imagine how bitter it must feel for those mourning loved ones lost to corona or who are having to fight against the repercussions of an illness when the virus is disputed and denied by some hopeless individuals,” said Merkel, 66, who said she would get vaccinated as soon as practicable. Germany has banned the sale of fireworks to discourage crowds. Authorities in Berlin said police would “punish violators consistently”.‘Hell of a year’In the Chinese city of Wuhan, where the pandemic originated a year ago, thousands were expected to gather at popular landmarks across the city centre for the countdown to 2021. Some said they were being cautious, but weren’t particularly worried.“Safety is the priority,” said Wuhan resident Wang Xuemei, 23, a teacher.In Australia, where the Sydney Opera House fireworks are televised around the world as the first big visual display of the new year, movement has been restricted, gatherings banned and internal borders shut. Most people were barred from coming to Sydney’s downtown on Thursday night.“What a hell of a year it’s been,” said Gladys Berejiklian, premier of New South Wales state, which includes Sydney. “Hopefully 2021 will be easier on all of us.” In Madrid’s usually teeming Puerta del Sol square, there will be no screaming revellers delightedly stuffing grapes into their mouths - one for every stroke of midnight, according to tradition. Spain’s midnight curfew has been extended to 1:30 am for the night, but most people are expected to stay at home.As police dragged metal barriers across the square, 61-year-old retiree Jose Angel Balsa said he would spend the evening “with family, just the four of us at home, holding lots of video calls and hoping for this to end as soon as possible.”In Britain, where a highly contagious variant of the virus is rampaging and most people are under strict restrictions, official billboards instruct the public to “see in the New Year safely at home”. Barriers were erected in public places such as London’s Trafalgar Square and Parliament Square.Russian authorities stopped people gathering on Red Square. Bars and restaurants were to shut before midnight, but firework displays would go ahead.In Italy, bars, restaurants and most shops were closed, and a curfew imposed for New Year’s Eve at 10 p.m. Pope Francis cancelled plans to lead New Year’s Eve and New Year’s Day services because of a flare-up of his sciatica condition, the Vatican said.In France, where a night curfew will also be in force, no more than six adults are allowed to gather around the dinner table. But there will be celebrations - small, perhaps, but with style.At “A la Ville de Rodez”, an upmarket Parisian delicatessen, manager Brice Tapon was preparing packages of foie gras, truffles and pate for groups of two or three.“I will... stuff myself with foie gras, champagne and all this food,” said Annie Chaplin, a customer. “And I’ll stay home.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/fireworks-explode-over-empty-streets-in-sydney-christchurch-as-2020-slinks-away-into-history/story-SRNMiGn1LR84uIQJfqLOdK.html
31-12-2020||World||Covid-19: No data to back UK’s new vaccination plan, says Pfizer||US pharmaceutical company Pfizer Inc. said that it has no data to establish that single dose of its Covid-19 vaccine would provide protection against the virus after more than 21 days, undercutting the observation of UK’s Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI). The UK government announced a new immunisation strategy after the committee recommended inoculating as many people as possible with the first dose before offering others their second dose.In its advisory published on Wednesday, the JCVI said that in order to maximise benefits from the vaccination programme in the short term, the second dose of AstraZeneca’s vaccine can be offered 4 to 12 weeks after the first dose. It further stated that the second dose of Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine can be offered between 3 to 12 weeks after the first dose. “Pfizer and BioNTech’s Phase 3 study for the Covid-19 vaccine was designed to evaluate the vaccine’s safety and efficacy following a 2-dose schedule, separated by 21 days,” Pfizer said in a statement, adding that there are no data to demonstrate that protection after the first dose is sustained after 21 days.Also Read | UK to follow new immunisation strategy for Oxford-AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine. All you need to knowPfizer’s statement comes after the head of the UK medicine regulator, Dr June Raine, said that the updated guidance for Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine allows for a “potentially longer interval” than previously recommended. The pharmaceutical giant has urged the UK health authorities to remain vigilant while introducing different dosing regimens. Pfizer stressed that it is important to conduct surveillance efforts on any alternative schedules.Meanwhile, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) has approved AstraZeneca’s Covid-19 vaccine, AZD1222. The Phase 3 trials of AZD1222 against SARS-CoV-2 across two different dose regimens showed an average efficacy of 70.4%, with no hospitalisations or severe disease observed in the vaccinated groups from three weeks after the first dose. UK health secretary Matt Hancock said that the approval was “good news for the whole world” due to its cost and storage feasibility.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-pfizer-says-no-data-to-back-uk-s-new-vaccination-plan/story-CuOJ9cto4iztpzMo12BJsL.html

31-12-2020||World||Explainer: What we know about China-made vaccines||China was ahead in the global race to develop coronavirus vaccines with the most candidates in late stage of trials earlier in the year and its first approval of a homemade shot for the general public came on Thursday, yet with no detailed efficacy data.Following is what we know about China’s vaccine development, efficacy data and approval timeline.Which are the most advanced?Five vaccines from Sinovac Biotech, China National Pharmaceutical Group (Sinopharm), CanSinoBIO and the Chinese Academy of Sciences are in late-stage clinical trials. None of them has released detailed efficacy data.Authorities approved a vaccine developed by Sinopharm’s Beijing affiliate on Thursday, a day after the developer said interim analysis of its Phase 3 trial showed 79.34% efficacy, without providing details.The efficacy reading is lower than the 86% rate for the same vaccine announced by the United Arab Emirates on Dec. 9, based on preliminary data.A Sinopharm executive said on Thursday detailed data would be released later without giving a specific timeline.Sinovac’s candidate has also showed varied efficacy readouts. Data from a late-stage trial of its CoronaVac shot in Turkey showed a 91.25% success rate, while researchers in Brazil said its efficacy was between 50% and 90%.Brazil expects to release CoronaVac’s efficacy data by Jan. 7 after three delays.CanSinoBIO plans to submit clinical trial results for its vaccine to authorities in Mexico next week, a top Mexican health official said.How many people have been inoclulated?While China has been slower than several other countries in approving Covid-19 vaccines, it has been inoculating its citizens for months with three different shots undergoing late-stage trials.China launched an emergency use programme in July aimed at essential workers and others at high risk of infection and has administered more than 4.5 million doses of Sinopharm’s two vaccines and Sinovac’s CoronaVac.It has been ramping up the programme over the past month in anticipation of greater transmission risks over the winter.The South China Morning Post newspaper reported that China would vaccinate as many as 50 million people before the Lunar New Year holiday in mid-February.China also approved a vaccine from CanSinoBIO for military use and the vaccine had been given to some 40,000 to 50,000 people, a CanSinoBIO executive said on Nov. 28.What technology is used?Sinopharm’s and Sinovac’s vaccines are based on traditional technology that uses inactivated or dead virus, that cannot replicate in human cells, to trigger an immune response.The overall occurrence rate of adverse reactions of those Covid-19 shots is similar to those of other inactivated vaccines, and the occurrence rate of relatively serious adverse effects such as allergy is about two in a million, National Health Administration official Zeng Yixin said on Thursday.Who is buying China’s vaccines?The United Arab Emirates became the first country to roll out a Chinese vaccine to the public this month.Pakistan announced on Thursday a 1.2 million dose purchase deal with Sinopharm.Sinovac’s CoronaVac shot has been signed up by Brazil, Indonesia, Turkey, Chile and Singapore. The company is also in supply talks with Malaysia and the Philippines.CanSinoBIO has a supply deal with Mexico.President Xi Jinping has pledged to make China’s vaccines a global public good.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/explainer-what-we-know-about-china-made-vaccines/story-A7HMgPIRPMcjt1vuFPhv8O.html
31-12-2020||World||Saudi-led coalition strikes at Yemen capital after attacks on Aden blamed on Houthis||Saudi-led coalition warplanes struck targets in Yemen’s Houthi-held capital Sanaa on Thursday in retaliation for attacks in the southern port city of Aden the previous day that took place as officials in a government backed by Riyadh arrived there.The coalition accused the Houthi movement, which it has been fighting for six years, of staging the attack on Aden’s airport and a second one on the presidential palace.Thursday’s coalition air strikes hit Sanaa airport and several other sites in and around the city, residents said. Loud blasts were heard and warplanes flew overhead for several hours, they said.Houthi-run Masirah television said the planes hit at least 15 locations in different districts in the capital. There were no immediate reports of casualties.Coalition air strikes have killed thousands, including many civilians, over the course of the war.But they have been less frequent in recent years as the conflict has reached a stalemate, with the Iran-aligned Houthis controlling most population centers and President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi’s internationally recognised government - supported by Riyadh and Western powers - basing itself in Aden.The main war has been eclipsed by a power-struggle between Hadi’s government and southern separitists in Aden. Saudi Arabia has been trying to unite them to focus on fighting the Houthis.At least 22 people were killed and dozens more wounded in Wednesday’s attack on Aden airport, which took place just as members of Hadi’s new cabinet arrived from Saudi Arabia. A second attack was made on the Maasheq palace, where they had been taken to safety.A coalition statement said the alliance had downed an explosive-laden Houthi drone that was targeting the palace. “The desperate, terrorist attack to target Maasheq palace confirms the responsibility of the terrorist, Iran-backed Houthi militia of the attack in Aden International Airport,” the statement said. There was no immediate reaction from the Houthis, who had earlier denied responsibility for the airport attack.Aden has been mired in violence because of the rift between the separatists and Hadi’s government, which has been based there after being driven from Sanaa by the Houthis in 2014.The Southern Transitional Council (STC), which seeks independence for south Yemen, declared self-rule in Aden in April, triggering clashes with Hadi’s forces and complicating United Nations efforts to forge a permanent ceasefire in the overall conflict.The new cabinet unites the STC with Hadi in an effort to fulfil the Saudi aim of ending the feud.Government officials were among the casualties in the Aden airport attack. Three International Committee of the Red Cross staff members were also killed, the organisation said.Yemeni Prime Minister Maeen Abdulmalik said all members of the cabinet were “fine” and will remain in Aden despite the attack.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/saudi-led-coalition-strikes-at-yemen-capital-after-attacks-on-aden-blamed-on-houthis/story-cbqFwAiChivUcyJXhjlSuO.html

The crackdown came even as the country’s chief justice, Gulzar Ahmed, on Thursday took suo motu notice of the attack on the place of worship in Teri village in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Karak district. The country’s supreme court will hear the case on January 5.Local police said raids had been carried out overnight, and more raids were underway to arrest those who participated in the vandalism or provoked the mob to demolish the place of worship.Some 1,500 people had reportedly participated in the attack on the temple.The chief justice took the step after minority lawmaker Ramesh Kumar briefed him about the temple being set ablaze, during their meeting in Karachi on Thursday.The Shri Paramhans Ji Maharaj’s Samadhi along with the Krishna Dwara Mandir in Teri village was vandalised on Wednesday by an unruly mob. They claimed the temple had encroached on extra land and set it on fire.Noorul Haq Qadri, Pakistan’s minister for religious affairs, called the episode “a conspiracy against sectarian harmony”. He took to Twitter on Thursday, saying the “protection of the religious freedom of minorities is our religious, constitutional, moral and national responsibility”.Local media quoted advocate Rohit Kumar, a representative of the Hindu community, as saying that the temple hadn’t exceeded the area agreed upon.Meanwhile, dozens of Hindus reportedly rallied in the city of Karachi to demand the rebuilding of the place of worship in Teri village.The temple was first attacked and demolished in 1997. After intervention by the supreme court in 2015, the local community had agreed to its reconstruction. Despite the reconstruction, there was a dispute over the land allocated to the temple. This also led to some misunderstanding between the temple supporters and local clerics.In 1919, Guru Sri Paramhans Dayal was laid to rest at the site and a temple was built there.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/dozens-arrested-for-vandalising-hindu-temple-in-pakistan/story-GzT1iIyceWl0ArQU11SPVK.html

China on Thursday granted conditional approval to the country’s first homegrown COVID-19 vaccine developed by Sinopharm. The approval came a day after Sinopharm said its vaccine showed 79.34 per cent efficacy and a 99.52 per cent antibody-positive conversion rate in the interim results of Phase III clinical trials. The decision to procure the vaccine was made in the meeting of a special cabinet committee on Wednesday after Sinopharm said that its vaccine was 79.34 per cent effective, the Ministry of National Health Services said. The Drug Regulatory Authority of Pakistan (Drap) has not yet approved the emergency use of the drug which once approved would be given free to all frontline health workers in the first quarter of 2021. The committee was informed that Pakistan was in contact with other drug manufacturers for future bookings. The committee said that the private sector would also be encouraged to approach Drap for emergency use of any available and safe COVID-19 vaccine. Meanwhile, another 58 people died in Pakistan due to coronavirus, taking the COVID-19 toll to 10,105, while 2,206 people were in critical conditions. The number of recuperated people reached 435,073 after 4,960 people recovered in the last 24 hours. It was the second consecutive day that over 4,000 patients tested negative. The authorities have carried out 39,659 tests in the last one day, registering a positivity rate of 6.24 per cent.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-to-buy-1-1-million-doses-of-sinopharm-s-covid-19-vaccine/story-YsDtuhWET7xJcnU0a8Rz6H.html

My mother was born in France, her mother was totally French as was her grandfather. So for me it is about reclaiming what I already have. And that makes me very happy,” said the 80-year-old Johnson, who was speaking in French.“I will always be a European, that’s for sure. One cannot tell the British people: you are not Europeans. Having a tie with the European Union is important,” he added.His son Boris was the public face of the Leave campaign in the 2016 referendum and says Britain can “prosper mightily” as a fully sovereign nation outside what he sees as an overly bureaucratic EU.But on Wednesday the Prime Minister sounded a more concilatory note as parliament approved a new trade deal with the EU, saying: “This is not the end of Britain as a European country. We are in many ways the quintessential European civilisation... and we will continue to be that.” The United Kingdom officially leaves the EU’s orbit on Thursday night, after an often strained 48-year liaison with the European project.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/boris-johnson-s-father-is-applying-for-french-citizenship/story-stLB5ZA8E5hlaKppDMcYxM.html

While ministers say the roll out of vaccines will allow the country to start getting back normal by spring 2021, they have also warned the weeks ahead may be the hardest yet.The new faster spreading strain of the virus has driven daily infections to a record level, with more people hospitalized and daily death rates close to the peak of the first wave in the spring. The reopening of schools has been delayed and the government says restrictions could be tightened further.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-tells-public-to-stay-home-for-new-year-s-eve-celebrations/story-2evKiJHMsaGH6cHL6ypKHO.html

The US, Germany, Japan and Australia have all been regulating Chinese investments more strictly, not just Taiwan,” added Su.Moreover, Taiwan has brought new regulations to close loopholes that could be used by Chinese companies to skirt regulations. Articles 3, 4 and 6 of the Measures Governing Investment Permits to the People of the Mainland Area have been changed to expand the definition of Chinese capital, reported Taipei Times.The rule further stated that any company found to break the regulations will face a maximum penalty of New Taiwanese Dollar 25 million and have to divest immediately, informed Su.The ministry also announced an amendment to the Regulations Governing Investment or Technical Cooperation in the Mainland Area, tightening control of Taiwanese technology and intellectual property (IP) going to China, reported Taipei Times.“Selling or licensing Taiwanese technology or IP will now be considered ‘technical cooperation’ and must be approved in advance,” the ministry said in a release.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taiwan-tightens-control-over-chinese-investments-due-to-security-concerns-report/story-u1wEw6ZM9bS2ogc1lxY1jL.html

Prosecutors immediately appealed against the bail decision.Beijing imposed the legislation on the former British colony in June that critics say aims to crush dissent and erode freedoms in the semi-autonomous, Chinese-ruled city - charges that authorities in Hong Kong and China reject. Lai, a critic of Beijing who had been a frequent visitor to Washington, is widely believed to be a target of the new legislation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hong-kong-s-top-court-puts-media-tycoon-jimmy-lai-back-in-custody/story-Sq60ArMJ7aIpyX1MyB4I4H.html
31-12-2020||World||Possible Trump pardon overshadows WikiLeaks founder Assange extradition ruling||A UK judge will rule Monday on whether WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange should be extradited to the US to face criminal charges after weeks of talk about a possible pardon from Donald Trump.The decision from a London judge will come after President Trump, whose administration brought the charges, issued a plethora of pardons to political allies. And lawyers say the odds of clemency from Trump are better than a judge buying Assange’s arguments that his human rights will be trampled on in America.“It’s very rare for the magistrates to refuse extradition requests from the US,” said Anthony Hanratty, a lawyer at BDB Pitmans in London, who specializes in extradition cases. “There’s a quite strong presumption that the U.S. will comply with obligations in relation to human rights and legal process.”Assange, 49, has been in custody or self-imposed exile in London for the better part of a decade. He initially sought refuge in the Ecuadorian embassy in 2012 rather than face questioning in a Swedish sexual assault case, which was later dropped. Last year, when he was expelled from the embassy, he faced US charges related to WikiLeaks disclosures.He’s accused of working with US Army intelligence analyst Chelsea Manning to get classified documents from databases containing about 90,000 Afghanistan war-related activity reports, 400,000 Iraq war-related reports and 250,000 State Department cables.At a pair of extradition hearings earlier this year, delayed by the coronavirus pandemic, Assange’s lawyers focused their arguments on allegations that he couldn’t receive a fair trial in the US.But Assange drew praise from Trump during the 2016 campaign when WikiLeaks released emails that undercut Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign. And it seems that Assange’s supporters have moved on from the extradition battle to focus on a possible pardon.Assange’s fiancée, Stella Moris, has spent the last few months making direct pleas to Trump via Twitter and appearances on Fox News.“I beg you, please bring him home for Christmas,” she tweeted last month.Officials at WikiLeaks declined to comment ahead of Monday’s ruling and instead referred to Moris’s tweets. The US Justice Department declined to comment.The pardon fever has only grown in recent weeks after Trump issued pardons to more than a dozen people. The recipients were mostly political allies, including Paul Manafort, his former campaign manager, and Charles Kushner, the real estate developer and father of the president’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner.Trump would face opposition to a pardon from inside his own administration. Secretary of State Michael Pompeo -- when he was CIA director -- described WikiLeaks as a hostile force that threatens the US.Barring a pardon, the extradition process in London will likely drag on no matter how Judge Vanessa Baraitser rules Monday. Appeals could take 18 to 24 months with possible challenges going to the UK Supreme Court and even the European Court of Human Rights, Hanratty said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/possible-trump-pardon-overshadows-wikileaks-founder-assange-extradition-ruling/story-ktbo5bx4GJChjH9lRSmkUM.html

31-12-2020||World||EU drug watchdog looking at timing of dosage in AstraZeneca-Oxford vaccine review||The European Union (EU) drug watchdog is looking at when people should be given the second dose of AstraZeneca and Oxford University’s Covid-19 vaccine, rather than at the size of the first dose, as part of its review of the shot, a source at the agency said on Wednesday. Britain on Wednesday became the first country in the world to approve the coronavirus vaccine developed by the British duo, with the authorities recommending that a second shot is administered between four and 12 weeks after the first.Two full doses three months apart were found to be 80% efficacious, the UK drug regulator said, higher than the average that the developers themselves had found in their late-stage trials. For the European Medicines Authority (EMA), the crucial point is the level of protection people have once they have received the first shot and then have to wait between four and 12 weeks for the second one, the source said. “This is exactly what we are looking at. You must have sufficient coverage with the first dose given that this is a vaccination campaign in the middle of a pandemic,” the source, who declined to be named due to the sensitivity of the matter, said.Earlier on Wednesday, AstraZeneca said it had submitted full data to pursue conditional marketing authorisation from the EMA, but the regulator said it still needs more information for approval.In a statement, the EMA said it expected more information from ongoing trials in January and it has requested additional scientific data from the company. It did not respond to Reuters’ request for comment on its analysis of timing and dosages. The Oxford/AstraZeneca shot has been plagued with questions about its most effective dosage since data showed some surprising results.Two full doses were given to the majority of participants and were shown to be 62% efficacious - but a smaller group of volunteers received by accident half a dose followed by a full dose, and registered 90% efficacy.The UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) said on Wednesday that the 90% rate had not stood up to analysis.The issue of the first shot at half dosage is also not on the table at EMA, with the regulator only looking at the two full dosage regimen.It makes more sense for the timing of the second shot to affect efficacy rather than the dosage size in this case, the source at EMA said.“The 12-week thing is reassuring from a scientific point of view because there is a logical explanation for these types of vaccines, but that the half dose was more effective than the full dose is something that actually clashes with logic,” the source said.However, the source said the variations in the trial have caused a complexity that makes it more difficult for regulators to assess it.AstraZeneca’s late-stage trial was originally designed for two injections four weeks apart. But in late-stage trial data published in The Lancet medical journal on December 12., the company said most participants had delays in receiving their second shot.The median time between two standard doses in UK volunteers was about 10 weeks, and six weeks in Brazil, it said.“Some people received the dose four weeks later, others 12 weeks later. It was all very variable. And that’s why it’s very difficult to interpret these studies,” the EMA source said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/eu-drug-watchdog-looking-at-timing-of-dosage-in-astrazeneca-oxford-vaccine-review/story-Itoj9p2et7DREQrOsxRitN.html
31-12-2020||World||Harsh winter can bring illness, death to Afghan kids: Report||More than 300,000 children in war-ravaged Afghanistan face freezing winter conditions that can lead to illness and death without proper winter clothing and heating, a humanitarian organization said Thursday.The ongoing military conflict in Afghanistan has destroyed many homes and forced thousands of children to shelter in camps for the homeless. There they are at risk of not only hunger and disease, including Covid-19, but also death from freezing temperatures.Chris Nyamandi, Afghanistan country director for Save the Children, said in a statement Thursday that early snow in northern Afghanistan has impacted children particularly badly.“The most vulnerable children are those whose schools have shut because of the worsening winter conditions,” he said. “Their families don’t have the money to buy winter clothing. Instead children are forced to huddle at home to escape the bitter cold.”Schools are closed until March in the coldest parts of Afghanistan, where the temperature can plummet to as low as minus 27 degrees Celsius (minus 16 degrees Fahrenheit).Save the Children has provided winter kits to more than 100,000 families in 12 of Afghanistan’s 34 provinces. The kits include fuel and a heater, blankets and winter clothes for children including coats, socks, shoes, hats.“The situation is bleak for children forced to live in camps in places like Balkh province. It is already very cold in this northern province with overnight temperatures as low as minus ten. But it will get much colder before March,” Nyamandi said. “For thousands of children the Afghan winter is a time of grim survival.”Violence has been on the upswing in Afghanistan even as Taliban and Afghan government negotiators hold talks in Qatar, trying to hammer out a peace deal that could put an end to decades of war.A report from Save the Children released Thursday cites 12-year-old Rohina, who lives in a camp for people forced to flee their homes in northern Balkh province. She attends Save the Children supported, community-based education classes.“We are poor and are living under open sky,” she said. “Me and my siblings are not able to sleep for the night because of the cold. How can someone learn like this?”At a camp in the northern part of the capital Kabul, there are more than 700 families, the majority of them displaced by violence in their hometowns. They and other families keep warm and cook by burning the garbage that surrounds them.“It is cold at night, cold in morning, we don’t have wood, we don’t have charcoal,” said 10-year-old Mohammad Dad, who lives at the camp. “We don’t have blankets we make fire out of plastic to keep us warm.”Mohammad’s grandmother, 50-year-old Raihan, lives with seven members of her son’s family at the camp. She said the fires they make from discarded plastic does little to keep them warm.“The children are sick, from night till morning they are coughing,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/harsh-winter-can-bring-illness-death-to-afghan-kids-report/story-cmD5xEamxPX4ngizxTgJHK.html
31-12-2020||World||Pentagon keeps $398 billion F-35’s full-rate production on hold||The Pentagon has put a decision on approving full-rate production of Lockheed Martin Corp.’s F-35 on indefinite hold, as officials remain unable to say when the fighter jet will be ready for combat testing that’s been delayed repeatedly since 2017.The most recent of many milestones for a full production decision on the $398 billion program -- “no later than March” of next year -- has been scrapped by Ellen Lord, the Defense Department’s undersecretary for acquisition and sustainment.“Technical challenges and the impact of Covid-19” have delayed preparation of the simulation facility where the sophisticated testing of the costliest US weapons system will be conducted, Jessica Maxwell, Lord’s spokeswoman, said in a statement when asked about a previously undisclosed Dec. 18 memo by Lord. She said a new date would “based on an independent technical review.”That means it will be months into President-elect Joe Biden’s administration before his new team at the Pentagon has all the information it will need to make a decision on the F-35’s full-rate production, the most lucrative phase for Bethesda, Maryland-based Lockheed.The simulated combat testing was to have occurred this month, the latest date of an exercise once scheduled for 2017.Whenever the testing occurs, it will take an additional two to three months to transfer and analyze the data and then draft a final report for delivery to Pentagon leaders and Congress. The report is mandated by law before a decision.A decision to allow full-rate production will be a seal of approval from the Defense Department to American taxpayers and foreign customers that the warplane has been fully tested, deemed effective against the highest-level threats, can meet its maintenance goals and can be produced efficiently.More than 600 of the F-35 program’s potential 3,200 aircraft already have been delivered, and the fighter is in use by the military in nine nations, including the US Air Force and Marine Corps. But it still hasn’t demonstrated its effectiveness against the most challenging Russian and Chinese air defense systems and aircraft. That will be measured in a sophisticated on-ground simulator at Patuxent River Naval Air Station in Maryland.Biden’s TeamBiden and his aides have complained that Acting Defense Secretary Christopher Miller and the Trump loyalists around him have failed to provide his transition team with adequate briefings, criticism that Miller has rebuffed.Maxwell, the spokeswoman for acquisition chief Lord, said it’s possible Biden’s team will be briefed on the F-35 memo during an “acquisition-specific” meeting scheduled to take place next week. Previously “we provided information on the F-35 as part of the initial transition books, and have since provided additional F-35 program information as part of broader Requests for Information on acquisition,” she said.The Defense Department’s F-35 program office is analyzing test preparations and expects to have revised dates for the simulation and for a potential full production decision by Feb. 28, according to Laura Seal, a program spokeswoman.Robert Behler, the Defense Department’s operational testing director, says in his latest annual report, set for release in January, that the roughly one month of combat testing is now expected to occur in mid- to late-2021.Maxwell said in spite of the delayed decision the program “will continue low-rate initial production at the planned rate.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pentagon-keeps-398-billion-f-35-s-full-rate-production-on-hold/story-06gdKLdqC5V5QR8VtxCCBI.html
31-12-2020||World||2020 finally ending, but New Year’s revelries muted by coronavirus||This New Year’s Eve is being celebrated like no other, with pandemic restrictions limiting crowds and many people bidding farewell to a year they’d prefer to forget.Australia will be among the first nations to ring in 2021 because of its proximity to the International Date Line. In past years 1 million people crowded Sydney’s harbor to watch fireworks that center on the Sydney Harbor Bridge.Authorities this year are advising revelers to watch on television. People are only allowed in downtown Sydney if they have a restaurant reservation or are one of five guests of an inner-city apartment resident. People won’t be allowed in the city center without a permit.Some haborside restaurants are charging up to 1,690 Australian dollars ($1,294) for a seat, Sydney’s The Daily Telegraph newspaper reported Wednesday.Sydney is Australia’s most populous city and has its most active community transmission of Covid-19 in recent weeks. Melbourne, Australia’s second-most populous city, has cancelled its fireworks.“For the first time in many, many years we made the big decision, difficult decision to cancel the fireworks,” Melbourne Mayor Sally Capp said.“We did that because we know that it attracts up to 450,000 people into the city for one moment at midnight to enjoy a spectacular display and music. We are not doing that this year,” she added.New Zealand, which is two hours ahead of Sydney, and several of its South Pacific island neighbors have no Covid-19, and New Year celebrations there are the same as ever.In Chinese societies, the Lunar New Year celebration that falls in February in 2021 generally takes precedence over solar New Year, on Jan. 1. While celebrations of the Western holiday have been growing more common in recent decades, this year will be more muted.Beijing will hold a countdown ceremony with just a few invited guests, while other planned events have been cancelled. And nighttime temperatures plunging to -15 Celsius (- 5 Fahrenheit) will likely discourage people from spending the night out with friends.Taiwan will host its usual New Year’s celebration, a fireworks display by its capital city’s iconic tower, Taipei 101, as well as a flag-raising ceremony in front of the Presidential Office Building the next morning. The island has been a success story in the pandemic, registering only 7 deaths and 700 confirmed cases of Covid-19.Hong Kong, with its British colonial history and large expatriate population, has usually seen raucous celebrations along the waterfront and in bar districts. For the second year running, however, New Year’s Eve fireworks have been cancelled, this time over coronavirus rather than public security concerns.Still roiled by its coronavirus outbreak, Hong Kong social distancing regulations restrict gatherings to only two people. Restaurants have to close by 6 p.m. Live performances and dancing are not allowed. But crowds still throng shopping centers.In Japan, some people skipped what’s customarily a chance to return to ancestral homes for the holidays, hoping to lessen health risks for extended families amid the coronavirus pandemic.Rural restaurants saw business drop, while home deliveries of traditional New Year’s “good luck” food called “osechi” boomed.Emperor Naruhito is delivering a video message for the new year, instead of waving from a window with the imperial family as cheering crowds throng the palace.Train services that usually carry people on shrine visits overnight Dec. 31, as well as some countdown ceremonies, have been cancelled.Meiji Shrine in downtown Tokyo, which attracts millions of people every year during New Year holidays and is usually open all night on New Year’s Eve, will close its doors at 4 p.m. on Dec. 31 this year, the shrine announced on its website.In South Korea, Seoul’s city government has cancelled its New Year’s Eve bell-ringing ceremony for the first time since it started the event in 1953, months after the end of the Korean War.Eastern beaches and other spots where people typically gather watch the year’s first sunrise will be closed. The city of Pohang instead plans to broadcast live on YouTube as the sun rises at several of its beaches.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/2020-finally-ending-but-new-year-s-revelries-muted-by-coronavirus/story-4S2XL0pZpMmKsS5C3sMHeO.html
31-12-2020||World||Heavy snow expected in Texas; storm could spawn tornadoes||A winter storm moving across southwestern Texas on Wednesday could dump more than a foot (0.30 meters) of snow before moving eastward and possibly spawning tornadoes in parts of Texas, Louisiana and Mississippi on New Year’s Eve, according to weather forecasters.Jeremy Grams, a forecaster with the National Weather Services Storm Prediction Center in Norman, Oklahoma, said 12 to 18 inches (0.30 meters to 0.46 meters) of snow was possible west of the Pecos River in southwest Texas, with another 3 to 5 inches (0.13 meters) predicted for western Oklahoma by Thursday.Tornadoes are possible as the cold air moving eastward with the storm collides with moisture and warmer temperatures from the Gulf of Mexico, Grams said.“On the warm side of the system we have the chance for tornadoes from southeast Texas across most of Louisiana and at least into southern Mississippi,” Grams said.Grams said a wintry mix of precipitation and a threat of tornadoes is uncommon — but not unheard of — this time of year.The storm produced what Grams said was a likely a brief tornado in Corsicana, Texas, about 50 miles (80 kilometers) south of Dallas shortly before noon Wednesday.More than a dozen mobile homes were damaged in Corsicana, Navarro County officials said in a social media statement, but no injuries were reported. Two other homes were damaged by fallen trees.The Navarro County Office of Emergency Management did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Grams said any tornadoes would likely be classified as EF2, with wind speeds of 111-135 mph (179-217 kph), or below, compared to violent tornadoes which he said are those rated EF4 and above with wind speeds of 166 mph (267. kph) and higher. In Oklahoma, the state Department of Transportation reported wet and slushy roads on Interstate 40 in the central part of the state on Wednesday, and extending along I-44 to Tulsa. The state said salt and sand was being applied to make roadways less slick. The city of Odessa, Texas, in the Permian Basic oil patch opened a winter weather shelter that would be available through Friday. Federal guidelines for social distancing to stop the spread of Covid-19 will be enforced at the shelter, the city said.Texas Gov. Greg Abbott on Tuesday placed several state agencies on standby ahead of the storm. Meanwhile, another storm system dropped heavy snow across the Upper Midwest and led to winter storm warnings for parts of Nebraska, Iowa, Kansas, Missouri, South Dakota, Wisconsin and Illinois.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/heavy-snow-expected-in-texas-storm-could-spawn-tornadoes/story-oIO1BNRMAaEnZwPMLrZrOI.html
31-12-2020||World||Kamala Harris vows to ensure Covid-19 vaccine is distributed ‘equitably and free of charge’||US Vice President-elect Kamala Harris said on Thursday that once she and President-elect Joe Biden take office, they will ensure Covid-19 vaccines are distributed “equitably and free of charge”. Harris tweeted this announcement in support of Joe Biden’s criticism of the Trump administration’s pace of vaccine rollout. Warning that if vaccinations continue at the current pace “it’s going to take years, not months,” to vaccinate the entire nation, Biden has promised to administer 100 million shots of the Pfizer/BioNtech vaccine during his first 100 days in the Oval Office. “As Joe Biden said yesterday, once in office we will ensure that the Covid-19 vaccines are distributed equitably and free of charge—so it doesn’t matter the color of your skin or where you live. If you want a vaccine, you’ll be able to get one.” tweeted HarrisBiden announced on Wednesday that he will invoke the Defence Production Act to speed up vaccine production in the US. The Defence Production Act is a cold war era law that gives the President sweeping powers to control the country’s domestic industry. “I am going to move heaven and earth to get us going in the right direction. I am going to use my power under the Defence Production Act, when I am sworn in, and order private industry to accelerate the making of the materials needed for the vaccines as well as protective gear.” Biden said.Biden also stated that he and the Vice President-elect have been discussing a bi-partisan vaccine delivery plan for the country, with special emphasis on rural communities. “Vice President Harris and I have been speaking to county officials, mayors, governors of both parties to speed up the distribution of the vaccine across the nation. We’re planning a whole of government effort. And we’re going to work to set up vaccination sites, and send mobile units to hard to reach communities.” he added. Both Kamala Harris and Joe Biden have been administered the Pfizer/ BioNTech vaccine in the public eye to demonstrate its safety and efficacy. Harris told reporters that she got vaccinated to “dispel fears and mistrust in the minority community” about vaccines. The President-elect too has on many occasions stressed on the need for mass vaccination programs driven by communities. On Thursday, he acknowledged that the treatment meted out to minority communities by the government and scientific community has resulted in vaccine hesitancy, promising to launch a mass education campaign to help allay their fears. “We also know there’s a vaccination hesitancy in many communities, especially Black, Lation, and Native American communities, who have not always been treated with dignity and honesty they deserve, by the federal government and the scientific community throughout our history. That’s why we will launch a massive public education campaign to increase vaccine acceptance, we will do everything to show that vaccines are safe and critically important for one’s own health, and that of their families and communities.” Biden saidBiden ended his speech with the assurance that vaccines will be distributed all over the country on an equitable basis, where everyone will be vaccinated free of cost. “That means we are also gonna make sure vaccines are distributed equitably, so every person who wants a vaccine can get it no matter the colour of their skin or where they live. And we’re going to ensure that vaccinations are free of charge.” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/kamala-harris-vows-to-ensure-covid-19-vaccine-is-distributed-equitably-and-free-of-charge/story-01X4oU6ltd18aqPhz9MdpL.html

According to witnesses, the mob was led by a local cleric and supporters of Pakistan’s radical Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam party,Pakistan’s minister for religious affairs, Noorul Haq Qadri, called the attack on the temple “a conspiracy against sectarian harmony.” He took to Twitter Thursday, saying attacks on places of worship of minority religious groups are not allowed in Islam and “protection of religious freedom of minorities is our religious, constitutional, moral and national responsibility.”The incident comes weeks after the government allowed Hindu residents to build a new temple in Islamabad on the recommendation of a council of clerics.Although Muslims and Hindus generally live peacefully together in Pakistan, there have been other attacks on Hindu temples in recent years. Most of Pakistan’s minority Hindus migrated to India in 1947 when India was divided by Britain’s government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/mob-attacks-sets-ablaze-hindu-temple-in-northwestern-pakistan/story-mH46FTC6eOaDlatTSbOjxI.html
31-12-2020||World||China approves first homegrown vaccine said to be 79.3% effective||Chinese health regulators said Thursday that they have given conditional approval to a coronavirus vaccine developed by state-owned Sinopharm.The two-dose vaccine is the first approved for general use in China. The go-ahead comes as the country has begun to vaccinate 50 million people before the Lunar New Year holiday in February.Conditional approval means that research is still ongoing, the company will be required to submit follow-up data as well as reports of any adverse effects after the vaccine is sold on the market, Chen Shifei, the deputy commissioner of the National Medical Products Administration, told a news conference.The company “must continuously update the vaccine’s instructions, labels and report to the agency,” Shifei said.The vaccine was developed by the Beijing Institute of Biological Products, a subsidiary of state-owned conglomerate Sinopharm. The company announced Wednesday that preliminary data from last-stage trials had shown it to be 79.3% effective.It is an inactive vaccine, which means the virus was grown in a lab and then killed. The germ is then injected into the body to generate an immune response.Final proof of its effectiveness will depend on publication of more data.Sinopharm is one of at least five Chinese developers that are in a global race to create vaccines for the disease that has killed more than 1.8 million people.In addition to the emergency vaccinations already underway, China plans to start vaccinating high-risk population, such as seniors as well as people with existing chronic illnesses. Officials did not say what percentage of the population they will vaccinate in China.“This is different in every country but the general thinking is that it has to reach 60% to protect the entire population,” said Zeng Yixin, vice minister of the National Health Commission.Practically, it means that the drug or product in question may be restricted for certain age groups, according to Tao Lina, a former government immunologist.Officials declined to name a particular price and gave conflicting statements about it. “It will certainly be in the limit of what people can afford,” said Zheng Zhongwei, a National Health Commission official.A minute later, Zeng, the other NHC official, stepped in to say that the vaccines “will definitely be free for the public.”The vaccine is already under mass production, though officials did not answer questions about current production capacity.Approval of China’s vaccine could also mean hope for countries around the world who may not have access to the Pfizer or Moderna shots, which have stricter cold chain requirements. Sinopharm’s vaccine is able to be stored at 2 to 8 degrees Celsius (36 to 46 degrees Fahrenheit), or a normal refrigeration temperature.“This is very exciting that there is another vaccine and one that can be distributed in locations that don’t have the cold chain,” said Ashley St. John, an immunologist at the Duke-NUS Medical School in Singapore. “But at the same time we have to temper the excitement. We have to understand the long term efficacy, effect on transmission and effect on severe disease.”___Wu reported from Taipei, Taiwan.___The name of China’s drug regulator has been corrected to the National Medical Products Administration, not the Medical Production Administration.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-approves-first-homegrown-vaccine-said-to-be-79-3-effective/story-mzD7zGe0IwdXkSLYL9AXHJ.html
31-12-2020||World||Trump extends visa sanctions on nations refusing to repatriate their citizens||US President Donald Trump has indefinitely extended the visa sanctions on countries refusing to repatriate their citizens who violated laws in the United States. The visa sanctions on such countries were set to expire on December 31. Trump issued a memorandum on April 10 which empowered the Secretary of State and the homeland security secretary to deny visas to countries refusing to accept their citizens who violated American laws. “In light of the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic and the continuing public health risk it poses to Americans,” Trump said in a memorandum issued on Wednesday that his April 10 “memorandum shall continue in force until terminated by the president”. According to the April 10 memorandum, the secretary of state is authorised to “initiate a plan to impose the visa sanctions” if the Homeland Security Department determines a country not accepting returnees is delaying or impeding operations “necessary to respond to the ongoing pandemic”. The April 10 memorandum noted that countries “denying or unreasonably delaying” the repatriation of their citizens would be deemed to be causing “unacceptable public health risks for Americans”. “Countries that deny or unreasonably delay the acceptance of their citizens, subjects, nationals, or residents from the United States during the ongoing pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 create unacceptable public health risks for Americans,” Trump had said in his memorandum.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-extends-visa-sanctions-on-nations-refusing-to-repatriate-their-citizens/story-CkNFIjVr3hwXXsMi10nlIM.html
31-12-2020||World||Pandemic made my last year in office the hardest, says Angela Merkel||Angela Merkel said in her last New Year’s address to the nation as German chancellor that 2020 was by far the most difficult of her 15-year leadership, yet the start of vaccinations against Covid-19 made 2021 a year of hope.In a rare show of emotion, Merkel, who steered Germany and the European Union (EU) through the 2008 financial crisis, the Greek debt crisis a year later and the migrant crisis five years ago, condemned a protest movement opposed to lockdowns and said she would get vaccinated when the shot is widely available.“Let me tell you something personal in conclusion: in nine months a parliamentary election will take place and I won’t be running again,” said Merkel, 66. “Today is therefore in all likelihood the last time I am able to deliver a New Year’s address to you.”She added: “I think I am not exaggerating when I say: never in the last 15 years have we found the old year so heavy and never have we, despite all the worries and some scepticism, looked forward to the new one with so much hope.”Her message will resonate with most people in a country struggling with a rise in coronavirus infections and deaths and where a majority support lockdown measures and vaccination as the best weapons against the virus.Praise for Merkel, a trained physicist whose management of the pandemic has been guided by scientific advice, for having tamed the first wave has however turned to criticism of her perceived failure to tackle the second.Europe’s biggest economy holds an election in September and Merkel, whose conservatives are expected to win most seats in parliament, will most likely hand over the baton to one of three men vying to lead her Christian Democratic Union (CDU) party.“I can only imagine how bitter it must feel for those mourning loved ones lost to corona or who are having to fight against the repercussions of an illness when the virus is disputed and denied by some hopeless individuals,” said Merkel.“Conspiracy theories are not only false and dangerous, they are also cynical and cruel,” she added. “I will also get vaccinated when my turn comes.”Merkel’s fourth and last term was marked by discontent within conservatives after losses in regional elections which many blamed on her decision to welcome more than one million asylum seekers in 2015.The setbacks at regional polls in 2018, in which conservatives lost voters to both the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) and the ecologist Greens, prompted her not to seek a fifth term.Should coalition building after September election drag on beyond December, Merkel will remain as caretaker chancellor in 2022 until a new government is in place.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pandemic-made-my-last-year-in-office-the-hardest-says-angela-merkel/story-iMnAuPyrT0nT5M9iSlMOvK.html

The Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS) said on Wednesday that it was tightening measures to ensure the safety and well-being of the crew and to safeguard public health in Singapore.Flight crew, who layover in “high-risk destinations”, will be required to undergo polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests on three occasions - upon arrival in Singapore, and on the third and seventh day following their return, reported the Channel News Asia, citing a CAAS statement.The move follows the recent Covid-19 cases involving a Singapore Airlines (SIA) steward and a pilot. The crew will also be required to self-isolate until they receive a negative result from their seventh-day PCR test, said CAAS.The crew travelling to and from South Africa will also wear full personal protective equipment (PPE), including N95 masks, face shields, protective gowns and gloves. These requirements have already been in place for crew travelling to and from the United Kingdom since December 24. South Africa and the UK have recently reported cases of the new variants of the coronavirus that are potentially more contagious. Singapore has reported 58,411 Covid-19 cases so far with 29 deaths.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/singapore-further-tightens-covid-19-measures-on-air-crew/story-8Zd5Xwtgy8XRPrLte274oM.html

McCain and USS Curtis Wilbur “conducted a routine Taiwan Strait transit” in accordance with international law.Their movement “demonstrates the US commitment to a free and open Indo-Pacific,” the Navy said in a statement on its website.China’s Defense Ministry called the move a “show of force” and a provocation that “sent the wrong signal to the ‘Taiwan independence forces’ and seriously endangered peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait area.”“We firmly oppose this,” the ministry said in a statement on its official microblog, adding that it monitored the ships’ passage from the air and sea. “The Chinese People’s Liberation Army at all times maintains a high level of alert and can respond at any time to any threat or provocation and resolutely defend national sovereignty and territorial integrity.”While China claims Taiwan as its own territory, the busy Taiwan Strait is generally considered an international waterway. China fiercely opposes any signal of US military support for Taiwan, a self-governing republic that relies on Washington for defensive weapons and political backing in the face of Chinese threats to annex the island by force.Taiwan’s Defense Ministry issued a statement saying it had observed the passage of the ships passage and that “the situation is normal.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-accuses-us-of-show-of-force-with-taiwan-strait-passage/story-GfXw8o4lFZ0c6JoCb15m4J.html

31-12-2020||World||US warships transit Taiwan Strait, China denounces ‘provocation’||Two US warships sailed through the sensitive Taiwan Strait on Thursday drawing protest from Beijing, the second such mission this month and coming almost two weeks after a Chinese aircraft carrier group used the same waterway.China, which claims democratically run Taiwan as its own territory, has been angered by stepped-up US support for the island, including arms sales and sailing warships through the Taiwan Strait, further souring Beijing-Washington relations.The US Navy said the guided missile destroyers USS John S. McCain and USS Curtis Wilbur had “conducted a routine Taiwan Strait transit December 31 in accordance with international law”.“The ships’ transit through the Taiwan Strait demonstrates the US commitment to a free and open Indo-Pacific. The United States military will continue to fly, sail and operate wherever international law allows.”This is the 13th sailing through the strait by the US Navy this year.China’s Defence Ministry denounced the trip as “provocation” and “a show of force”, adding Chinese ships and aircraft trailed the US ships.The passage of the ships sent the wrong message to supporters of Taiwan independence and are a serious threat to peace and stability, it added.“The Chinese People’s Liberation Army maintains a high level of alert at all times, responds to all threats and provocations at all times, and resolutely defends national sovereignty and territorial integrity,” the ministry said.Taiwan’s Defence Ministry said the ships had sailed in a northerly direction through the strait on what it termed an “ordinary mission”. Taiwan’s armed forces monitored the sailing and the situation is “as normal”, it added.China’s military said it had tailed the last US warship to pass through the Taiwan Strait on December 19, and denounced the mission.The day after that trip, Taiwan’s navy and air force deployed as a Chinese aircraft carrier group led by the country’s newest carrier, the Shandong, sailed through the Taiwan Strait.China said the group was on its way to routine drills in the disputed South China Sea.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-warships-transit-taiwan-strait-china-denounces-provocation/story-E53hEGEPNWL7fL7ubHWo5N.html
31-12-2020||World||India will try to bridge fissures, says T S Tirumurti, India’s UN ambassador||India will begin on Friday its eighth stint as a non-permanent member of the UN Security Council in the New Year, hoping to bring together the world’s most exclusive club of nations split by differences that have been worsened by the Covid-19 pandemic that has killed more than 1.8 million people.“India will work in an inclusive manner and try and bridge the fissures in the council between the member states, exacerbated by Covid,” T S Tirumurti, the Indian permanent representative to the UN, said in a wide-ranging interview ahead of the start of a two-year term, technically on January 1 but effectively on January 4, the first working day of the new year. “We look forward to working closely with all members of the council,” Tirumurti added in response to a question about how he will deal with China, one of the five permanent members of the council. China has been unabashedly adversarial, so much so that it had even tried to prevent the council from condemning the Pulwama terror attack.India was last on the council in a two-year term ending 2012. That was the seventh. Its previous terms were 1950-1951, 1967-1968, 1972-1973, 1977-1978, 1984-1985 and 1991-1992.Question: What are India’s objectives going into its eighth stint as a non-permanent member of the UNSC?Tirumurti: You are right, we are no strangers to the Security Council. This will be the eighth time that we will take our seat in the Security Council as an elected member. Every time India has been in the Security Council, we have contributed in a significant way to enhance peace and security – right from the first stint in the Council in 1950-51 when we played an important constructive role in the Korean War. In the council, we have stood for decolonisation (of) Africa and the Middle East, against apartheid, for developing countries, for democracy and rule of law, for multilateralism and for peace, security, human rights and development. We hope to reinforce these and work to combat terrorism, bring in reform, focus on maritime security and peace keeping, nudge the council towards peace building with greater participation of women and youth, and use technology for broader human welfare. But as importantly, India will work in an inclusive manner and try and bridge the fissures in the Council between the member states, exacerbated by Covid. Question: What are the prospects of achieving tangible progress in the reform of the UNSC, such as a movement towards adopting a text for negotiations? (Despite years of discussion, there is no document or a set of points to negotiate, accept or reject)Tirumurti: Well, the United Nations, which is the foremost multilateral body in the world today, is still stuck in 1945. The world has changed considerably since then and become truly multipolar. But the UN refuses to give space to a multipolar world thereby rendering multilateralism ineffective. The sad reality is that a handful of status-quoists have consistently opposed any reform and use the smoke-screen of what is called the Intergovernmental Negotiation (IGN) process to stop any move towards a consensus for reform. Unfortunately, this so-called process has dragged on for more than a decade without even commencing text-based negotiations. The naysayers are opposed to even the General Assembly rules of procedure to be applied to the IGN process. In the absence of General Assembly rules of procedure, no records are kept, there is no interpretation and no attribution to positions taken by member states. In other words, we have a process which is all talk and no action. We are determined to work with other like-minded countries to break this logjam. Question: Do you expect to use the stint to bolster India’s case for a permanent seat?Tirumurti: The process for the Security Council reforms happens initially in the General Assembly. However, our credentials have been established and acknowledged by almost all countries. But our tenure in the Security Council will give us an additional opportunity to demonstrate to the global community how important it is for the Security Council to be more representative and reflective of contemporary realities. Question: How will India use the term to address the most urgent crisis facing the world at the time, the Covid-19 pandemic?Tirumurti: At the outset, we need to remember that the mandate of the Security Council is primarily dealing with peace and security issues. The pandemic, while it is certainly a global crisis, is per se an issue that falls primarily in the realm of global health. Multilateral agencies such as World Health Organization are in the front line for pandemic response. In this context, what this crisis has demonstrated is that the global institutions are not equipped to handle a truly global crisis. In fact, plurilateral organisations such as the G20 have been more nimble and adept at addressing these Covid challenges. However, the Security Council will have to factor in the pandemic response while looking at global hot spots. For example, it broadly endorsed a call by the UN Secretary General for a global ceasefire, while making an exception for fighting terrorism. Question: Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has called for increased multilateralism in a post-Covid-19 world. How will that play out in real terms at this multilateral forum?Tirumurti: PM Modi has actually called for reformed multilateralism. But yes, what the crisis has showed us is that genuine inclusive multilateralism is the way forward in a multipolar world. Today, there is talk of multilateralism in crisis. However, it is in crisis because countries do not see multilateralism delivering the results they desire. So, the Prime Minister’s call for reformed multilateralism is for reflecting this multipolarity in multilateral institutions and processes. My feeling is that reform in multilateralism is inevitable and the question is when and not if. Question: With a seat at the Security Council, will India be able to deal better with China’s obstructionist actions, such as its opposition to the designation of Masood Azhar, the founder of Jaish-e-Mohammad?Tirumurti: As far as terrorism is concerned, India’s position is crystal clear – we oppose terrorism and we have zero-tolerance for terrorism, no matter what its justification is. Many Pakistani terrorists and entities are already in the 1267 Sanctions list. In fact, Pakistan has the highest number of terrorists inscribed in this list in keeping with its reputation as the epicenter of terrorism. On China, let me just say that India has a positive and constructive agenda in the Security Council and we look forward to working closely with all members of the Council.Question: Indians will expect the non-permanent membership to be used to bring more attention on China’s growing aggression, which has raised concerns around the world. Do you think that will be a fair ask?Tirumurti: What we do in the Security Council is to deliberate on issues of common security concern for the world and not necessarily focus on bilateral issues. The history of our successive tenures in the Security Council is testament to the fact that we do not shy away from standing up for our sovereignty, for securing common security interests, for our principles and for international peace and security, no matter who the aggressor is. Question: How will India use the eighth term to advance the goal of combating terrorism in the neighbourhood and around the world?Tirumurti: We are one of the biggest victims of terrorism, especially cross-border terrorism. Decades of combating terrorism exported from our neighbour has resulted in steeling our determination against this menace. We will not accept any dilution of our fight against terrorism. We will not accept any justifications being given for terror, which some countries are doing their best to justify, even giving it a religious colour. Unfortunately, some like the UN Alliance of Civilisations are providing fodder for such justification. We are ready to stand with any country, inside the Security Council or outside, who are willing to advance our common objective to counterterrorism. We don’t want to go back to pre-9/11 days where the world was split into “your terrorist” and “my terrorist”. The world needs to guard against such attempts to skew the narrative. Question: India has been a world leader on climate change. The Prime Minister launched the Coalition for Disaster Resilient Infrastructure at the UN in 2019. What more can be expected on this front in the next two years?Tirumurti: You are right. India is one of the few major economies to have walked the talk on climate change. According to the International Climate Action Tracker, India is the only country among the top five whose actions are on track to keep global warming below 2-degree Celsius target. We have already reduced our emission intensity by 21% over 2005 levels. Solar power has grown to 36GW. Our renewable energy capacity is already fourth largest in the world and will reach 175 GW by 2022. You mentioned the Coalition for Disaster Resilient Infrastructure. Besides that, the Prime Minister, along with the French President (Emmanuel Macron), also launched the International Solar Alliance which has been opened up for universal membership. India has already committed US$ 1.7 billion in soft loans for solar energy. You asked what more can be expected in the next two years. In fact, this is a question that we often ask to other countries who have made time-bound commitments but are nowhere near to fulfilling those. As the Prime Minister said recently, we should first review our achievements against targets already set. Only then will our voices be credible. We have called on the developed countries to not keep shifting the goal post of climate targets but demonstrate action, including those related to climate financing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/india-will-try-to-bridge-fissures-says-t-s-tirumurti-india-s-un-ambassador/story-CyKMmJ2sbHqJKEpA4RZ79J.html
31-12-2020||World||WHO, marking year since Covid-19 began, urges fair vaccine distribution to all||The head of the World Health Organization (WHO), marking a year since the first cases of the novel coronavirus were reported by China, urged countries on Wednesday to ensure that vaccines are made available to people at risk everywhere, not just in rich nations. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO director-general, appealed for $4 billion to buy Covid-19 vaccines for distribution in lower and middle-income countries through the COVAX vaccine facility.“This is the challenge we must rise to in the New Year,” Tedros said in a video message issued a day before the first anniversary of China reporting the first cases of pneumonia of unknown origin to the UN health agency.“Vaccines offer great hope to turn the tide of the pandemic. But to protect the world, we must ensure that all people at risk everywhere - not just in countries who can afford vaccines - are immunised,” he said.He also urged countries to combat conspiracy theories and attacks on science, saying “The choice is easy,” and the world can “walk the last miles of this crisis together, helping each other along the way, from sharing vaccines fairly, to offering accurate advice, compassion and care” to all who need them.The COVAX alliance, which aims to secure fair access to Covid-19 vaccines for poor countries, said on Dec. 18 it had agreements in place for nearly 2 billion doses, roughly doubling its supply, with the first deliveries due in early 2021.A WHO-led international mission of experts is due to visit China in the first week of January to investigate the origin of the SARS-CoV-2 virus that emerged in the central city of Wuhan in December 2019.More than 81.84 million people have been reported to be infected by the novel coronavirus globally and 1,788,443​ have died, according to a Reuters tally.“The likely scenario is the virus will become another endemic virus, a virus that will remain somewhat of a threat but a very low-level threat in the context of an effective global vaccination programme,” Mike Ryan, WHO’s top emergency expert, told a press conference on Monday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/who-marking-year-since-covid-19-began-urges-fair-vaccine-distribution-to-all/story-SG0aUxG5MkxFp4qNtCA9iN.html

The current production rate will allow the vaccine to be rolled out across Russia’s regions and be exported to other countries at the same time, Manturov said.Russia sent 300,000 doses of the vaccine to Argentina last week, causing frustration at home, with some people arguing that more shots should be made available at home.. Authorities on Wednesday reported 26,513 new daily coronavirus cases, including 5,105 in Moscow, pushing the national tally to 3,131,550 - the fourth highest in the world.Russia also said that 599 people had died in the last 24 hours, taking the official death toll to 56,426, though excess mortality data suggests the actual figure is around triple that.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russia-to-distribute-over-1-mn-sputnik-v-shots-at-home-by-year-end-says-minister/story-2WlLgl6CJrfUS1wvpP33jI.html

Once outside, Pringle slammed Walker to the ground face first, prosecutors said.Pringle has been charged with a misdemeanor assault charge. Pringle’s attorney, Chaz Ball, declined to comment to the newspaper.Walker was charged with multiple crimes, including resisting arrest and assault. Those charges were dropped in November.

31-12-2020||World||Nawaz Sharif’s passport will be cancelled on Feb 16, says Pak minister||The Pakistan government on Wednesday said it will cancel the passport of former prime minister Nawaz Sharif on February 16. Sharif, 70, the Pakistan Muslim League Nawaz (PML-N) supremo, has been living in London since November last year after the Lahore High Court granted him permission to go abroad for four weeks for treatment. The three-time former prime minister, who was convicted in two corruption cases -- Avenfield properties and Al-Azizia -- was declared a proclaimed offender earlier this month by the Islamabad High Court after he failed to appear before it despite several warnings. “(We) will cancel Nawaz Sharif’s passport on February 16,” Interior Minister Sheikh Rashid Ahmed told reporters here in response to a query. He, however, did not provide any further details. Meanwhile, Adviser to the Prime Minister on Accountability and Interior, Mirza Shahzad Akbar, said Pakistan had asked the British authorities to deport Sharif who was convicted by the courts. Pakistan currently has no extradition treaty with Britain. Prime Minister Imran Khan in October had said he would contact his British counterpart Boris Johnson, if needed, to discuss Sharif’s deportation. Sharif resigned as Pakistan prime minister in 2017 after the Supreme Court disqualified him from holding public office and ruled that graft cases be filed against the beleaguered leader and his children over the Panama Papers scandal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nawaz-sharif-s-passport-will-be-cancelled-on-feb-16-says-pak-minister/story-GDGgsmeasUU0RobSn9lZVI.html
31-12-2020||World||Census Bureau to miss deadline, jeopardizing Trump plan||The Census Bureau will miss a year-end deadline for handing in numbers used for divvying up congressional seats, a delay that could undermine President Donald Trump’s efforts to exclude people in the country illegally from the count if the figures aren’t submitted before President-elect Joe Biden takes office.The Census Bureau plans to deliver a population count of each state in early 2021, as close to the missed deadline as possible, the statistical agency said in a statement late Wednesday.“As issues that could affect the accuracy of the data are detected, they are corrected,” the statement said. “The schedule for reporting this data is not static. Projected dates are fluid.”It will be the first time that the Dec. 31 target date is missed since the deadline was implemented more than four decades ago by Congress.Internal documents obtained earlier this month by the House Committee on Oversight and Reform show that Census Bureau officials don’t expect the apportionment numbers to be ready until days after Biden is inaugurated on Jan. 20.Once in office, Biden could rescind Trump’s presidential memorandum directing the Census Bureau to exclude people in the country illegally from numbers used for divvying up congressional seats among the states. An influential GOP adviser had advocated excluding them from the apportionment process in order to favor Republicans and non-Hispanic whites.“The delay suggests that the census bureau needs more time to ensure the accuracy of census numbers for all states,” said Terri Ann Lowenthal, a former congressional staffer who specializes in census issues.By law the Commerce Department must present the president by year’s end with population figures from the 2020 census, data then used to determine how many seats in Congress each state gets. The president then is required to submit the numbers to Congress in early January. The Commerce Department oversees the Census Bureau, which conducts the once-a-decade head count of every US resident.However, there are no penalties for missing the deadline.“For the Census Bureau, goals No. 1 , 2 and 3 are completeness, accuracy and usefulness. They like to maintain the schedule, but that can’t be a priority for them,” said Kenneth Prewitt, a former Census Bureau director during President Bill Clinton’s administration.Besides deciding how many House seats each state gets, the census is used for determining how $1.5 trillion in federal funding is distributed each year.Trump’s July order on apportionment was challenged in more than a half dozen lawsuits around the US, but the Supreme Court ruled earlier this month that any challenge was premature, allowing the plan to move forward. The Census Bureau hasn’t publicly revealed how it plans to determine who is in the country illegally since the Supreme Court last year prohibited a citizenship question from being added to the census questionnaire.After the pandemic caused hiring shortages and prompted the Census Bureau to suspend field operations in the spring, the statistical agency asked Congress for extensions. The requests included one that would push the deadline for handing in the apportionment numbers from the end of the year to next spring.At the time, Trump said, “This is called an act of God. This is called a situation that has to be. They have to give it.”The request passed the Democratic-controlled House but went nowhere in the Republican-controlled Senate after Trump issued his order.A coalition of municipalities and advocacy groups sued the Trump administration after it changed the schedule once again to shorten census field operations by a month and return to the Dec. 31 deadline for handing in the apportionment numbers. The plaintiffs argued the count was shortened by the Commerce Department so that census data-crunching happened while Trump was still in office, and they said it would cause minorities to be undercounted.They also worried that the shortened field operations and data processing would jeopardize the count’s accuracy and completeness. Bureau statisticians have been given only half the time originally planned to crunch the numbers, and Census Bureau director Steven Dillingham said last month that agency statisticians had found anomalies in the 2020 data that have popped up in past censuses.The Census Bureau’s watchdog agency on Wednesday said it was concerned about lapses in quality control checks meant to detect falsifications by census takers. The Office of Inspector General said the Census Bureau failed to complete 355,000 re-interviews of households to verify their information was accurate.Even top Census Bureau officials internally questioned being able to meet the Dec. 31 deadline, with associate director Tim Olson telling colleagues in an email that anyone who thought the census numbers could be crunched by year’s end “has either a mental deficiency or a political motivation.” The email was disclosed in the litigation.Former Census Bureau director John Thompson said the quality of the data is “the overarching issue” facing the Census Bureau.“If these are not addressed, then it is very possible that stakeholders including the Congress may not accept the results for various purposes including apportionment,” said Thompson, who oversaw 2020 census preparation as the agency’s leader during the Obama administration.He said in an email that missing the Dec. 31 target date “means that the Census Bureau is choosing to remove known errors from the 2020 Census instead of meeting the legal deadline.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/census-bureau-to-miss-deadline-jeopardizing-trump-plan/story-6O6WvNiIALcRgeAGlhpSyO.html
31-12-2020||World||Biden picks first woman to serve as deputy defense secretary||President-elect Joe Biden will nominate former Pentagon official Kathleen Hicks to serve as the first female deputy defense secretary, saying he wanted someone who knows the department “inside and out” to help restore order to an agency he says was cast into disarray by President Donald Trump.Colin Kahl, who served as Biden’s national security adviser when he was vice president, will be nominated for undersecretary of defense for policy.The new additions to Biden’s national security team, announced Wednesday, signal a return to experienced hands after Trump has run through a number of defense leaders, including two confirmed secretaries and three acting secretaries of defense. Biden complained Monday that critical national security posts have been “hollowed out” in personnel, capacity and morale.Also Read: Joe Biden to block still-pending Trump administration regulationsHicks and Kahl would report to Lloyd Austin, the retired four-star Army general and Raytheon Technologies Corp. board member who Biden has tapped to be secretary of Defense.Austin’s nomination faces an additional hurdle in that both chambers of Congress would have to approve a waiver to a law prohibiting recently retired military officers to fill the top civilian job at the department.

The chancellor will meet with the premiers of Germany’s 16 states next week to discuss whether to keep non-essential stores, gyms and restaurants shut for longer.Even though vaccines will gradually be made available across the population, “the tasks ahead remain gigantic,” Merkel said, urging Germans to show the same solidarity and discipline next year that had gotten them through the pandemic so far.Europe’s largest economy has provided relatively generous aid packages to help businesses cushion the blow from lockdown rules. The spending has caused total new borrowing this year and next to balloon to over 300 billion euros ($369 billion), creating tensions within Merkel’s coalition.Merkel defended the spending, saying state aid helped ease uncertainty and even “existential fears” for people like shop owners, freelancers and artists.The somber tone belies a successful close to Germany’s European Union presidency. At the tail end of the six-month term, Merkel helped secure backing for the bloc’s landmark spending and recovery package, finalized a post-Brexit trade deal with the U.K. and completed an investment pact with China.Her final full year in office was probably her toughest.“Never in the last 15 years have any of us felt the outgoing year to be so weary,” Merkel said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/germany-merkel-urges-discipline-in-long-harsh-winter-to-beat-pandemic/story-qgvoYQPo4CHerOvBojN3DN.html
31-12-2020||World||Joe Biden to block still-pending Trump administration regulations||President-elect Joe Biden will issue a memo effective Inauguration Day that will block actions taken by the outgoing administration that haven’t yet become official, the transition team announced Wednesday.Jen Psaki, incoming White House press secretary, said the move will curb “midnight” regulations and actions. She cited a Trump Labor Department plan to make it easier for companies to classify employees as contractors, who typically don’t get overtime pay or health benefits.“The memo will potentially freeze this rule and not allow it to be implemented,” Psaki said.Incoming administrations historically issue a memo freezing new rules that have been announced but not yet published in the Federal Register. By suspending their publication, the new administration can wipe away such final rules and rewrite or abandon them.Also Read | California announces first confirmed case of virus variantPresident Donald Trump’s administration has been rushing to finalize a slew of regulations governing air pollution, energy efficiency and endangered species before Biden is sworn in. In addition to the forthcoming Labor Department rule, the administration is working now to finish new measures governing foreign agricultural workers and a regulation that would block the Environmental Protection Agency from relying on scientific research that isn’t or can’t be made public.While Biden officials can unwind many Trump rules, doing so will consume time and resources, generally requiring the creation of replacement rules through a formal notice-and-comment process that is designed to move slowly.The Inauguration Day memo would mean a potentially easier process for rewriting or scrapping late-moving Trump rules. Typically 60 days must pass for major rules to become effective after publication in the Federal Register.The Biden transition team also complained that the Trump administration isn’t doing enough to cooperate with the incoming administration.“Make no mistake, this lack of cooperation has real world implications, most concerningly as it relates to our national security,” said transition spokesman Yohannes Abraham. “This intentionally generated opacity makes it harder for our government to protect the American people moving forward.”An Office of Management and Budget official said the office had provided all factual information and has taken 45 meetings with the transition team.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-to-block-still-pending-trump-administration-regulations/story-yHx8T5AjO2pIKeS89gufxH.html
31-12-2020||World||California announces first confirmed case of new Covid-19 variant||California on Wednesday announced its first confirmed case of the new and apparently more contagious variant of the coronavirus, the second case documented in the United States in a day.Governor Gavin Newsom announced the infection found in Southern California during an online conversation with Dr. Anthony Fauci, head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.“I don’t think Californians should think that this is odd. It’s to be expected,” Fauci said.Newsom did not provide any other details about the person who was infected.The first person in the US known to be infected with the variant was identified Wednesday as a Colorado National Guardsman who had been sent to help out at a nursing home struggling with an outbreak. Health officials said a second Guard member may have it too.The cases have triggered a host of questions about how the version circulating in England arrived in the US and whether it is too late to stop it now, with top experts saying it is probably already spreading elsewhere in the United States.“The virus is becoming more fit, and we’re like a deer in the headlights,” warned Dr. Eric Topol, head of Scripps Research Translational Institute. He noted that the US does far less genetic sequencing of virus samples to discover variants than other developed nations, and thus was probably slow to detect this new mutation.Click here for complete coverage of Covid-19 pandemicThe two Guard members had been dispatched on Dec. 23 to work at the Good Samaritan Society nursing home in the small town of Simla, in a mostly rural area about 90 miles outside Denver, said Dr. Rachel Herlihy, state epidemiologist. They were among six Guard members sent to the home.Nasal swab samples taken from the two as part of the Guard’s routine coronavirus testing were sent to the state laboratory, which began looking for the variant after its spread was announced in Britain earlier this month, Herlihy said. Samples from staff and residents at the nursing home are also being screened for the variant at the lab, but so far no evidence of it has been found, she said.The confirmed Colorado case, first announced Tuesday, is in a man in his 20s who had not traveled recently, officials said. He has mild symptoms and is isolating at his home near Denver, while the person with the suspected case is isolating at a Colorado hotel while further genetic analysis is done on his sample, officials said.The nursing home said it is working closely with the state and is also looking forward to beginning vaccinations next week.Several states, including California, Massachusetts and Delaware, are also analyzing suspicious virus samples for the variant, said Dr. Greg Armstrong, who directs genetic sequencing at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. He said the CDC is working with a national lab that gets samples from around the country to broaden that search, with results expected within days.The discovery in Colorado has added urgency to the nation’s vaccination drive against Covid-19, which has killed more than 340,000 people in the US.Read more| United States facing 4 historic crises at once, says Joe BidenBritain is seeing infections soar and hospitalizations climb to their highest levels on record. The variant has also been found in several other countries.Scientists have found no evidence that it is more lethal or causes more severe illness, and they believe the vaccines now being dispensed will be effective against it. But a faster-spreading virus could swamp hospitals with seriously ill patients.The discovery overseas led the CDC to issue rules on Christmas Day requiring travelers arriving from Britain to show proof of a negative Covid-19 test. But US health officials said the Colorado patient’s lack of travel history suggests the new variant is already spreading in this country.Topol said it is too late for travel bans.“We’re behind in finding it. Colorado is likely one of many places it’s landed here,” he said. “It’s all over the place. How can you ban travel from everywhere?”Colorado public health officials are conducting contact tracing to determine its spread.Researchers estimate the variant is 50% to 70% more contagious, said Dr. Eric France, Colorado’s chief medical officer.“Instead of only making two or three other people sick, you might actually spread it to four or five people,” France said. “That means we’ll have more cases in our communities. Those number of cases will rise quickly and, of course, with more cases come more hospitalizations.”London and southeast England were placed under strict lockdown measures earlier this month because of the variant, and dozens of countries banned flights from Britain. France also briefly barred trucks from Britain before allowing them back in, provided the drivers got tested for the virus.New versions of the virus have been seen almost since it was first detected in China a year ago. It is common for viruses to undergo minor changes as they reproduce and move through a population. The fear is that mutations at some point will become significant enough to defeat the vaccines.South Africa has also discovered a highly contagious Covid-19 variant that is driving the country’s latest spike of cases, hospitalizations and deaths.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/california-announces-first-confirmed-case-of-virus-variant/story-MKBXaGUQzrPNJsRCB7SKAJ.html
31-12-2020||World||New York should ban small-business evictions: Ocasio-Cortez||US Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York called on Governor Andrew Cuomo to extend his statewide ban on evictions to include small businesses.The outspoken Democrat also suggested that New York should extend rent protections to vulnerable small businesses and that the federal government should step in to help with rents and mortgages nationwide. Under legislation signed this week, New Yorkers suffering from financial hardships due to the coronavirus pandemic will be protected from evictions and foreclosures until May 1.“Our priority should be to keep people housed and prevent economic collapse of the family and local small businesses that are the backbone of our communities,” Ocasio-Cortez wrote on Twitter.Cuomo echoed the call on Wednesday but said state lawmakers should be the ones to take up legislation that will protect commercial tenants and small businesses, including a ban on late fees and penalties. Landlords should recognize that if they kick out a tenant, there’s unlikely to be anyone to replace them until the economy improves, he said.“If the legislature doesn’t do it, or doesn’t do it quickly, then I would do an executive order to do it,” he said at a virus briefing. “But I’d rather see them just close the loopholes in the bill so there’s no confusion.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-york-should-ban-small-business-evictions-ocasio-cortez/story-2zCoM4J0RFpCeYrx0C4HRJ.html
31-12-2020||World||Mitch McConnell rules out passing house bill with $2,000 payments||Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell on Wednesday closed off chances of the Senate acting anytime soon on a House bill that would give most Americans $2,000 stimulus payments.The Kentucky Republican said the House legislation, approved in a bipartisan vote Monday, “has no realistic path” to quick passage in the Senate and that it falls short of the demands of President Donald Trump. He again blocked an attempt by Democratic leader Chuck Schumer to adopt the House bill to increase the payments to $2,000 from the $600 by unanimous consent.The Senate instead will work on combining the stimulus payments with measures on election integrity and rolling back social media liability protections, he said. That responds to all three issues Trump has said he wants, but a bill melding them likely will alienate enough senators in both parties to leave prospects for bigger stimulus payments dead in the Senate.“The Senate is not going to be bullied into rushing out more borrowed money into the hands of the Democrats’ rich friends who don’t need the help,” McConnell said. The House bill would raise the income cutoff to receive a payment.The clash over the payments also is entangling another piece of year-end business in the Senate -- a vote to override Trump’s veto of a $740.5 billion defense policy bill. Senators Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Ed Markey of Massachusetts said they would continue to delay the defense legislation vote unless McConnell relents and allows a vote on a standalone bill on the bigger stimulus checks.“We are saying to Mitch McConnell, to allow the United States Senate to do what it’s supposed to do, and that is the vote,” Sanders told reporters. “The House passed the bill, it’s over here right now. Do you want to vote against it? Then vote against it.”Pennsylvania Republican Senator Pat Toomey later blocked an attempt by Sanders to call up the House bill for a roll call vote.Trump’s pressureMcConnell and many other Republicans oppose taking up the House legislation despite increasingly angry statements by Trump urging the Senate to raise the stimulus payments to $2,000 from the $600 that was in the bill he signed into law on Sunday.“Unless Republicans have a death wish, and it is also the right thing to do, they must approve the $2000 payments ASAP. $600 IS NOT ENOUGH! Also, get rid of Section 230 - Don’t let Big Tech steal our Country, and don’t let the Democrats steal the Presidential Election. Get tough!” Trump tweeted on Tuesday, repeating his unfounded claim of election fraud in November.That’s created a bind for the GOP. Georgia Senators David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler came out in favor of the higher payments on Tuesday as they campaigned in a close contest that will be settled in a Jan. 5 runoff. Their Democratic opponents, Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff, had previously endorsed the $2,000 checks. The runoff will determine control of the Senate.Other Republican also are publicly on board, including Marco Rubio of Florida and Missouri’s Josh Hawley, both of whom are potential contenders for the 2024 GOP presidential nomination.Republican critics of the House measure have focused on a feature of the bill which allows some payments to go to people with six-figure incomes.Income limitsMarried couples with a combined adjusted gross income of $150,000 or less and individuals who make $75,000 or less annually would be eligible for the full $2,000 per person amount. The payments are less for higher incomes, based on family size. For example, a single adult earning less than $115,000, a married couple earning up to $230,000, and a family of four with as much as $310,000 in annual income would get a portion of the $2,000 per person.“The problem with $2,000 is not targeted. It goes to people who didn’t lose any money,” said Senator Lamar Alexander, a Tennessee Republican. “If we are going to spend that much money my preference is to target it.”House Speaker Nancy Pelosi sidestepped a question about whether she would try to revive the legislation when the new Congress convenes after Jan. 3 if the Senate doesn’t act this week.The legislation “would have bipartisan support in the Senate if Mitch McConnell would only allow it to come to the floor instead of being an obstruction to those checks going to the American people.” she said at her weekly news conference.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/mitch-mcconnell-rules-out-passing-house-bill-with-2-000-payments/story-inZOr9bgchjy4SAsabW36J.html

President-elect Joe Biden has pledged to halt arms sales to Saudi Arabia, the Middle East’s biggest buyer of American weapons, in a bid to pressure Riyadh to end a war in Yemen that has caused the world’s worst humanitarian crisis.The package would include 3,000 GBU-39 Small Diameter Bomb I (SDB I) munitions, containers, support equipment, spares and technical support, the Pentagon said.“The proposed sale will improve Saudi Arabia’s capability to meet current and future threats by increasing its stocks of long-range, precision air-to-ground munitions,” the Pentagon said in a statement. It added that “the size and accuracy of the SDB I allows for an effective munition with less collateral damage.”The Pentagon’s Defense Security Cooperation Agency notified Congress of the possible sale on Tuesday. Members of Congress have been angered by steep civilian casualties in Yemen and earlier this year tried and failed to block the sale of F-35 warplanes to Riyadh.Despite approval by the State Department, the notification does not indicate that a contract has been signed or that negotiations have concluded.The Pentagon said Boeing Co was the prime contractor for the weapons.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-state-department-approves-potential-sale-of-3-000-smart-bombs-to-saudi-arabia/story-UCEpr9bG9DHVnRZY82y6LJ.html
31-12-2020||World||Airport blasts kill 30 as unity govt lands in Yemen||Multiple explosions and gunfire rocked Yemen’s Aden airport on Wednesday as a new cabinet flew in from its refuge in Saudi Arabia, killing at least 30 people and wounding 60 others, according to the Al-Masdar news website.Al-Masdar said a deputy minister of public works was killed, and two other vice ministers were wounded in the attack, which took place as cabinet members prepared to step off the plane. They had returned to Aden amid a heavy security presence and were whisked to their headquarters at the presidential palace after the assault.President Abd Rabbuh Mansur Hadi blamed Iran-backed Houthi rebels who have been fighting the government since 2014, and vowed that violence won’t deter the government from working to normalise life in the war-battered nation, the Saba news agency reported. No one claimed responsibility.A blast was later heard near the presidential palace after the cabinet was taken there. The Saudi-led military coalition that’s been trying to restore Hadi to power said it intercepted a Houthi drone trying to target the compound.AP footage from the scene showed members of the government delegation disembarking as the blast shook the grounds. Many ministers rushed back inside the plane or ran down the stairs, seeking shelter.Thick smoke rose into the air from near the terminal building. Officials at the scene said they saw bodies lying on the tarmac and elsewhere at the airport.Yemeni Communication Minister Naguib al-Awg, who was also on the plane, told The Associated Press that he heard two explosions, suggesting they were drone attacks. Yemeni Prime Minister Maeen Abdulmalik Saeed and the others were quickly whisked from the airport to Mashiq Palace in the city.“It would have been a disaster if the plane was bombed,” he said, insisting the plane was the target of the attack as it was supposed to land earlier.Saeed tweeted that he and his cabinet were safe and unhurt. He called the explosions a “cowardly terrorist act” that was part of the war on “the Yemeni state and our great people.”Mohammed al-Roubid, deputy head of Aden’s health office, told the AP that at least 16 people were killed in the explosion and 60 were wounded.Images shared on social media from the scene showed rubble and broken glass strewn about near the airport building and at least two lifeless bodies, one of them charred, lying on the ground. In another image, a man was trying to help another man whose clothes were torn to get up from the ground.According to one Yemeni security official, three Red Cross workers were among the wounded, though it was not clear if they were Yemenis or of other nationalities. He and other officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to talk to the media.U.N. special envoy for Yemen, Martin Griffiths, condemned the explosion as an “unacceptable act of violence.” He said in a tweet that it was “a tragic reminder of the importance of bringing #Yemen urgently back on the path towards peace.”The ministers were returning to Aden from the Saudi capital, Riyadh, after being sworn in last week as part of a reshuffle following a deal with rival southern separatists. Yemen’s internationally recognized government has worked mostly from self-imposed exile in Riyadh during the country’s years-long civil war.The Saudi ambassador to Yemen, Mohammed al-Jaber, described the attack as a “cowardly terrorist act targeting the Yemeni people, their security and stability.”Despite “the disappointment and confusion caused by those who create death and destruction,” the peace agreement between the government and southern separatists “will go forward,” he insisted.Yemen’s embattled President Abed Rabbo Mansour Hadi, in exile in Saudi Arabia, announced a Cabinet reshuffle earlier this month.The reshuffle was seen as a major step toward closing a dangerous rift between Hadi’s government and southern separatists backed by the United Arab Emirates. The Saudi-backed government is at war with with Iran-allied Houthi rebels, who control most of northern Yemen as well as the country’s capital, Sanaa.Naming a new government was part of a power-sharing deal between the Saudi-backed Hadi and the Emirati-backed separatist Southern Transitional Council, an umbrella group of militias seeking to restore an independent southern Yemen, which existed from 1967 until unification in 1990.The blast underscores the dangers facing Hadi’s government in the port city, which was a scene of bloody fighting between forces of the internationally recognized government and the UAE-backed separatists.Last year, the Houthis fired a missile at a military parade of newly graduated fighters of a militia loyal to the UAE at a military base in Aden, killing dozens.In 2015, then-Yemeni Prime Minister Khaled Bahah and members of his government survived a missile attack, blamed on the Houthis, on an Aden hotel used by the government.Yemen, the Arab world’s poorest country, has been engulfed in civil war since 2014, when the Shiite Houthi rebels overran the north and Sanaa. The following year, a Saudi-led military coalition intervened to wage war on the Houthis and restore Hadi’s government to power.The war has killed more than 112,000, including thousands of civilians. The conflict also resulted in the world’s worst humanitarian crisis.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/airport-blasts-kill-30-as-unity-govt-lands-in-yemen/story-qLV0OigaeHRaQBPYxjn8SJ.html
31-12-2020||World||Chinese court jails 10 Hong Kong democracy activists for up to three years||A Chinese court on Wednesday jailed 10 Hong Kong democracy activists for up to three years over a bid to flee the city by speedboat to Taiwan, as a crackdown on dissent in the territory intensifies.The group was arrested by the Chinese coastguard on August 23 en route to the self-ruled island, which has quietly opened its doors to Hongkongers seeking sanctuary.The court in the southern city of Shenzhen sentenced Tang Kai-yin to three years in jail and Quinn Moon to two years for organising an illegal border crossing.The eight others were sentenced to seven months behind bars for illegally crossing the border.The sentencing follows the imposition of a sweeping new security law in Hong Kong this year that has given the government broad powers to prosecute political dissidents.A number of activists have fled the city for overseas and political organisations have shuttered their doors as Beijing seeks to keep a lid on unrest that rocked the financial hub for months last year.A total of 12 people were caught on the boat and the group were facing prosecution in Hong Kong related to last year’s protests before attempting their escape. They will likely be hit with further charges in the city after serving their mainland sentences.Two minors from the so-called “Hong Kong 12”, aged 17 and 18, were returned to the city on Wednesday after they admitted wrongdoing, Chinese officials said.The pair face charges of conspiracy to commit arson and possession of an offensive weapon and have been remanded in custody ahead of their next court appearance.The 10 adults first appeared before the Shenzhen court on Monday, but the trial -- like many in China’s opaque legal system -- was not open to foreign reporters or diplomats.These 10 were also fined up to 20,000 yuan (US$3,060) in addition to their jail terms.But the Yantian District People’s Procuratorate said it would not pursue its case against the two teenagers, surnamed Hoang and Liu.- Going fishing -Families of the accused were only notified of the trial date three days before the hearing and were unable to attend due to the short notice and Covid-19 restrictions.Their lawyers were barred from meeting the detainees, with authorities instead appointing state-approved legal representation.The lawyers on Wednesday said the sentences were too heavy and the allegation of organising a border crossing was not substantiated.According to mainland Chinese media, Tang bought the boat in August and learnt basic driving skills for the escape, while Quinn Moon was responsible for communicating with the rest of the group, urging them to tell the coastguard they were going fishing if caught.They all pleaded guilty to the crime and signed confession papers in the presence of lawyers, said the Southern Daily, a mouthpiece of the Guangdong provincial Communist Party committee.- ‘Fleeing tyranny’ -The United States on Monday called for the immediate release of the group, saying it was “fleeing tyranny”. “Communist China will stop at nothing to prevent its people from seeking freedom elsewhere,” a US embassy spokesperson told AFP. Amnesty International said in a statement that the group were at risk of torture serving sentences in mainland Chinese jails.“These sentences meted out after an unfair trial lay bare the dangers faced by anybody who finds themselves tried under the Chinese criminal system,” said Amnesty International’s Asia-Pacific Regional Director Yamini Mishra.“The Chinese authorities have shown the world once again that political activists will not receive a fair trial.”China’s foreign ministry on Monday pushed back against comments by foreign countries on the case.Washington must “immediately stop interfering in China’s internal affairs through the Hong Kong issue and immediately stop interfering in China’s judicial sovereignty”, spokesman Zhao Lijian told reporters.The security law that now blankets Hong Kong gives authorities sweeping powers of prosecution for acts deemed terrorism, secession, subversion or collusion with foreign entities. The city had enjoyed unique freedoms since its handover from former colonial power Britain in 1997, with a deal promising a “one country, two systems” arrangement for 50 years. Beijing says the new security law was needed to restore peace and stability but critics have condemned it as a fatal attack on Hong Kong’s freedoms.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinese-court-jails-10-hong-kong-democracy-activists-for-up-to-three-years/story-dSidqEv3botwiOxJaVCa0H.html
31-12-2020||World||Russia opens new criminal case against Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny||Russian state investigators said on Tuesday they had opened a new criminal case against Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny, accusing him of fraudulently spending public donations to organisations he controls on his personal needs.The move is likely to be seen as the latest sign that the Kremlin does not want Navalny, who is convalescing in Germany, to return to Russia after what Berlin and other Western nations say was an attempt in August to murder him with a nerve agent.Navalny is one of President Vladimir Putin’s leading critics and the Kremlin has said he is free to return home just like any other Russian citizen, something he has said he plans to do. It has said it has seen no evidence he was poisoned however and has denied any involvement in the August incident which saw him collapse on a plane before being airlifted to Germany.Russia’s Investigative Committee, which looks into serious crimes, late on Tuesday accused Navalny and unnamed individuals of large-scale fraud, saying he and others had spent 356 million roubles ($4.81 million) donated to organisations he controls on their personal needs.That, it said in a statement, included purchasing goods and services and covering personal expenses such as overseas trips.Navalny responded to the case on Twitter, saying it was fabricated and looked like a hysterical action ordered by Putin. He said he had predicted that the authorities would seek to jail him after failing to kill him.The Kremlin earlier on Tuesday declined to comment on other potential legal action against Navalny. Putin has said that media reports that Russian state security agents poisoned Navalny were part of a U.S.-backed plot to try to discredit him. He said Navalny was not important enough to be a target.Russia’s prison service on Monday gave Navalny another potential legal headache in the form of a last minute ultimatum: Fly back from Germany at once and report early on Tuesday morning, or be jailed if you return after that deadline. Navalny was unable to return in time.The prison service said a suspended sentence in an earlier and separate theft case Navalny says was politically-motivated could be changed to a real jail term.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russia-opens-new-criminal-case-against-kremlin-critic-alexei-navalny/story-eLYUKUgBCJ4eLxJQf6JKkO.html

31-12-2020||World||British govt places millions under tight restrictions as Covid-19 cases soar||The British government on Wednesday extended its toughest coronavirus restrictions to more than three-quarters of England’s population, saying a fast-spreading new variant of the virus has reached most of the country.Health Secretary Matt Hancock said that at midnight the government’s top infection-warning level, Tier 4, would be expanded beyond London and the southeast to cover large swaths of central, northern and southwest England, including the major cities of Manchester and Birmingham. The move will severely curtail New Year’s Eve celebrations in parts of England that are home to 44 million people, or 78% of the population.In England’s Tier 4, most people are advised to stay home, barred from mixing with the members of other households either indoors or out, nonessential shops are shut and restaurants and bars can only offer takeout.Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland also have implemented strong lockdown measures.Hospitals in the worst-hit areas of London and southern England are becoming increasingly overstretched, with ambulances unable to unload patients at some hospitals where all the beds are occupied. There are more people in hospitals with COVID-19 now than at the first peak of the outbreak in April.Britain has recorded more than 72,500 confirmed coronavirus deaths, the second-highest death toll in Europe after Italy. The country reported a record number of new confirmed cases on Tuesday, more than 53,000, and 50,023 on Wednesday.The U.K. also reported Wednesday that another 981 people with the coronavirus had died. It’s the highest daily figure reported since April, though it follows a lag in reporting over the Christmas holidays.Hancock said Wednesday’s authorization of a second vaccine for use in the U.K. was good news, but “sharply rising cases and the hospitalizations that follow demonstrate the need to act where the virus is spreading.”He told lawmakers in the House of Commons that the medicines regulator’s approval of the vaccine made by British pharmaceutical company AstraZeneca and Oxford University “brings forward the day on which we can lift the restrictions,”“But…we must act to suppress the virus now, especially as the new variant makes the time between now and then even more difficult.”In addition to the wider restrictions, the government delayed the return to school after the Christmas break for millions of students. Education Secretary Gavin Williamson said secondary schools in England would not resume in-person teaching until Jan. 11, though most primary schools would go back on Monday as planned.Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine and another already in use developed by U.S. drugmaker Pfizer and Germany company BioNTech meant “there are plenty of reasons for people to be optimistic about the spring.”However, Johnson said, “people should not in any way think that this is over.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/british-govt-places-millions-under-tight-restrictions-as-covid-19-cases-soar/story-TRyeVJrvFBRpq355PSGYtI.html
31-12-2020||World||Hindu temple in Pakistan vandalised, set on fire||A historic Hindu temple in Pakistan’s Khyber Pakhtunkwa province was vandalised and set on fire by an unruly mob of hundreds on Wednesday following a dispute over the land occupied by it.The Shri Paramhans Ji Maharaj’s Samadhi along with the Krishna Dwara Mandir in Teri village of Karak district was vandalised by the mob that claimed the temple had encroached on extra land.District police officer Irfan Marwat said the mob was protesting the expansion work of the temple and demolished new construction work alongside the old structure.The temple was first attacked and demolished in 1997. After intervention by the Supreme Court in 2015, the local community had agreed to its reconstruction. Despite the reconstruction, there was a dispute over the land allocated to the temple. This also led to some misunderstanding between the temple supporters and local clerics. Eyewitnesses said that hundreds of people set fire to the building on Wednesday. They surrounded and vandalised the temple for hours but police did not intervene.Local media quoted advocate Rohit Kumar, a representative of the Hindu community, as saying that the temple did not exceed the agreed area and that residents violated the agreement by vandalising the temple.No case has been registered and neither any arrest made so far in the incident.
