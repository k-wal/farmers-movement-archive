Health Canada said it received Pfizer’s submission on October 9, and “after a thorough, independent review of the evidence”, determined that the “vaccine meets the Department’s stringent safety, efficacy and quality requirements for use in Canada.”It also said that “strong monitoring systems” will be in place as the vaccine is rolled out, adding, “Health Canada and the Public Health Agency of Canada will closely monitor the safety of the vaccine once it is on the market and will not hesitate to take action if any safety concerns are identified.”Canada is expected to receive 249,000 doses of the vaccine very soon and early recipients will include healthcare workers and residents of long term care homes, considered among the most vulnerable demographics.Another four million doses are expected to be available by March next year, while Canada has nearly 20 million doses of this particular vaccine on order. The Pfizer vaccine has to be delivered in two doses and brings with it logistical challenges having to be stored at temperatures below -70 degree C.The country has established 14 distribution centres where the vaccinations will take place in the beginning.Health Canada said the vaccine is for use in people 16 years of age or older, but noted Pfizer-BioNTech are running further clinical trials on children of all age groups and that could change.Canada recently amended the contract with Pfizer so that it would deliver up to 249,000 doses this month. That will mean about 124,500 of the highest risk Canadians will get vaccinated at first as two doses are required per person a few weeks apart.Pfizer and BioNTech said it will supply a minimum of 20 million doses to Canada through 2021 and as many as 76 million.Canada has contracts with six other vaccine makers as well.The government has said 14 distribution centres will be located in large Canadian cities initially. There will be at least one in each province and two each in Canada’s four largest provinces.“This is phenomenal news for all Canadians as we take the next step toward ending this pandemic. As soon as vaccines arrive on Ontario soil, we will be ready to deliver and administer them,” Ontario Premier Doug Ford said in a tweet.(With inputs from Agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canada-becomes-second-nation-to-approve-pfizer-biontech-covid-vaccine/story-iCUSDwTWq9Yb7Don2LDmMJ.html

Absolutely clueless! So disappointed with his response...But it might help if our PM actually knew what he was talking about!”Dhesi last week coordinated a letter signed by 36 MPs from various parties to foreign secretary Dominic Raab, asking him to raise the farmers’ issue with the Indian government. A protest demonstration was held outside the Indian high commission in Aldwych on Sunday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/farmers-issue-a-matter-for-india-pak-to-settle-says-pm-boris-johnson/story-AIXMchYfGe9Kf5GVe3FAwL.html

Pfizer, along with its German partner BioNTech, has developed the vaccine which has an efficacy rate of nearly 95%.On Tuesday, it cleared a major hurdle after the FDA released documents in which it raised no new red flags over the safety and efficacy of the vaccine.“The vaccine’s efficacy and safety data met its expectations for emergency use authorisation,” Reuters reported citing FDA official.The agency typically follows the recommendations of its advisory panels but is not required to do so. It is not clear how many days or weeks the FDA will take to make a decision, but states are prepping for vaccine deliveries in mid-December.Meanwhile, Pfizer Chief Executive Albert Bourla said earlier that he is expecting a “very intense” meeting with a US vaccine advisory panel. However, remaining optimistic about the approval, Bourla said that is counting on the panel of outside experts to sign off on his company’s Covid-19 vaccine candidate.“I think they will vote ‘yes’ given the strength of the data,” Bourla said.On Wednesday, Canada became the second country to approve Pfizer vaccine. It has already been approved by the United Kingdom.Besides the US, European Medicines Agency (EMA) is also assessing data to approve the vaccine.The United States is the worst affected country due to coronavirus disease. As per the figures by the John Hopkins University, as many as 15,189,410 people have been infected by the viral disease pushing the healthcare system under the crumbling pressure. While the 286,461 others have succumbed to the disease.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-fda-panel-to-discuss-emergency-use-of-pfizer-covid-19-vaccine-tomorrow/story-61LOO75pKS3R8GhHXucweO.html

It is the only Brazilian company with the model in its fleet.The Boeing plane was grounded globally in March 2019, shortly after a 737 Max crashed in Ethiopia. A prior crash in Indonesia involving the model occurred in October 2018. In all, 346 people died.Brazil’s aviation regulator lifted its restrictions on the 737 Max in November, clearing the way for the plane to resume flights in Latin America’s biggest country.Similar restrictions have been lifted in the U.S. and Europe, where commercial flights with the plane are expected to resume soon, likely starting with American Airlines on Dec. 29.“The MAX is one of the most efficient aircraft in aviation history and the only one to undergo a complete recertification process,” Gol’s chief executive officer, Paulo Kakinoff, said in a statement earlier this week.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/boeing-737-max-back-in-air-2-years-after-grounded-by-crashes/story-EvQNxmHOdBGP4lNyBj2EkP.html

Moscow and Washington have discussed extending the pact, but differences have remained.New START was signed in 2010 by then-US President Barack Obama and then-Russian President Dmitry Medvedev. It limits each country to no more than 1,550 deployed nuclear warheads and 700 deployed missiles and bombers, and envisages sweeping on-site inspections to verify complianceAfter both Moscow and Washington withdrew from the 1987 Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty last year, New START is the only remaining nuclear arms control deal between the two countries still standing.Arms control advocates have warned that its expiration would remove any checks on US and Russian nuclear forces, in a blow to global stability.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russia-conducts-drills-of-its-strategic-nuclear-forces/story-WKHILGKZrpfhSURRZxhaDK.html

Google’s pause of election ads, which came into effect after polls closed in the US presidential election on Nov. 3, was one of its measures to combat misinformation and other abuses on its site.It was part of its ‘sensitive events’ policy, which seeks to prohibit content that potentially capitalizes on or lacks reasonable sensitivity towards events like public health emergencies or natural disasters. The company said in an email to advertisers seen by Reuters that “we no longer consider the post-election period to be a sensitive event.” Major online platforms have been under pressure to police misinformation in political ads. Facebook Inc said in November that its post-election ban on political ads would likely last another month.Twitter Inc banned political ads last year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/google-will-lift-post-election-political-ad-ban-on-december-10/story-sf42foUZAIOodFw335XeaK.html

This and other questions answered||After the United Kingdom rolled out Pfizer-Biotech vaccine against the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), several countries, including India, are gearing up to grant emergency use authorisation to different vaccine candidates. While the governments around the world will be targeting frontline workers and people at higher risk to inoculate them against the virus, some groups may have to wait longer even after the vaccine becomes available for the general public.The National Health Service (NHS) of the UK is currently offering Pfizer’s Covid-19 vaccine in some hospitals to health care workers at high risk, people aged 80 and above who already have a hospital appointment in the next few weeks, and those who work in care homes. But the health care provider has also advised some groups to wait for the vaccination.Also Read | UK issues precautionary advice on Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine after two allergic reactionsHere’s the list of people who should avoid Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine for now:Pregnant women: The Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine has not yet been assessed in pregnancy, so the NHS has advised that until more information is available, those who are pregnant should not have this vaccine. The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) wants to see more non-clinical data before finalising the advice in pregnancy.Planning to get pregnant: The NHS has advised delaying the vaccination for those who are planning to get pregnant in the next three months. Alternatively, they can start the two-dose course now and avoid getting pregnant until at least 2 months after the second dose.Breastfeeding: Such a group should wait until they have finished breastfeeding and then have the vaccine. “If you were breastfeeding when you had the first dose you are advised not to have the second dose until you have finished breastfeeding,” says NHS.People with a history of allergic reactions: The UK regulators have advised people who have a history of “significant” allergic reactions to not get the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine. The MHRA issued precautionary advice to the NHS after two health care staff members experienced allergic reactions. Dr June Raine, chief executive of the MHRA, testified to a parliamentary committee on Wednesday, where she acknowledged that the cases of allergic reactions didn’t feature in the extensive clinical trials.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-can-pregnant-women-take-pfizer-s-vaccine-this-and-other-questions-answered/story-opkf2Ck9otQKygzKzi56yI.html
09-12-2020||World||France unveils draft law to fight Islamist radical ‘enemy’||A draft law aimed at arming France against Islamist radicalism was unveiled Wednesday, a measure promoted by President Emmanuel Macron to rout out what he calls “separatists” undermining the nation.Parliament is expected to open what is likely to be a lively debate on the draft law in the months ahead. The measure, long in the making and refined until days before its presentation, has gone through various name changes and is now known by the delicate title “Supporting Republican Principles.”Prime Minister Jean Castex said those whose project is to “divide and spread hate and violence” are at the center of “separatism.”Separatism is especially dangerous because it “is the manifestation of a conscious, theorized, political-religious project with an ambition to make religious norms predominate over the law,” he said at a news conference.In an interview with the newspaper Le Monde he said the nature of a law is long-term and it would apply to any political ideology that threatens French values, “even if today it is radical Islamism that we try by all means to fight.”Castex and others insist that neither Islam as a religion nor regular Muslims are targeted by the draft law. Neither is named in the text made up of about 50 articles aimed at enabling better oversight of mosques, associations, public services and schools. The aim is to reduce the space where radicals can operate and ensure that French values, including secularism, are guaranteed.Among notable measures is making school obligatory from age 3 with the ability to opt out in favor of home schooling for special cases only. The measure is aimed at ending so-called clandestine schools run by fundamentalists with their own agenda.Another article encourages mosques to register as places of worship, so as to better identify them. Many of the nation’s more than 2,600 mosques currently operate under rules for associations. Foreign funding for mosques, while not forbidden, would have to be declared if more than 10,000 euros.The draft law would make it a crime punishable by fines and up to one year in prison for a doctor to provide a young woman with virginity certificates, sometimes demanded ahead of marriage.To do away with forced marriages, a measure requires the couple to meet separately for an interview with an official when there is a doubt about free consent. If the doubt persists, the official must take the issue to a prosecutor who could forbid the marriage.Those practicing polygamy would be forbidden French residence cards.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/france-unveils-draft-law-to-fight-islamist-radical-enemy/story-sFf2ANRVbWSkpyOFLn6ZKL.html

But unless something changes dramatically, billions of people around the world will not receive a safe and effective vaccine for Covid-19 for years to come.”So far, the alliance said, all of Moderna’s doses and 96% of Pfizer-BioNTech’s shots have been acquired by rich countries.It added: “In welcome contrast Oxford-AstraZeneca has pledged to provide 64% of their doses to people in developing nations. Yet despite their actions to scale up supply they can still only reach 18% of the world’s population next year at most“Oxford-AstraZeneca deals have also mostly been made with some of the big developing countries like China and India, while the majority of developing countries have not done deals and have to share the COVAX pool of vaccines between them.”This demonstrates that one company alone cannot hope to supply the whole world, and that only open sharing of technology between vaccine producers can make this possible, the alliance said.It called on pharmaceutical corporations to openly share their technology and intellectual property through the World Health Organisation Covid-19 Technology Access Pool, so that billions more doses can be manufactured and safe and effective vaccines can be available to all who need them.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/rich-nations-hoarded-enough-covid-vaccines-to-inoculate-their-populations-thrice/story-kd16kHVbEvbyQQ0PgdQe9N.html
09-12-2020||World||US Democratic- controlled House approves defense policy bill with a veto-proof margin||The Democratic-controlled House easily approved a wide-ranging defense policy bill, defying a veto threat from President Donald Trump and setting up a possible showdown with the Republican president in the waning days of his administration.The 335-78 vote in favor of the $731 billion defense measure came on Tuesday hours after Trump renewed his threat to veto the bill unless lawmakers clamp down on social media companies he claims were biased against him during the election.Trump tweeted Tuesday that he will veto “the very weak National Defense Authorization Act,’‘ or NDAA, unless it repeals so-called Section 230, a part of the communications code that shields Twitter, Facebook and other tech giants from content liability. Trump also wants Congress to strip out a provision of the bill that allows renaming of military bases that now honor Confederate leaders.Congressional leaders vowed to move ahead on the hugely popular bill — which affirms automatic 3% pay raises for US troops and authorizes other military programs — despite the veto threat.The final vote represented approval from more than 80% of the House — well above the two-thirds support required to override a potential veto. A total of 140 Republicans joined 195 Democrats to back the bill, which now goes to the Senate.Wyoming Rep. Liz Cheney, a member of the House Republican leadership, urged Trump not to follow through on his veto threat, but added that if he does veto it, “We should override.’‘If Trump vetoes the bill, “we will come back to vote to override,” said Rep. Adam Smith, D-Wash., the chairman of the House Armed Services Committee.But with Trump pressuring Republicans to stand with him, it was unclear until the final tally whether the bill would receive the two-thirds support needed to override a veto. The House Freedom Caucus, a bloc of roughly three-dozen conservatives, backed Trump’s position Tuesday and opposed the bill.“We stand with the president,’‘ said Rep. Andy Biggs, R-Ariz., the group’s chairman. “This particular NDAA bill is filled with flaws and problems,’‘ including limitations on troop withdrawals ordered by Trump in Afghanistan and Germany, Biggs said.Smith and other lawmakers noted that many defense programs can only go into effect if the bill is approved, including military construction. The measure guides Pentagon policy and cements decisions about troop levels, new weapons systems and military readiness, military personnel policy and other military goals.Troops should not be “punished” because politicians failed to enact needed legislation to ensure their pay, said Rep. Mac Thornberry of Texas, the top Republican on the Armed Services panel. The $731 billion measure increases hazardous duty pay for overseas deployments and other dangerous job assignments, hikes recruiting and retention bonuses and adjusts housing allowances.The dispute over social media content — a battle cry of conservatives who say the social media giants treat them unfairly — interjects an unrelated but complicated issue into a bill that Congress takes pride in having passed unfailingly for nearly 60 years. It follows Trump’s bid to sabotage the package with an earlier veto threat over Confederate base names.Measures approved by the House and Senate would require the Pentagon to rename bases such as Fort Benning and Fort Hood named for Confederate generals, but Trump opposes the idea and has threatened a veto over it. The fight erupted this summer amid widespread protests over police killings of unarmed Black men and women, and Trump used the debate to try to appeal to white Southern voters nostalgic about the Confederacy.Smith and Thornberry said in a joint statement last week that lawmakers had “toiled through almost 2,200 provisions to reach compromise on important issues affecting our national security and our military.”For 59 straight years, they added, the NDAA has passed because lawmakers and presidents agreed to set aside their own preferences “and put the needs of our military personnel and America’s security first. The time has come to do that again.”The powerful Republican chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, Sen. James Inhofe of Oklahoma, said he had spoken to Trump and explained that the defense bill is not the place for the big tech fight.“I agree with his sentiments — we ought to do away with 230,” Inhofe told reporters. “But you can’t do it in this bill.”Trump’s veto threat in the final months of his administration is his latest attempt to bend the norms. From redirecting money intended for military bases to build the border wall with Mexico to installing acting nominees in administrative positions without Senate confirmation, Trump has chipped away at the legislative branch throughout his term.If he does veto the defense bill, Congress could cut short its Christmas recess to hold override votes, senior House members said.“I think we can override the veto, if in fact he vetoes,’‘ House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, D-Md., said Tuesday before the vote. “I hope he does not veto, I hope he reconsiders. And I think he will get substantial pressure, advice (from Republicans) that, you know, you don’t want to put the defense bill at risk.’‘White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany said Trump’s attempt to pressure Congress on Section 230 was justified.“Twitter has become a publisher, choosing to fact-check content,” she said. “And when you’re a publisher, there are certain responsibilities with that and you should not be immune from liability.”Past presidents have certainly threatened to veto defense bills, which set annual policy with troop levels, equipment priorities, pay raises and other matters.The defense bill is typically a widely bipartisan measure, one of the few areas of common ground. Over the summer, the Senate approved its version, 86-14, while the House similarly passed its effort, with opposition coming mostly from the liberal and conservative flanks.Trump’s allies on Capitol Hill, including House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, have railed against the social media companies, especially during the heated November election. McCarthy, R-Calif., voted for the bill Tuesday but said he would not support overriding the veto.Some Democrats, including Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer, agree the Section 230 provision could be revisited, even as they disagree with Trump’s tactic of attaching it to the defense bill.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-democratic-controlled-house-approves-defense-policy-bill-with-a-veto-proof-margin/story-eeZP8krgjbPTm0YkeCATTI.html

Extending Washington’s continuous support to Hong Kong, Sullivan said that the US stands united against China’s assault on freedom of Hong Kong.“We stand united with our allies and partners against China’s assault on Hong Kong’s freedoms--and to help those persecuted find safe haven,” the tweet read further.This comes after the police arrested eight more activists on Tuesday over a pro-democracy demonstration in July, the latest move by authorities in a relentless crackdown on opposition forces in the region.The arrests have come days after media mogul Jimmy Lai, the founder of the Apple Daily newspaper, on Thursday was reported to have been charged with fraud and then denied bail.In August too, the tycoon was arrested under the national security law.Pro-Beijing administration in recent times has launched a crackdown against pro-democracy activists and politicians, and have several arrests since the passing of security law, which is deemed as draconian by people of Hong Kong and countries like the United States.The United States on Monday slapped sanctions against 14 Chinese officials for undermining the autonomy of Hong Kong.US State Secretary Michael Pompeo, in a statement, said that Beijing’s “unrelenting” assault against Hong Kong’s democratic processes has gutted its Legislative Council, rendering the body a rubber stamp devoid of meaningful opposition.“Today, the Department of State is holding accountable those responsible for these brazen acts. We are designating 14 Vice-Chairpersons of the NPCSC in connection with developing, adopting, or implementing the Law of the People’s Republic of China on Safeguarding National Security in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region,” the statement read.This comes after a number of former pro-democracy lawmakers have been arrested in the month of October over protests after the draconian national security law was imposed on the city by Beijing. The law criminalises secession, subversion and collusion with foreign forces and carries with it strict prison terms. It came into effect from July 1.Several of those disqualified were sitting lawmakers, who were subsequently ejected from the Parliament by Beijing overruling constitutional precedent and bypassing Hong Kong’s courts on November 11, sparking the mass resignation of the entire pro-democratic camp.Several countries have criticised China, with the European Council saying the move to disqualify opposition lawmakers constituted a “further severe blow” to freedom of opinion in the city and “significantly undermines Hong Kong’s autonomy.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-s-aide-deeply-concerned-over-china-s-assault-on-hong-kong/story-a0rWawKzwhE2v2WO7tUKPM.html

The prosecution can also seek to have the person deported from Denmark.The Russian Embassy in Copenhagen identified the suspect as a man and said in a statement that it considers the arrest a mistake and hopes for his acquittal.“We expect the Danish judiciary to take an unbiased approach to the case,” the Embassy said. “We hope that the court will acquit our citizen and set him free.”No date has been set for the criminal case, which is is expected to be held behind closed doors. Denmark’s TV2 broadcaster said the trial would be held in Aalborg, northern Denmark.In 2012, Finnish national Timo Kivimaki who was working with the University of Copenhagen as a researcher, was sentenced to four months in prison for spying on Denmark on behalf of Russia.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/denmark-charges-russian-citizen-with-espionage/story-4RGWzzp9QH0ZaQEbLF2vRK.html
09-12-2020||World||EU wants to boost border security against extremist attacks||The European Commission wants member states to reinforce external border controls and police cooperation to better protect the 27-nation bloc from extremist attacks.As part of its Counter-Terrorism Agenda unveiled Wednesday, the EU’s executive arm said an efficient detection of suspects at the bloc’s borders is crucial to guarantee European citizens’ security.Since the deadly Paris attacks five years ago in which fighters who had returned from Syria were involved, the EU has been repeatedly hit by extremist actions. In 2019, seven jihadist terrorist attacks were carried out in the EU, and twice that number of plots were thwarted by law enforcement.“Member states should urgently complete the modernisation of our external border management within the agreed roadmaps, with the ambition of developing the world’s most modern border management system,” the commission said.Under the Schengen Information System regulations implemented two years ago, national authorities are already required to create alerts related to “terrorist offenses” and member states need to share information with Europol.“Despite the progress made, more work is needed,” said the commission, which plans to strengthen the EU agency for law enforcement with an increased budget and larger competences, including the possibility to issue its own alerts on foreign fighters.The EU’s executive branch also plans to work with member states to improve access to digital evidence and encrypted information used by criminals.The commission estimates that 5,000 EU residents have traveled to Syria and Iraq to join jihadist groups, including 1,500 who are still in the area and could return with plans to hit European targets.“All those entering the EU, citizens or not, must be checked against the relevant databases,” said the commission, which will also propose that individuals who have been denied a firearm for security reason in one EU country can’t apply for a weapon in another member state.In its proposals, the commission urged EU countries to ensure the interoperability of their information systems and to share intelligence on foreign fighters in a bid to carry out efficient, systematic targeted checks.Last month, after France was hit by consecutive attacks in October, French president Emmanuel Macron pleaded in favour of a reform of the Schengen agreement, through which most EU countries abolished their national borders, to reinforce European security. The topic is expected to be discussed during a meeting of EU leaders starting Thursday in Brussels.France has already reintroduced border checks since the Paris attacks and is planning to further reinforce its police and military presence at its own borders. More recently, Austria, Sweden and Denmark also reintroduced reinforced controls, citing security reasons.As part of its strategy to fight radicalisation, the EU’s executive branch also urged member states and EU lawmakers to quickly adopt legislation proposed in 2018 and still being discussed that would ensure that terror content would be removed from the internet within an hour.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/eu-wants-to-boost-border-security-against-extremist-attacks/story-GYgNQxGEtxwWM7imbgEpaP.html

Rehman denied media reports that the PPP was reluctant to resign from parliament. Observers said that the party, which enjoys a majority government in the Sindh province, does not want to leave provincial assemblies or let go of its provincial government.The PML-N, at the same time, has started full scale preparations for a PDM rally in Lahore on Sunday. It is believed that if PDM makes a good show in Lahore, the Imran Khan government will come under pressure to enter talks with opposition party leaders. The PDM has demanded the removal of Khan and holding of general elections. A successful rally in Lahore, the capital of Punjab province, which is the political heartland of Pakistan, could force the army to rethink its strategy about supporting the Khan government and press for changes and compromise, say observers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pak-oppn-lawmakers-to-quit-en-masse-threatens-joint-alliance/story-Er8AXQINqt189YwlT8OiLO.html

The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) issued precautionary advice to the National Health Service (NHS) after two health care staff members experienced allergic reactions.NHS England confirmed that both staff members have a significant history of allergic reactions to the extent that they need to carry an adrenaline auto-injector with them. Shortly after the two staff members were administered with the first dose of Pfizer’s vaccine, they developed symptoms of “anaphylactoid reaction”. They are currently recovering after receiving appropriate treatment, reported the British media.The MHRA has advised that people with such “significant” allergic reactions to medicines, food or vaccines should not get the vaccine jab. Dr June Raine, chief executive of the MHRA, testified to a parliamentary committee on Wednesday, where she acknowledged that the cases of allergic reactions didn’t feature in the extensive clinical trials.“We know from the very extensive clinical trials that this wasn’t a feature. But if we need to strengthen our advice, now that we’ve had this experience in the vulnerable populations – the groups have been selected as a priority – we get that advice to the field immediately,” said Dr Raine.Also Read | UK looking at allergic reaction to Pfizer-BioNTech vaccineOn Tuesday, Britain rolled out the Covid-19 vaccine developed by Pfizer and BioNTech, becoming the first Western nation to start inoculating its general population. Margaret Keenan, a 90-year-old grandmother from Britain, became the first person in the world to receive the Pfizer’s Covid-19 vaccine outside of a trial.The Data Monitoring Committee for the study of phase 3 trial of Pfizer’s vaccine has not reported any serious safety concerns related to the vaccine. It reported some cases of fatigue and headache after the volunteers received the second dose of the vaccine.“The only Grade 3 (severe) solicited adverse events greater than or equal to 2% in frequency after the first or second dose was fatigue at 3.8% and headache at 2.0% following dose 2,” Pfizer had said in a statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-issues-precautionary-advice-on-pfizer-covid-19-vaccine-after-two-allergic-reactions/story-Ijx3aXyDdYmCqD4nfjy3SP.html

Since 2017 many more households, including families with children, have been pushed to the brink,” the JRF’s research said.The foundation defines destitution as when a household cannot afford two or more of the essentials we all need to live, like shelter, food, heating and clothing.According to the report, of the 2.4 million people that experienced destitution at any point during 2019, around 550,000 were children. It also found that one in five destitute people are homeless or suffer from drug and alcohol problems, while some 54 per cent have a chronic health problem or disability.“I’m appalled, I’m ashamed and I’m angry. Nearly 2.5 million people experienced destitution in 2019. That’s more than a 50 per cent increase since 2017. More than half a million children are growing up with the experience of destitution,” JRF director Helen Barnard said in a video published on Twitter in which she called for improving social security, building more social homes and creating better paid, more secure jobs.The study said although destitution has risen sharply across the UK, the highest levels are in northern cities and towns.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/study-finds-over-2-million-uk-families-likely-to-plunge-into-poverty-amid-covid-19-crisis/story-I8p7RLYg8hdxGveyAp94NO.html

09-12-2020||World||Explained: Why did height of Mount Everest change?||The world’s highest mountain is now officially a little higher, and that might not be the end of the story.China and Nepal agreed this week on a new standard height for Mount Everest, the rugged Himalayan peak that straddles their border.As definitive as that sounds, geological changes, the complicated business of measuring a mountain and varying criteria for determining the world’s highest peak will likely ensure the question isn’t settled for good.GEOLOGICAL UPS AND DOWNSThe mountain’s height changes. The movement of tectonic plates can lift it up ever so gradually, while earthquakes can bring it down.The countervailing forces may help maintain a degree of stability over time, said Dang Yamin, a member of a Chinese team that surveyed Everest’s height earlier this year.“Nature tends to strike a balance,” he told the official Xinhua News Agency. As an example, Dang cited a massive 1934 earthquake that wiped out 150 years of steady height increase in a few moments.MEASURING MOUNTAINSThere’s more than one way to measure a mountain.Last year, a Nepalese team set up a satellite navigation marker on Everest’s peak to gauge its exact position via GPS satellites. A Chinese team undertook a similar mission this spring, though it used the Chinese-made Beidou constellation of navigation satellites, along with other equipment.At the same time, Nepalese crews took measurements with modern, laser-equipped versions of instruments called theodolites, first used to gauge the mountain’s height in 1856 by measuring angles using trigonometry.The Nepalese team also used ground penetrating radar to measure the amount of snow and ice that sits on top of its highest rock.AND THE ANSWER IS ...China and Nepal presented a new official figure of 8,848.86 meters (29,031.69 feet) above sea level. The agreement announced Wednesday was heralded as a sign of the growing political, economic and cultural ties between the two countries.The new height is 0.86 meters (more than 2 feet) above the higher of the countries’ two previous figures, that given by Nepal. The two had diverged for year over the mountain’s actual height.Measuring the height above sea level has always been tricky because ocean levels vary considerably depending on tides, magnetism and other factors. Rising sea levels are creating another factor for future measurements.HAWAII’S UNDERWATER GIANTHow high above sea level is just one way of measuring a mountain’s height. One reason Everest wins the prize is that its base sits high up on already lofty foothills.As measured from the Earth’s core, Ecuador’s Mount Chimborazo is the world’s highest, standing more than 2,072 meters (6,800 feet) above Everest. Because the Earth bulges in the middle, mountains along the equator are farther from the core.Measuring from the foot of the mountain to the peak, Hawaii’s Mauna Kea is the tallest. Most of it, however, is under the sea.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/explained-why-did-height-of-mount-everest-change/story-iqqFKZWhCzzRS2Omj92VXI.html
09-12-2020||World||China set to bail out Iraq with multibillion-dollar oil deal||Iraq is poised to sign a multibillion-dollar contract with China ZhenHua Oil Co., a bailout from Beijing for the cash-strapped government which will receive money upfront in exchange for long-term oil supplies.The deal is the latest example of China, via state-controlled trading companies and banks, lending to struggling oil producers such as Angola, Venezuela and Ecuador, with repayment in the form of oil barrels rather than cash. This year’s crash in oil prices has hammered Iraq’s budget and the government has failed to pay teachers and civil servants on time.The Iraqi agency in charge of petroleum exports, SOMO, picked ZhenHua after asking oil traders for bids, according to people familiar with the matter. Cabinet spokesman Hassan Nadhim said on Tuesday there had been “several offers” and they were being studied before Prime Minister Mustafa Al-Kadhimi makes the final decision.Under the terms of a letter SOMO sent last month, the winning bidder will buy 4 million barrels a month, or about 130,000 a day. They will pay upfront for one year of supply, which at current prices would bring in more than $2 billion, according to Bloomberg calculations. The deal runs for five years -- but the upfront payment is only for one year.The deal attracted widespread interest among major oil traders, according to the people. The deadline for the tender was extended from late November to allow companies more time to bid.ZhenHua Oil didn’t reply to an email seeking comment that was sent to its headquarters in Beijing after normal business hours on Tuesday.All major producers have taken a hit from oil’s coronavirus-triggered plunge. But Iraq, where crude accounts for almost all government revenue, is in a worse position than most. Its economy will contract 12% this year, more than that of any other OPEC member under a production quota, according to International Monetary Fund forecasts.Thousands of Iraqis have taken to the streets in recent months to protest about worsening living conditions. The government has struggled to fulfil its commitments to the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, which agreed at the height of the pandemic in April to cut output. Baghdad has pumped above its cap on several occasions, angering OPEC’s de facto leader Saudi Arabia.Rare DealEnergy-rich nations short on revenue have often relied on pre-payment deals to raise money, but Baghdad hasn’t done so until now. The semi-autonomous Kurdistan Regional Government in northern Iraq has used similar contracts in the past, as have Chad and the Republic of Congo.In a pre-payment deal, the oil buyer effectively becomes a lender to the country. The barrels are security for the loan.Iraq’s woes make it harder for the government to raise money more conventionally, such as through the bond market. The country’s dollar yields average 7.5%, one of the highest levels for any sovereign. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said this week that Iraq was among the most vulnerable bond issuers heading into 2021.The pre-payment part of Iraq’s contract is one of the largest in recent history, although less than the record $10 billion that Russia’s state-run Rosneft raised in 2013 from trading houses Vitol Group and Glencore Plc.Besides its size, the Iraqi deal is rare because it allows the winner to ship crude to wherever it wishes for a year. Normally, Middle Eastern crude is sold with strict clauses preventing traders and refiners from re-selling the barrels to different regions.The exclusion of that clause was probably seen as advantageous enough to compensate for the fact the pre-payment money is effectively interest-free for Iraq. A country usually pays a yield for the cash it receives upfront.Revitalize ChinaZhenHua produces and trades oil. The company has played a large role in Beijing’s so-called “going global” policy for energy. It has invested in oil concessions in the United Arab Emirates, Kazakhstan and Myanmar, and trades crude originating from the likes of Kuwait, Brazil and the Republic of Congo.The company was founded in 2003 as a subsidiary of the largest Chinese state-owned defense contractor, known as Norinco. According to its website, ZhenHua trades about 1.3 million barrels a day of oil and finished products.Other major Chinese traders include Unipec, Chinaoil and Sinochem. Shrouded in relative secrecy in the past, these state companies are gaining prominence as China’s oil consumption rises. It’s set to soon overtake the U.S. as the world’s largest crude importer.ZhenHua, meaning “Revitalize China” in Mandarin, started a joint-venture with SOMO to market barrels into China in 2018, though it was later scrapped.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-set-to-bail-out-iraq-with-multibillion-dollar-oil-deal/story-AVA37OYwkRXgqlNMRhr4EK.html
09-12-2020||World||UK looking at allergic reaction to Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine||People with a history of allergic reaction should not have the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, British health officials said on Wednesday, after two individuals who received it on Tuesday showed strong adverse reaction.“We’re looking at two case reports of allergic reactions,’’said Dr June Raine, head of the UK’s medical regulatory agency as she testified on Wednesday to a Parliamentary committee. “We know from the very extensive clinical trials that this wasn’t a feature.”Raine, chief executive of the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) said the new advice is that people with a significant history of allergy to vaccines and drugs should not have the vaccine.Stephen Powis, England’s medical director, said: “As is common with new vaccines the MHRA have advised on a precautionary basis that people with a significant history of allergic reactions do not receive this vaccination after two people with a history of significant allergic reactions responded adversely yesterday. Both are recovering well”.Thousands of people were vaccinated with the vaccine across the UK on Tuesday, with more attending clinics and hospitals on Wednesday. The initial supply of 800,000 doses is to be followed by 4 million more from Belgium before the end of the month.Raine said: “Even last evening we were looking at two case reports of allergic reactions. We know from the very extensive clinical trials that this wasn’t a feature, that if we need to strengthen our advice now that we’ve had this experience in the vulnerable populations - the groups have been selected as a priority - we get that advice to the field immediately”.She said it was possible to approve the vaccine expeditiously because the MHRA adopted a “novel or innovative” regulatory process, known as the rolling review of data from trials.“Normally, all the data on a vaccine’s safety, quality and effectiveness, and all required documentation, must be submitted together to start an evaluation to approve a medicine or a vaccine”.“But in this case, in the case of a rolling review, we reviewed data in packages or tranches as soon as they became available from the ongoing studies, on a staggered basis. By reviewing data as soon as it became available, we could reach an opinion sooner on whether the medicine or the vaccine could be approved.”Raine added that the flexibility and the agility of the clinicians and scientists at the MHRA, coupled with their familiarity with vaccine development and approval, and the access to independent expert advice was key to its ability to progress in the shortest time.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-looking-at-allergic-reaction-to-pfizer-biontech-vaccine/story-mwk3Xklr2kdUKDGUIVuxSL.html
09-12-2020||World||Poles voice fears of ‘Polexit’ as govt defies EU over budget||As the Polish government plays a game of chicken with the European Union over its next long-term budget, some Poles are voicing fears that a drawn-out conflict could put their country on a path toward an eventual departure from the bloc, or “Polexit.”Poland’s conservative government, led by Jaroslaw Kaczynski’s Law and Justice party, denies that it has ever wanted to leave the 27-member bloc and popular support for EU membership runs extremely high.But critics fear the combative tone of Polish leaders — who have recently compared the EU to the Soviet Union and used terms like “political enslavement” to describe Poland’s predicament in the standoff — could create momentum, which if unstopped, could accidently bring the nation to the exit door.The fears are rooted in a threat by the Polish and Hungarian governments to block the EU’s 1.82 trillion-euro ($2.21 trillion) budget for the next seven years, including a coronavirus recovery package. The veto threat comes after other EU members voted to introduce a new rule that would allow the bloc to cut funding to EU nations that violate the rule of law.Both countries, under their nationalist right-wing governments, have eroded judicial and media independence, creating concerns about democratic backsliding.That issue will be debated at a summit of EU leaders on Thursday and Friday.Similar concerns about a “Huxit” are mirrored to a lesser extent in Hungary, where the government has often portrayed the EU in Brussels as a foreign, despotic power that aims to bend Hungary to its will — especially on immigration.In November, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban echoed Polish parallels between the EU and Soviet Union, saying the EU budget’s rule of law conditions resembled the “ideological blackmail” practiced by the USSR.But both Poland and Hungary are so dependent on EU funding — and their populations so favorable toward the freedom it gives their workers to cross borders — that it seems unlikely they would ever truly take the self-defeating step of leaving.Still, Polish critics have been urging the government to chose a more conciliatory path, arguing that if Poland ever finds itself outside the EU, its difficult geographic position in central Europe would leave it vulnerable like Ukraine and Belarus, exposed to the Kremlin’s considerable influence.“Due to its position, Poland cannot be neutral,” Senate Speaker Tomasz Grodzki of the opposition Civic Platform party said in a nationally televised address on Nov. 27 in which he appealed to the government to drop its tough position. “Either it is in the family of Western civilization or among the authoritarian dictatorships of the East.”The ruling party countered that Grodzki has no authority to conduct foreign policy and that his position is harmful because it contradicts the government’s official negotiating position. Both Polish and Hungarian governments argue they are actually the ones upholding rules set out in the EU treaty, which does not contain a mechanism to link funding to rule of law.As the governments in Poland and Hungary dig into their stance, other EU countries have begun considering options that would allow the bloc’s 25 other nations to launch the coronavirus recovery plan without them.The fears of a hypothetical Polexit are fueled by Brexit, Britain’s messy divorce from the EU, which is seen as accidental. It was set in motion when former British Prime Minister David Cameron called for a referendum, actually intending to keep the EU in, but lost the vote.Those who see Polexit as extremely unlikely point to the very different national perceptions of EU membership.For the British, EU membership mainly brought access to a larger market, and with that came regulations and costs deemed burdensome by many.But for Poles, joining the EU in 2004 — five years after joining NATO — ushered them fully into the Western fold after decades of Soviet-imposed authoritarian rule. It also opened up enormous opportunities for Polish workers to earn higher wages abroad.“Our emotional attachment is stronger than in the UK,” said Piotr Buras, director of the Warsaw office of the European Council on Foreign Relations.If the Polish government would ever decide to leave the EU for ideological and political reasons, it would essentially mark the rejection of the Western democratic model of society and politics, he said.“I cannot imagine Poland outside of the European Union remaining a democratic and liberal country,” Buras said. But he also argued that “Poles would never tolerate a government that would basically decide to leave the European Union in order to stay in power.”Warsaw stands to lose billions of euros if it is bypassed in the coronavirus recovery fund. Also at risk are study abroad plans by Polish students for the next academic year as part of the popular Erasmus exchange program.Poland’s three living former presidents, noting their own long efforts to build a democratic nation, asked the government in a joint appeal this week “to stop blackmailing other European Union countries.”“This is harmful to Poland and its place in a united Europe,” Lech Walesa, Aleksander Kwasniewski and Bronislaw Komorowski wrote.Last week 50 Polish cities turned off lights on key buildings, bridges and other landmarks, symbolically showing the darkness that would come if municipalities are stripped of EU development funds.Grodzki, the Senate speaker, had a warning for the nationalist government.“If you cause Poland to lose gigantic money for further development and reconstruction, if you also lead us out of our European home, history and the people will not forgive you,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/poles-voice-fears-of-polexit-as-govt-defies-eu-over-budget/story-gJyNcPDyLs0t4U5EYSgP5I.html

But some countries such as the United States have not signed up, having secured bilateral deals.COVAX hopes to deliver some 2 billion doses by the end of 2021 but that would still only represent about 20% of the populations of countries that are part of the mechanism.“Nearly 70 poor countries will only be able to vaccinate one in ten people against Covid-19 next year unless urgent action is taken,” Amnesty International said, based on recent calculations.“Updated data shows that rich nations representing just 14% of the world’s population have bought up 53% of all the most promising vaccines so far,” it said.Amnesty said Canada was the country that had bought the most shots when considering the size of its population with enough doses to vaccinate every Canadian five times.The organisation urged support for a proposal made by South Africa and India to the World Trade Organisation Council to waive intellectual property rights for Covid-19 vaccines, tests and treatments.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/amnesty-rich-countries-have-bought-too-many-covid-19-vaccines/story-i2wdw8J1rE1P1hiCa58WxK.html
09-12-2020||World||How the world is preparing for ‘a different Christmas’ during Covid-19 pandemic||Governments and scientists all over the world are mulling over if and how families should celebrate Christmas and New Year while the coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic rages on. Governments fear that relaxing rules and restrictions might usher in another spike in the number of cases when many countries are already witnessing a second wave.After a year of battling losses, families are anxious to get together during the holiday season. The US, which is the worst-hit country, saw increased travelling around thanksgiving, when people decided to travel back home to their families despite experts warning against it. Dr Hans Kluge, regional director of WHO’s Europe office, said on Thursday, “It will be a different Christmas, but that does not mean that it cannot be a merry one”.Here’s a breakdown of the world wide measures announced so far.ItalyItaly approved new restrictions in the end of November with hopes of avoiding a renewed surge of Covid-19 cases around the holiday season. The European country - one of those badly hit by the pandemic, Italy banned midnight mass and halted inter-town movements. Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte urged people on national television to not invite guests over for Christmas celebrations. Between December 1 and January 6, movement between the country’s 20 regions has been limited to emergencies and for work. On Christmas Day and Boxing Day, Italians will not be allowed to leave their respective towns. FranceFrench President Emmanuel Macron has announced that the majority of the lockdown measures will be eased from December 15 for the festive break. Shops, cinemas, and theatres will reopen just in time for Christmas. Domestic travel will be allowed without any restrictions, the nation-wide curfew that is scheduled to come into force on December 15 will be lifted for Christmas Day so people can visit their families. Restaurants, cafes, bars, and nightclubs will be closed for the foreseeable future. Religious service for Christmas will be permitted but with a limit of 30 people.

The UK began vaccinating elderly people and medical workers with a vaccine developed by American drugmaker Pfizer and Germany’s BioNTech on Tuesday, the world’s first rollout of the vaccine.“We’re looking at two case reports of allergic reactions,’’ she said. “We know from the very extensive clinical trials that this wasn’t a feature.”“But If we need to strengthen our advice, now that we have had this experience with the vulnerable populations, the groups who have been selected as a priority, we get that advice to the field immediately,” she said.Raine’s comments came as part of a general discussion of how her agency will continue to monitor people who receive the Pfizer vaccine, which waas authorized for emergency use last week.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-investigates-possible-allergic-reactions-to-covid-19-shot/story-u0acUea6bZGCoFsHJk6JCN.html

Tickets for a 15-minute trip costing 300 euros ($364) are already on sale.Volocopter completed a demonstration flight over Singapore’s Marina Bay area in October last year, and the first commercial route is likely to fly tourists over the same district, offering spectacular views of the skyline, the company said. Later services could including cross-border journeys.Singapore is at the forefront of plans to introduce flying taxis thanks to a more welcoming regulatory regime than in some other countries. While the craft could replace helicopters and light aircraft on some routes, they’d also be small and nimble enough to fly deep within cities and land with minimal space.“Singapore is renowned for its leading role in adapting and living new technologies,” Volocopter Chief Executive Officer Florian Reuter said, adding that local capabilities in battery research, material science and route validation for autonomous operations will be central to the project.Volocopter, which counts computer chip manufacturer Intel Corp. and automakers Daimler AG and Geely as investors, plans to set up a team of 50 pilots, engineers and operations specialists to support the Singapore flights.The craft will initially carry a pilot and one customer, though services could switch to two passengers once approvals for autonomous operation are received. Ticket prices should fall sharply once flights become more widely available, according to Volocopter.Obtaining necessary approvals from the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore and the European Union Aviation Safety Agency will be a prerequisite for flights, the company said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/first-electric-air-taxis-set-to-fly-in-singapore-by-2023/story-UNNcm9M035KBCiG2OPTaKN.html

Nations such as France and the UK, which had harsher lockdowns, are gradually easing measures.While vaccinations will start in the first quarter, she warned that the country won’t be able to carry out enough immunizations over the winter to change the course of the pandemic. The latest incidence rate stands at 149 infections per 100,000 people over the past seven days, nearly three times the government’s target of 50.“What will people say looking back at a once-in-a-century event if we can’t find a solution” for the coming weeks, the visibly emotional chancellor said. “If we have too many contacts before Christmas, and it turns out to be the last Christmas with the grandparents, we will have missed an opportunity.”Germany had record Covid-19 fatalities over the past 24 hours, highlighting the government’s struggles to contain the disease. Some states like Bavaria and Saxony have tightened restrictions, and tougher nationwide measures could come next week.Also Read |  Low carbon recovery from Covid-19 slowdown can solve climate crisis: ReportWith Germany currently holding the European Union presidency, Merkel is battling on multiple fronts.

The German leader will travel to Brussels on Thursday to try to find ways forward.For Germany’s future, she said it’s key to fight the pandemic in order to set the stage for growth and be in a position to return to pre-crisis economic levels in 2022.“We should be careful not to destroy too many human lives and thereby keep the economy running,” Merkel said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/angela-merkel-pleads-for-tougher-covid-curbs-to-fight-stubborn-outbreak/story-EircwAwoZ2NFoXnNVvUfYJ.html
09-12-2020||World||Emissions hit new record, world on track for 3C warming, says UN||Greenhouse gas emissions reached a new high last year, putting the world on track for an average temperature rise of 3 degrees Celsius, a UN report showed on Wednesday.The report by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) - the latest to suggest the world is hurtling toward extreme climate change - follows a year of sobering weather extremes, including rapid ice loss in the Arctic as well as record heat waves and wildfires in Siberia and the US West.On Monday, researchers at Europe’s Copernicus Climate Change Service said last month was the hottest-ever November on record.“The year 2020 is on course to be one of the warmest on record, while wildfires, storms and droughts continue to wreak havoc,” said Inger Andersen, UNEP’s Executive Director.The annual “emissions gap” report measures the gap between anticipated emissions and those consistent with limiting the global temperature rise this century as agreed in the 2015 Paris Agreement.Under the global climate pact, nations have committed to a long-term goal of limiting the average temperature rise to below 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit it even further to 1.5C.Also Read |  UK energy networks given 20% more to spend on net zero goalEmissions have, however, grown by an average 1.4 percent per year since 2010, with a steeper increase of 2.6 percent last year due, partly due to a large increase in forest fires.Total 2019 emissions of carbon dioxide equivalent (GtCO2e) hit a new record of 59.1 gigatonnes.This year, there has been a temporary emissions dip as economies slowed due to the coronavirus pandemic.The resulting drop in travel, industrial activity and electricity generation are likely to work out at a 7% reduction in emissions, the report said. That translates to only a 0.01C reduction in global warming by 2050.Green investment under government stimulus packages to pull economies out of the pandemic-induced slump could cut up to 25% off emissions predicted in 2030.Such packages could put emissions in 2030 at 44 GtCO2e - within the range that gives a 66% chance of holding temperature rises to below 2C, but still insufficient to achieve the 1.5C goal.The United Nations and Britain are holding an online event on Saturday to mark the fifth anniversary of the Paris Agreement, and governments are under pressure to come forward with tougher climate targets before the end of the year.A growing number of countries have committed to net zero emissions by mid-century but these need to be translated into strong near-term policies and action, the UNEP report said.“The levels of ambition in the Paris Agreement still must be roughly tripled for the 2C pathway and increased at least fivefold for the 1.5C pathway,” it added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/emissions-hit-new-record-world-on-track-for-3c-warming-says-un/story-08cm7FyhYjVWC7O0jWj1cI.html

He had originally set a target of 5,000 new infections per day and fewer than 3,000 Covid patients in intensive care before the lockdown could be eased.The numbers in ICU nationwide hover just above 3,000 but are consistently falling. However, the downward trend in infections has flattened, with the number of confirmed new cases rising to above 13,000 on Tuesday.Health officials acknowledge the 5,000 target is almost certainly beyond reach by Dec. 15.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/france-says-will-delay-easing-of-lockdown-if-necessary/story-WaxJv8Mes7oznSxsAitw8I.html

Trump says the result was fraudulent, but no court has found evidence to support his assertions.Last week, a district court in Nevada ruled that the Trump campaign had not proven a claim that there had been a malfunction in voting devices and the contest between Trump and Biden had been manipulated.“We also are not convinced that the district court erred in applying a burden of proof by clear and convincing evidence, as supported by the cases cited in the district court’s order,” Nevada’s Supreme Court said in its judgement.Nevada’s Republican Party said it was “extremely disappointed” by the decision.“We were not afforded an opportunity to write our brief or argue the case in front of the Court,” Nevada’s GOP said in a statement. “Full denial of legitimate due process and appellate rights is truly unprecedented, shocking and extraordinary.”Biden won Nevada by a 33,596-vote margin, giving him the state’s six votes in the Electoral College which choses the president. The electors are scheduled to meet on Dec. 14 to formalize the outcome, with Biden having won 306 votes to 232 for Trump.Tuesday was marked as the so-called safe harbor deadline for states to resolve disputes arising from the election. Under US law, Congress will consider a state’s election result to be “conclusive” if it is finalized by the safe harbor date.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nevada-s-top-court-rejects-trump-campaign-s-appeal-to-overturn-election-results/story-gDrtJvkjYsxiFiMa19w4kN.html

09-12-2020||World||Pakistan lawmakers to resign en masse to paralyse govt: PDM chief Rehman||The political crisis in Pakistan has deepened after an 11-party Opposition alliance announced that their lawmakers will resign en masse by the end of this month from parliament to paralyse the government and force Prime Minister Imran Khan to call early snap polls.The decision was taken after the Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM), an alliance of 11 Opposition parties formed in September this year to overthrow Prime Minister Khan’s government, held a marathon meeting in Islamabad.PDM chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman announced on Tuesday night that a consensus was reached on resigning from parliament.“All lawmakers will submit their resignation letter to their party chiefs by 31st December,” he said, flanked by PML-N leader Maryam Nawaz and PPP chief Bilawal Bhutto Zardari.The exact timing of stomping out of assemblies would be decided later, said Rehman.Soon after the election in 2018, he had urged the Opposition leaders not to take oath to join parliament due to alleged rigging. But his idea was overruled by others, chiefly by the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) and the The Pakistani Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N).It is believed that en masse resignation is the only way to bring the government on its knees and force it to call early elections.The PPP government in the Sindh province was considered as a hurdle as it was not sure if that it would sacrifice its government to help the Opposition alliance.The leaders also agreed to go ahead with a rally in Lahore on December 13 as a show of power to the government. It will be the sixth rally after similar gatherings held in Gujranwala, Karachi, Quetta, Peshawar and Multan.The Opposition parties succeeded in attracting a huge number of people despite hurdles created by the government.Prime Minister Imran Khan rejected the demand to step down or call early elections and consistently advocated that Opposition was protesting to put pressure to stop probes in corruption cases against their leaders.Speaking to a group of senior journalists and columnists on Tuesday, he said that “by-election will be held on the vacant seats” and no concession would be given to the protesting parties.However, experts and Opposition leaders argue that when hundreds of lawmakers resign from the national and provincial assemblies, it would be virtually impossible to avoid general elections.“The government will be forced to call general elections, otherwise the legitimacy of the entire process will be questionable,” said PML-N leader Ahsan Iqbal, warning the more protests would follow in case elections were not held.The Opposition alliance has alleged that Khan was supported in elections by the ‘establishment’ and also failed to run the country and address chronic issues.PML-N chief Nawaz Sharif has directly named Army chief General Qamar Javed Bajwa and ISI head Lt Gen Faiz Hameed for meddling in political affairs.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-lawmakers-to-resign-en-masse-to-paralyse-govt-pdm-chief-rehman/story-QLjDiUakRwuaDMmygA3SYI.html
09-12-2020||World||China using big data to detain Muslim minorities in Xinjiang: Report||The Chinese government is using big data to arbitrarily detain Uyghur Muslims in Xinjiang, a leaked list of more than 2,000 detainees from the province suggests.A new report by the New York-based Human Rights Watch (HRW), which carried the list, says the Integrated Joint Operations Platform (IJOP), a predictive computer programme, analyses data and selects members of minority communities to be detained.“A big data programme for policing in China’s Xinjiang region arbitrarily selects Turkic Muslims for possible detention… A leaked list of over 2,000 detainees from Aksu prefecture provided to HRW is further evidence of China’s use of technology in its repression of the Muslim population,” the report released on Wednesday said.The IJOP programme automatically selects possible detainees for the controversial camps set up in the remote region according to parameters including studying the Koran, wearing religious clothing or travelling internationally.“The Aksu List (from 2018) provides further insights into how China’s brutal repression of Xinjiang’s Turkic Muslims is being turbocharged by technology,” said Maya Wang, a senior China researcher at HRW.“The Chinese government owes answers to the families of those on the list: why were they detained, and where are they now?”“The Aksu list is the first time we have seen the IJOP in action in detaining people,” said Wang.Experts from the UN and human rights advocates have said that at least a million from Muslim Uyghur community have been detained in camps in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region (XUAR).China has denied that Uyghurs were incarcerated in the camps, saying the government had set up vocational training institutes, which were also meant to de-radicalise locals and fight terrorism, separatism and extremism.The inmates have been released from the camps, Beijing has said.Access to the Xinjiang camps is strictly restricted, making it impossible to independently verify whether all the camps have closed.“Xinjiang issues are not about human rights, ethnicity or religion at all, but about combating violence, terrorism and separatism. The series of measures Xinjiang has taken are not only in accordance with China’s laws but are also concrete steps and manifestations of China’s implementation of the international counter-terrorism and de-radicalisation initiatives,” the Chinese foreign ministry had said earlier this year.China, however, has been strongly criticised for its treatment of Muslim minorities in the vast northwestern province.“The mass surveillance and arbitrary detention of Xinjiang’s Turkic Muslims violate fundamental rights under China’s constitution and international human rights law. Article 37 of the constitution states that all arrests must be approved by either the procuratorate (the state prosecution agency) or the courts,” the HRW report added.“‘Predictive policing’ platforms are really just a pseudo-scientific fig leaf for the Chinese government to justify vast repression of Turkic Muslims,” Wang said. “The Chinese government should immediately shut down the IJOP, delete all the data it has collected, and release everyone arbitrarily detained in Xinjiang.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-using-big-data-to-detain-muslim-minorities-in-xinjiang-report/story-qYxaQDzWdo0LbjhyTfYHjP.html

If they do, we will study the data,” EMA’s Executive Director Emer Cooke told Italian daily la Repubblica, when asked about the Chinese and Russian vaccines.China has approved three vaccine candidates developed by Sinovac and state-owned Sinopharm for emergency use.Russia was the first country to grant regulatory approval for a novel coronavirus vaccine, doing so before large-scale trials were complete, stirring concern among scientists and doctors about the safety and efficacy of the shot.The Russian vaccine Sputnik V is being developed by Moscow’s Gamaleya Research Institute and marketed by Russia’s sovereign wealth fund, the Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF).Cooke said the agency was not under any pressure to accelerate procedures to authorise the vaccine developed by Pfizer and BioNTech or one by Moderna .“If anything, the pressure is scientific, because we want to be certain to do what is best for citizens” she said, adding that EMA acted independently.She said the agency was still expecting to complete its review of the Pfizer and BioNTEch vaccine by Dec 29 and to finalise its review of the Moderna vaccine by Jan 12.The European Union Commission authorises vaccines based on EMA’s scientific advice after consultation with the 27 EU states.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russia-china-have-not-sought-ema-s-authorisation-for-covid-19-vaccines/story-ux6n9mfXj6FQmmo62HfKnO.html
09-12-2020||World||AstraZeneca vaccine better at stopping Covid-19 than slowing transmission: Report||A vaccine from the University of Oxford and AstraZeneca Plc shows only a limited ability to stop transmission of the coronavirus despite preventing Covid-19 illness in a majority of those who are infected.As promising vaccine data keeps rolling in, one of the central unanswered questions has been whether inoculations can not only stop people from getting sick but also slow the spread of the virus, a key element for reopening economies.Oxford and Astra are the first vaccine developers to unveil data on asymptomatic infection rates in people who received their shot. Overall, it reduced such transmissions by 27% in a large study, according to peer-reviewed results published in the Lancet medical journal on Tuesday.That’s well below the vaccine’s 70% effectiveness at preventing symptomatic Covid-19 cases overall, though even those results are clouded by questions over its benefits in older recipients.Researchers tested more than 6,000 study participants in the U.K. for Covid-19 infections on a weekly basis and found 29 asymptomatic infections in the vaccinated group. That compared with 40 cases in the control group, which was roughly the same size.Smaller GroupVaccine efficacy against asymptomatic transmission was higher, at 59%, in a smaller group that received a half dose, followed by a full second dose, rather than two full shots. The data support Oxford’s preliminary finding that the low-dose, full-dose regimen appears to elicit a stronger immune response, preventing 90% of infections. Two full doses were only 4% effective against asymptomatic transmission.Although vaccines that prevent illness but not transmission could be widely used and help lower the disease’s death toll, they could also lead to complacency within populations, experts say. Those who are immunized with them could still spread the virus to other, more vulnerable people, including those who’ve yet to receive a shot or can’t get one for medical reasons.Andrew Pollard, the Oxford professor who led the study, called the data “tantalizing” but said it was too early to draw firm conclusions. He said researchers are trying to analyze the amount of virus in the swabs to determine whether vaccination reduced viral loads, which would help limit contagion.“What would be fantastic would be vaccines that prevent transmission so you reach the point where you not only protect the people who are vaccinated but also those who can’t be vaccinated or haven’t been vaccinated yet,” he said in an interview.Similar questions surround other early Covid vaccines, including one from Pfizer Inc. and BioNTech SE that’s been approved in the U.K. -- where the first shots were given Tuesday. It’s possible that shot didn’t work as well at preventing asymptomatic cases as it did at preventing illness, according to a report by staff of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.Pfizer expects to report data on whether or not its vaccine stops transmission of the virus within the first quarter of 2021, Chief Executive Officer Albert Bourla said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/astrazeneca-vaccine-better-at-stopping-covid-19-than-slowing-transmission-report/story-wMC0v2fCW9McifQziPjHgP.html

The original bones are those of a Hoplophoneus -- not technically cats, they are an extinct genus of the Nimravidae family and once stalked the plains of North America.Such extinct predatory mammals are commonly known as sabre-toothed tigers.Also on sale was a Tyrannosaurus Rex tooth which fetched just over $6,000, while a 85-cm long fin from a mosasaur -- a marine reptile that in the Cretaceous period was at the top of the submarine food chain -- was bought for almost $8,000.A 75-million-year-old ammolite -- an opal-like organic gemstone in shades of red and orange -- measuring 40 cm long by 36 cm wide remained unsold because the reserve price was not met.Debate rages as to the right balance between the scientific value of such items and their worth on the open market. Some palaeontologists insist animal or plant fossils are not decorative objects for collectors, but witness to the evolution of life on Earth and therefore scientific articles that ought to be studied and then shared with the public in museums.Before the sale, Swiss collector Yann Cuenin told AFP: “If we’re talking about the sabre-toothed tiger, for example, it’s not a skeleton which is of major scientific interest, in the sense that it’s something which is already known to science. “I am all for museums, but I am also in favour of objects living among us; for there to be collectors, for pieces to be bought and sold -- that’s what brings culture to life.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/sabre-toothed-tiger-skeleton-sells-for-70-000-a-year-after-discovery/story-A0mQgEbZIqDHLtxjnj2EKN.html
09-12-2020||World||Oxford-AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine effective but questions remain for elderly||On the day Britain began immunizing its population with a Covid-19 shot developed by Germany’s BioNTech SE and the US’s Pfizer Inc., a peer-reviewed study of the UK’s homegrown vaccine left some key questions unanswered.Click here for complete coverage of Covid-19While trial results published Tuesday in The Lancet found that a vaccine developed by the University of Oxford and AstraZeneca Plc is safe and effective, more analysis will be needed to see how well it works in people over 55, among those at higher risk from the pandemic.Because older adults were recruited to the studies later than younger ones, “they’ve had less time for cases to accrue in those age groups and for us to be able to measure an efficacy signal,” said Andrew Pollard, lead investigator on the Oxford trial. “The evidence we have so far on the immune response very much suggests that it’s likely to be similar levels of protection across the ages.”UK RolloutThe Pfizer-BioNTech shot, approved in Britain last week, could be cleared in the US as soon as this week and the European Union by the end of the year as governments race to overcome a contagion that has taken more than 1.5 million lives and devastated economies. The Astra-Oxford shot looks less effective than that vaccine and another from Moderna Inc., which each showed 95% efficacy in trials, but is expected to be cheaper and easier to deploy.The Lancet report provides the first peer-reviewed data from any of the leading vaccines.The initial data from Astra and Oxford last month appeared positive but raised concern over how much protection the shot would offer after the trials produced two different results from two dosing regimens. The partners said their vaccine was 90% effective when a half-dose was given before a full-dose booster, and that two full doses showed an efficacy of 62%.It later emerged the lower dose was the result of a manufacturing mistake and only tested in a younger group. Astra Chief Executive Officer Pascal Soriot said in an interview last month the company would set up an additional, probably global, trial to verify the 90% result. On Tuesday, the company said it’s still deciding whether to hold an additional study, while Pollard said Oxford had no plans for an extra UK trial at present. A separate study is underway in the US.No RushWhile the vaccine’s efficacy rate may be enough to get it approved, the variability in different subgroups and lack of data for older people should give regulators pause in rushing this through, according to Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Sam Fazeli.“I would wait until at least the US trial, which is much more tightly controlled in terms of dosing and intervals between doses, reads out before approving the vaccine,” said Fazeli.The US study has recruited 17,000 participants out of its 40,000-person target, and won’t yield initial results until late January or early February, according to Moncef Slaoui, chief scientific officer of the US Operation Warp Speed project. That means a potential emergency-use authorization could come toward the end of February or early March, he said Tuesday.The results published in The Lancet, based on advanced trials of 11,636 people in the UK and Brazil, were reviewed after 131 participants contracted Covid-19. Of those, 30 were in the group that received the vaccine and 101 in the control arm, equating to an efficacy rate of 70%, according to The Lancet data.Also Read | Covishield vaccine trial: Six out of 249 volunteers drop out ahead of second dose in MumbaiWhile the vast majority of 175 severe adverse events were deemed unrelated to the Covid-19 or control shots, one case of the neurological disorder transverse myelitis may be linked to the shot, the paper said.Astra shares were little changed early Wednesday in London.More StudyFurther trials to substantiate the findings and an investigation of efficacy in older adults are needed, Maria Deloria Knoll and Chizoba Wonodi of the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health wrote in an article accompanying the data.The authors noted “limitations” with the results, including less than 4% of participants who were older than 70 years of age, as well as the finding that no participants older than 55 received the mixed-dose regimen. Still, they said that the expected lower price of the vaccine holds promise for lower- and middle-income nations.“Despite the outstanding questions and challenges in delivering these vaccines, it is hard not to be excited about these findings and the existence of three safe and efficacious Covid-19 vaccines,” they wrote.The lack of clarity over the true efficacy of the Astra-Oxford jab and plans for the additional study aren’t expected to hold up regulatory approvals in the UK and European Union, Soriot said last month, with a green light in Britain possible by year-end. US approval won’t come until 2021, after trials there were paused for nearly seven weeks following the incident of suspected transverse myelitis in the UK study. The British trial resumed in less than a week.The Oxford-Astra data will be scrutinized around the world, with many countries counting on the vaccine to protect their populations. It will cost a fraction of the price set by Pfizer and BioNTech, and the shot from Moderna. The Astra vaccine should also be easier to deploy, with storage temperatures of between two and eight degrees Celsius, compared with minus 70 for Pfizer’s shot.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/oxford-astrazeneca-covid-19-vaccine-effective-but-questions-remain-for-elderly/story-C9X7E0KTjuzjvMpLRdDHBO.html

Over 700 million Tweets were sent in 2020 about elections around the world and Donald Trump, Joe Biden, Barack Obama, Narendra Modi and Kamala Harris were among the most Tweeted-about global figures,” read a blog post by Tracy McGraw, Global Head of Consumer Communications for Twitter.According to the blog post, it came as no surprise that the most popular hashtag used by most people this year was none other than #COVID19.Over 68 million people worldwide have been infected by the virus, which include 1.55 million people succumbing to the virus.“Not only was the hashtag (and other variations on it) Tweeted nearly 400 million times, but we also saw the ways in which it changed how we Tweeted about so many other topics.With much of the world staying home more - in fact, #StayHome was the 3rd biggest hashtag of the year - we saw a change in habits through Twitter,” it read further.Meanwhile, the second most-Tweeted hashtag of the year was #BlackLivesMatter due to the killings of George Floyd that sparked protests against police brutality not just in the US but across the world as well.“The world mobilized and amplified the need for equality and social justice following the death of George Floyd, who was the third most-Tweeted-about person globally,” the blog post read. Floyd is also the third on the list when it comes to the most-tweeted-about person on the list.The list of most-tweeted-about people also included former President Barack Obama, rapper Kanye West and deceased basketball legend Kobe Bryant.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-joe-biden-pm-modi-kamala-harris-among-most-tweeted-about-people-in-2020/story-0CirZmnI3XAEx0wusKG71N.html
09-12-2020||World||Singapore ‘cruise-to-nowhere’ turns back after Covid-19 case aboard||A passenger aboard a Royal Caribbean ‘cruise-to-nowhere’ from Singapore has tested positive for Covid-19, forcing around 2,000 guests to be quarantined in their cabins and the Quantum of the Seas ship to return to dock on Wednesday.Singapore has been piloting the trips, which are open only to residents, make no stops and sail in waters just off the city-state.The global cruise industry has taken a major hit from the coronavirus pandemic, with some of the earliest big outbreaks found on cruise ships. In one case in February off the coast of Japan, passengers were stuck for weeks aboard the Diamond Princess with over 700 guests and crew infected. “A guest was feeling unwell and tested positive for Covid-19...We are asking all guests to remain in their state rooms to prevent the spread of illness,” the captain of the Quantum of the Seas told passengers over the tannoy in a video shared on social media. “We kindly ask all guests with urgent medical or health situations like diabetes, heart disease etc to contact guest services,” he said, adding that the ship had returned to Singapore a day before the end of its planned four-day sailing. Confirming the positive test, Royal Caribbean said in a statement that all guests and crew who had close contact with the infected guest have subsequently tested negative for the virus.“Emergency response plans have been activated according to guidelines including immediate isolation of close contacts, contact tracing and deep-cleaning of the ship,” Annie Chang, director of the cruise segment at Singapore Tourism Board said.Passengers will be able to disembark and medical support will be provided if necessary, she added. Royal Caribbean’s ‘cruises-to-nowhere’ from Singapore began last week, marking the firm’s first sailing since it halted its global operations in March due to the pandemic. The cruises are a part of Singapore’s plans to revive its tourism industry that has been battered due to the novel coronavirus, which has infected more than 67.72 million people globally and killed 1,548,575​.Singapore, which has had just over 58,000 cases and 29 deaths, has been reporting less than a handful of local infections in recent weeks. The case on board is another setback for Singapore after a plan to open a quarantine-free air travel bubble with Hong Kong last month was postponed at the eleventh hour.Part of the precautions for the resumption of cruises in Singapore involves pre-departure testing and for guests to carry an electronic contact tracing device and to social distance at all times. The infected case’s close contacts will be placed in quarantine or health surveillance, the Straits Times newspaper reported citing an advisory from the health ministry. Others will need to monitor their health, while continuing regular activities including going to school or work, and undergo a swab test at the end of a 14-day monitoring period.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/singapore-cruise-to-nowhere-turns-back-after-covid-19-case-aboard/story-whqjzvHVpHvAJ6mteMQZQN.html

Notably, the State Department did not accept the recommendation.India has rejected the USCIRF’s observations against the country in its annual report.“We reject the observations on India in the USCIRF Annual Report. Its biased and tendentious comments against India are not new. But on this occasion, its misrepresentation has reached new levels. It has not been able to carry its own Commissioners in its endeavour,” the spokesperson of the Ministry of External Affairs said in New Delhi in April in response to media queries on the observations in the USCIRF Annual Report.“We regard it as an organisation of particular concern and will treat it accordingly,” the spokesperson said.On Tuesday, US Ambassador-at-Large for International Religious Freedom Samuel Brownback defended the action taken against Pakistan.Also Read | US move on UN Iran sanctions faces pushback “(In) Pakistan – a lot of their actions (violations of religious freedom) are done by the government. In India, some of them are done by the government and the law that was passed, and much of it’s communal violence. And then when that takes place, we try to determine whether or not there has been effective police enforcement, judicial action after communal violence takes place,” he told reporters during a conference call.Brownback was responding to a question as to why Pompeo designated Pakistan as a country of particular concern and not India. The top American diplomat said that half of the world’s people that are locked up for apostasy or blasphemy are in Pakistani jails.“We just had really a difficult webinar this morning on forced brides into China, and one of the source places is Pakistan religious minorities, Christians and Hindu women being marketed as concubines or forced brides into China because there’s not effective support, and then there’s discrimination against the religious minorities that make them more vulnerable,” he said.“That doesn’t mean that India doesn’t have problems. … The violence is a problem. We’ll continue to raise those issues, but those are some of the basis as to why Pakistan continues to be on the CPC list and India is not,” Brownback said, adding that he has made several trips to both the countries.There were several recommendations made by the commission that the Secretary did not follow, and this was one of them, Borwnback said when asked why India was not designated as a country of particular concern.“We watch the situation in India very closely. The Secretary’s travelled there multiple times. These issues have been raised in private discussions at the government – high government level, and they will continue to get raised,” he said.“I can’t go into the decision-making process that the Secretary went through. He’s well aware of a lot of the communal violence that’s happening in India; he’s well aware of the statute that has been enacted and the issues associated with the (Narendra) Modi government. And as I said, he’s raised it at the highest levels, but just decided at this point in time not to place them on a CPC or a Special Watch List,” Brownback said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/violation-of-religious-freedom-in-pak-by-govt-in-india-much-of-it-s-communal-violence-us-diplomat/story-UqxpP9k4xhcm101zXRGvLI.html

Volunteers between 18 and 60 years old received two doses of the vaccine over 28 days.The UAE’s Health and Prevention Ministry announced the results via a statement on the state-run WAM news agency, saying they “have reviewed Sinopharm CNBG’s interim analysis of the Phase III trials.”“The analysis shows no serious safety concerns,” the statement said.It wasn’t immediately clear if the announced results included only those taking part in the testing in the UAE or if they also include results from China and elsewhere. The statement described the vaccine as receiving “official registration” without elaborating on what that meant. Emirati officials could not be immediately reached for comment.The Sinopharm vaccine has been approved for emergency use in a few countries and the company is still conducting late-stage clinical trials in 10 countries. Morocco is gearing up for an ambitious Covid-19 vaccination program, aiming to vaccinate 80% of its adults in an operation starting this month that’s relying initially on the Sinopharm vaccine.Sinopharm’s shot relies on a tested technology, using a killed virus to deliver the vaccine, similar to how polio immunizations are made. Leading Western competitors use newer, less-proven technology to target the coronavirus’ spike protein using RNA.Top officials in the UAE, including Dubai’s ruler Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, have publicly receive the shots as part of the vaccine testing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-state-backed-sinopharm-virus-vaccine-has-86-efficacy-says-uae/story-cBHNAAlEtDW4dwJ6eopgrI.html
09-12-2020||World||West has policy to engage India in ‘anti-China games’, says Russian foreign minister Lavrov||Western powers have adopted an “aggressive and devious” policy to engage India “in anti-China games by promoting Indo-Pacific strategies”, Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov has said against the backdrop of the India-China border standoff. Lavrov also accused Western powers of trying to undermine Russia’s “close partnership and privileged relations with India”. The comments, made during the general meeting of the state-run think tank Russian International Affairs Council on Tuesday, reflected Moscow’s traditional suspicion of the Indo-Pacific concept. The remarks are also significant as Russia has been nudging India and China to resolve the border standoff. Criticising Western and European powers for their “notorious concept” of a rules-based order and use of sanctions for alleged chemical and cyber-hacking violations, Lavrov said such moves are made without the involvement of global bodies under the UN. He accused Western powers of presenting their positions and initiatives to the world as the “only correct ones”, saying Russia is convinced it is better to work within global organisations despite existing differences. The West is also trying to restore the unipolar world order but poles such as “Russia and China are unlikely to be subordinate to it”. Lavrov said, “However, India is currently an object of the Western countries’ persistent, aggressive and devious policy as they are trying to engage it in anti-China games by promoting Indo-Pacific strategies, the so-called ‘Quad’ while at the same time, the West is attempting to undermine our close partnership and privileged relations with India.” The “very tough pressure” from the US on India in relation to military-technical cooperation with Russia is part of the efforts to undermine the partnership, he said, without giving details. Lavrov was apparently pointing to the US threat of imposing sanctions on India under the Countering America’s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (CAATSA) for the $5.4-billion deal with Russia for S-400 air defence systems. There was no immediate response from Indian officials to Lavrov’s remarks. In the past, India has said that its relations with Russia are time-tested and unaffected by developments in ties with other partners such as the US. Lavrov also said the US-led West had rejected trends towards the formation of a multi-polar world, sidelined Russia and China and is “trying to draw all others into a unipolar world by any means possible”. Russia, he said, will promote a unifying agenda and the G20 is the “only mechanism outside the UN Security Council where it is still possible to come to terms based on a balance of interests”. This is because the G20 represents the G7 and Brazil-Russia-India-China-South Africa (Brics) and other states that share the philosophy of Brics such as Saudi Arabia, Mexico, Argentina, Indonesia and Egypt, he said. Russia has attempted several times in recent months to push India and China towards a negotiated settlement of the border standoff. In September, Russia hosted in-person meetings of the foreign and defence ministers of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) that facilitated meetings of the Indian and Chinese ministers. Though external affairs minister S Jaishankar and his Chinese counterpart Wang Yi agreed on a road map for disengagement at that meeting, the two sides haven’t been able to move forward with de-escalation efforts on the Line of Actual Control (LAC).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/west-has-policy-to-engage-india-in-anti-china-games-says-russian-foreign-minister-lavrov/story-WbNfR30MEFMeBd3LDibekJ.html
09-12-2020||World||Trump set record sanctions use that Biden is likely to maintain||The Trump administration has imposed sanctions at a record-shattering pace of about three times a day during the president’s time in office: a slew of measures targeting companies, individuals and even oil tankers tied to Iran, North Korea, China, Venezuela and Russia.President-elect Joe Biden’s team is promising a top-to-bottom review of sanctions operations, but don’t expect a significant slowdown on his watch.About seven weeks before the inauguration, Biden’s picks for top administration slots are making clear that economic restrictions on countries will remain an essential tool, even if they don’t like everything about the way Trump used them.Adewale “Wally” Adeyemo, chosen by Biden to be the No. 2 official at Treasury, plans to review how the Terrorism and Financial Intelligence unit, or TFI, at Treasury operates, people familiar with the matter said. That includes an evaluation of current programs, staffing and budgets, according to the people.Yet the conviction that sanctions remain crucial underscores just how central they have become to the way the US conducts foreign policy, using its economic might as much as its military power to get what it wants abroad, even when close allies disagree. And as much as Biden wants to distance himself from Trump’s policies, experts and observers say he is likely to keep up Trump’s aggressive approach.In their determination to push through an “America First” approach to geopolitical crises, Trump’s team innovated new forms of economic coercion, melding run-of-the-mill sanctions designations with tariffs, export controls and secondary sanctions to punish friends and enemies alike.“They’ve used these tools, tariffs, export controls as a one-two-three punch going after folks like China and others,” said Adam Smith, a former senior adviser in the Treasury Department’s sanctions unit and now a partner at Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher.Trump went after NATO ally Turkey over its detention of an American pastor and threatened to punish Germany for the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline.Ignoring the warning that China’s economy was too big, and too closely intertwined with America’s, Trump repeatedly sanctioned Chinese officials and firms, including 14 top legislators on Dec. 7. He blew past warnings that unilateral sanctions against Iran would be ineffective, crippling that country’s economy, without the help of European partners.“We had never seen an administration so creatively use these diverse tools in a seemingly coordinated way,” Smith said.Under Trump, the administration took more than 3,900 distinct sanctions actions, according to data collected by Gibson Dunn, with a surge in 2018, when the administration reintroduced many Iran penalties after it pulled out of the 2015 nuclear deal backed by allies including the UK, France and Germany. No previous administration had exceeded 700 sanctions actions a year.Biden’s team, wary of showing its cards before taking office, has been vague about which of Trump’s sanctions it will keep or lift, though the president-elect called for returning to the Iran nuclear deal, which would require easing sanctions in some fashion. In a CNN article in September, however, Biden said his administration would “continue the use of targeted sanctions against Iran’s human rights abuses, its support for terrorism and ballistic missile program.”“We must also remain laser-focused on the Treasury Department’s critical role protecting our national security,” Adeyemo said when his nomination was announced Dec. 1. “This includes using our sanctions regime to hold bad actors accountable.”One challenge Biden will face is that US sanctions have now become so sprawling and complicated that they’re more difficult to enforce or manage without risking serious blowback on the American economy.“What you’re seeing is multiple major economies targeted with sanctions,” said Justine Walker, head of global sanctions and risk at the Association of Certified Anti-Money Laundering Specialists. “The industry exposure is so much greater, and I think that’s where there’s a potential concern.”Critics argue that the Trump administration has wielded sanctions too bluntly and indiscriminately, using them as a catch-all for any and every foreign policy problem.In addition, Treasury’s sanctions unit has been depleted of key staff, starting at the top. The unit has had no undersecretary since Sigal Mandelker stepped down in October 2019.A number of civil servants have also left the unit during Trump’s tenure, even as the use of the economic measures have increased in sheer volume and sophistication. Adeyemo plans to address staffing issues and consider increasing the unit’s budget, the people said, assuming he’s confirmed by the Senate.Broadly, the incoming Biden team argues that if it uses sanctions, it will do so in concert with others, not against them. Two countries of focus will be Russia, where the new administration may target oligarchs allied with President Vladimir Putin, and China, where the US under Trump has imposed sanctions on its own rather than working with other nations with similar interests.“What I do expect to see is an overarching strategy that does look more toward multilateral alliances and partnerships,” Adam Szubin, a former acting under secretary for terrorism and financial intelligence, said at a National Security Institute conference on Dec 1. “Wherever possible, you’ll see an effort to stand on a united front and call China on its behavior where that’s necessary.”The US approach under Trump was more hostile, with the argument being that companies would fall into line whether they liked it or not because access to the US financial system was too precious to them. Complaints that the overuse of financial sanctions would undermine the dollar’s primacy were quickly dismissed.As Biden prepares to take office, there’s no bigger sanctions target than Iran. According to Secretary of State Michael Pompeo, the US targeted 1,500 people and entities in Iran in 77 separate rounds of sanctions, accounting for almost half of the administration’s sanctions actions.“We have deprived the regime, according to their own words, of some $70 billion for terror,” Pompeo said at a conference last week. “We know our campaign is working because now the Iranians are desperately signaling their willingness to return to the negotiating table to get sanctions relief.”Sanctions experts argue that while the Trump administration’s sanctions were often effective, there were times when they seemed to serve as public relations more than sound economic policy, something they say they don’t expect to see from Biden’s administration.“I don’t think they will be scaling back on sanctions, they will be scaling back on the misuse of sanctions,” said Daniel Fried, a former ambassador, assistant secretary and State Department sanctions coordinator under Democratic and Republican administrations. “Scaling back on use of sanctions as a purely messaging tool or a media-cycle management device -- sanctions because you want to look like you’re being tough.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-set-record-sanctions-use-that-biden-is-likely-to-maintain/story-WsKlzp66IwLzM9qxLC0esN.html
09-12-2020||World||Joe Biden vows 100 million Covid-19 vaccinations in first 100 days||President-elect Joe Biden on Tuesday laid out his plan to fight the coronavirus pandemic during his first 100 days in office, saying his administration would vaccinate 100 million Americans, push to reopen schools and strengthen mask mandates.Biden, who formally introduced his public health team on Tuesday, also announced he would nominate retired Army General Lloyd Austin as the country’s first Black defense secretary.He also picked US Representative Marcia Fudge of Ohio to lead the Housing and Urban Development Department, and Tom Vilsack, the former agriculture secretary, to fill the same role again, according to news reports on Tuesday. At a briefing in Wilmington, Delaware, Biden said he needed Congress to fully fund delivering vaccines to all corners of the United States. Getting children back to school will be a national priority in the first 100 days, Biden said.Also Read | US Supreme Court rejects Pennsylvania Republicans’ attempt to block Biden victory“In 100 days, we can change the course of the disease and change life in America for the better,” said Biden, who takes office on Jan. 20. “Whatever your politics or point of view, mask up for 100 days.”Biden’s first few months will likely be dominated by the pandemic, which is straining hospitals amid a nationwide resurgence.The coronavirus has killed more than 283,000 Americans and caused millions to lose their jobs.Effective vaccines would help the Biden administration turn its focus to healing the ailing US economy. The US Food and Drug Administration released documents on Tuesday raising no new issues about the safety or efficacy of Pfizer Inc’s vaccine, which could receive emergency authorization this month. Biden introduced California Attorney General Xavier Becerra, a Latino former congressman, as his nominee for secretary of health and human services. Becerra has a long record of supporting the Affordable Care Act, better known as Obamacare.PUSHBACK ON PENTAGON PICKBiden picked Austin as defense secretary nominee, despite pushback from some Democrats in Congress unhappy with the idea of a former military man running the Pentagon.“The fact is, Austin’s many strengths and his intimate knowledge of the Department of Defense and our government are uniquely matched to the challenges and crises we face,” Biden wrote in The Atlantic magazine. “He is the person we need in this moment.”The confirmation of Austin, 67, who oversaw US forces in the Middle East under former President Barack Obama, would require Congress to approve a waiver because he has been out of the military fewer than the seven years mandated by a law designed to ensure civilian oversight of the armed forces.Outgoing President Donald Trump’s first defense secretary, former Marine General Jim Mattis, also needed a waiver.At least two Democratic senators, Richard Blumenthal and Jon Tester, expressed opposition to waiving the law, casting doubt on whether Austin’s nomination will pass a closely divided Senate.Fudge will be Biden’s housing and urban development secretary, Politico and Bloomberg News reported, citing unnamed sources. If confirmed, Fudge would face a housing crisis stemming from the pandemic, which has seen millions of people miss rent and mortgage payments because of business shutdowns.Biden has asked Vilsack, who was agriculture secretary during the Obama administration, to return to the position, Axios reported. Vilsack campaigned for Biden in Iowa, where he was governor for two terms, and served as an agricultural policy adviser.The transition team did not immediately comment on the Fudge and Vilsack reports. Earlier on Tuesday, Fudge told reporters she would be honored, but did not confirm she would be nominated.Also Read |  Iran says US sanctions preventing purchases of Covid vaccinesCIVIL RIGHTSThe nominations of Austin and Fudge, who is also Black, add to Biden’s effort to assemble a Cabinet and administration that reflect the country’s diversity. Earlier on Tuesday, Biden met for nearly two hours with leaders of seven leading civil rights organizations who have pressed Biden to select more people of color as his top advisers. Biden won the White House in large part because of support from the nation’s Black community, and the president-elect has made addressing civil rights one of the main pillars of his administration, promising to expand support for Black-owned businesses and reform the justice system. The Rev. Al Sharpton, head of the National Action Network, said he again told Biden to nominate a Black attorney general. “The least we could have is someone with a proven civil rights background,” Sharpton said.Trump has refused to concede his Nov. 3 election defeat, citing unsubstantiated claims of widespread voter fraud. On Tuesday, Texas filed a lawsuit asking the US Supreme Court to throw out the results in four other states in a long-shot bid to reverse the election’s outcome.The Trump campaign and allies have filed numerous lawsuits challenging vote counts in multiple states, with little success. State officials have said there is no evidence of widespread fraud.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-vows-100-million-covid-19-vaccinations-in-first-100-days/story-oaSgR4JELKQncxCEKVlR8O.html
09-12-2020||World||Iraqis slowly rebuild Mosul, with little aid from government||Anan Yasoun rebuilt her home with yellow cement slabs amid the rubble of Mosul, a brightly colored manifestation of resilience in a city that for many remains synonymous with the Islamic State group’s reign of terror.In the three years since Iraqi forces, backed by a US-led coalition, liberated Mosul from the militants, Yasoun painstakingly saved money that her husband earned from carting vegetables in the city. They had just enough to restore the walls of their destroyed home; money for the floors was a gift from her dying father, the roof a loan that is still outstanding.Yasoun didn’t even mind the bright yellow exterior — paint donated by a relative. “I just wanted a house,” said the 40-year-old mother of two.The mounds of debris around her bear witness to the violence Iraq’s second-largest city has endured. From Mosul, IS had proclaimed its caliphate in 2014. Three years later, Iraqi forces backed by a US-led coalition liberated the city in a gruelling battle that killed thousands and left Mosul in ruins.Such resilience is apparent elsewhere in the city, at a time when Baghdad’s cash-strapped government fails to fund reconstruction efforts and IS is becoming more active across the disputed territories of northern Iraq.Life is slowly coming back to Mosul these days: merchants are busy in their shops, local musicians again serenade small, enthralled crowds. At night, the city lights gleam as restaurant patrons spill out onto the streets.The UN has estimated that over 8,000 Mosul homes were destroyed in intense airstrikes to root out IS. The nine-month operation left at least 9,000 dead, according to an AP investigation.Memories of the group’s brutality still haunt locals, who remember a time when the city squares were used for the public beheading of those who dared violate the militants’ rules.The Old City on the west bank of the Tigris River, once the jewel of Mosul, remains in ruins even as newer parts of the city have seen a cautious recovery. The revival, the residents say, is mostly their own doing.“I didn’t see a single dollar from the government,” said Ahmed Sarhan, who runs a family coffee business.Antique coffee pots, called dallahs, line the entrance to his shop, which has been trading coffee for 120 years. An aging mortar and pestle, used by Sarhan’s forefathers to grind beans, sits in his office as evidence of his family’s storied past.“After the liberation, it was complete chaos. No one had any money. The economy was zero,” he said. His business raked in a measly 50,000 Iraqi dinars a day, or around $40. Now, he makes closer to about $2,500.But even as Sarhan and other merchants are starting to see profits — despite the impact of the coronavirus pandemic — ordinary labourers are struggling. Sarhan employs 28 workers, each getting about $8 a day.“It is nothing ... they will never be able to rebuild their homes,” he says.Since the ouster of IS in 2017, the task of rebuilding Mosul has been painfully slow. Delays have been caused by lack of coherent governance at the provincial level; the governor of Nineveh province, which includes Mosul, has been replaced three times since liberation.With no central authority to coordinate, a tangled web of entities overseeing reconstruction work — from the local, provincial and federal government to international organizations and aid groups — has added to the chaos.The government has made progress on larger infrastructure projects and restored basic services to the city, but much remains unfinished.Funds earmarked for reconstruction by the World Bank were diverted to help the federal government fight the coronavirus as state coffers dwindled with plunging oil prices. Meanwhile, at least 16,000 Mosul residents appealed for government cash assistance to rebuild their homes.Only 2,000 received financial assistance, said Zuhair al-Araji, the mayor of Mosul district.“There’s no money,” he said. “They have to rebuild on their own.”Mosul residents eye government policies with suspicion and suspect local officials are too corrupt to help them.“Whatever funds are provided, they will steal it,” said Ammar Mouwfaq, who spent all his savings to re-open his soap shop in the city last year.A photo of his father hangs inside the shop, which he took over in the 1970s. Neat stacks of the region’s famous olive oil soap, imported from the Syrian city of Aleppo, tower above him.“What you see now, I did alone,” he added.On one thoroughfare the ruins of cinemas bombed by IS — the militant group’s strict interpretation of Islam banned such forms of entertainment — are a stark contrast to the shops and restaurants abuzz with customers.The Old City, with its labyrinth of narrow streets dating back to the Middle Ages, now serves as an eerie museum of IS horrors. Misshapen iron rods jut out of what’s left of houses they were designed to fortify. Smashed pieces of alabaster stone and masonry, once extolled by historians for architectural significance, lie among the debris. Signs of a former life — a pair of women’s shoes, a notebook covered in hearts, shells from exploded ammunition — are untouched.“Demolition is forbidden” reads a graffiti written on a slab of wall surrounded by rubble, a testament to Mosul’s unwavering dark humor.The Mosul Museum, where IS militants filmed themselves smashing priceless antiquities to dust, partially re-opened in January. But apart from occasional contemporary art exhibits such as that of Iraqi sculptor Omer Qais last month, there is nothing to see.On the other side of town, Sarhan, the coffee trader, invites anyone who cares to see his collection of antique swords, plates and bowls he painstakingly hunted down.

The platform and the media business could agree on a lump sum or regular payments based on the amount of news content used.Facebook and Google have said they would read details of the draft legislation before commenting.Facebook has previously warned it might block Australian news content rather than pay for it.Google has previously said the proposed laws would result in “dramatically worse Google Search and YouTube,” put free services at risk and could lead to users’ data “being handed over to big news businesses.”The government is concerned that Google was taking 53% of online advertising dollars while Facebook took a 28% share without paying for the news that the platforms share with their users.Michael Miller, executive chairman of News Corp Australia, one of the nation’s largest media organizations, welcomed the legislation on Tuesday as a significant step toward fairness.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/google-and-facebook-risk-big-fines-under-draft-australian-news-law/story-EgsX9U2xCCqC7gYYEfx8jM.html
09-12-2020||World||IIT-Guwahati researchers develop technology to harvest water from air||Researchers at Indian Institute of Technology, Guwahati claimed to have developed a new technology to harvest water from the air by using the concept of hydrophobicity.A team, led by Uttam Manna, Associate Professor of Chemistry, along with his research scholars Kousik Maji, Avijit Das and Manideepa Dhar, published the results of the “path-breaking” work in the journal of Royal Society of Chemistry, IIT-Guwahati said in a release.“Such water-harvesting techniques use the concept of hydrophobicity or water-repelling nature of some materials.The concept of hydrophobicity can be understood by looking at the lotus leaf,” Manna said.The research team from IIT-Guwahati has used the concept of chemically patterned SLIPS for the first time, to effectively harvest water from moist air, he added.“A patterned hydrophilic SLIP was produced by spraying a sponge-like porous polymeric material on top of a simple A4 printer paper. Further, chemically modulated hydrophilic spots were associated on the coating, prior to lubricating with two distinct types of oils.“This surface could harvest water from foggy/water vapour laden air without the need for any cooling arrangement,” the release said.With increasing water scarcity throughout the world, there have been attempts to collect and conserve water through non-traditional means and the IIT-Guwahati scientists have turned to nature to design ways of water harvesting, it said.“We have produced a highly efficient water harvesting interface. The researchers have also compared the performance of their pitcher-plant inspired SLIPS materials to other bio- inspired ideas and have found theirs to be superior in terms of efficiency of water harvesting,” Manna said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/iit-guwahati-researchers-develop-technology-to-harvest-water-from-air/story-uyDdakna9kSYAZeRsHBs9O.html

The party was dissolved hours after Beijing passed a contentious national security law for the city on June 30 amid fears it could be targeted under the legislation.Chow was also arrested in August under the new security legislation on suspicion of “colluding with foreign forces,” but is yet to face any charges.Under the national security law, Beijing punishes what it broadly defines as sedition, secession, terrorism and collusion with foreign forces with up to life in jail.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hong-kong-activist-agnes-chow-denied-bail-after-landmark-sentencing/story-QJscu9SlBv2kK5EqrKR3iO.html
09-12-2020||World||US has privately raised issues with India, says ambassador for religious freedom Sam Brownback||The US administration has raised issues related to religious freedoms in India in private discussions with the government in New Delhi and will continue to raise such matters, US ambassador-at-large for international religious freedom Sam Brownback has said. Brownback made the remarks during a briefing on Tuesday on the designation by the US of China, Pakistan and eight other states as countries of particular concern for systematic violations of religious freedom. He was responding to a question regarding the US Commission for International Religious Freedom’s recommendation for India to be also designated in a similar manner. “There were several recommendations made by the commission that [secretary of state Mike Pompeo] did not follow, and this was one of them. And we watch the situation in India very closely. The secretary has travelled there multiple times. These issues have been raised in private discussions at the government – high government level, and they will continue to get raised,” he said. Also read | How a suspected Chinese spy targeted California politicians for 5 yearsPompeo is “well aware of a lot of the communal violence that’s happening in India” and he is also aware of the Citizen (Amendment) Act and “issues associated with the Modi government”, Brownback said. “And as I said, he has raised it at the highest levels, but just decided at this point in time not to place them on a CPC [country of particular concern] or a special watch list,” he added. There was no immediate response from Indian officials to Brownback’s comments. In the past, India has dismissed criticism of such matters by the US administration and American bodies as interference in the country’s internal matters. Brownback also sought to make a distinction between the situation related to religious freedoms in India and Pakistan, saying the US had extensively reviewed the situation in both countries. “Pakistan – a lot of their actions are done by the government. In India, some of them are done by the government and the law that was passed, and much of it’s communal violence. And then, when that takes place, we try to determine whether or not has there been effective...police enforcement, judicial action after communal violence takes place,” he said. He pointed out that Pakistan accounts for half of the people in prison around the world for apostasy or blasphemy, and problems such as “forced brides” or women from Pakistan’s Christian and Hindu minorities being “marketed as concubines” in China. Besides, there is also discrimination against Pakistan’s religious minorities that makes them more vulnerable, he said. “And that doesn’t mean that India doesn’t have problems. The statute...that was asked about earlier is a problem. The violence is a problem. We’ll continue to raise those issues, but those are some of the basis as to why Pakistan continues to be on the CPC list and India is not,” Brownback said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-has-privately-raised-issues-with-india-says-ambassador-for-religious-freedom-sam-brownback/story-urrj4dOJas8DpPMfeit97J.html
09-12-2020||World||Supreme Court dismisses GOP lawsuit; Biden names Austin as defence secretary||US Supreme Court on Tuesday dismissed a lawsuit filed by President Donald Trump’s Republican allies from Pennsylvania seeking to overturn the election outcome in the state, even as President-elect Joe Biden announced retired Gen Lloyd Austin as his nominee for secretary of defence.Austin will become the first Black person to lead the Pentagon if he is confirmed by Senate. Announcing the nomination, Biden said Austin had shown “exemplary leadership, character, and command”.He also spoke about having worked with the general as vice-president in the Obama administration.Biden also presented his health team to lead his administration’s fight against Covid-19 and announced a three-step drive for his first 100 days in office — to urge everyone to wear masks, ensure the widest distribution of vaccines and safe and secure reopening of schools.Trump’s efforts to overturn his defeat to Biden suffered a severe blow with the nine justices of the Supreme Court, including the three nominated by him, dismissing the lawsuit with a terse one-line order: “The application for injunctive relief presented to Justice (Samuel) Alito and by him referred to the Court is denied.” This was the first case seeking to the dispute the 2020 White House race to reach the highest court of the nation.Biden’s team had no direct response to the order. But Ron Klain, his chief of staff, retweeted a post that summed up the situation succinctly: “Biden won again today so that’s kinda great.”Trump might have hoped for a somewhat different outcome. “Now, let’s see whether or not somebody has the courage, whether it’s a legislator or legislatures, or whether it’s a justice of the Supreme Court, or a number of justices of the Supreme Court — let’s see if they have the courage to do what everybody in this country knows is right,” he had said at a White House event just ahead of the court’s order.Trump’s Republican allies in Texas have also filed a lawsuit in the Supreme Court asking it to declare the election results Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin and Georgia to be declared “unlawful”. The court has asked the four battleground states that the president lost to respond by Thursday.The president is still in no mood to give up yet, but his legal challenges have been futile, as are his political attempts to get state legislatures and Republican legislators to overturn the results. Democrats keeping a count said the president and his allies’ scorecard is one legal victory to 50 defeats. And now Rudolph Giuliani and Jenna Ellis, his lawyers spearheading those legal challenges and the political machinations, have both tested positive for Covid-19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/supreme-court-dismisses-gop-lawsuit-biden-names-austin-as-defence-secretary/story-YPPzx52xVudCdJ7steUtKK.html
09-12-2020||World||White House advised to veto National Defense Authorization Act||The White House Office of Management and Budget in a letter said US President Donald Trump has been advised to veto the revised 2021 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA).“If the conference report to H.R. 6395 were presented to the President, his advisors would recommend he veto it,” the statement said on Tuesday.The House of Representatives is expected to pass the bill later on Tuesday followed by the Senate on Wednesday.Trump is threatening to veto the NDAA because it fails to repeal a 1996 law that gives social media platforms liability protection for third-party posts and freedom to police the content.The Republican incumbent also took to Twitter last week to express displeasure over the bill provisions that would rename monuments and bases that honour Confederate figures. He also opposes language in the bill that would possibly slow down troop reductions.The bill also includes language that would sanctions companies help facilitate the construction of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline project and Turkey over the acquisition of the Russian S-400 air defence system.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/white-house-advised-to-veto-national-defense-authorization-act/story-yU7VMYbtprVhRQNsVSEeFK.html
09-12-2020||World||US Supreme Court rejects Pennsylvania Republicans’ attempt to block Biden victory||As another blow to the legal effort by incumbent United States President Donald Trump and allies to overturn the election, the US Supreme Court on Tuesday rejected a bid by the Pennsylvania Republicans to nullify President-elect Joe Biden’s victory in the state.According to The Hill, the Tuesday order, which was unsigned and included no noted dissents, came ahead of the midnight “safe harbour” deadline, which provides states with a kind of immunity from congressional oversight into the election results that are certified in time.It further reported that the justices’ move leaves intact Pennsylvania Governor Tom Wolf’s certification of Biden’s victory by a margin of more than 81,000 votes.The verdict also represents a “lengthy string” of defeats for Trump’s legal campaign, claiming widespread voter fraud. The incumbent President, in his Tweets, continuously called the election a fraud and claimed that he “won the election, by a lot”.The American daily further reported that one of the plaintiffs in the Supreme Court petition was Republican Representative Mike Kelly.The challengers’ original complaint was filed in the state court last month that sought to strike down “an expanded” mail-in ballot policy that Pennsylvania put in place in 2019 after it was passed by the state’s GOP (Grand Old Party, or the Republican Party)-led legislature.According to an analysis of the Pennsylvania Department of State data by The Philadelphia Inquirer, the former US Vice-President won three out of four mail-in ballots cast in the state.The Pennsylvania Supreme Court rejected the case late last month, citing the litigants’ undue delay in bringing the challenge, prompting the petition to the US Supreme Court. The attorneys argued that the top state court had violated their due process rights and other constitutional guarantees.“No court has ever issued an order nullifying a governor’s certification of presidential election results,” they argued in a brief as quoted by The Hill. “The loss of public trust in our constitutional order resulting in this kind of judicial power would be incalculable.”The court’s denial came just hours after Trump expressed hope that the Supreme Court would embrace his claims of having won the election.“Let’s see whether or not somebody has the courage, whether it’s a legislator or legislatures, or whether it’s a justice of the Supreme Court or a number of justices of the Supreme Court,” Trump said during a coronavirus vaccine summit.He added, “Let’s see if they have the courage to do what everybody in this country knows is right.”Biden is being projected as the winner of the Presidential elections in the US after he clinched the state of Pennsylvania to take him past the required 270 Electoral College-vote mark.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-supreme-court-rejects-pennsylvania-republicans-attempt-to-block-biden-victory/story-6eWX1R4GY0SkXSVFoGDuFN.html
09-12-2020||World||Iran says US sanctions preventing purchases of Covid vaccines||Iran’s attempts to procure vaccines to curb the worst outbreak of coronavirus in the Middle East are being hampered by US sanctions, officials in Tehran said, as it’s unable to utilize a payment system intended to ensure fair global access to the shots.Iran had hoped to deploy funds worth billions of dollars locked up in South Korean won-denominated accounts to help buy vaccines under an agreement reached with Seoul months ago.However on Monday, central bank Governor Abdolnaser Hemmati said US banking sanctions were effectively preventing Tehran from using the COVAX facility that’s jointly managed by Geneva-based Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, and the World Health Organization. Banks were unwilling to process transactions and convert the won into dollars, he said on Instagram.In a statement, a spokesperson for Gavi said there was no “legal barrier” to Iran procuring vaccines through COVAX as the US Treasury’s Office on Foreign Assets Control had issued a license covering coronavirus vaccine procurement.A Million CasesBut an Iranian government official said the OFAC license had little effect. The money would have to be cleared through a US bank in order to be converted into dollars and then into euros before being transferred to COVAX, said the official, who asked not to be named because they are not authorized to speak on the matter.South Korea has told Iran that it can’t provide an assurance the money won’t be seized or blocked when it’s transferred to a US bank, the official said.Gavi didn’t respond to an email requesting further details or an interview about Iran’s access to the facility. US sanctions are meant to exclude purchases of food and medicines.So far, more than a million Iranians have contracted Covid-19 and more than 50,000 have died. Officials say the numbers significantly underestimate the true scale of the outbreak.The Trump administration reimposed sweeping economic sanctions on Iran from 2018 as it sought to force the country into a tougher agreement on its nuclear program and downgrade its presence in the Middle East. President-elect Joe Biden has vowed to re-engage with the Islamic Republic, triggering optimism in Tehran that sanctions could be removed.Iran is preparing to start human trials of its own vaccine, which has been renamed after a top nuclear scientist, Mohsen Fakhrizadeh, assassinated late last month, but at the earliest it will only be available next summer.Earlier Tuesday, the semi-official Mehr news agency removed a report from its website that said Iran’s Health Ministry was in talks with AstraZeneca Plc to secure 20 million doses of a coronavirus vaccine it’s developing with Oxford University.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/iran-says-us-sanctions-preventing-purchases-of-covid-vaccines/story-KgJW166V8XkteQI6xw8QtL.html
09-12-2020||World||Minneapolis eyes deep police cuts after Geroge Floyd’s death||Minneapolis City Council members who tried unsuccessfully to dismantle the police department in response to George Floyd’s death are voting Wednesday on whether to shrink it, a move that could imperil the entire city budget because the mayor is threatening to use his veto to protect public safety amid soaring crime rates.The plan, which supporters call “Safety for All,” is the latest version of the “defund the police” movement that Minneapolis and other cities have considered since Floyd’s May 25 death ignited mass demonstrations against police brutality and a nationwide reckoning with racism.Eleven of the 13 council members have already cast committee votes in favor of the largest parts of the plan, signaling that passage is likely. It would cut nearly $8 million from Mayor Jacob Frey’s $179 million policing budget and redirect it to mental health teams, violence prevention programs and other initiatives.“I am actively considering a veto due to the massive, permanent cut to officer capacity,” Frey said in a statement Monday night. Reducing the authorized size of the force by 138 officers before enacting alternatives is ”irresponsible,” he said.Cities around the US, including Los Angeles, New York City and Portland, Oregon, are shifting funds from police departments to social services programs in an effort to provide new solutions for problems traditionally handled by police. Such cuts have led some departments to lay off officers, cancel recruiting classes or retreat from hiring goals.In Minneapolis, violent crime rates have surged since the death of Floyd, a Black man who was handcuffed and pleading for air for several minutes while Derek Chauvin, a white former officer, pressed his knee against his neck. Chauvin and three others were charged in Floyd’s death and are expected to stand trial in March.Police have recorded 532 gunshot victims this year as of last Thursday, more than double the same period a year ago. Carjackings have also spiked to 375 so far this year, up 331% from the same period last year. Violent crimes have topped 5,100, compared with just over 4,000 for the same period in 2019.“This summer happened because George Floyd was murdered by the Minneapolis Police Department and it wasn’t an accident, it’s because the system of policing we know now is not just racist, but it doesn’t create safety for all,” said Oluchi Omeoga, a cofounder of Black Visions, which supports “Safety for All” as a step toward more transformational change.Due to austerity forced by the coronavirus pandemic, the mayor’s proposal already bakes in a $14 million cut to the department compared with its original 2020 budget, mostly through attrition. Frey aims to hold the number of sworn officers around 770 through 2021 with hopes of eventually increasing the force to 888. “Safety for All” would cap the number at 750 by 2022. The department is already down by about 120 — partly due to officers claiming post-traumatic stress disorder from a summer of unrest — with more preparing to leave amid retirements and poor morale.Passions ran hot on both sides as more than 400 citizens signed up to speak during a marathon hearing last week that ran into the early hours Thursday, with many expressing alarm that the council was even contemplating cuts.“I think we need to make bold decisions on a path forward,” said Council Member Steve Fletcher, a coauthor of the proposal. While acknowledging that it would mean fewer officers, he defended the plan by saying it would reduce the department’s workload by shifting 911 calls away from armed officers to other specialists such as mental health professionals.“Combined those investments add up to a safer city for everybody and an approach that creates a more sustainable public safety system for our city,” Fletcher said in an interview.On the other side are those like Frey and Police Chief Medaria Arradondo who say there’s no need for an either-or decision — that it’s possible to reform policing without cutting officers. The mayor and 12 of the 13 council members are Democrats; one council member is from the Green Party.If the council approves the plan Wednesday night, Frey would have five days to veto if he chooses. The council could override him with a two-thirds majority, or nine council members.A proposal over the summer to dismantle the department and replace it with a “Department of Community Safety and Violence Prevention” initially had support from a majority of the council but faltered when a separate city commission voted against putting it on the November ballot. The city was paying $4,500 a day at one point for private security for three council members who reported getting threats after supporting defunding.Bill Rodriguez of Minneapolis, part of a community group called Safety Now Minneapolis that formed recently in response to rising crime, said his group supports police reform by funding many of the programs the council wants to fund: expanding violence prevention programs, programs aimed at intervening safely with people suffering mental health issues and finding ways to respond to some 911 incidents without police officers.But he said cutting police officers is a bad idea and was sharply critical of council members who he said “can’t get beyond” their vow this summer to abolish or defund police.“They are hell-bent on their agenda,” Rodriguez said. “Everything they do has that taste on it. ... They’re still making this up as they go along. We’ve got a City Council being run by a bunch of inexperienced activists who have never run anything in their lives.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/minneapolis-eyes-deep-police-cuts-after-geroge-floyd-s-death/story-IjxFHSSDo3tohhSG5qrU5I.html
09-12-2020||World||Joe Biden’s attorney general search is focused on Jones, Garland||Alabama Sen. Doug Jones and federal appeals court judge Merrick Garland are emerging as the leading contenders to be nominated as President-elect Joe Biden’s attorney general, three people familiar with the matter told The Associated Press.A decision hasn’t been finalized and the dynamics could shift in the coming days as Biden builds out his Cabinet with an eye to ensuring diverse leadership in the top ranks of his administration.But Jones, who lost reelection last month, and Garland, whose Supreme Court nomination was snubbed by Republicans, appear increasingly well positioned ahead of other rivals. Democrats are particularly concerned about the prospect of Biden nominating former Deputy Attorney General Sally Yates, fearing she could face a difficult confirmation in the Senate because of her role in issues related to the Russia investigation.Biden’s thinking was described by people with knowledge of the presidential transition’s internal thinking who were not authorized to speak publicly. Andrew Bates, a representative for the transition, did not comment for this story.The president-elect is facing pressure to ensure that Black and Latino leaders are prominently positioned in his administration. He selected retired Army Gen. Lloyd Austin this week to become the first Black secretary of defense.Also Read |  ‘Highest stock markets, best employment’: Trump hopeful of continuing as US prezJones, who is white, has had a long-standing personal relationship with Biden dating back to Biden’s first presidential campaign in 1988. The former US attorney prosecuted members of the Ku Klux Klan who were responsible for a 1963 church bombing in Birmingham, Alabama, and later served as the US attorney there from 1997 until 2001.Biden met with civil rights activists on Tuesday to discuss diversity in his Cabinet. The Rev. Al Sharpton, who attended the meeting, encouraged Biden to select a Black attorney general but gave him room to select someone of another race as long as they had a background in civil rights.“I said the least we could have is someone that has a proven civil rights background that’s someone that’s going to handle this heightened racist bigoted atmosphere,” Sharpton told reporters.It’s unclear whether Garland would fit that standard as easily. He is an experienced judge with a reputation for moderation who held senior positions at the Justice Department decades ago, including as a supervisor of the prosecution of the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing.Garland was put forward by President Barack Obama for a seat on the Supreme Court in 2016 following the death of Justice Antonin Scalia, but Republicans refused to hold hearings in the final year of Obama’s term. The vacancy was later filled by Justice Neil Gorsuch during the Trump administration.The incoming attorney general would inherit a Justice Department that has endured a tumultuous four years and would likely need to focus on not only civil rights issues and an overhaul of national policing policies after months of mass protests over the deaths of Black Americans at the hand of law enforcement, but also on concerns from Democrats about politicization of the department in the Trump administration.Biden has said he will not be involved in Justice Department investigative decisions even as some Democrats have openly wished for probes into President Donald Trump and his associates after he leaves office.Supporters of Yates view her nearly 30-year Justice Department career in both Democratic and Republican administrations, and experience ranging from civil rights cases to national security matters, as making her uniquely qualified to lead the department as it looks to move on from the Trump era.Still, Republican senators would be likely to focus a Yates confirmation hearing on her final year at the department, when the FBI closed out the Hillary Clinton email investigation and opened an investigation into whether the Trump campaign was coordinating with Russia, which later morphed into special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation.Yates has repeatedly discussed both, including before the Senate committee that has oversight of the confirmation process. She has made clear that she disagreed with the way the FBI conducted some of the most heavily scrutinized actions of both investigations, including the decision to hold a press conference about the Clinton probe and then to alert Congress days before the election that it had been reopened.Also Read |  Joe Biden taps General Lloyd Austin as first black Pentagon chiefEven so, Republicans would nonetheless press Yates on problems with the Russia probe that were revealed by a Justice Department inspector general investigation, including errors and omissions in applications to surveil a former Trump campaign aide, and about how she would handle a special counsel inquiry focused on the FBI’s actions in that case.Yates has said that she would not have signed off on the surveillance had she known of the problems in the applications. But the appointment of John Durham as a special counsel to review the Russia probe suggests the inquiry is likely to endure into the Biden administration, creating a backward-looking focus for a new attorney general just as Yates would try to turn the page from the issue.Jones would not comment Tuesday on the possibility of a nomination as attorney general.“They have a process and we’ll let that process play,” he told reporters on Capitol Hill.The Biden team has also been considering a number of other potential candidates for the post, including former Justice Department official Lisa Monaco.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-s-attorney-general-search-is-focused-on-jones-garland/story-SJLAWKY7pAV4Y4NedK86FP.html
09-12-2020||World||Joe Biden vows 100 million Covid-19 vaccinations in first 100 days of administration||US President-elect Joe Biden has said that in the first 100 days of his administration, he would mandate everyone to wear a mask, ensure 100 million Covid-19 vaccinations and reopen the majority of schools as he assured Americans that his “crisis-tested” team of experts will deliver better healthcare and revive the economy. The US is in the midst of a deadly pandemic that has infected almost 15 million Americans and killed 286,000. Globally, there are 68.2 million Covid-19 cases and the pandemic has claimed more than 1.5 million lives. Announcing his national health team, Biden asked the Trump administration to act now to purchase the doses it has negotiated with Pfizer and Moderna and to work swiftly to scale manufacturing for the US population and the world. “This can be fixed. If it does, my team will be able to get at least 100 million vaccinations done in my first 100 days. Third, it should be a national priority to get our kids back into school and keep them in school,” he said on Tuesday. “If Congress provides the funding we need to protect students, educators, and staff, and if states and cities put strong public health measures in place that we all follow, then my team will work to see that the majority of our schools can be opened by the end of my first 100 days. That’s right, we will look to have most of the schools open in 100 days if Congress provides the funding we need,” he added. He said masking, vaccinations and reopening school were three key goals for his first 100 days. “But we will still have much to do in the year ahead. And sadly, much difficulty, too. We will be far, far from done. Yet, it is possible that after 100 days, we will be much further along in the fight against the pandemic,” Biden said. Biden named Xavier Becerra as Secretary of Health and Human Services, Indian-American Dr Vivek Murthy as his Surgeon General. He named Dr Anthony Fauci as Chief Medical Adviser to the President on Covid-19, while Dr Rochelle Walensky has been named as Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; and Dr Marcella Nunez-Smith as Covid-19 Equity Task Force Chair. “It’s a team of world-class experts at the top of their fields. Crisis-tested. Defined by a deep sense of duty, honour, and patriotism. They are ready on Day One to spare no effort and get the pandemic under control, so we can get back to work, back to our lives, and back to our loved ones,” he said. “They will lead the COVID-19 response across our government to accelerate testing, fix our supply chain, and distribute the vaccine. They will work with my economic team — because controlling the pandemic, delivering better health care, and reviving the economy go hand in hand. They will work with my foreign policy and national security team — because we can only beat this virus if we beat it everywhere,” Biden said. Biden announced that in consultation with Dr Fauci, his team has developed the first three objectives and new initiatives that he is asking them to complete during his first 100 days in office. “My first 100 days won’t end COVID-19. I cannot promise that. We did not get into this mess quickly, and it’s going to take time to fix. But I am convinced that in 100 days we can change the course of the disease and change life in America for the better,” he said. “First, my-100 day masking plan. It starts with my signing an order on Day One to require masks where I can — like federal buildings and interstate travel on planes, trains, and buses,” he said. “Second, this team will help get at least 100 million COVID-19 vaccine shots into the arms of Americans in 100 days. We will follow the guidance of scientists and get vaccines to those most at-risk. That includes health care personnel and people in long-term care; and, as soon as possible, that will include educators,” he said. Biden said it will be the most efficient mass vaccination plan in US history. “I credit everyone who has gotten us to this point, but developing the vaccine is one herculean task. Distributing it is another. And vaccines in a vial only work if they are injected into the arms of people, especially those most at risk,” said the president-elect. “We are going to require masks wherever possible, but this goes beyond government action. And so, as a new President, I’m going to speak directly to the American people. We need your help.

She added that the North has been unresponsive to South Korea’s offer for cooperation to jointly tackle the pandemic.The North Korean leader’s sister, Kim Yo Jong, responded in a statement carried by state media.“It can be seen from the reckless remarks made by her without any consideration of the consequences that she is too eager to further chill the frozen relations between North and South Korea,” she said.“Her real intention is very clear. We will never forget her words and she might have to pay dearly for it,” Kim said.The remarks show how sensitive North Korea is to what it considers any outside attempt to tarnish its image as its guards against the pandemic and the economic fallout.Despite its zero-virus case claim, North Korea’s state media have repeatedly said there is a “maximum emergency” anti-epidemic campaign in which it has closed its international borders, flown out diplomats and isolated residents with suspected symptoms.The North’s border closure with China, it’s biggest trading partner, is wrecking its already fragile economy. The North has admitted it’s facing “multiple crises” due to the pandemic, a spate of natural disasters last summer and persistent US-led sanctions imposed over its nuclear programme.Experts have said a major disease outbreak in North Korea could cause a humanitarian disaster because of its fragile health care system.South Korea’s foreign minister told a forum in Bahrain on Saturday that the pandemic had “made North Korea more North Korea — that is, more closed, very top-down decision-making process where there is very little debate on their measures in dealing with COVID-19”.“They still say they do not have any cases, which is hard to believe,” Kang said. “So, all signs are the regime is very intensely focused on controlling the disease that they say they do not have.” Also this week, US Deputy Secretary of State Stephen Biegun is in Seoul for talks on North Korea and other issues.South Korea’s spy agency recently told lawmakers that Kim Jong Un had ordered diplomats overseas to refrain from any acts that could provoke Washington because it is worried about President-elect Joe Biden’s expected new approach toward North Korea.Some observers say North Korea could still do something provocative to try to draw Biden’s attention and create the need to restart stalled nuclear talks in which it could win concessions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/kim-s-sister-slams-seoul-over-questioning-zero-virus-claim/story-EuJkKkJvPJvTzXiD8W6xpN.html
09-12-2020||World||‘No safety concerns in Pfizer shot’||US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) said on Tuesday that the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine is 95% protective against Covid-19.The FDA review comes before a Thursday meeting where independent experts will scrutinise the data and vote on whether to recommend use of the vaccine. The vote isn’t binding but the FDA usually follows the group’s guidance. A US decision to allow use of the vaccine is expected within days.The review also said that, while the vaccine prevents symptomatic cases, it’s not clear if it keeps the disease from being transmitted. That highlights a major unknown: How effective they’ll be in stemming the spread of coronavirus at a population level. Data from 38,000 US trial participants “suggest a favourable safety profile, with no specific safety concerns identified that would preclude issuance” of emergency use nod, the review said.Meanwhile the UK, which on Tuesday started its vaccination drive, is planning to test the Pfizer shot in combination with another jab from AstraZeneca and Oxford University. Studies aimed at determining if using the two vaccines together can enhance immunity are planned for next year, said the UK Vaccine Taskforce. The group disclosed the plans as it published a report on its work so far, including deals for 357 million doses from seven makers and investments in three sites to expand the nation’s manufacturing capacity.Approval for the Oxford shot is likely by year-end, setting the stage for the combination trials, which will involve initial shots from one vaccine, followed by a booster jab from the other.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/no-safety-concerns-in-pfizer-shot/story-arnWECqdLRya7U4oyWuQVL.html

The US tech giant said it’s set to roll out the anti-tracking feature next year and warned it could kick apps off its widely used App Store if they don’t obey its requirements. Called App Tracking Transparency, it will require apps to clearly ask for users’ permission before tracking them. It was due to be launched this year but was delayed to allow developers more time to make changes. “Its aim is to empower our users to decide when or if they want to allow an app to track them in a way that could be shared across other companies’ apps or websites,” Senior Vice President of Software Engineering Craig Federighi said. “Developers who fail to meet the standard can have their apps taken down from the app store,” Federighi said in an online keynote speech to the European Data Protection and Privacy Conference. Privacy campaigners say the move is a vital step that could strengthen respect for privacy but tech rivals like Facebook that make money from digital advertising that tracks users have pushed back against the measure. Federighi said tech users should be empowered to have more control of their data and dismissed arguments from advertisers and tech companies who say the anti-tracking feature will hurt the online ad industry. “When invasive tracking is your business model, you tend not to welcome transparency and customer choice.” In a separate policy update, apps in the App Store will soon start giving users more details about the personal data they use, Britain’s competition watchdog said. Each app’s listing will highlight key information about the data collected and a summary of its privacy policy. The changes, which were announced earlier this year, will take effect shortly for users worldwide, though a specific date wasn’t given. The UK’s Competition and Markets Authority said it worked with counterparts in the Netherlands and Norway to push for the changes, based on concern users were not being told clearly whether their data was being shared with third parties.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/apple-to-tighten-app-privacy-remove-apps-that-don-t-comply/story-qFtvltjYriUXSkgHJyxyZO.html

Bourla said he understood the concerns around the speed at which the vaccines had been developed. “Always there are people who are sceptical about vaccines, but I have to say they are wrong,” he said.“I can imagine that in this case, because the products, the vaccines or the medicines are developed very fast that it is even worse because it has been severely politicised, particularly in the US.“That makes people confused. They don’t know who to believe and what to believe, because the discussion was happening on political rather than on scientific terms.”But he stressed that the companies were intent on ensuring that only safe and effective vaccines make it to market, and “the regulators are very careful.”For those wary of getting a jab, Bourla said: “I understand their concerns, but they need to think twice.“The decision to vaccinate, or not, is not affecting only your health. It is affecting the health of others, and likely the health of people you love,” he said.“If you don’t vaccinate you are becoming the weak link that will allow the virus to replicate.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/on-covid-19-vaccine-testing-pfizer-chief-insists-we-didn-t-cut-any-corners/story-UyxNedzPFvPH2tr8N12HKP.html

It’s also a reminder that we must be vigilant the rest of the day,” Cooper said. Meanwhile, Washington Governor Jay Inslee announced a three-week extension of the state’s current restrictions on Tuesday, which include bans on indoor dining and social gatherings, CNN reported.“This is because we remain concerned about COVID activity and we still do not have a clear picture of the situation following the Thanksgiving weekend,” Inslee said at a news conference.Meanwhile, California recorded over 20,000 deaths as result of Covid-19 infections.The state’s Department of Public Health added 112 fatalities Tuesday, bringing the total to 20,047since the pandemic hit the Golden State, according to CNN.The United States currently has 15,087,418 COVID-19 infections, along with 285,518 deaths.

He is well-known both to Biden and farm groups, having spent eight years as agriculture secretary, Barack Obama’s longest-serving cabinet member.Biden chose Vilsack as he tries to build support among constituencies that favored Trump, especially in rural America.Biden settled on Vilsack after also considering Ohio Representative Marcia Fudge, whose case had been pressed by a key ally, Representative James Clyburn of South Carolina.Fudge will be nominated instead to lead the Department of Housing and Urban Development, a person familiar with the transition said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-picks-tom-vilsack-to-reprise-role-as-agriculture-secretary/story-K1xHegRFahVT9puNDFlE1H.html

09-12-2020||World||Pfizer vaccine moves closer to getting the OK in US||US regulators has released their first scientific evaluation of Pfizer’s Covid-19 vaccine and confirmed it offers strong protection, setting the stage for the government to green light the biggest vaccination effort in the nation’s history.The analysis by Food and Drug Administration scientists on Tuesday comes ahead of a Thursday meeting where the agency’s independent advisers will debate if the evidence is strong enough to recommend vaccinating millions of Americans. A final FDA decision and the first shots could follow within just days.They are among a whirlwind of developments that are expected to make multiple vaccines available by early next year, in the US and beyond.Britain on Tuesday began vaccinations with the shot made by Pfizer and German partner BioNTech. The FDA later this month will consider one developed by Moderna. Also Tuesday, a medical journal published early data suggesting a third vaccine candidate, AstraZeneca’s, also protects people, though not as much as the two other frontrunners.The vaccines emerged from an all-out worldwide race and are reaching the market less than a year after the virus was even identified — a remarkable scientific achievement that shaved years off the usual process.The encouraging developments come as the coronavirus continues surging across much of the world. The scourge has claimed more than 1.5 million lives, including over 285,000 in the US, the highest toll of any country.FDA scientists reanalyzed data from Pfizer’s huge, still-unfinished study and found that so far, the vaccine appears safe and more than 90% effective across patients of different ages, races and underlying health conditions. The FDA specifically confirmed it works well in older people, who are especially vulnerable to the virus.Thursday’s public meeting will be closely watched by health authorities around the world and is considered key to bolstering confidence in the shots amid scepticism about vaccine safety among many Americans.“We want people to see this discussion, to see the issues that are brought up, and have a vigorous discussion of the data elements by the outside experts,” FDA Commissioner Stephen Hahn said in an interview. “That will be an important part of showing what goes into our decision making.” The FDA is expected to follow its committee’s advice, and first in line once vaccinations begin would be health care workers and nursing home residents.Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla declined to predict how quickly FDA might issue a decision.“They need to take as much time as they need to feel comfortable. It’s very important for the trust of the vaccine from the people,” he said.Pfizer and BioNTech previously reported the shots appeared 95% effective at preventing mild to severe COVID-19 disease, based on the first 170 infections confirmed after participants’ second dose. Only eight of the infections were among volunteers who had been given the real vaccine; the rest were among those who had gotten a dummy shot.Moderna has reported nearly identical protection in tests of its vaccine, which was developed with the US National Institutes of Health.A third option, from AstraZeneca and Oxford University, appears safe and about 70% effective, according to early test results from Britain and Brazil. But that report, in the medical journal Lancet, showed that questions remain about how well it helps protect those over 55.Still, British regulators are considering emergency use of that vaccine, too, and if it pans out, it could become the vaccine of choice in the developing world because it doesn’t need to be kept in the deep freeze like Pfizer’s formula.A big question for all the coming vaccines is how long protection lasts.FDA said partial protection appears two weeks after the first dose of the Pfizer shot, and greater protection seems to last at least two months after the second and final dose.As for safety, the FDA found no serious side effects among the more than 37,000 volunteers who have been tracked for at least two months after their last dose, the period when vaccination problems typically appear.The main side effects were injection-site pain or flu-like reactions that tend to last a day or two: More than half of adults under 55 experienced fatigue or headache, about a third reported chills or muscle pain, and 16% had a fever. Older adults were less likely to experience those reactions.Once mass vaccinations get underway, the government intends to conduct unprecedented monitoring of recipients to watch for any side effects that didn’t show up during testing. Even studies of tens of thousands of people can’t spot a complication that strikes, say, 1 in a million.Among the additional questions ahead of Thursday’s meeting: Were the shots adequately tested in Black, Hispanic and other communities hard hit by the pandemic? Does the vaccine protect against infection with no symptoms, or could the vaccinated still unknowingly spread the virus? What should pregnant women be told about vaccination, since they weren’t tested in Pfizer’s study? Studies in children as young as 12 are just beginning.Answering some of those questions may require keeping Pfizer’s 44,000-person study going even after vaccinations begin. Health authorities are wrestling with how to do so in a way that’s fair to participants who got a dummy shot but would want the real thing now.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pfizer-vaccine-moves-closer-to-getting-the-ok-in-us/story-SHisUXPw279zfx4Hwl3FNN.html
09-12-2020||World||Joe Biden taps General Lloyd Austin as first black Pentagon chief||US President-elect Joe Biden named retired army general Lloyd Austin on Tuesday to be secretary of defence, who if confirmed will become the first African-American to lead the Pentagon.“Throughout his lifetime of dedicated service -- and in the many hours we’ve spent together in the White House Situation Room and with our troops overseas -- General Austin has demonstrated exemplary leadership, character, and command,” Biden said in a statement.“He is uniquely qualified to take on the challenges and crises we face in the current moment.”The four-star general was the US commander in Iraq and then the head of the US Central Command covering over all of the Middle East in 2010 to 2016 when Biden was vice president.But he was a surprise choice for secretary of defence, bypassing a highly qualified former senior Pentagon civilian official, Michele Flournoy.By choosing Austin, Biden will have to persuade the US Senate to waive a law that says the US military must be led by a civilian or, if a former military official, someone who has been out of the service at least seven years.The law has been waived only twice before, including in 2017, when former general Jim Mattis was made defence secretary under President Donald Trump.The Biden campaign called Austin “a trusted and crisis-tested leader who has overseen some of the most complex and impactful operations in the history of the armed services,” citing the campaign against the Islamic State group and the withdrawal of nearly 150,000 military personnel from Iraq before that.“I look forward to once again working closely with him as a trusted partner to lead our military with dignity and resolve, revitalize our alliances in the face of global threats, and ensure the safety and security of the American people,” Biden said in the statement.‘Back on track’In a separate piece in Atlantic magazine explaining why he picked Austin, Biden wrote: “I’ve sought his advice, seen his command, and admired his calm and his character.” He acknowledged the issue of nominating someone recently in military service to helm the department of defence, and said he hoped Congress would grant a waiver and that his nomination would be quickly approved.“Austin also knows that the secretary of defence has a different set of responsibilities than a general officer and that the civil-military dynamic has been under great stress these past four years,” Biden wrote.“He will work tirelessly to get it back on track.”Austin spent four decades in the army, graduating from West Point Military Academy and following a career with a wide range of assignments, from leading platoons to running logistics groups and overseeing recruiting, to senior Pentagon jobs.In March 2003, he was the assistant division commander of the 3rd Infantry Division when it marched from Kuwait into Baghdad in the US invasion of Iraq.From late 2003 to 2005, he was in Afghanistan commanding the Combined Joint Task Force 180, the principle US-led operation seeking to stabilize the security situation in the country.In 2010, he was made commanding general of US forces in Iraq, and two years later became the commander of the Central Command, in charge of all Pentagon operations in the Middle East and Afghanistan.That put him in charge of the fight against the Islamic State as it captured large swathes of Iraq and Syria.Since retiring, Austin has been on the board of one of the Pentagon’s largest weapons suppliers, Raytheon, as well as other companies.He also was part of a small group of shareholders in an investment group, Pine Island Capital Partners, that included Biden’s pick for secretary of state, Antony Blinken, and his rival for the Pentagon job, Flournoy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-taps-general-lloyd-austin-as-first-black-pentagon-chief/story-5WkFzp1OuiAFOuSRluPPAP.html
09-12-2020||World||Covid-19 aid in balance as Congress buys time for talks||Top Washington Republicans are convening Tuesday to sort out their end-of-session business on government spending and Covid-19 relief, as they take advantage of an additional week’s time and a moment that’s teed up for potential gridlock-breaking action.Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and White House chief of staff Mark Meadows are meeting by conference call.Already, Capitol Hill leaders are moving a government shutdown deadline to the end of next week, but progress is slow and key decisions are yet to be made. And the negotiating dynamic isn’t entirely clear since there are parallel Covid-19 relief talks among both a group of more pragmatic lawmakers and the battle-scarred congressional leadership.Lawmakers are struggling to figure out how to deliver long-delayed pandemic relief, including additional help for hard-hit businesses, further unemployment benefits, funding to distribute Covid-19 vaccines and funding demanded by Democrats for state and local governments.A flashpoint is a demand by McConnell, R-Ky., to award businesses and universities, among others, a shield against lawsuits for Covid-related negligence. McConnell and business allies like the US Chamber of Commerce say such suits threaten businesses with financial hardships from opportunistic lawsuits.“Contrary to the majority leader’s dire predictions, there has been no flood of Covid lawsuits. In fact, quite the opposite,” said top Senate Democrat Chuck Schumer of New York. “Far from the pandemic of lawsuits, there’s barely been a trickle.”Separately, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Richard Shelby, R-Ala., spoke by phone on Monday to try to kick start talks on a separate $1.4 trillion government-wide spending bill. That measure is held up over issues like the sage grouse, the Census and accounting maneuvers being employed by lawmakers to squeeze $12 billion more into the legislation.Leaders had previously told lawmakers that this week would probably be the last of the session, but talks are going more slowly than hoped and both sides were quick to endorse a stopgap measure that would prevent a government shutdown through Dec. 18.Three main items of legislation are at issue: a defense policy bill that President Donald Trump is threatening to veto; the $1.4 trillion government-wide spending bill; and perhaps $900 billion in long-sought Covid-19 relief.There are two sets of talks on Covid-19 relief — on the leadership level and by a group of Senate moderates — occurring at the same time, and it’s unclear how the negotiators might sort themselves out, lending an air of confusion to the process.The bipartisan Senate group was set to meet again Monday evening. But a long weekend of talks pushed senators apart on one difficult negotiation, the proposed liability protection that has been a priority of McConnell.Republicans initially proposed a sweeping five-year liability shield, retroactive to December 2019, to protect companies and organizations from Covid-19-related lawsuits. Democrats, along with their allies in labor and civil rights groups, roundly dismissed that approach as a danger to workers.Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., said she wants to make sure “we’re not sacrificing the rights of people who have been made sick or killed by their employers with a pro-corporate liability release.”Lawmakers heard from a coalition of 142 labor and civil rights groups urging them to resist granting companies liability for Covid claims.“Any type of immunity would directly harm Black, Latino, and other workers of color who are overrepresented in ‘essential’ and in-person, reopened jobs,” the coalition wrote in a letter to Congress.Negotiators suggested a scaled-back liability shield, but a six-month proposal was panned by Republicans and there is no agreement yet from Democrats. The powerful AFL-CIO said Monday it opposes even a short-term liability provision.It’s clear that McConnell’s Republican majority is demanding the liability protection in exchange for the Democrats’ push for additional money for states and cities battling the Covid-19 crisis.“The leader had made clear that state and local money is tied to liability protection, so there’s either going to be none for both of those or both of those are going to be provided for,” Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, told reporters. “My hope is we’ll do both.”White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow said Monday that Trump is comfortable with a deal along the lines of one being put together by the group of Senate moderates and pragmatists. That $900 billion plan does not include the direct payments sought by Trump before the election.Without another round of fresh aid, after the $1,200 checks sent to Americans in spring, lawmakers on the left and right said they would have trouble backing the package.Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., said last week he would need direct payments for his support, and GOP Sen. Josh Hawley said Monday that he encouraged Trump to reject any package without them.“I urged him to veto,” Hawley said he told the president during a recent phone call.If an agreement isn’t possible on the omnibus bill, lawmakers might have no option but to pass another continuing resolution that would keep the government running on autopilot and permit them to punt the unfinished spending bills into next year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-aid-in-balance-as-congress-buys-time-for-talks/story-31yklqQxo8pYvHmeARProI.html
09-12-2020||World||UN expert demands Julian Assange’s release, 10 years on||A UN rights expert on Tuesday urged Britain to release Julian Assange immediately following a decade of “arbitrary detention”, insisting the WikiLeaks founder should await a decision on extradition to the United States outside prison.The 49-year-old Australian was first arrested 10 years ago on December 7, 2010.He is currently being held in the top-security Belmarsh jail in London awaiting the next hearing, due on January 4, on a US extradition request, in a case seen by his supporters as a cause celebre for media freedom.“The British authorities initially detained Mr. Assange on the basis of an arrest warrant issued by Sweden in connection with allegations of sexual misconduct that have since been formally dropped due to lack of evidence,” said UN human rights expert Nils Melzer.“Today, he is detained for exclusively preventative purposes,” said Melzer, the special rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.“Mr. Assange is not a criminal convict and poses no threat to anyone, so his prolonged solitary confinement in a high-security prison is neither necessary nor proportionate and clearly lacks any legal basis.”UN rights experts do not speak for the United Nations but report their findings to it.Assange faces 18 charges in the United States relating to the 2010 release by WikiLeaks of 500,000 secret files detailing aspects of military campaigns in Afghanistan and Iraq.If convicted in the United States, Assange could be jailed for up to 175 years.‘Severe suffering’In 2012, while on bail, he dodged an extradition attempt by Sweden by claiming political asylum in Ecuador’s embassy in London.He remained in the small diplomatic mission for seven years and the Swedish charges were later dropped.But he was turned over to British police in April 2019 after a change of government in Quito, and jailed for having skipped bail. Washington then served a formal extradition request.Melzer said the “progressively severe suffering inflicted” on Assange “amounts not only to arbitrary detention, but also to torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment”.Melzer said Assange, “who suffers from a pre-existing respiratory health condition”, should be released from prison during the coronavirus pandemic.He said the former computer hacker could potentially be placed under guarded house arrest.“Mr. Assange’s rights have been severely violated for more than a decade,” said Melzer.“He must now be allowed to live a normal family, social and professional life.”Assange should not be extradited to the United States due to serious human rights concerns, the UN expert added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/un-expert-demands-julian-assange-s-release-10-years-on/story-JaOVWS7FR0M43laDTpDvWK.html
09-12-2020||World||Joe Biden diversity push turns tense over unfilled top-tier profiles||President-elect Joe Biden’s early picks for top administration jobs made history for elevating women, people of color and immigrants. But advocates want to see more racial diversity closer to the center of power, putting pressure on Biden as he moves to a new round of selections next week.He is now drawing criticism over the makeup of his inner circle from Black and Latino lawmakers, and groups like the NAACP and UnidosUS are demanding more say on selections. Amid those objections, his transition team slowed its decision on a Defense secretary, and its choice of a health secretary is emerging as a new flashpoint before an announcement as soon as next week.The incoming administration broke major barriers with the selection of Kamala Harris as the first Black and Indian-American woman for vice president, along with two Black women, a Latino immigrant and an Indian-American woman for key economic and national security posts. Yet advocates say those officials won’t be as close to the seat of power as the White people the president-elect chose for key posts -- including Janet Yellen for Treasury Secretary, Antony Blinken for Secretary of State and Ron Klain as chief of staff.“The reality is that there are not enough Black people in his inner circle,” said David Clunie, the executive director of the Black Economic Alliance and a former Obama administration official.Also Read | Biden weighs pick for agriculture chief from diverse slateBiden acknowledged, and even welcomed, the pressure and promised to follow through.“I promise you, it will be the single most diverse cabinet based on race, color, based on gender that’s ever existed in the United States of America,” he said at a Friday press conference. Pressed on whether he’d be choosing people of color to the Defense secretary and attorney general, he declined to say.He said in a CNN interview on Thursday that he was hearing from advocacy groups but recognized “it’s their job to push me.”Latino advocates have been pressing top Biden advisers to choose New Mexico Governor Michelle Lujan Grisham as Health and Human Services secretary after the transition team moved away from her for that position. In response, the Biden camp leaked to reporters that they had picked her for Interior secretary and that she turned them down in the hopes of getting HHS.When the Congressional Hispanic Caucus met with three of Biden’s top advisers on Thursday, members had believed Lujan Grisham was the most likely Latina to get a spot in the Biden cabinet and they publicly expressed dismay at the leaks suggesting she may not get a job at all.“This was to kind of throw her under the bus,” Arizona Representative Raul Grijalva said. During the meeting, “almost all the members commented on that, how they felt that that was a raw deal that the governor got -- that that kind of publicity was meant to undermine any effort of her getting HHS.”Klain and transition co-chairs Ted Kaufman and Jeff Zients told the CHC on Thursday they want Lujan Grisham in the administration, though they didn’t reveal whether she still had a shot at HHS, a Democrat on the call said.The growing concerns over the health-secretary pos reflect the chagrin expressed by Representative James Clyburn of South Carolina and other Black lawmakers over the number of African Americans selected so far for key roles. This week, Biden unveiled his economic team during a press event in Wilmington, Delaware, including four women, one Black man and one White man -- with the cabinet-level jobs all going to women, including Yellen. All spoke of their humble beginnings and pledged to fight to close the wealth gap.Two days later, Biden announced in a written statement the appointment of a White man, Brian Deese, to head the National Economic Council. TIAA Chief Executive Officer Roger Ferguson, who is Black, had also been under consideration for the job. Deese is an executive at BlackRock Inc.Clyburn and other members of the Congressional Black Caucus have made clear their preference for Ohio Representative Marcia Fudge, who is Black, to be Agriculture secretary. The Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus last month wrote to Biden asking him to include Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders in his cabinet.The Biden team slowed its selection process for Defense secretary after Black leaders expressed concerns that Biden might not name an African American to any of the top four cabinet departments -- Defense, Justice, State or Treasury. He had been widely expected to tap Michele Flournoy, who is White, to be the first female Pentagon chief, but she wasn’t announced with the rest of his national security team two weeks ago.Two Black candidates, retired four-star General Lloyd Austin and former Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson, have been reported to be among those Biden is now considering to lead the Pentagon, and Johnson has also been discussed as an option for attorney general.Biden also faces pressure for diversity in political ideology. Progressive Democrats have also made clear their opposition to a range of potential picks and nominations, targeting people they see as potentially leading Biden away from his campaign promises to the left.“I don’t envy them,” Janet Murguia, president of UnidosUS, said of the Biden transition team. “This is a very challenging time in terms of meeting the commitments that have to be met.”‘Making Everybody Happy’Murguia, who worked in Bill Clinton’s White House, nevertheless said her expectations were high. “For some of us, we were part of administrations that had at least three or four Hispanics 25 years ago, 30 years ago. So the bar is very high in terms of making everybody happy,” she said. “I know that’s likely not going to be possible. I do understand that. But it also underscores why we have to keep promoting that high-water mark for representation.”Also Read | Joe Biden says jobs report ‘grim,’ relief package needed now and in JanuaryMurguia asked Biden Thursday to meet to “discuss our shared goal of ensuring that government at all levels reflects the diversity of America and works well for all families.”She’s not alone in requesting a session with the president-elect. So have a coalition of Black civil rights groups including the NAACP and the National Urban League, who say they’re concerned about Black representation in key positions and want Biden to make clear that civil rights will be a central issue for his administration.“We want to make sure that issues concerned with civil rights is a top priority. And it’s not secondary and it’s not talking points,” said NAACP President Derrick Johnson, who is scheduled to meet with Biden on Tuesday.But Johnson added that he shouldn’t have had to ask for the meeting.“We shouldn’t have to guess what he’s thinking; it should be a direct line of communication,” he said, pointing out that Biden’s agency review teams include people from business, environmental and labor groups but not civil rights groups.A transition official said Biden’s team has been working with the NAACP Legal Defense Fund, which is independent of the NAACP, and the National Urban League. It’s also in regular contact with the Congressional Black Caucus, which is recommending personnel.Keeping Certain People OutThe advocates also are fighting to keep certain people out of the administration.At the top of their lists is Rahm Emanuel, the former Obama chief of staff and former Chicago mayor who is rumored to be under consideration for Transportation secretary or another post. They say he should be disqualified because of his handling of the response to the 2014 killing in Chicago of Laquan McDonald, an unarmed Black teenager, by a White police officer.“Is that the type of person you would want to have as a part of your legacy?” Johnson said.The transition declined to comment on whether Emanuel is under consideration for an administration job.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-diversity-push-turns-tense-over-unfilled-top-tier-profiles/story-rcwolAqFopVoJQtZ6TqnjO.html
