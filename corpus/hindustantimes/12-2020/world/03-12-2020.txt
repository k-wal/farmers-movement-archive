The House of Representatives had passed its own version of the legislation in 2019. The two bills will now go through a reconciliation process to iron out the differences in the House and Senate versions, and a combined legislation must pass both chambers again before being sent to the White House for the president’s signature and enactment.“Ending nationality discrimination and levelling the playing field for high-skilled applicants, our legislation will keep families together while helping American companies retain top talent. I urge my colleagues and the President to take the final steps necessary to make these reforms a reality,” said Raja Krishnamoorthi, the Indian American lawmaker who co-sponsored by the House bill.The US grants some 1 million Green Cards a year. But a country cap limits their numbers to 7% of the total for applicants from every specific nation. The worst affected by this country limit are Indian applicants, with more than 300,000 primary applicants in the backlog. “While not everything that we wanted, it will still clear the existing backlog a lot sooner than the present miserable situation,” Immigration Voice, a group pushing for the removal of the country-limit said to its members in a message.It added: “After working on this bill for over a decade. you can take it from us that the bill is a great and hard-fought first-step towards a fairer more equitable immigration system.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-senate-passes-bill-to-raise-country-cap-on-green-cards-indians-may-benefit/story-9pMOJPUzWQHlTn3luI74mL.html

03-12-2020||World||Mexican president says Trump helped him get Covid-19 vaccine||Mexico’s president said Thursday he plans to give the military a role in distributing coronavirus vaccines, which he says US President Donald Trump helped him get.President Andrés Manuel López Obrador said that on his visit to Washington in July he spoke with Trump and Vice President Mike Pence and they “helped facilitate so that Mexico was taken into account and could get the vaccine.”López Obrador suggested Mexico will probably wait until US regulators approve the Pfizer vaccine later this month before giving it the go-ahead in Mexico.On Wednesday, Mexico’s Health Department signed a contract for 34.4 million doses of that vaccine, and said it hoped to receive 250,000 doses in December. Each person requires two doses.The president said the government is discussing with “the army and the navy, and we are defining the whole operation” to distribute the vaccine. López Obrador has given the military an unprecedented array of responsibilities in his two years in office, including distributing medical supplies and guarding hospitals.López Obrador is one of the few world leaders who has yet to congratulate President-elect Joe Biden.Mexico has suffered the world’s fourth-highest death toll, with over 107,500 test-confirmed deaths. However, the country does very little testing and officials estimate the real death toll is probably closer to 150,000.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/mexican-president-says-trump-helped-him-get-covid-19-vaccine/story-7uHNP2WSzLP2e4WMrH1LjN.html

Police said a full investigation into the incident would be conducted.“Officers remain at the scene and are likely to be for some time as we work together with other agencies in dealing with this major incident,” Chief Inspector Mark Runacres said.“Police enquiries into exactly what happened are at a very early stage and are continuing.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/multiple-casualties-in-blast-at-english-water-recycling-centre/story-jGZBb7KunRCfIHyng2b8AJ.html
03-12-2020||World||France to investigate dozens of mosques suspected of ‘separatism’||France will on Thursday start investigating dozens of mosques suspected of fomenting Islamist ideology to combat the rising threat of religious extremism, Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin said. The government has launched what it calls an unprecedented action against “separatism” following several Islamist attacks in France this autumn, including the beheading of a teacher who had shown his class caricatures of the Prophet Mohammad.Darmanin said 76 mosques out of the more than 2,600 Muslim places of worship had been flagged as possible threats to France’s Republican values and its security. Where suspicions are confirmed, the mosque will be closed down, he said.“There are in some concentrated areas places of worship which are clearly anti-Republican,” Darmanin told RTL radio, “(where) imams are followed by the intelligence services and where the discourse runs counter to our values.”Investigators will dig into the mosques’ financing and the background of imams deemed suspicious and search for evidence, among other things, of Koranic schools for young children.President Emmanuel Macron has warned of the growing menace of ‘Islamist separatism’ and its challenge to the unity of the secular French republic. Core French values such as the freedom of belief, gender equality and the right to blaspheme are threatened in localised areas, he has said. “Faced with this ill that is eating into our country, France has rallied with resilience, with determination,” the president wrote in a letter to the Financial Times newspaper in November.The government’s crackdown has left some Muslims feeling increasingly alienated in their own country. Some Muslim leaders while backing the government’s fight against Islamism have warned it against inadvertently lumping an overwhelming majority of their faith with the “fomenters of hate”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/france-to-investigate-dozens-of-mosques-suspected-of-separatism/story-tHLTBEdLmYpJ8ahhgPNIfP.html

The United States on Wednesday recorded over 3,100 Covid-19 deaths, the highest single-day spike till date, according to Johns Hopkins’ Coronavirus Resource Center. The United States has reported the highest number of deaths so far, followed by Brazil and India. Here’s the list of top 10 countries with most number of Covid-19 deaths:United States: It has recorded at least 273,590 deaths and nearly 14 million cases of coronavirus. The incoming Biden-Harris Administration has to face a major challenge to take control of the situation.Brazil: The Latin American nation is at the second spot with over 174,515 deaths. The Brazilian president was heavily criticised for not taking the virus seriously.India: It has recorded more than 138,000 Covid-19 deaths, with the national capital witnessing a huge spike.Mexico: The US’ neighbouring country has recorded over 107,000 deaths so far.United Kingdom: It has recorded at least 59,796 deaths as the country enters a tiered system.Italy: The European nation is again witnessing a surge in Covid deaths. It has reported over 57,000 deaths so far.France: Italy’s neighbour is also among the worst-hit countries in terms of Covid-19 deaths. It has recorded more than 52,800 deaths to date.Iran: The Middle Eastern nation was already struggling to overcome US’ sanctions and the pandemic created a major crisis in the region. Iran has reported at least 49,348 deaths so far.Spain: Another European nation in the list with more than 45,784 deaths. Russia: It has reported over 41,000 Covid-19 deaths and remains immensely dependent on its vaccine, Sputnik V, to combat the disease.Pfizer Inc. and BioNTech SE are waiting for an emergency use authorisation from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) after reporting a vaccine efficacy rate of 95 per cent. Though the UK’s health regulator has approved the use of Pfizer’s BNT162b2 vaccine, the government has to overcome logistical challenges to innoculate frontline workers and people at greater risk. Meanwhile, the threat of coronavirus continues to be a major concern for governments around the world as businesses reopen under strict guidelines.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-here-s-the-list-of-top-10-countries-with-most-number-of-virus-related-deaths/story-jKdybjwisscWaw4PhY8iTL.html
03-12-2020||World||Survey says US mayors see permanent changes even after Covid-19 vaccine||It will take years for US cities to fully recover from Covid-19 and during that time “a lot of small businesses won’t survive.”Those are among the takeaways from a survey of mayors released Thursday from the Boston University Initiative on Cities. The survey, conducted from June through August, doesn’t take into account the latest challenge of distributing virus vaccines to local residents.The 2020 Menino survey polled 130 mayors on how they are coping with the economic fallout from the pandemic and the disproportionate impact it brings to the most vulnerable residents and businesses.Two-thirds of US mayors expect that Latinos, renters, immigrants, and Black residents would still be feeling economic harm next summer. Moreover, half of mayors think it will take until 2022 for the arts and culture sectors to return to normal.“With the pandemic still spreading and the federal government still unable to come to an agreement on additional stimulus, we suspect mayors may actually be underestimating just how much their cities will change,”said Graham Wilson, Director of Boston University’s Initiative on Cities.Permanent changes are expected even after a vaccine is available, with 90% of mayors seeing a continued shift toward working from home. This will lead to downtown office buildings becoming “less desirable,” according to 60% of the mayors. The same percentage expect a permanent reduction in in-person retail shopping.The dire predictions do not bode well for small businesses. The majority of mayors expect those firms will be dramatically and permanently reshaped by Covid-19. Almost two-thirds doubt that new businesses will quickly emerge to replace those that went out of business during the pandemic.To help combat tax-base losses from closed businesses, New York City has proposed new streams of revenue such as a Pied-a-Terre Tax and increasing fines. The city also suggested reducing spending with measures such as citywide pay freezes and changes to health care coverage. In Washington, DC, the transit authority proposed eliminating weekend metro train coverage and reducing staff.Of the measures taken to help residents, mayors thought that the eviction moratoriums were the best policy: 93% of Democrat mayors supported these measures as did half of Republicans. Additional policies that were popular with mayors include universal paid sick leave, an increase in the minimum wage and commercial-eviction moratoriums.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/survey-says-us-mayors-see-permanent-changes-even-after-covid-19-vaccine/story-Zf2OgUPPNJIDfdWKyRYVRN.html
03-12-2020||World||US virus deaths top 3,100 in a single day for the first time||The US recorded over 3,100 Covid-19 deaths in a single day, obliterating the record set last spring, while the number of Americans hospitalized with the virus has eclipsed 100,000 for the first time and new cases are topping 200,000 a day, according to figures released Thursday.The three benchmarks altogether showed a country slipping deeper into crisis, with perhaps the worst yet to come, in part because of the delayed effects from Thanksgiving, when millions of Americans disregarded warnings to stay home and celebrate only with members of their household.Across the US, the surge has swamped hospitals with patients and left nurses and other health care workers shorthanded and burned out.“The reality is December and January and February are going to be rough times. I actually believe they are going to be the most difficult time in the public health history of this nation,” Dr. Robert Redfield, head of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said Wednesday.Health authorities had warned that the numbers could fluctuate strongly before and after Thanksgiving, as they often do around holidays and weekends, when because of reporting delays, figures often drop, then rise sharply a few days later as state and local agencies catch up with the backlog.Still, deaths, hospitalizations and cases in the US have been on a fairly steady rise for weeks, sometimes breaking records for days on end.The US recorded 3,157 deaths on Wednesday, according to the tally kept by Johns Hopkins University. That’s more than the number of people killed on 9/11, and it shattered the old mark of 2,603, set on April 15, when the New York metropolitan area was the epicenter of the US outbreak.The number of people in the hospital likewise set an all-time high Wednesday, according to the Covid Tracking Project. It has more than doubled over the past month.Also, the number of newly confirmed infections climbed just over 200,000 Wednesday for the second time in less than a week, by Johns Hopkins’ count.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-virus-deaths-top-3-100-in-a-single-day-for-the-first-time/story-TkmgkXwQNqG1AgG8AEfshI.html
03-12-2020||World||Bangladesh begins relocating Rohingya refugees to island||Authorities in Bangladesh have begun relocating thousands of Rohingya refugees to an isolated island despite calls by human rights groups for a halt to the process, officials said Thursday.The United Nations has also voiced concern that refugees be allowed to make a “free and informed decision” about whether to relocate to the island in the Bay of Bengal.The island’s facilities are built to accommodate 100,000 people, just a fraction of the million Rohingya Muslims who have fled waves of violent persecution in their native Myanmar and are currently living in crowded, squalid refugee camps.On Thursday, 11 passenger buses carrying refugees left Cox’s Bazar district on the way to the island, where they are expected to arrive after an overnight stopover, a government official involved with the process said on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to the media.He said “a few thousand” refugees were in the first batch. Authorities in Cox’s Bazar did not say how the refugees were selected for relocation.About 700,000 Rohingya fled to the camps in Cox’s Bazar after August 2017, when the military in Buddhist-majority Myanmar began a harsh crackdown on the Muslim group following an attack by insurgents. The crackdown included rapes, killings and the torching of thousands of homes, and was termed ethnic cleansing by global rights groups and the UN.Foreign media have not been permitted to visit the island, called Bhashan Char, or floating island. It was once regularly submerged by monsoon rains but now has flood protection embankments, houses, hospitals and mosques built at a cost of more than $112 million by the Bangladesh navy.Located 21 miles (34 kilometers) from the mainland, the island surfaced only 20 years ago and was never inhabited.Contractors say its infrastructure is like a modern township, with multifamily concrete homes, schools, playgrounds and roads. It also has solar-power facilities, a water supply system and cyclone shelters.International aid agencies and the UN have vehemently opposed the relocation since it was first proposed in 2015, expressing fear that a big storm could overwhelm the island and endanger thousands of lives.The U.N. said in a statement Wednesday that it has not been involved in preparations for the relocation or the selection of refugees and has limited information about the overall plan.“The United Nations takes this opportunity to highlight its longstanding position that Rohingya refugees must be able to make a free and informed decision about relocating to Bhasan Char based upon relevant, accurate and updated information,” it said.Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch on Thursday urged the government to cancel the relocation plan.The current refugee camps near the town of Cox’s Bazar are overcrowded and unhygienic. Disease and organized crime are rampant. Education is limited and refugees are not allowed to work.Still, most Rohingya are unwilling to return to Myanmar due to safety concerns. Government officials didn’t have an estimate of how many refugees would be willing to be relocated to the island.Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina has repeatedly told the UN and other international partners that her administration would consult them before making a final decision on the relocation, and that no refugees would be forced to move.Bangladesh attempted to start sending refugees back to Myanmar under a bilateral framework last November, but no one was willing to go.The Rohingya are not recognized as citizens in Myanmar, rendering them stateless, and face other forms of state-sanctioned discrimination.A UN-sponsored investigation in 2018 recommended the prosecution of Myanmar’s top military commanders on charges of genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity for the violence against the Rohingya.Myanmar is defending itself in the International Court of Justice in the Hague, Netherlands, after the West African nation of Gambia brought a case backed by the Organization for Islamic Cooperation, Canada and the Netherlands over the crackdown.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/bangladesh-begins-relocating-rohingya-refugees-to-island/story-H8FYM7qCVjjg8S0oMFrn7O.html
03-12-2020||World||US jobless claims drop, offering ray of hope for labor market||Applications for US state unemployment benefits fell by the most in almost two months, offering some hope that the gradual recovery in the job market will continue despite a spike in Covid-19 infections and renewed business restrictions.Initial jobless claims in regular state programs decreased by 75,000 to 712,000 in the week ended Nov. 28, the first drop in three weeks, Labor Department data showed Thursday. Without adjustments for seasonal fluctuations, applications dropped by about 122,000 during the period.Continuing claims -- the total pool of Americans on state unemployment benefits -- declined 569,000 to 5.52 million in the week ended Nov. 21.The main figures were below economists’ projections for 775,000 initial claims and 5.8 million continuing claims, based on the median estimates in Bloomberg surveys. One caveat: seasonal adjustments on claims data tend to be trickier around holidays, and last week included Thanksgiving, making it important to see if the trend holds.While the latest claims figures show gradual improvement, they’re still well above pre-pandemic levels. The labor market also remains challenged by a rising number of Covid-19 cases and a tightening of business restrictions in parts of the US Some industries such as travel, leisure and hospitality are still depressed by the pandemic and could cut jobs more aggressively in the absence of additional fiscal relief.The data show a labor market that “continues to progress through the pandemic, but still has a long road to a complete recovery,” Ian Lyngen, head of US rates strategy at BMO Capital Markets, said in a note.US stocks were little changed at the open, while 10-year Treasury yields fell along with the dollar.All but 10 states and territories posted unadjusted declines in initial claims last week, with some of the biggest drops occurring in California, Texas, Michigan and Georgia. Illinois, Oregon and Indiana reported the largest increases in filings during the holiday week.Adjustment Issues“The plunge in initial claims does not refute the idea that the trend is rising; we expected a sharp fall because of the difficulty of adjusting for Thanksgiving,” Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, wrote in a note. He had forecast claims of 725,000.The government’s monthly jobs report on Friday is projected to show payrolls grew by about 475,000 in November, still solid yet the smallest gain in seven months, according to the median forecast in a Bloomberg survey of economists. The jobless rate is forecast to tick down to 6.8% from 6.9%.A report on Wednesday from ADP Research Institute showed that companies in the US added fewer jobs than expected in November, a sign that businesses are slowing down the rate of hiring as coronavirus cases reach new levels.Continuing claims for Pandemic Unemployment Assistance, a program that provides benefits to self-employed and gig workers, decreased about 339,000 to 8.87 million in the week ended Nov. 14. This number, though, is inflated by multiple-counting and fraud, according to a government watchdog’s report this week, and the Labor Department plans to add a disclaimer.More people have moved into extended programs like Pandemic Emergency Unemployment Compensation, but these were put in place by the Cares Act will expire by year-end and leave millions of people without government aid. The number of Americans on PEUC assistance rose slightly to 4.57 million in the week ended Nov. 14.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-jobless-claims-drop-offering-ray-of-hope-for-labor-market/story-phXaRytWVk58zCFVkV1gnJ.html
03-12-2020||World||Covid-19: Three former US presidents may take vaccine shot on camera||The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is scrutinising the data submitted by Pfizer Inc. and BioNTech SE to grant the required approval for emergency use. While President Donald Trump continues to question what he believes is a delayed approval of the Covid-19 vaccine, the three most recent former presidents have volunteered to lead an awareness campaign once the vaccine is available for people at lesser risk. Former Presidents Barack Obama, George W. Bush and Bill Clinton have shown willingness to encourage the sceptical Americans to take the Covid-19 vaccine shot by publicly getting inoculated against the coronavirus disease. During an interview on SiriusXM’s The Joe Madison Show, Obama said that he would get the shot if Dr Anthony Fauci, US’ top infectious disease expert, tells him the vaccine is safe.“I promise you that when it’s been made for people who are less at risk, I will be taking it. I may end up taking it on TV or having it filmed, just so that people know that I trust this science,” Obama said.Also Read | US top health expert criticises UK’s approval of Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine. Here’s the reasonAfter Obama’s remarks, CNN reported that Bush’s chief of staff, Freddy Ford, said the president has already reached out to Dr Fauci and Dr Deborah Birx, the White House coronavirus response coordinator, to check if he could help in promoting the vaccine. Ford added that vaccines need to be deemed safe, and administered to the frontline workers and people at greater risk.“Then, President Bush will get in line for his, and will gladly do so on camera,” he added.Clinton’s press secretary, Angel Urena, also told the media network that the president will definitely take a vaccine as soon as it is made available to him based on priorities determined by the health officials. Urena said that Clinton would take the vaccine in a public setting if it encourages other Americans to get the doses.As the United States is waiting for an emergency use authorisation of Pfizer’s Covid-19 vaccine, Dr Fauci has indicated that some people are still concerned about the safety of the vaccine. Speaking to Fox News, Dr Fauci said that the FDA is doing “the correct way”, asserting that the US agency scrutinises the data “very carefully” to guarantee a safe and efficacious vaccine.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-three-former-us-presidents-may-take-vaccine-shot-on-camera/story-9HR0bytJtA0IhkGLVdV9OK.html
03-12-2020||World||China’s population may decline as fertility rate falls below warning level: Official||China’s total fertility rate has fallen below the warning line and the population growth has entered a critical turning point, Chinese Minister of Civil Affairs Li Jiheng has said amid demographers warning that the country’s population will soon start to decline.Facing a demographic crisis with a rapidly ageing population after implementing the decades-old one child policy, China permitted to have a second child since 2016.Now the demographers call on the government to immediately lift restrictions on having babies and be more tolerant toward babies born out of wedlock, and do more to lower the costs of raising and educating children.Li in an article said that under the influence of various factors, Chinese people are less willing to have children, the total fertility rate has fallen below the warning line, and the population development has entered a critical transition period, state-run Global Times reported on Thursday.On November 1, China started the world’s biggest exercise of population count to document demographic changes in the country.About seven million workers began a door to door survey for the seventh census in the country to account for China’s population stated to be 1.37 billion in the last exercise conducted ten years ago.The figures were expected to reveal more data related to the population which is key for China’s strategic development as the second-largest economy after the US and demographic crisis faced by it.He Yafu, an independent demographer, told the newspaper that the total fertility rate (the average number of children a woman gives birth to) should remain at about 2.1 for China’s population to stay stable, and a total fertility rate of 1.5 is a highly sensitive warning line, given historical and international experience.“Once it slips below 1.5, a country falls into the trap of low fertility and is unlikely to recover,” He said, noting that China’s fertility rate has fallen below that.He warned that China’s total population will soon start to decline, ending the trend of economic growth.Once a country’s population starts to contract, there is little chance of reversing the trend, He told the daily.The birth rate on the Chinese mainland dropped to 10.48 per 1,000 people last year, the lowest in seven decades, and the number of births was down 580,000 compared with the previous year, according to the National Bureau of Statistics.Last year, Chinese Premier Li Keqiang said during his annual press conference that China’s population above 60 years increased to 420 million and that of children over six years to 100 million putting heavy pressure on nursing services and day care centres.Recent studies said China’s population is aging at a rate and scale that is historically unprecedented. The Communist nation is expected to lose 400 million working age persons this century, and the number is already falling, Merrick Carey CEO of the Lexington Institute, a public policy think tank in Arlington, Virginia said in a policy paper.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-s-population-may-decline-as-fertility-rate-falls-below-warning-level-official/story-L2PtRUp2tqi6Xu9LtwIjSJ.html
03-12-2020||World||Iran ready to show goodwill if US, Europe abide by nuclear deal, says foreign minister||Iran will fully comply with a 2015 deal aimed at preventing it from developing nuclear weapons if both the United States and Europe honour their original commitments, Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif said on Thursday.US President Donald Trump quit the pact in 2018, saying it did not do enough to curb Iran’s nuclear and ballistic missile programs or its militant influence in the Middle East.However, president-elect Joe Biden has said he will rejoin it if Tehran first resumes strict compliance. He has also said he would work with allies “to strengthen and extend it”.Addressing a Rome conference via video-link, Zarif said the so-called Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) could not be renegotiated but it could be resurrected.“The United States has commitments. It is not in a position to set conditions,” he said.Iran’s Guardian Council watchdog body approved a law on Wednesday that obliges the government to halt U.N. inspections of its nuclear sites and step up uranium enrichment beyond the limit set under the 2015 deal if sanctions are not eased within two months.Zarif said that although the government did not like the law, it would nonetheless implement it.“But it is not irreversible,” he said. “The Europeans and USA can come back into compliance with the JCPOA and not only this law will not be implemented, but in fact the actions we have taken ... will be rescinded. We will go back to full compliance.”Zarif said economic sanctions imposed by the Trump administration had cost Iranians $250 billion and made it impossible to buy medicines and vaccines needed to combat the coronavirus, which has taken a particularly heavy toll on his country.“It is a crime against humanity,” he said, adding that the US measures were preventing European companies from doing business in Iran, dashing hopes of a massive upswing in trade after the 2015 deal was signed.“Europeans say they are in full compliance (with the deal) but they simply are not. ... We don’t see any European companies in Iran, we do not see any European country buying oil from Iran, we do not see any European banks send us our money,” Zarif said.The foreign minister said he hoped that neighbouring Arab states, some of which have recently forged ties with Iran’s arch-enemy Israel, would seek dialogue with Tehran once Trump left office.“We are their neighbours. We will be in this region together. I do not believe that they want to allow Israel to bring the fight to Iran,” Zarif said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/iran-ready-to-show-goodwill-if-us-europe-abide-by-nuclear-deal-says-foreign-minister/story-lz9oJKNgBsKuci0WBodsFI.html

03-12-2020||World||US pandemic death toll mounts as danger season approaches||US deaths from the coronavirus pandemic have surged past 2,000 for two days in a row as the most dangerous season of the year approached, taxing an overwhelmed healthcare system with US political leadership in disarray.The toll from Covid-19 reached its second-highest level ever on Wednesday with 2,811 lives lost, according to a Reuters tally of official data, one short of the record from April 15.Nearly 200,000 new US cases were reported on Wednesday, with record hospitalizations approaching 100,000 patients.The sobering data came as the head of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Wednesday warned that December, January and February were likely to be “the most difficult time in the public health history of this nation.”CDC Director Dr. Robert Redfield told an event hosted by the US Chamber of Commerce that the United States could start losing around 3,000 people - roughly the number that died in the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001 - each day over the next two months.“The mortality concerns are real and I do think unfortunately before we see February, we could be close to 450,000 Americans that have died from this virus,” Redfield said. The US death toll since the start of the pandemic stands at around 273,000.Meanwhile, the administration of outgoing President Donald Trump has yet to articulate an effective strategy to contain the virus beyond promoting the development of a vaccine, which could be rolled out later this month but faces an uphill battle amid a skeptical public and logistical challenges.The Republican president’s few public appearances recently had been dedicated to efforts to overturn the results of the Nov. 3 election won by Democratic President-elect Joe Biden, who will assume office on Jan. 20.Maryland Governor Larry Hogan, a Republican, said he had been concerned about the transition between the Trump and Biden administrations, but he had grown more hopeful that the federal government response would not lapse.“We’re in the middle of the worst battle of this war, and the hand-off has got to be smooth. We’ve got to work together. There’s got to be no politics in this virus,” he told ABC News’ “Good Morning America” program.Hogan echoed Redfield’s warning, citing dark days ahead and noting even when vaccines are approved, there initially won’t be enough to even cover all of his state’s healthcare workers.“The worst part of this virus is coming in the weeks and maybe the month or two to come. And we’re not going to have enough for everybody, so we’re just asking for patience,” Hogan said.Hospitals are filling up with Covid-19 patients, reducing care for people needing treatment for other ailments. Redfield said 90% of US hospitals were in areas designated as coronavirus “hot zones.”Rural and suburban hospitals were particularly affected, threatening their economic viability, Amesh Adalja, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, told MSNBC on Thursday.“There’s no end in sight because there’s so much community spread,” Adalja said, warning that the pandemic could force hospital closures.Still, rapid vaccine development, aided by the Trump administration’s “Operation Warp Speed” program, offered a ray of hope.Britain on Wednesday gave emergency approval to Pfizer Inc’s Covid-19 vaccine, a sign that US regulators may soon follow suit and allow inoculations within weeks.US Presidents Barack Obama, George W. Bush and Bill Clinton have volunteered to get their Covid-19 jabs on television to help demonstrate their safety, CNN reported, citing press aides to Bush and Clinton and an Obama interview on Sirius XM radio.“I may end up taking it on TV or having it filmed, just so that people know that I trust this science,” Obama said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-pandemic-death-toll-mounts-as-danger-season-approaches/story-jQ8Ev6dSqpFMcfZN11m6hO.html

My only home is Hong Kong which is why I will not apply for asylum in any country,” Hui said.“I will wait for the day that I can go home with the bells of freedom ringing in a free Hong Kong. Until my last breath I will fight to the end. Revive Hong Kong, revolution now!” In July, another democracy activist, Nathan Law, left Hong Kong after testifying in a U.S. congressional hearing about a tough new security law imposed by mainland China on the semi-autonomous territory.At first, he declined to disclose his whereabouts for safety but later appeared in London.“I will continue to fight on aboard and will make it my life mission to widen Hong Kong’s international battle front with people like Nathan Law in the U.K.,” Hui said.Hui was arrested in Hong Kong in May over an incident in the Legislative Council in which he dropped a rotten plant and attempted to kick it at the body’s president. He was able to get his passport back from the government and a visa after receiving an invitation from Danish lawmakers to travel to Denmark, where he arrived Tuesday.Since the start of anti-government protests in June 2019, Hong Kong police have made more than 10,000 arrests.Prominent pro-democracy figures who have been arrested include activists Joshua Wong and Agnes Chow, as well as media tycoon Jimmy Lai, an outspoken advocate for democracy.Hui’s parents, wife and two young children left Hong Kong on a flight on Wednesday, Hong Kong online news portal HK01 reported. It did not mention their destination.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/ex-hong-kong-lawmaker-goes-into-exile-plans-to-travel-to-uk/story-N3hC9lziv7SmgXRtOvRokI.html

The overall death figure in hospitals and care homes reached 59,699.Johnson hailed the achievement of scientists as the regulator approved the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine on Wednesday, and noted that it was developed from an idea pioneered by the English physician Edward Jenner, whose smallpox vaccine was tested in colonial India.Johnson said, “(It) is all the more vital that as we celebrate this scientific achievement, we are not carried away with over optimism or fall into the naïve belief that the struggle is over. It’s not. We’ve got to stick to our winter plan, a comprehensive programme to suppress the virus.”According to him, it is no longer a hope but certainty that normal life would return in the spring.“(We) are no longer resting on the mere hope that we can return to normal next year in the spring, but rather on the sure and certain knowledge that we will succeed - and together reclaim our lives and all the things about our lives that we love,” he said. “So I want to thank the scientists and all those around the world who have taken part in the trials and got us to this stage.”The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), the UK regulator, is currently evaluating data from clinical trials of the University of Oxford-AstraZeneca and Moderna vaccine candidates, with decisions expected in the coming days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-don-t-get-carried-away-it-s-not-over-warns-uk-pm-boris-johnson/story-5O0xTRofNAcg2cLAOpeCyK.html
03-12-2020||World||US top health expert criticises UK’s approval of Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine. Here’s the reason||British health regulators on Wednesday authorised the use of Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine for public inoculation against the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), drawing criticism from US’ top infectious disease expert Dr Anthony Fauci. The United Kingdom became the first country to approve Pfizer’s vaccine, BNT162b2, which has shown an efficacy rate of 95 per cent, while the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is yet to provide emergency use authorisation to the biotech firms.Dr Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, opined that the UK regulators did not scrutinise the data as carefully as the FDA is carrying out in its review. Speaking to Fox News, Dr Fauci said that the FDA is doing “the correct way”, asserting that the US agency scrutinises the data “very carefully” to guarantee a safe and efficacious vaccine.Also Read | Covid-19 vaccine: Is Pfizer approval hasty? Can Indians get vaccinated in UK? All you need to knowThe top health expert further said that rushing to approval would add to the “existing hesitancy” as many people are concerned about the safety of the vaccine. He boasted that the United States has the “gold standard” of a regulatory approach and the UK did not do it as carefully which helped them get ahead by a couple of days.“I don’t think that makes much difference. We’ll be there. We’ll be there very soon,” Dr Fauci added.Meanwhile, UK government ministers and health experts have said that all required procedures were followed to approve Pfizer’s Covid-19 vaccine. Education secretary Gavin Williamson claimed that Britain has better medical regulators that France, Belgium, and the United States and that’s why it was able to approve the vaccine before other countries. “That doesn’t surprise me at all because we’re a much better country than every single one of them,” Williamson told LBC.Pfizer Inc. and BioNTech SE expect to produce up to 50 million vaccine doses globally in 2020 and up to 1.3 billion doses by the end of 2021. Pfizer’s vaccine candidate needs ultra-cold storage at around minus 75°C and can be kept in the fridge for five days. An independent panel of experts is scheduled to meet on December 10 to discuss and review Pfizer’s application and could authorise the jab in the US soon after that date.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-top-health-expert-criticises-uk-s-approval-of-pfizer-covid-19-vaccine-here-s-the-reason/story-TD4115vVmn3enwiNLChKxK.html

The utility has warned it could shut power to a total of more than 272,000 customer accounts in eight counties, or about 816,000 people based on the size of the average household. That would constitute the region’s largest public-safety blackout this year.Dry winds strong enough to knock down power lines are forecast to rattle Southern California through Thursday, exposing more than 6.4 million people to critical fire weather, according to the National Weather Service and the U.S. Storm Prediction Center.“If fires do start they will have a pretty dangerous spread,” said Marc Chenard, a senior branch forecaster at the center. The danger isn’t just the immediate conditions, but the prolonged dryness that has plagued the area and turned trees, grasses and shrubs into fuel. Red flag fire warnings are posted in and around Los Angeles County as the threat grows.California has already been charred by record fires that have burned 4.2 million acres and killed 31 people in 2020. Utilities including Edison and PG&E Corp. have cut power repeatedly to prevent live wires from falling into dry brush.Sempra Energy’s San Diego Gas & Electric utility said 50,415 customers had been shutoff so far, and earlier warned about 88,700 homes and businesses, or more than 260,000 people, could lose power Wednesday night or Thursday morning, and possibly remain in the dark through Sunday or Monday. Most affected customers would be in the mountains east of San Diego. PG&E, California’s largest utility, said it may cut power to about 600 homes and businesses in Kern County this week, as well.Last week, Edison cut power to thousands of customers on Thanksgiving during high winds. In 2019, PG&E filed for bankruptcy after its wires sparked the deadliest blaze in state history.The high winds and blackouts will be mostly confined to Southern California but could touch a portion of the state’s Central Valley as well.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/power-shutoffs-hit-california-as-high-winds-risk-new-fires/story-9vhRYk6klOGRR1DcFqC2QM.html
03-12-2020||World||New Zealand’s carbon-neutral pledge: Govt faces uphill struggle||The New Zealand government’s goal to become carbon neutral by 2025 will only happen if backed by more funding and bold policies - including those targeting dairy farmers - rather than relying on carbon offset schemes, environmentalists said.In addition to promising a carbon-neutral public sector in five years, Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern declared a climate emergency earlier this week, a move the main opposition party dismissed as “virtue signalling”.“It’s an ambitious goal and it’s good to see the government committing to lead from the front,” Amanda Larsson, senior campaigner at Greenpeace Aotearoa, said on Thursday.“But in order to make a dent on emissions, what we really need is government policies to cut pollution from the agriculture and transport sectors.”Climate change was a key issue in October’s election, won by Ardern’s Labour Party, with many New Zealanders becoming more aware of the threat earlier this year as ash from bushfires in Australia turned its skies red and its glaciers brown.Proud of being one of the world’s most pristine, naturally beautiful countries, New Zealand has introduced climate change into its school curriculum, while parliament approved a bill to cut carbon emissions to net-zero by 2050.But according to analysis by research coalition Climate Action Tracker, the country’s current climate policies are “insufficient” and inconsistent with limiting global warming to the Paris accord’s tightest goal of 1.5 degrees Celsius.Methane from agriculture and waste accounts for more than 40% of New Zealand’s emissions, it noted.“We need to see bolder action from the government, a commitment to fully decarbonise the state sector and a clear plan that sets out how they will do it,” said Siri Andersen, co-director at climate campaign group 350 Aotearoa.“Our government has the mandate and the numbers in parliament to lead a rapid, just transition to a low-carbon future, and the community is expecting (it) to take bold action,” Anderson told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.The Pacific nation’s “School Strike 4 Climate” marches last year put pressure on Ardern to be bolder with her climate policies but her efforts to do so were often hampered by her coalition partners in government, green groups said.Under the new goal, government agencies will have to measure and report emissions and offset any they can’t cut by 2025.The programme will also be backed by a NZ$200 million ($141 million) fund to finance replacing coal boilers and help buy electric or hybrid vehicles.“The key challenge is, and always will be, funding,” said Elliott Hughes, a spokesman at Generation Zero, a youth-led climate action organisation.“Without additional funding, it’s difficult to imagine organizations already short on cash having the resources to decarbonize effectively.”However, this week’s announcement would send a strong signal to households, businesses and investors that climate change is a priority for New Zealand, green groups said.This needed to be followed with policies, regulations and incentives that make climate-smart choices easier, said Greenpeace’s Larsson.Government agencies will now need to look at replacing their fossil fuel vehicles with greener alternatives - like public transport, cycling or electric vehicles, environmentalists said.Improvements to public buildings - many of which use coal fired boilers - would also be needed to ensure energy efficiency and to prioritise renewable energy, they added.In addition, the new pledge should provide incentives for government designers of public housing to consider energy efficiency - vital given the country’s chronic housing shortage, said Denys Trussell of Friends of the Earth New Zealand.But the concern is that meeting the new emissions target will involve offsetting building emissions, which doesn’t “green” the sector at all, said Cindy Baxter, a spokewoman at Coal Action Network Aotearoa, a climate campaign group.“Buying offsets isn’t proper climate action,” she said. “We need to see this sector actually cutting fossil fuel use, but there needs to be funding for that.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-zealand-s-carbon-neutral-pledge-govt-faces-uphill-struggle/story-Z136At3Oc8BAVi9DQqWD8M.html
03-12-2020||World||China hits out at US after report of new visa restrictions||China on Thursday accused critics in the US government of “an escalation of political suppression” against Beijing following a report of new visa restrictions on members of China’s ruling Communist Party and their immediate family members.Foreign ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying said China would “make representations” to the US following the report Thursday in the New York Times that such people would be limited to one-month, single-entry visas.Hua called Washington’s approach “totally inconsistent with the US’s own interests,” and said it would damage America’s global image.“I think it is obvious to all that this is an escalation of political suppression by some extreme anti-China forces in the US out of strong ideological prejudice and deep-rooted Cold War mentality against China,” Hua said at a daily briefing.The Times report could not immediately be confirmed, but follows earlier hints that Washington was planning such a move, possibly even including a total ban on all 92 million Communist Party members. It wasn’t clear how the restrictions would be enforced since many members do not play active public roles in the party’s institutions.The restrictions would be the latest punitive measure taken against China’s leadership and economy amid sharpening disputes over human rights, the coronavirus pandemic, trade, technology, Taiwan and a host of other issues.On Wednesday, the U.S. said it would block imports from a major Chinese producer of cotton goods because of its reliance on workers detained as part of a crackdown on ethnic minorities in China’s northwest.Washington has already slapped travel bans and financial sanctions on officials connected to the crackdown on Uighurs and other Chinese Muslim groups in Xinjiang, as well as on Chinese and Hong Kong officials it accuses of restricting social and political rights in the semi-autonomous Chinese city through the implementation of a harsh new national security law.Diplomatic ties hit a low point over the summer when the US ordered the closure of the Chinese consulate in Houston and China responded by demanding the US vacate its consulate in the southwestern city of Chengdu.Washington had been loosening restrictions on travel by Chinese to the U.S., seeking to take advantage of the lavish spending habits of China’s newly wealthy. Beginning in 2014, Chinese travelers — whether party members or not — became eligible for multiple-entry visas valid for 10 years, with stays of 180 days allowed for each entry, while students were permitted visas good for five years. China reciprocated with similar treatment for US citizens. Chinese who make up the single largest group of foreign students at American universities have already complained of tougher conditions for obtaining or extending visas. Chinese academics have also faced greater scrutiny, while dozens of journalists with state media have been forced to return home and visa restrictions placed on those remaining, prompting retaliation from Beijing.Analysts have long speculated that President Donald Trump will impose harsher measures on China before leaving office on Jan. 20, placing President-elect Joe Biden in a bind in managing the increasingly fractious relationship.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-hits-out-at-us-after-report-of-new-visa-restrictions/story-95kGTk84C9FG7kLlPk3EBJ.html

03-12-2020||World||Covid-19: Tony Blair’s think tank urges need for ‘digital health passports’||A digital health passport with a traffic lights-like system that shows vaccine status of individuals is needed to ensure that those with negative Covid-19 test and vaccination are exempt from curbs and are able to attend sport events, concerts and travel, a think-tank set up by former British prime minister Tony Blair said on Thursday.After the Pfizer-BioNTech coronavirus vaccine was approved on Wednesday, the focus moved to delivery and administration from next week, and overcoming anti-vaccine content on social media. Prominent individuals from various walks of life are to be enlisted to encourage wide take-up of the vaccine. The first doses are expected to arrive from Belgium on Tuesday.The Tony Blair Institute for Global Change said the ultimate goal of an effective vaccine programme should be to enable people to live safely and freely alongside the virus. A key part of this will be individuals having “health passports” that shows their current vaccine status.It called on the Boris Johnson administration to urgently approve a digital platform for the health passport that can draw on vaccine and testing data by the second quarter of 2021, so that the economy, travel and society can be reopened and future lockdowns avoided.The think-tank’s report, titled ‘How the Government Should Call the Shots: Getting the UK Vaccine-Ready’, said the passport should show an individual’s next testing date, current testing status (antigen and antibody), vaccine date and location, and vaccine status including expiry date.It said, “The digital health passport would mean that those with an up-to-date negative Covid-19 test or a vaccination would not be subject to strict Covid restrictions and would be able to access settings such as the workplace, hospitality venues, sporting events, concerts.”“The Premier League is already believed to be in discussion with the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport on how such a system could allow fans to return to stadiums next year. It would enable a person to show they are Covid-safe, and give people working in those settings a quick, reliable and secure way to verify this,” the report added.A simple system of status similar to traffic lights would indicate whether someone has received the vaccine and/or has an acceptable test result, allowing them to move freely: ‘red’, indicating the person neither has an up-to-date test, nor a vaccine; ‘amber’, indicating a negative rapid test and ability to move freely until next test, ideally weekly; and ‘green’, indicating the person has had a vaccine and is able to move around freely until next vaccine date.Jonathan Van-Tam, England’s deputy chief medical officer and a leading figure in official communication on the virus, said thinking around issues such as “vaccination certificates” to make it easier for people to access venues and services had not yet evolved.However, he added that the National Health Service (NHS) would have a clear digital record of who had been vaccinated, saying, “There are definite plans to make sure that we absolutely know, and it is linked to health digital records, who has had the vaccine, who has one dose, two doses if two doses are required, which vaccine they’ve had, and when they’ve had it.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-tony-blair-s-think-tank-urges-need-for-digital-health-passports/story-rgKqYW5sLxM1Jx5B8kcJEL.html

In response to the upcoming jalsa, PTI Senator Faisal Javed Khan on Thursday said the government will not create any obstacles for the PDM jalsa as the rally is a ‘big obstacle in itself’.Taking to his Twitter account, he further wrote that all PDM rallies have flopped and failed to exert any pressure on the government.This comes after the fifth power show of the PDM began on Monday amid the government’s desperate attempts to obstruct it.The PDM has held four similar rallies in Peshawar, Gujranwala, Karachi, and Quetta since October 16.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/opposition-warns-imran-khan-of-violence-if-govt-attempts-to-obstruct-rally-in-lahore/story-fMp6mNqCtVMrhF775UeSqO.html

Using computer simulations, the study, published in the journal The Cryosphere, analysed how climate change could lead to irreversible sea level rise as temperatures continue to rise and the Greenland ice sheet continues to decline.While there were scenarios in which the ice sheet melting could be reversed, the scientists, including those from the University of Reading in the UK, said these relied on actions to counteract global warming before it’s too late. According to the researchers, the ice sheet is seven times the area of the UK, and stores a large amount of the Earth’s frozen water. In the research, the scientists simulated the effects of Greenland ice sheet melting under a range of possible temperature rises, ranging from minimal warming to worst-case scenarios.At current rates of melting, they said the ice sheet contributes almost one millimetre to sea level per year, accounting for around a quarter of the total increase. The researchers said despite seasonal periods of growth, Greenland has lost 3.5 trillion tons of ice since 2003.Under all future climates like the present or warmer, they found that the ice-sheet declined in size and contributed to some degree of sea-level rise.Importantly, the scientists said there were scenarios in which the ice sheet melting could be reversed. But these depended on actions to reverse global warming before it’s too late, the scientists added.Under scenarios in which global warming goes beyond 2°C, there could be significant ice loss and several metres of global sea level rise to persist for tens of thousands of years, the scientists said, adding that a warmer climate would lead to greater sea-level rise. In such cases, even if temperatures later return to current levels, the study showed that the Greenland ice sheet will never fully regrow once it melts beyond a critical point. After this point, the scientists said sea levels would permanently remain two metres higher than current levels, regardless of other contributing factors. According to the researchers, this is because the ice sheet is so large that it has a substantial impact on its local climate, and as it declines, Greenland would experience warmer temperatures and less snowfall. Once the ice-sheet retreats from the Northern part of the island, the study cautioned that the area would remain ice-free. To avoid irreversible sea level rise such melting would cause, the scientists said climate change must be reversed before this threshold is reached. “To avoid partially irreversible loss of the ice sheet, climate change must be reversed -- not just stabilised -- before we reach the critical point where the ice sheet has declined too far,” said Jonathan Gregory, a co-author of the study from the University of Reading.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/take-action-melting-of-greenland-ice-sheet-could-be-reversed-say-scientists/story-PMJkY1DL3vUR5if5j3enYO.html

The tropical cyclone made landfall in the island nation’s Trincomalee district between Thiriyaya and Kuchchaveli villages last night, the Disaster Management Centre said. Districts in the island’s north and east received as much as 200 mm of rain. However, its impact was less than what was anticipated by the officials. Incidents of flooding and tree felling were reported but property damage has largely been contained, officials said. In a flash flood in Trincomalee district, 12 houses were submerged. Over 630 families were accommodated in temporary relief camps, while over 1,700 families made personal arrangements in safe locations. In northern Vavuniya district, around 250 families had been evacuated, officials said. The meteorological department said the cyclone will exit the country by early Thursday evening but the coastal areas will continue to be out of bounds as strong winds and heavy rain are predicted. The effect of the cyclone will gradually diminish throughout the day, the department said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/cyclone-burevi-moving-away-from-sri-lanka-damage-has-been-minimal-officials/story-fADzTyhUDlHVJU2XwAQo2L.html

When it comes to use and development of cross-border rivers, China always acts responsibly. We have a policy featuring development and conservation, and all projects will go through science-based planning and assessment with due consideration for its impact downstream and taking into account interests of upstream and downstream regions,” she said at a briefing when asked about the project on Thursday.“The development of lower reaches of Yarlung Zangbo is in early stages of planning and assessment. There is no need to read too much into that,” she said.“For a long time, China, India, and Bangladesh have had good cooperation in sharing hydrological information, flood and disaster reduction and contingency management. We will continue communication through existing channels,” Hua said.“Going forward China, India, Bangladesh and other concerned countries will continue to have good communication. There is no need for any anxiety on this matter,” she added.Experts caution that though it’s early to comment on the adverse impact of the project, there are reasons for unease in India and Bangladesh.“As a major downstream dam on the lower reaches of the Yarlung Tsangpo, this is surely an important development but also something that has been speculated for quite some time now. China’s position as an upper riparian allows it extensive leverage over the Himalayan waters and in recent years, China’s dam-building and water-diversion projects, coupled with reservations in transparently sharing all hydrological data despite MoUs (post the Doklam standoff), have all been a major cause of concern for downstream countries like India and Bangladesh,” said Farwa Aamer, director of the South Asia Programme at the New York-based EastWest Institute.Miroslav Marence from the River Basin Development programme of The Netherland-based IHE Delft Institute for Water Education said the lack of information on the project was worrying.“To form technical and also scientific opinion, project data is essential. After we have these data, we can speak about influences and impacts - environmental and social. The project looks known in China but without any international knowledge. This makes the project more conspirative,” Marence said.Marence said that it was his “speculation” that China isn’t sharing project details because it “has big impact”.Experts cited the example of how China has handled the issue of sharing hydrological data for the Lancang river (originating in Tibet) and flowing as Mekong through southeast Asian countries such as Laos, Cambodia, Thailand and Vietnam.It was only in October this year that China signed an agreement with the Mekong River Commission (MRC) to share year-round data on the flow of its portion of the vital waterway amid rising concern that Chinese dams may be causing drought downstream in southeast Asia. Until October, Beijing was only sharing water data for the months between June and October.A push for more data from China’s portion of the Mekong river intensified this year after the US government’s criticism that 11 Chinese dams on the Lancang river were “hoarding” water and hurting livelihoods downstream, a Reuters report said in October. Beijing denies the accusation.Ameya Pratap Singh, doctoral candidate at Oxford University, who has written on “India-China relations and the geopolitics of water”, said New Delhi needs to be on alert about the dam.“From India’s perspective the risks are …flooding, water scarcity, diversion of river water and consequent unrest in the northeast where the administrative control of the state has been historically feeble,” Singh said.The new project fits well with China’s turn towards coercive diplomacy and weaponisation of dependence elsewhere, Singh said, giving the example of the ongoing China-Australia trade spat.“Natural resources and Tibetan water reservoirs will potentially be weaponised with India and S-E Asia. There are no good options for New Delhi… But India itself has been unwilling to negotiate trans-boundary river water sharing with Bangladesh. The upper riparian holds all the cards,” Singh added.Liu Xiaoxue, south Asia watcher at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, a leading Chinese government-affiliated think tank, said the dam will give an opportunity for China and India to cooperate, but New Delhi’s apprehensions will remain.“My opinion is that it will surely benefit both sides leading to mutual prosperity. But given the huge deficit of political mutual trust between India and China, there is no doubt it will result in a strong resistance from the Indian side,” she told HT.“Actually, in today’s world, to handle cross-border rivers remains a big challenge to any concerned party. India and China as upstream and downstream countries as well as two emerging powers are supposed to develop a more sensible and sustainable way to solve their differences,” Li said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/our-right-to-build-dam-on-brahmaputra-says-china-as-experts-warn-of-impact/story-t1enUMRHZXvOjU4WnZG1DK.html
03-12-2020||World||China drafts new law on grains reserves amid food security concerns||China published a new draft law on management of its grain reserves on Thursday to include oversight of stocks in regions and provinces as it seeks to bolster its food security.Previous rules governing grain reserves only applied to its central state stockpiles but Beijing has this year heightened its focus on risks to food supply.The law was drawn up as “new situations and questions have risen regarding grains reserves security administration, posing severe challenges to China’s grains stockpile security,” the National Development and Reform Commission said in a statement on its website.China said in May that it would draft and carry out both near and long term plans on ensuring food security amid the global coronavirus pandemic.The pandemic has disrupted agriculture supply chains worldwide, threatening to trigger a potential food crisis and as the virus continues to spread across the world.Local governments should build up reserves of processed grains and oils of an appropriate scale in central areas of medium-large cities and regions with markets that are prone to volatility, the state planner said.“The state’s need to secure grains output and its capability to control domestic supplies has become more urgent,” said Meng Jinhui, senior analyst with Shengda Futures.The new law stipulates how the reserve volumes should be set and the products to be included, as well as when the grains can be released.Reserves should only be used in cases of obvious grains shortage, significant price moves, major natural disasters or other emergencies.The document also encourages urban and rural residents to stockpile grains in a reasonable way.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-drafts-new-law-on-grains-reserves-amid-food-security-concerns/story-pDwN8PoGhL8xS5BMUMxfrN.html
03-12-2020||World||Trump running out of time to solidify immigration agenda after US election loss||President Donald Trump’s administration is pushing to finalize new immigration restrictions before his term ends in January, according to three senior homeland security officials, a last-gasp effort in a policy area that was a central focus during his four years in office.The moves come even as Democratic President-elect Joe Biden has pledged to rescind many of Trump’s immigration policies. By finalizing rules that have just been proposed, or issuing last-minute orders, the administration could slow down Biden’s efforts to undo many of Trump’s signature measures that have made it harder for immigrants to enter and settle in the United States.A central goal for Trump’s last few weeks in office is replacing a lottery system used to award H-1B visas to skilled foreign workers, according to officials with the US Department of Homeland Security, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss government operations. Instead, a new selection process would favor visa applicants with higher-paying jobs.The Trump administration argued in a proposed version of the regulation released in October that the change is needed to better protect US workers.White House senior adviser Stephen Miller - considered the architect of Trump’s hard-line immigration agenda - told Reuters over the summer that the regulations meant to drive up wages in the H-1B program would be politically unpopular to reverse.Other measures that could be hurried to the finish line include new rules to restrict access to asylum and a regulation that would allow federal immigration officials to collect DNA from family-based visa applicants and the US citizens or permanent residents who sponsor them.Another measure would tighten visa rules for international students, cultural exchange visitors and foreign journalists.The changes would take the form of regulatory actions that are crafted by agencies and do not require congressional approval but need to follow legal processes outlined in federal law.News reports have also surfaced about a possible Trump executive order to weaken the constitutional right to citizenship for all people born in the United States. A senior homeland security official told Reuters, however, the effort did not appear to be a priority for the White House.Acting DHS Deputy Secretary Ken Cuccinelli is spearheading the last-ditch immigration effort, one official told Reuters, as the president continues to promote unfounded claims of widespread voter fraud and has not conceded his Nov. 3 election defeat.The White House and DHS declined to comment.Trump is not the first president to engage in a last-minute policy push, according to Republican strategist Alex Conant.“Every outgoing administration tries to do as much as they can before the clock runs out,” he said. “There are a lot of true believers in this White House who think immigration is bad for the country and are spending their last hours in power trying to cement their policies.”Most of Trump’s immigration plans are unlikely to be finished, however, before he leaves office and the ones that are hastily pushed through will be vulnerable to court challenges.A federal judge on Tuesday blocked two different fast-tracked Trump rules targeting the H-1B program. The judge said the administration failed to show “good cause” to skip regulatory steps that typically take months or longer.Rules that have not taken effect by the time Biden takes office on Jan. 20 could be delayed and eventually rescinded, according to three experts in government regulations.Any work in Trump’s final month in office will also likely be slowed down by the Christmas and New Year’s holidays and possible departures of Trump appointees, which is typical for outgoing administrations.One closely watched policy area will be any final Trump actions related to the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, which was instituted by President Barack Obama, whom Biden served as vice president.The Supreme Court in June thwarted Trump’s attempt to end DACA, which offers deportation relief and work permits to some 646,000 “Dreamer” immigrants brought to the United States as children but who lack legal status.After the ruling, the Trump administration said it would still consider ending the program and then issued an order that narrowed its scope.Even though a federal judge ruled against that move in November, the administration could try other last-minute avenues to hamper the program.“Nothing would surprise us,” said Frank Sharry, executive director of the pro-immigrant America’s Voice.Biden has promised to send legislation to Congress that would provide a path to citizenship to the estimated 11 million immigrants living in the country illegally, including those enrolled in the DACA program.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-running-out-of-time-to-solidify-immigration-agenda-after-us-election-loss/story-vGymsB94Z8XVjjqliYYV9K.html

03-12-2020||World||Game not over in Covid-19 fight, warns UK PM||Prime Minister Boris Johnson sought to strike a note of caution amid the excitement of the UK becoming the first country to approve the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine against Covid-19, warning that it is not “game over” for the deadly virus just yet.Click here for complete coverage of Covid-19Johnson hailed the “searchlights of science” fighting back against the world’s “invisible enemy” but urged people to not get carried away with over optimism over the course of the “long and cold months” ahead while the two-dose vaccine starts to be injected into the arms of those at the highest risk of death from the disease. He urged people to follow the Covid Winter Plan of tiered lockdown which is now in force across England, with a majority of areas still under high alert measures of social distancing.“It is a fantastic moment, but the worst thing now would be to think that this is the moment when we can relax our guard and think it’s game over in the fight against Covid. It’s not. This is not the end,” Johnson said, during a briefing at 10 Downing Street on Wednesday evening.“We have been waiting and hoping for the day when the searchlights of science would pick out our invisible enemy and give us the power to stop that enemy from making us ill – and now the scientists have done it,” he said. “It is all the more vital that as we celebrate this scientific achievement we are not carried away with over optimism, or fall into the naïve belief that the struggle is over. It’s not, we’ve got to stick to our Winter Plan,” he noted.The UK PM confirmed that in line with the advice of the independent Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI), the first phase of the vaccine deployment will include care home residents, health and care staff, the elderly and those who are clinically extremely vulnerable.“But there are immense logistical challenges: the vaccine must be stored at minus 70 degrees and each person needs two injections, three weeks apart. So it will inevitably take some months before all the most vulnerable are protected,” he said.“[But] we are no longer resting on the mere hope that we can return to normal next year in the spring, but rather on the sure and certain knowledge that we will succeed,” he added.His address came hours after the UK government confirmed that it has accepted the independent Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) assessment and authorised the use of Pfizer/BioNTech to immunise against Covid-19. Now, authorisation has been granted, Pfizer will begin delivery of the vaccine to the UK. In making the recommendation to authorise supply, the MHRA will decide what additional quality assurance checks may be required before a vaccine can be made available.The UK claims to be the first country to pre-order supplies of the vaccine from Pfizer/BioNTech, with 800,000 doses being made available next week and 40 million doses ordered overall – enough to vaccinate up to a third of the population, and the majority of doses anticipated in the first half of next year.“As a nation, we owe every scientist, clinician and trial volunteer an enormous debt of gratitude for their victory won against odds that at times seemed impossible. It is thanks to their efforts, and of our Vaccine Taskforce, that the UK was the first country to sign a deal with Pfizer/BioNTech and will now be the first to deploy their vaccine,” said UK Business Secretary Alok Sharma.The MHRA started the rolling review of Pfizer/BioNTech’s data in October and the UK government asked the regulator to assess the vaccine for its suitability for authorisation under Regulation 174 of the Human Medicines Regulations, enabling the temporary supply of medicines to be authorised. The regulator has stressed that a speedy timeline does not mean any “corners have been cut” and the vaccine was declared safe for human use only after very rigorous checks.Also Read | Good progress being made on Brexit trade deal, British minister says“This vaccine has now passed all of the extensive checks needed for authorisation to supply and will soon be ready to be delivered to the NHS,” said Professor Jonathan Van-Tam, Deputy Chief Medical Officer for England.The state-funded National Health Service (NHS) for England said deployment plans will include hospital hubs for NHS and care staff and older patients to get vaccinated; local community services with local teams and General Practitioners already signing up to take part in the programme; and vaccination centres across the country, ensuring people can access a vaccine regardless of where they live.“This is a momentous occasion and provides fresh hope that we can beat this pandemic, with the UK at the forefront of this revolutionary breakthrough,” said Health Secretary Matt Hancock.The vaccine will be available for free across the UK, with the government working with the devolved administrations to ensure it is deployed fairly across all four nations – England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. There has been some social media buzz around warning people against so-called “vaccine tourism” as only UK nationals and residents who qualify as high risk will have access to the vaccine at this stage.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/game-not-over-in-covid-19-fight-warns-uk-pm/story-lS3xEVsiTvrfXuxeZ9BX0O.html
03-12-2020||World||China has brought modern-day slavery into 21st century: Uyghur activist on abolition of slavery day||As the world celebrated the International Day for the Abolition of Slavery, an Uyghur American activist, Rushan Abbas, on Wednesday pointed out that the “gruesome stain in humanity’s history” is an ongoing issue as “China has brought modern-day slavery into the 21st century”.“One would hope that humanity has outgrown such prehistoric and barbaric practices. And yet, here we are, ending the year 2020 and growing closer to a new decade, still fighting to abolish slavery as if it were a new concept,” said Abbas, pointing towards “China’s genocide against Uyghurs”.Uyghurs, a Turkic Muslim ethnic minority, mostly live in the western China province. The Chinese government for decades has been trying to assimilate the Uyghurs by force into the country’s majority Han cultural identity.She gave examples of her family members and in-laws who are in China’s “concentration camps”. “Both Abdulhakim (husband) and I have family members who are extrajudicially detained inside China’s concentration camps. We don’t have any information on their well-being, their whereabouts or even if they’re alive. They are treated as slaves for China’s economic advancements. China has, in effect, brought modern-day slavery into the 21st century and state leaders have failed to act,” she said.“What does this mean for us? It means that much of the world’s fast fashion and affordable goods that are so often “made in China” are made by enslaved Uyghurs,” she added.Also Read | Muslims in Nepal hold protest demanding justice for China’s UyghurShe further says, “China claims these forced labour facilities and concentration camps are “vocational training centers.” However, these are lies, spun by the CCP to fulfill their economic goals on the blood, sweat, tears and lives of the Uyghur people.”About the conditions inside these “concentration camps, the activist said, “My own sister and my husband’s entire family is languishing inside dark, cold cells... deprived of humane conditions, adequate food/water, medication and torn from their loving families... and for what? To make CalvinKlein bags, Adidas shoes, Apple laptops and Zara tops? My sister, Dr Gulshan Abbas is a retired medical doctor...” She urged people to take time out to learn about the plight of the Uyghurs and “practice diligence and caution when buying any new product”. “Make sure that an Uyghur didn’t suffer to make the item that you bought. I pray that humankind can learn to respect, have compassion and love for one another, that slavery will be a thing of the past. No human deserves to be deprived of their freedom and suffer the abuses that Uyghurs face at the hands of the Chinese government,” she added.A sizeable Muslim population in Xinjiang has been incarcerating in an expanding network of “political re-education” camps, according to US officials and UN experts.People in the internment camps are reportedly subjected to forced political indoctrination, torture, beatings and denial of food and medicine, besides being prohibited from practising their religion or speaking their language.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-has-brought-modern-day-slavery-into-21st-century-uyghur-activist-on-abolition-of-slavery-day/story-vD9zDelHgrjY4XXwE8D3TO.html
03-12-2020||World||Scientists reset biological clock to restore vision in old mice||A team of scientists at Harvard Medical School have turned back the clock on aged eye cells in the retina to reverse vision loss in elderly mice with a condition mimicking human glaucoma, according to a study published in Nature on December 2. This proof-of-concept study demonstrates the epigenetic reprogramming of complex tissues, such as the nerve cells of the eye, to a younger age when they can repair and replace tissue damaged from age-related conditions and diseases. The approach paves the way for therapies to promote tissue repair of various organs to reverse aging and age-related diseases in humans.“That ageing (the loss of cellular functions over time) can (at least in a mouse) be safely reversed in a complex tissue such as the eye to restore its youthful functions. It implies that, in mammals, there is a reset switch that can erase many of the problems that accumulate with ageing. It implicates the epigenome (gene regulation), specifically epigenetic noise that accumulates over time, as a central cause of ageing,” said senior author Dr David Sinclair, professor of genetics in the Blavatnik Institute and co-director of the Paul F. Glenn Center for Biology of Aging Research at Harvard Medical School, in an email.Also read | Research shows bariatric surgery may reduce severity of Covid-19 in patients with obesity“If affirmed through further studies, these findings could be transformative for the care of age-related vision diseases like glaucoma and to the fields of biology and medical therapeutics for disease at large,” Dr Sinclair said.Glaucoma is an optic neuropathy marked by progressive degeneration of the optic nerve and is the second leading cause of irreversible blindness, after cataract. The study is the first to demonstrate that it is possible to reverse vision loss, rather than stop its progress, in animals with a condition mimicking human glaucoma. Dr Sinclair and his team used an adeno-associated virus (AAV) as a vehicle to deliver into the retinas of mice three youth-restoring genes—Oct4, Sox2 and Klf4—that are normally switched on during embryonic development. The three genes, together with a fourth one, which was not used in this work, are collectively known as Yamanaka factors. This promoted nerve regeneration following optic-nerve injury in mice with damaged optic nerves, reversed vision loss in animals with a condition mimicking human glaucoma, and reversed vision loss in aging animals without glaucoma. “The (Yamanaka) factors have been used to make pluripotent stem cells in the dish and used to make cells that are returned to the body. They cause cancer or kill animals when turned on. We show it is possible to use a subset of them to reverse aging, and in existing cells within the body,” said Dr Sinclair. The treatment resulted in a two-fold increase in the number of surviving retinal ganglion cells after the injury and a five-fold increase in nerve regrowth. “Previous studies identified factors that can promote retinal ganglion cells survival and regeneration, but none showed restoration of vision. Sinclair’s group very cleverly used only three (Oct4, Sox2, Klf4) of the four ‘Yamanaka factors’ and restored eyesight after damage to the optic nerve. Thus, avoiding unwanted tumors growth or cell death by not using the c-Myc. Although this study provides proof of principle in mice, it is a huge step forward for the field of regenerative medicine,” said Prof Keshav K Singh, professor of Genetics, pathology and environmental health at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, who has done extensive work in mitochondrial genetics, including reversing skin aging in mice. Lead author Yuancheng Lu, research fellow in genetics at Harvard Medical Lab and a former doctoral student in Sinclair’s lab, builds on the Nobel-winning discovery of Shinya Yamanaka, who identified the four transcription factors, Oct4, Sox2, Klf4, c-Myc, that could erase epigenetics markers on cells and return these cells to their primitive embryonic state from which they can develop into any other type of cell. Subsequent studies identified two major setbacks -- the four Yamanaka factors could induce tumour growth when used in adult mice, which made them unsafe, and could also erase the cell’s identity by resetting the cellular state to its most primitive. Lu and colleagues circumvented these hurdles by dropping the gene c-Myc to deliver the remaining three Yamanaka genes, Oct4, Sox2 and Klf4. The modified approach successfully reversed cellular aging without fuelling tumour growth or losing their identity. The findings set the stage for treatment of various age-related diseases in humans. “The study has significance for regenerative medicine towards slowing down or reversing aging related decline in organ function. Yes, gene therapy holds promise to promote tissue repair and reverse age-related diseases in due course, after relevant safety and efficacy studies,” said Dr Anurag Agrawal, director, Council of Scientific and Industr​ial Research-Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology, New Delhi. “The Yamanaka factors can be potentially used to treat neurodegeneration, arthritis, organ deterioration, and other age-related conditions,” said Dr Sinclair.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/scientists-reset-biological-clock-to-restore-vision-in-old-mice-pave-way-for-new-treatments-of-age-related-diseases/story-JiqLyEVKodF2U5TFQLirUP.html
03-12-2020||World||Presidential pardons: Here’s the list of key allies, family members Trump could pardon||Amid reports of US Department of Justice investigating a potential presidential pardon bribery scheme, President Donald Trump is expected to use his clemency power to pardon or commute the sentences of his allies before leaving the office. Last month, Trump pardoned former national security adviser Michael Flynn, who had pleaded guilty to lying to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) about contacts with the Russian ambassador to Washington. Calling Flynn “an innocent man”, the White House said in a statement that he should have never been prosecuted. It described the retired US Army three-star lieutenant general as the “victim of partisan government officials engaged in a coordinated attempt to subvert the election of 2016.” As of November 26, Trump has granted clemency 45 times, including 29 pardons and 16 commutations, which is the lowest of any US president since William McKinley.While Trump has used his expansive power less frequently than any other president in modern history, a CNN report suggests that the outgoing commander-in-chief might stretch the power to save his allies as well as his family members from future prosecution, even though they haven’t been charged with any crime.Heres’s the list of key people Trump might be considering to pardon in the coming days:Donald Trump: In June 2018, Trump made clear in a tweet that the thought of self-pardoning occurred to him, stating that he has the “absolute right” to pardon himself. “As has been stated by numerous legal scholars, I have the absolute right to PARDON myself, but why would I do that when I have done nothing wrong?” tweeted Trump.Rudy Giuliani: Trump’s personal lawyer allegedly sought dirt on Joe Biden from foreign governments, particularly Ukraine, in a quid-pro-quo. During Trump’s impeachment hearings, US envoy Gordon Sondland had testified that Trump and Giuliani sought a ‘quid pro quo’ with Ukraine. The Trump administration is accused of withholding $400 million in military aid to Ukraine and pressurising the country to launch an investigation into Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden.Also Read | How Trump compares to other US presidents on pardons and commutationsIvanka Trump and Jared Kushner: The couple worked on Trump’s campaigns as well as in the White House in advisory roles.

03-12-2020||World||US, Australia, India push back on Chinese influence. It’s QUAD in action | Analysis||Australian lawmakers on Thursday cleared legislation that gives the federal government power to veto any agreement struck with foreign states. The law is seen to be targeted at China that had signed up the south Australia state of Victoria in 2018 for President Xi Jinping’s signature Belt and Road Initiative.  ”Australia’s policies and plans, the rules that we make for our country are made here in Australia according to our needs and our interests,” Prime Minister Scott Morrison told reporters in Canberra soon after.A few hours earlier, the United States’ House of Representatives had cleared legislation to delist foreign firms that don’t adhere to US auditing standards, a move that could lead to Chinese companies including behemoths such as Alibaba Group, Baidu Inc and PetroChina getting kicked off American exchanges if they don’t let US regulators review their financial audits.China watchers in New Delhi said the two laws that seek to curb Chinese influence wasn’t a standalone effort.“It is QUAD in action,” one of them said, referring to the informal group of Japan, Australia, the United States and India.Foreign ministers of the four countries met in Japan in October over concerns about Chinese attempts to flex its muscles in its neighbourhood including India’s Ladakh region, the South China Sea and the East China Sea and to ensure a free and open Indo-Pacific based on rule of law and freedom of navigationIndia has been engaged in a standoff with Chinese troops over its attempts to take control of Indian territory along the Line of Actual Control for more than six months. The two armies even clashed in Galwan valley in June that led to casualties on both sides but have mostly managed to keep the situation under control since then. Japan has been uncomfortable at China’s continuing attempts to undermine Japan’s administration over the Senkaku Islands, the East China Sea islets claimed by Beijing that have pushed Tokyo to increase its defence budget to a record high and scale up defence cooperation.Last month, Japan Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga announced a breakthrough agreement on a defence pact with Australia that will allow reciprocal visits for training and operations. This pact is the first in 60 years that approves a deal permitting foreign troops to operate on its soil.“You can see a concerted effort by QUAD; the three middle powers - India, Australia and Japan - backed by a superpower - the US - to not only reduce the influence of China in their respective countries but in their respective regions. Sometimes, far beyond,” the official mentioned above added.It was a reference to the US Deputy Secretary of State Stephen E Biegun’s visit to Bangladesh in October facilitated by New Delhi to reset ties and extend its support. Biegun was the first high-ranking US official in at least a decade to travel to Dhaka, a visit that was described as hugely successful. Officials said one immediate fallout of the joint initiative was Dhaka’s reported reluctance to host Defence Minister Wei Fenghe when he travelled to Kathmandu and Islamabad over the past week.It also was in the context of the larger effort to contain China’s influence that New Delhi has resumed diplomatic engagement with Nepal, sending top officials to Kathmandu to repair relations with the Himalayan nation that had upset India over its controversial political map that included Indian territory. Nepal’s foreign minister Pradeep Kumar Gyawali is scheduled to raise the level of engagement when he visits New Delhi later this month.Simultaneously, India also last week sent National Security Adviser Ajit Doval to Colombo to revive the trilateral maritime security cooperation dialogue with Sri Lanka and the Maldives in face of Chinese attempts to step up defence linkages with smaller countries in the region.Also Read: China has itself to blame for strong QUAD | AnalysisNew Delhi had suspended this dialogue to expand maritime security cooperation in 2014 after its relations with the Maldives soured under the previous Abdulla Yameen regime who was seen to be acting under Chinese influence.A few weeks earlier, India had gifted Myanmar, another country in the neighbourhood which has come under pressure from Beijing, a 3,000 diesel-electric submarine INS Sindhuvir. People familiar with the developments have said the move had helped New Delhi get an edge over China, which pushes its military hardware among countries in the neighbourhood.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/india-china-quad-us/story-F5SeBZWBlOj5oANWdQA3pO.html
03-12-2020||World||Germany extends restrictions to fight Covid-19 spread||Chancellor Angela Merkel said Germany will extend its partial lockdown by three more weeks into next year as the country struggles to regain control of the coronavirus spread.Click here for complete coverage of Covid-19Bars, gyms and cinemas will remain closed until Jan 10 and the government will reconvene with regional leaders on Jan. 4 to reassess the restrictions, Merkel said late Wednesday after talks with the premiers of Germany’s 16 states.The country’s infection rates are still far too high and need to come down faster, Merkel said in Berlin. “We have to bemoan a very high number of deaths every day, which shows the amount of responsibility that we have.”Germany had 23,275 new cases in the 24 hours through Thursday morning and total infections have more than doubled since the measures started, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. The latest daily death toll was 482, close to a record.Merkel’s administration last week already extended the partial shutdown until Dec 20 while keeping schools and much of the economy open. The so-called “lockdown light” has yielded little progress in slowing the spread to levels the government has determined as manageable.Merkel on Wednesday reiterated that the seven-day incidence per 100,000 citizens needs to come down to around 50 -- and stay there -- before restrictions can be loosened. It was unchanged at 134 on Thursday, according to the latest data from Germany’s RKI public health institute.RKI President Lothar Wieler said that the infection numbers have leveled out but are not yet showing any palpable sign of declining. “Weary” health authorities are no longer able to track cases effectively and some hospitals are approaching the limit of their capacity, with operations and treatments delayed, he added.Care Homes“We are seeing more and more outbreaks in care homes,” Wieler said Thursday at a news conference, urging citizens to respect hygiene and distancing rules and protect vulnerable groups. “These restrictions will be with us for a long time, until a sufficient section of the population has been vaccinated.”Also Read | EU stops short of advising against holiday travel over virusCurbs might be tightened further in January if the number of new cases doesn’t come down fast enough, according to Bavarian State Premier Markus Soeder.“We should not shy away from acting much more consequently,” said the conservative politician, who is seen as a candidate to succeed Merkel as chancellor next year.Merkel has said before that the country will likely prolong its partial shutdown into January unless there’s an unexpectedly rapid decline in contagion rates. By contrast, France and Britain, which imposed tougher restrictions, are now cautiously moving to loosen curbs ahead of the Christmas holidays.The lack of progress in stemming the spread is increasing tension over how to protect the economy. Merkel said the government can’t continue to reimburse affected businesses for 75% of lost sales next year.Eckhardt Rehberg, budget spokesman for Merkel’s parliamentary caucus, said the chancellor is right to turn the focus away from compensating businesses for lost sales and back to so-called bridge aid. Under the program, which has been extended until the end of June, companies can apply for assistance with fixed costs such as heating and rent.Spending 15 billion euros ($18 billion) a month on sales compensation “cannot be justified either to other sectors of the economy or to the taxpayer,” Rehberg said Thursday in an interview with Deutschlandfunk radio. “The state won’t be able to afford to pay for everything,” and “we still have the challenge of financing intensive-care beds for hospitals and rolling out the vaccine.”Merkel dampened expectations that new medication can quickly put an end to the disease. She said it’s unclear if a vaccine for the virus will be available before Christmas, but added that Pfizer Inc., BioNTech SE and Moderna Inc. will deliver 7 million doses in the first quarter of 2021.Governments across the world are hoping for a rapid rollout of such vaccines to bring an end to the pandemic.

03-12-2020||World||Tibetan social media platforms challenge Chinese govt amid suppression||Despite the attempts by the authoritarian Chinese Communist Party (CCP) to curb freedom of expression, right to information, association and religion in Tibet, there has been a rise in domestic social media giving platform to voices challenging the government-sponsored news.The CCP censors the internet and maintains intensive surveillance apparatus in the form of facial recognition technology and Global Positioning System (GPS) coordination in its occupied territories including Tibet, East Turkistan (Xinjiang), and Southern Mongolian (Inner Mongolia), reported The Taiwan Times.With the aim to control the “digital ecosystem”, the social media accounts linked to the CCP propaganda campaign is being used to spread disinformation on social media such as Twitter, Facebook, etc.They have been used to promote content attacking critics of the Chinese government and to spread conspiracy theories blaming the US for waging a biological war against China, The Taiwan Times reported.Meanwhile, the government has blocked websites run by human rights groups, foreign media, Google search engine and social media sites such as Facebook, Twitter, etc.China is considered to be having one of the most pervasive online censorship system in the world, the country’s infamous “Great Firewall” blocks access and censors numerous websites, The Taiwan Times reported.Despite these attempts, a series of images and videos of 156 Self Immolators inside Tibet were sent through social media, the Taiwanese media outlet informed. During the coronavirus pandemic information on personal accounts of life under lockdown was shared on social media. Besides, intensive discussions were leaked with images and videos exposing high ranking officials of their mismanagement, lack of transparency and accountability, The Taiwan Times said.With the aim to muzzle the voices of Tibetans, the CCP this year arrested 10 Tibetans in Lhasa for spreading ‘rumors’ about the coronavirus outbreak on March 12 on WeChat, The Taiwan Times reported.“In July two Tibetan lyricists, Khado Tsetan and singer Tsegao, were sentenced to seven years and three years in prison respectively by a Chinese court in North-Eastern Tibet without a trial after they composed, sang and circulated a song praising Tibetan spiritual leader, H.H. the Dalai Lama. They have been charged for alleged involvement in “subversion of state law and leaking information to the outside world, which is considered as a “state security crime,” said the Free Tibet website.Meanwhile, a Tibetan girl was arrested from the same region for having shared the song on social media.It is a common practise across Tibet and East Turkistan (Xinjiang) that if complaints were made and voices raised, they are liable to face further punishments, The Taiwan Times said while adding that after their release the political prisoners are put under strict surveillance where every move is constantly watched. Besides putting the families of these political prisoners under surveillance, they are also denied access to subsidies and government jobs.Citing the example of Tibetan language rights advocate Tashi Wangchuk, The Taiwan Times further said that he was sentenced to five years for “inciting separatism” in a closed-door trial by Yushu Intermediate People’s Court for voicing concerns in an interview with The New York Times.Despite the global outcry, the Chinese court rejected his appeal and also denied him access to his lawyer. Human Rights Watch’s China director, Sophie Richardson was quoted as saying: “Tashi Wangchuk’s only ‘crime’ was to peacefully call for the right of minority peoples to use their own language”. In the seventh Tibet Work Forum held in Beijing from August 28 and 2, President Xi Jinping emphasised on intensifying and Sinicising Tibetans and their culture through the “patriotic reeducation”. He also emphasized against “anti-Dalai Lama Campaigns in Tibet” with the expansion of mass education to promote “socialism with Chinese Characteristics”, said The Taiwan Times. To counter or rather silence these criticisms, the state media like Global Times and Xinhua had to resort to regular publishing of opinion articles. Further, the CCP has used both the electronic and print media to be its mouthpiece for propaganda.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/tibetan-social-media-platforms-challenge-chinese-govt-amid-suppression/story-RHqdGt28MNFvs9XP8XtOGO.html
03-12-2020||World||Facebook accused of squeezing rival startups in virtual reality||Virtual-reality startups are accusing Facebook Inc. of using a familiar playbook to muscle out rivals in what could be the digital platform of the future -- prompting a new line of scrutiny from US competition enforcers.Facebook is the world’s biggest virtual-reality hardware maker thanks to its 2014 acquisition of Oculus for $2 billion. Its practices are now drawing the attention of the Justice Department’s antitrust division, which is talking to developers about their interactions with the company, according to two people familiar with the matter.The scrutiny over Facebook’s virtual-reality business reflects broader concerns that the social-media pioneer has grown too powerful. One U.S. lawmaker, during a hearing with Facebook Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg, attributed the company’s dominance to a simple strategy: Copy, acquire and kill any company that’s a competitive threat.Software developers and startup founders say the world’s biggest social media company is now using that same playbook to undermine competition in the virtual-reality market.Facebook’s Oculus acquisition was a bet by Zuckerberg that virtual reality would go beyond gaming to encompass a broad array of experiences and eventually change the way people work and communicate, experts say.Facebook is pushing hard to establish its presence in virtual reality because it represents a unique opportunity for the social media player to establish itself as the leader in the next state-of-the-art platform to deliver products and services to its users without relying on Alphabet Inc.’s Google or Apple Inc.The Federal Trade Commission is preparing to bring an antitrust case against Facebook as soon as next week. But that investigation has been focused mostly on whether the company’s acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp harmed competition, Bloomberg has reported.The social media giant last year disclosed an investigation by the Justice Department, but neither the company nor the department has provided details or explained how the inquiry is different from the FTC probe. The FTC declined to comment. The Justice Department didn’t respond to a request seeking comment.Developers say Facebook is using its market power to thwart companies that offer competing games and services. It’s copying the most promising ideas, using below-cost pricing for its devices and making it harder for some apps to work properly on the platform, according to developers and a hardware maker.Faceboook declined to comment about the complaints.Facebook has a 39% share of the virtual-reality hardware market, making it the industry’s largest player, according to data from market intelligence firm International Data Corporation. Smaller players include Lenovo Group Ltd., Sony Corp. and HTC Corp., while Apple is developing its own mixed virtual and augmented reality headset for launch as early as 2022, Bloomberg has reported. Facebook launched its latest headset, the Quest 2, in October, cutting the price to $299 from $399.At the core of the complaints is the way Facebook runs the platform and competes against software developers who build apps and depend on the platform for their business.“Our industry is getting eaten alive by Facebook,” said Cix Liv, who co-founded startup Yur Inc., which makes technology that can be integrated into Oculus games to track fitness metrics. “Any application that has a chance of being mildly competitive with them, they have to kill it somehow.”Yur released its fitness tracking app for Oculus in September 2019 and spent months working to satisfy Facebook’s security, privacy and performance benchmarks to get the app into the Oculus app store. While the app was available to users on another marketplace, Liv said, Yur couldn’t get it into the Oculus store even though he said the startup met Facebook’s requirements.Facebook in the spring released a software update for Oculus that prevented Yur’s technology from working within games, according to Liv. Liv said Yur was the only company that experienced such an issue. Subsequent updates required users to delete the Yur app in order to get the Oculus headset working again.Then in September, Facebook released its own fitness tracker called Oculus Move that Liv said has the same functionality and look as Yur’s product. He accuses Facebook of effectively killing his product by keeping it out of the store and breaking its functionality, all while working to copy his technology.The reason is simple, Liv says: Facebook wants to favor its own products on the platform so it can collect as much data about users as possible in order to “control the future of ads by knowing more about you than any company in history.”Virtual-reality consultant Nima Zeighami said Facebook “locked down the ecosystem so much that if someone makes an app that competes with them too much, they can just blacklist them.”Liv said he was forced out of his company after speaking out against Facebook on Twitter about a month ago. He said the venture capital fund backing his startup, Venture Reality Fund, told him that he would have to leave the company if he continued criticizing Facebook. Liv said he believed the fund sought to pacify Facebook because of its potential to acquire the fitness app and other startups the fund is backing.One of the fund’s partners, Tipatat Chennavasin, denied telling Liv that he had to leave the company if he kept criticizing Facebook.The criticisms against Facebook echo those leveled against other tech giants, such as Amazon.com Inc., which sells its own branded products in competition with third-party sellers on its marketplace. Apple also owns the App Store, where its products compete against those of developers who depend on the store to sell their apps.In October, Democrats on the House antitrust panel recommended that Congress prohibit a dominant platform from competing against companies that operate on the platform -- in essence, to break them up.Other app developers have similar stories of copied products and functionality issues regarding Facebook. One is Guy Godin, a developer who created Virtual Desktop Inc., which allows users to replicate their computer desktops on the Oculus headset. It was released on Oculus in 2016 and has become a top seller on the platform, he said.In June 2019, Godin introduced a version that could stream games and other content to the Oculus headset, a feature that was popular with gamers because they weren’t tethered to their computers with a cable, Godin said.A few weeks later, Facebook told him to remove the feature or else his app would be pulled from the Oculus store. Facebook explained it was due to poor user experience and health and safety issues. Godin called those claims “totally bogus” but said he had no choice but to comply because he depends on Oculus for 90% of his revenue.In September that year, Facebook announced it was releasing a competing product called Oculus Link, which allowed users to stream content but required a cabled connection to the user’s computer.Godin said he’s happy to compete against Facebook’s product but that it isn’t a level playing field because the company controls what features he can offer.“They just want to own it all,” he said. “If there’s only one company, it’s going to be very hard to survive as a developer.”The complaints mirror allegations about Facebook raised in the findings of the House investigation of tech platforms.“Facebook is a case study, in my opinion, in monopoly power because your company harvests and monetizes our data, and then your company uses that data to spy on competitors and to copy, acquire and kill rivals,” Representative Pramila Jayapal, a Washington Democrat, told Zuckerberg when he testified in July.A group of more than 40 developers organized in September and considered writing an open letter to Facebook calling for more transparency to its Oculus store policies and other changes to benefit developers, according to Liv. He said they’re now looking to team up with an established organization that can represent their views similar to the way Apple’s App Store developers created the Coalition for App Fairness.To help secure its position in the market, Facebook is selling the Oculus headset at a loss, according to Stan Larroque, the founder and CEO of Lynx, a Paris startup that promotes its virtual-reality headset to businesses. Engineers at Lynx, whose headset uses many of the same components as Oculus’s Quest headset, estimate that Facebook sells the latest version of the headset, the Quest 2, at a $50 loss per device, said Larroque. That makes it impossible for smaller device makers to compete, he said.“The message is we’re Facebook and we don’t care if we make money or not, but we’ll flood the market and virtual reality will be Facebook Reality pretty soon,” Larroque said.The House report warned that below-cost pricing, also known as predatory pricing, is a risk in digital markets because they tend to be characterized by a winner-take-all dynamic, where one or two companies end up dominating. As a result, there’s an incentive to pursue growth over profit by engaging in predatory pricing for some period to force out competitors.Developers also complain that Facebook squeezes them by forcing them to pay a commission on sales, a complaint also leveled at Apple. One of them is Darshan Shankar, the founder and CEO of Bigscreen Inc., which lets users stream movies on the Oculus headset and interact virtually with friends as they watch together.When a user rents a movie on Bigscreen, they have to use the Oculus in-app purchase system, which collects 30% of the rental fee. That ultimately makes the economics of the business unworkable for the start-up, he said. Shankar said Facebook refuses to negotiate on the 30% commission that Bigscreen has to pay.“It’s literally impossible for anyone to start an e-commerce or media business in VR because these walled gardens are gatekeepers,” he said. “Entire industries are impossible because of them.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/facebook-accused-of-squeezing-rival-startups-in-virtual-reality/story-z8AsuDZY4brj4C13zbNsWK.html

The Counter Terrorism Department (CTD) of Punjab police had registered as many as 41 FIRs against JuD leaders, including Saeed in different cities. The trial courts have so far decided 25 cases.The ATC has sentenced Saeed for a collective imprisonment of 21 years on terror financing charges under sections 11-N of Anti-Terrorism Act 1997 in four cases so far.Saeed-led JuD is the front organisation for the Lashkar-e-Taiba which is responsible for carrying out the 2008 Mumbai attack that killed 166 people, including six Americans.The US named Saeed as a Specially Designated Global Terrorist, and the country, since 2012, has offered a USD 10 million bounty on Saeed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pak-atc-jails-yahya-mujahid-spokesperson-of-hafiz-saeed-led-jud-to-15-years/story-FvRYp1f7IslVxYzMoke5IK.html

The steps were needed to avoid risking “needless suffering and death,” he said.The order, which supersedes one from June, prohibits public and private gatherings of people from more than one household and states that all businesses in the city that require people to work on location must stop operations. Walking, driving, travel on public transport, bikes, motorcycles and scooters are prohibited, other than for those undertaking essential activities.There are several exemptions, including for faith-based outdoor services and the homeless. Others that can continue to operate include supermarkets, grocery stores and health-care operations, but that doesn’t cover gyms and similar facilities. Still, activities such as golf, tennis and pickleball are permitted, according to the order.The city’s safety protocols on social distancing follow those developed by Los Angeles County, Garcetti said. S&P futures turned negative after the order.Los Angeles County has the most infections of any county in the US, with 408,396 confirmed cases and 7,700 deaths. Nationwide, Covid-19 fatalities reached more than 2,700 Wednesday, the deadliest day so far, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University.Anyone over the age of 16 traveling into LA must complete an online form upon arrival to acknowledge they’ve read and understood a California travel advisory.

03-12-2020||World||Prepared to accept election defeat if it is ‘accurate’ result, says Trump||Donald Trump has said that he is prepared to accept any poll result if it is “accurate”, even as the US President repeated his unsubstantiated allegations of large-scale voter fraud and electoral malpractice in the presidential election.Democratic leader Joe Biden has defeated incumbent president Trump, Republican, in the November 3 presidential election. However, Trump has not conceded and has sought legal recourse in challenging the results.“I don’t mind if I lose an election, but I want to lose an election fair and square. What I don’t want to do is have it stolen from the American people. That is what we are fighting for, and we have no choice (but) to be doing that,” Trump told his supporters at a holiday party gathering at the White House on Wednesday.A video of the event, which was closed for the press, was posted online on Wednesday.“We already have the proof, we already have the evidence, and it is very clear. Many people in the media and even judges so far have refused to accept it. They know it’s true, they know it’s there, they know who won the election, but they refuse to say you are right. Our country needs somebody to say you are right,” Trump said.Biden has secured 306 electroral college votes while Trump has 232 votes out of the 538-mener Electoral College. The winner should have at least 270 votes.“Ultimately, I am prepared to accept any accurate election result, and I hope that Joe Biden is as well, but we already have the proof. We already have tens of thousands of ballots more than we need to overturn all of these states that we are talking about. This is an election for the highest office in the greatest country in the history of the world,” he said.“Every reasonable American should be able to agree, based on what we have already documented, that we need a systematic analysis of the mail-in ballots to review the envelopes. It’s about the signature, and if they are on the envelopes, we can only review the envelopes, and that will tell us everything. This is the absolute minimum we should expect. This is not just about my campaign, although it has a lot to do with who is going to be your next president,” Trump said.Trump said the judicial scrutiny of the election is about restoring faith and confidence in American elections.“This is about our democracy and the sacred rights that generations of Americans have fought, bled, and died to secure. Nothing is more urgent or more important. The only ballots that should count in this election are those cast by eligible voters who are citizens of our country, residents of the states in which they voted, and who cast their ballots in a lawful manner before the legal deadline,” he said.Moreover, the United States must never again have an election in which there is not a reliable and transparent system to verify the eligibility, identity, and residency of every single person who cast a ballot, a very, very cherished ballot.“Many very smart people have congratulated me on all we have done. The biggest tax cuts in history, regulation cuts, the biggest in history. We rebuilt our military. We took care of our vets like never before. Space force and so much more,” he said.“But then they went on to say as big and as important as these events were, the single greatest achievement in your presidency will be exactly what you are doing right now -- voter integrity for our nation. “It’s more important than any of the things that we discussed. If we don’t root out the fraud, the tremendous and horrible fraud that’s taken place in our 2020 election, we don’t have a country anymore,” Trump said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/prepared-to-accept-election-defeat-if-it-is-accurate-result-says-trump/story-bmLEqBbTcJSUXjBlBxRoJL.html
03-12-2020||World||India urges Israel, Palestine to re-engage in direct talks to advance goal of two-state solution||Welcoming the decision to resume coordination between the Palestinian Authority and Israel, India has urged the leadership of both sides to use the opportunity and re-engage in direct negotiations to advance the goal of a two-state solution.The two-state solution has for decades been the primary focus of efforts to achieve peace in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The solution would establish an independent Palestinian state alongside Israel -- two states for two peoples. In theory, this would win Israel security and allow it to retain a Jewish demographic majority (letting the country remain Jewish and democratic), while granting the Palestinians a state.Most governments and world bodies, including the UN, have set achievement of the two-state solution as official policy. This goal has been the basis of peace talks for decades.Addressing the United Nations General Assembly session on ‘Question of Palestine’ on Wednesday, India’s Permanent Representative to the UN Ambassador T S Tirumurti said the Israel-Palestine conflict is almost as old as the United Nations itself, but the aspirations of Palestinian people for a State for themselves remain unfulfilled. “The peace negotiations between the two parties have remained stalled since 2014. Developments on the ground are not creating conditions conducive to the resumption of these negotiations. We call on parties to refrain from steps that hinder resumption of negotiations,” he said.Tirumurti said India is happy to note the decision to resume coordination between the Palestinian Authority and Israel. “We urge the leadership of Israel and Palestine to use this opportunity and re-engage in direct negotiations to advance the goal of a two-State solution. We also call upon the Secretary-General, the members of the Middle East Quartet and the key Arab partners to take immediate steps to facilitate this dialogue,” he said.Last month, the Palestinian Authority had said it was resuming its civil and security cooperation with Israel that had been suspended since May over Israel’s plans to annex parts of the West Bank. As per media reports, Palestinian Civil Affairs Minister Hussein al-Sheikh wrote on Twitter that “the relationship with Israel will return to how it was” after President Mahmoud Abbas received confirmation that Israel remained committed to past agreements with the Palestinians.Tirumurti reiterated that India remains fully supportive of a peaceful negotiated settlement of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict achieved through direct negotiations, resulting in the establishment of a Palestinian state living side by side in peace and security with Israel. The Indian envoy underscored that India has been steadfast in its support for the just Palestinian cause and in its solidarity with the Palestinian people, which extends beyond political support. “It is our firm belief that even as peace is being pursued on the political track, the people of Palestine must not be forgotten,” he said.Tirumurti said India’s efforts are also focused on Palestinian nation-building and strengthening institutions through the India-Palestine development partnership covering various sectors of the Palestinian economy. This includes construction of schools, hospitals, technology parks and centres for excellence.“We see it as an essential investment to help establish a viable and sovereign Palestinian State,” he said.Over the years, India has also invested in strengthening human resource capacities of the Palestinian people through scholarships for Palestinian students pursuing higher education and training of Palestinian professionals in prestigious Indian institutes. Around 250 Palestinians benefit every year from such opportunities.Highlighting another dimension of India’s support to the Palestinian cause, Tirumurti said India quadrupled its support to United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) in recent years, recognising the acute crisis faced by the UN agency. India has made a multi-year pledge of USD 10 million over the next two years to contribute to a more stable and predictable funding for UNRWA. “We consider our partnership with UNRWA as an investment in peace and stability in the region,” he said, thanking all member states, who supported India’s membership to the Advisory Commission of UNRWA. Addressing the International Day of Solidarity with the Palestinian People 2020 Virtual Meeting on Tuesday, UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres had expressed a “deep sense of worry about the grim realities in the occupied Palestinian Territory and the diminishing prospects of resolving the conflict, which has been with the United Nations since its very creation”. Guterres expressed hope that recent developments will encourage Palestinian and Israeli leaders to re-engage in meaningful negotiations, with the support of the international community, towards a two-state solution and will create opportunities for regional cooperation. “Only a two-state solution that realises the legitimate national aspirations of Palestinians and Israelis can lead to sustainable peace,” he said, adding that the United Nations remains committed to supporting Palestinians and Israelis to resolve the conflict.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/india-urges-israel-palestine-to-re-engage-in-direct-talks-to-advance-goal-of-two-state-solution/story-FzpsAddJRoSdIjQW7g2pJO.html

Authorities reported the deaths all took place in Nakhon Si Thammarat province, where television footage showed staff of a hospital piling up sandbags outside an emergency room to fend off water gushing in from the street.Other images showed people wading or pushing motorcycles through thigh-deep water while some residents, including a Buddhist monk, rowed boats through commercial areas where children played.The floods started a week ago but had receded by Thursday, according to the interior ministry, having affected more than 255,000 households in seven of the southern provinces.The impacted region is home to Thailand’s major rubber plantations, accounting for the majority of the world’s natural rubber supply. The Rubber Authority of Thailand said on Thursday it will pay affected rubber farmers 3,000 baht ($99.34) if the flood damaged more than 20 rubber trees in their plantations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/five-dead-as-flash-floods-hit-southern-thailand/story-hnod9ST5EBbuULBRzlX8dP.html

The Trump administration has sought to cement the outgoing President’s tough-on-China legacy, while relations between the world’s two largest economies have sunk to the lowest point in decades.The move was a part of ongoing action to protect the United States from the Chinese Communist Party’s “malign influence,” the NYT quoted a spokesman for the State Department as saying.The Department did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.Washington and Beijing have clashed over China’s handling of the coronavirus outbreak, its tightening grip on Hong Kong, its disputed claims in the South China Sea, trade and accusations of human rights crimes in Xinjiang.Last week, Reuters reported the United States was poised to add China’s top chipmaker SMIC and national offshore oil and gas producer CNOOC to a blacklist of alleged Chinese military companies, curbing their access to US investors.The new visa guidelines allow American officials to determine someone’s party status based on their application and interview, the paper reported.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/united-states-toughens-visa-rules-for-malign-chinese-communist-party-members/story-rr2zaQKhUF5paup43iNG8M.html

The plan was to collect 2 kg (4.4 pounds) of samples.The sample collection was completed after 19 hours, the space agency said in its statement, without disclosing the total weight of the samples collected.China had planned to collect the samples over a period of about two days, with the entire mission taking around 23 days.The ascending vehicle would lift off from the lunar surface with the samples, and dock with a module currently orbiting around the moon.The samples would then be transferred to a return capsule onboard the orbiting module for delivery back to Earth.If successful, the mission will make China only the third country to have retrieved lunar samples after the United States and the Soviet Union.China made its first lunar landing in 2013.In January 2019, the Chang’e-4 probe landed on the far side of the moon, the first space probe from any nation to do so.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-completes-lunar-sample-collection-ahead-of-schedule/story-HFOKF2R5COnoQWfjhhI1BL.html

We take so much from her and we rarely give a lot back.”Harry and Meghan, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, have spoken out on issues such as race and the environment since stepping down from their roles as working members of the royal family at the end of March and moving to California.The prince, who has been criticised in the past for his use of private jets, urged people to imagine being a raindrop in order to help repair the Earth.“Every single raindrop that falls from the sky relieves the parched ground,” he said. “What if every one of us was a raindrop? If every single one of us cared?

03-12-2020||World||Did Canada’s pre-election politics spark Justin Trudeau’s remarks on the farmers’ protest in India?||Politics ahead of possible mid-term elections in Canada in the spring of 2021 may have been the reason behind Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s comments on India’s farm laws that could cause bilateral ties to reset back to the lows of 2017.An Indian official said the remarks during a virtual event were a “setback” given that the relationship had warmed in preceding months after Trudeau returned to power in October 2019, though as the leader of a minority government.Canada foreign ministry, Global Affairs Canada, had been in touch with India on the farm legislations, and their necessity had been conveyed over multiple conversations. In fact, New Delhi expected the matter to be raised in Canada’s House of Commons and was prepared for foreign minister Francoise-Philippe Champagne’s response that the concerns had been made clear.However, an official pointed out that Trudeau “escalated” the matter by raising it unprompted during a Facebook live event to celebrate the birth anniversary of Guru Nanak. The event was to be private and was closed to media, but the video was placed in the public domain, causing damage to the relationship akin to Trudeau’s appearance at a social event in Toronto in 2017, where pro-Khalistan flags and banners were waved and Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale and the assassins of Indira Gandhi featured on floats participating in the accompanying parade.“It was not inadvertent,” Vishnu Prakash, former Indian High Commissioner to Ottawa, said of Trudeau’s comments. He said for the Canadian PM, it was the “primacy” of the vote bank that appeared to matter “without much regard for the relationship”.There is a possibility that Canada may be headed for snap elections next year and that could have been part of the calculation for Trudeau. New Democratic Party leader Jagmeet Singh had already made a strident statement on the farm laws and Conservative leader Erin O’Toole released a video of his party’s support for “peaceful protests”. The latter came prior to Trudeau’s appearance at the virtual event. With all three parties competing for the Sikh vote, which is critical in ensuring a majority in the House, he may not have wanted to lose the advantage he has with the community, which has been holding protests in the suburbs of Toronto and Vancouver on the issue.Prakash described the outcome was “political opportunism” and added, “Even if there’s competitive politics, a prime minister saying something is different from what the opposition says.”Months of improvement in the relationship during which the two PMs have spoken and foreign ministers have been regularly in contact may now be jeopardised. “That’s a pity as a lot of effort has gone into it in the last year and there was again hope for revival of the political relationship,” Prakash said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/did-canada-s-pre-election-politics-spark-justin-trudeau-s-remarks-on-the-farmers-protest-in-india/story-TYyAdFNSCTQXab9mpUe0MP.html
03-12-2020||World||China testing blunders stemmed from secret deals with firms||Secrecy and cronyism at China’s top disease control agency led to widespread test shortages and flaws that hampered the early response to the coronavirus outbreak, an Associated Press investigation has found.Click here for complete coverage of Covid-19China’s Center for Disease Control and Prevention gave test kit designs and distribution rights exclusively to three then-obscure Shanghai companies with which officials had personal ties, according to the investigation. It was based on interviews with more than 40 doctors, CDC employees, health experts, and industry insiders, as well as hundreds of internal documents, contracts, messages and emails.The Shanghai companies — GeneoDx Biotech, Huirui Biotechnology, and BioGerm Medical Technology -- paid the China CDC for the information and the distribution rights, according to two sources with knowledge of the transaction who asked to remain anonymous to avoid retribution. The price: One million RMB ($146,600) each, the sources said. It’s unclear whether the money went to specific individuals.In the meantime, the CDC and its parent agency, the National Health Commission, tried to prevent other scientists and organizations from testing for the virus with their own homemade kits. They took control of patient samples and made testing requirements to confirm coronavirus cases much more complicated.The flawed testing system — at a time when the virus could have been slowed — stopped scientists and officials from seeing how fast it was spreading. Chinese authorities failed to report a single new case between Jan. 5 and 17, even as hundreds were infected in Wuhan, the city where the virus was first detected.The apparent lull in cases meant officials were slow to take early actions such as warning the public or barring large gatherings. It also caused critical shortages of testing kits, barring access to care for many who were infected.The testing problems, along with other mistakes and delays, allowed the virus to rip through Wuhan undetected and spread across the world in a pandemic that has now sickened 64 million people and killed almost 1.5 million.China was hardly the only country to grapple with testing. In in the U.S., the CDC declined to use a WHO design and insisted on developing its own kits, which turned out to be faulty and led to even longer delays than in China. Still, the hiccups in China were especially consequential because it was the first country to detect the virus.“Because you have only three companies providing testing kits, it kept the capacity of testing very limited,” said Yanzhong Huang, a senior fellow for global health at the Council on Foreign Relations. “It was a major problem that led to the rapid increase in cases and deaths.”China’s foreign ministry and China’s top medical agency, the National Health Commission, did not respond to requests for comment.But interviews and documents suggest that a culture of backdoor connections quietly flourished in a top-down, underfunded public health system. Though none of the first three diagnostics companies tapped to make test kits were well-known in the industry, there were extensive ties between the companies and top China CDC researchers.The founder of BioGerm, Zhao Baihui, was the former chief technician of the Shanghai CDC’s microbiology lab. Emails and financial records obtained by the AP show that Zhao first started BioGerm’s predecessor through an intermediary in 2012, while she was still at the Shanghai CDC. In the next five years, she sold thousands of dollars’ worth of test kits to her own workplace through the intermediary. After quitting the CDC in 2017, Zhao went on to spearhead lucrative contracts with Shanghai officials.Zhao did not respond to requests for comment from the AP.Another of the three companies, GeneoDx, enjoyed special access because it is a subsidiary of the state-run firm SinoPharm, which is managed directly by China’s cabinet. In October 2019, GeneoDx co-organized an internal CDC training conference on emerging respiratory diseases in Shanghai. Tan Wenjie, the CDC official who ran the training, was later put in charge of developing test kits.GeneoDx did not respond to requests for comment or interviews. The National Health Commission did not respond to a request for a comment or an interview with Tan.The last company, Huirui, is a longtime partner with Tan, the CDC official in charge of test kits. In an interview, CEO Li Hui said the CDC routinely contracted his company to make emergency testing chemicals. He denied any personal relationship with Tan or any payments to the CDC.“We’ve been working with the CDC to respond to emerging new diseases for about ten years, not just for a day or two, it’s normal,” Li said.It’s unclear whether the agreements between the China CDC and the three test kit companies violated Chinese law.They raise questions around potential violations of bribery laws, along with rules against abuse of authority, self-dealing and conflicts of interest, said James Zimmerman, a Beijing-based corporate attorney and former chairman of the American Chamber of Commerce in China.But other experts caution that the state may have designated the three companies to make test kits under special laws on the procurement of emergency goods during natural disasters.“Things will be different in the middle of a crisis,” said Lesli Ligorner, a Beijing-based attorney specializing in anti-corruption law. “I wouldn’t be so quick to rush to judgement.”The first step in making test kits is to get samples of the virus and decode its genetic sequence. This leads to test designs, essentially a recipe for the tests.In past outbreaks, the China CDC sent test designs and testing compounds to laboratories across the country just days after identifying the pathogen. But this time, they held back the genome and test designs. Instead, they finalized “technology transfer” agreements to give the test designs to the Shanghai companies, according to three people familiar with the matter. The selection process was kept secret.At the same time, central CDC authorities stymied others from testing. Provincial CDC staff were told that instead of testing and reporting cases themselves, they had to send patient samples to designated labs in Beijing for full sequencing, a complicated and time-consuming procedure. As a result, for weeks, local CDC staff were unable to confirm new cases.After a Jan. 14 internal teleconference to order secret preparations for a pandemic, China’s health authorities relaxed the requirements to confirm cases and started distributing the CDC-sanctioned test kits. A day after the first test kits finally arrived in Wuhan on Jan. 16, the case count began to rise again.But the test kits from GeneoDx and Huirui had quality issues, turning out inconclusive results or false negatives. And technicians were hesitant to use test kits that would later prove more accurate from more established companies, because the CDC did not endorse them.As a result, in the early days, getting a Covid test was so difficult that Wuhan residents compared it to winning the lottery.Among the victims was Peng Yi, a 39-year-old schoolteacher who started coughing on Jan. 23. When he went to the hospital, he waited for eight hours, only to be turned away for a lack of test kits. Then, when he finally got tested on Jan. 30, it turned out negative, even as the virus ravaged his lungs.His second test, on Feb. 4, turned out positive. It was too late. Weeks later, Peng passed away.“There were very, very few tests, basically none….if you couldn’t prove you were positive, you couldn’t get admitted to a hospital,” his mother, Zhong Hanneng, said in a tearful interview in October. “The doctor said there was nothing that could be done.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-testing-blunders-stemmed-from-secret-deals-with-firms/story-hOsYGt5WdPVqm1O962ys3H.html
03-12-2020||World||Biden, democrats swings behind bipartisan virus aid bill, says ‘immediate held’ needed||President-elect Joe Biden swung behind a bipartisan Covid-19 relief effort and his top Capitol Hill allies cut their demands for a $2 trillion-plus measure by more than half in hopes of breaking a monthslong logjam and delivering much-sought aid as the tempestuous congressional session speeds to a close.Biden said Wednesday the developing aid package “wouldn’t be the answer, but it would be the immediate help for a lot of things.” He wants a relief bill to pass Congress now, with more aid to come next year.Biden’s remarks followed an announcement by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and Senate Democrat leader Chuck Schumer of New York in support of an almost $1 trillion approach as the “basis” for discussions. The announcement appeared aimed at budging Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., who so far has been unwilling to abandon a $550 billion Senate GOP plan that has failed twice this fall.The Democrats embraced a $908 billion approach from moderate Sens. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., and Susan Collins, R-Maine, among others. It would establish a $300 per week jobless benefit, send $160 billion to help state and local governments, boost schools and universities, revive popular “paycheck protection” subsidies for businesses, and bail out transit systems and airlines.“In the spirit of compromise we believe the bipartisan framework introduced by Senators yesterday should be used as the basis for immediate bipartisan, bicameral negotiations,” Pelosi and Schumer said. They said they would try to build upon the approach, which has support in the House from a bipartisan “problem solvers” coalition.The statement was a significant concession by Pelosi and Schumer, who played hardball this fall during failed preelection discussions with the administration on a costlier bill. They wanted a more generous unemployment benefit and far more for state and local government. Their embrace of the $908 billion measure was a retreat from a secret $1.3 trillion offer the two Democrats gave McConnell just on Monday.It’s another sign of urgency for additional Covid aid and economic stimulus as the economy struggles to recover from being slammed by the novel coronavirus. While the jobless rate isn’t as high as was feared, the restaurant and airline industries are desperate for aid, as are other businesses, state and local officials, transit systems and the Postal Service, among others.The new plan includes a liability shield for businesses and other organizations that have reopened their doors during the pandemic. It’s the first time Pelosi and Schumer have shown a willingness to consider the idea, a top priority of McConnell, though there’s been no discussion on the details, which are sure to be tricky.McConnell had dismissed the bipartisan offer on Tuesday, instead aiming to rally Republicans around the $550 billion GOP proposal. But McConnell himself endorsed a $1 trillion-or so plan this summer, only to encounter resistance from conservatives that prompted him to retrench. He has acknowledged that another infusion of aid to states and local governments, a key Pelosi demand, probably will pass eventually.McConnell wouldn’t respond when asked about the Democratic statement. His top deputy, Sen. John Thune, R-S.D., said GOP leaders might agree to merging the bipartisan proposal with McConnell’s bill.“I think there’s still time, although it’s short, to put a bill together,” Thune said.Any relief package would be attached to a $1.4 trillion year-end spending bill required to avert a government shutdown next weekend. Talks on that measure are proceeding but if lawmakers should stumble, a temporary spending bill would be needed as a bridge into next year.The bipartisan group of lawmakers proposed a split-the-difference solution to the protracted impasse, hoping to speed overdue help to a hurting nation before Congress adjourns for the holidays. It was a sign that some lawmakers reluctant to adjourn for the year without approving some pandemic aid.Their proposal includes $228 billion to extend and upgrade “paycheck protection” subsidies for businesses for a second round of relief to hard-hit businesses such as restaurants. It would revive a special jobless benefit, but at a reduced level of $300 per week rather than the $600 benefit enacted in March. State and local governments would receive $160 billion.There’s also $45 billion for transportation, including aid to transit systems and Amtrak; $82 billion to reopen schools and universities; and money for vaccines and health care providers, as well as for food stamps, rental assistance and the Postal Service.The new effort follows a split-decision election that delivered the White House to Democrats and gave Republicans down-ballot success.Pelosi and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin struggled over a relief bill for weeks before the November election, discussing legislation of up to $2 trillion. Senate GOP conservatives opposed their efforts and Pelosi refused to yield on key points.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-democrats-swings-behind-bipartisan-virus-aid-bill-says-immediate-held-needed/story-DuJErGUg9TjlnrL8Sd7POO.html
03-12-2020||World||US bans cotton imports from Chinese firm on ‘slave labor’||The Trump administration banned cotton imports from a military-linked Chinese firm it accuses of relying on “slave labor,” as the US seeks to ramp up economic pressure on Beijing over its treatment of Muslim ethnic minority groups.The US Department of Homeland Security said Wednesday that customs officers at American ports would impound “shipments containing cotton and cotton products originating” from the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps., one of China’s largest producers. The organization -- set up by the Communist Party more than 60 years ago to help develop the far western region of Xinjiang -- was previously hit by Treasury Department sanctions barring it from transactions with American companies and citizens.“The human rights abuses taking place at the hand of the Chinese Communist government will not be tolerated by President Trump and the American people,” DHS Acting Deputy Secretary Ken Cuccinelli said in a statement. US businesses shouldn’t be allowed to “profit from slave labor” he said, adding that “‘Made in China’ is not just a country of origin, it is a warning label.”The Trump administration and other critics of Beijing have targeted cotton from China, which supplies about one-third of US apparel, as a way to increase pressure over the mass detention of Turkic-speaking ethnic Uighurs. Xinjiang produces more than 80% of China’s cotton, much of it from XPCC.The US’s action could potentially affect clothing exports from other Asian producers like Bangladesh, Vietnam, and Cambodia, if they contain cotton from China, according to Sheng Lu, an associate professor in the Department of Fashion & Apparel Studies at the University of Delaware.“Cotton made by XPCC are used by garment factories throughout China and exported to other apparel producing countries,” he said.The US imported about $11 billion in cotton textile and apparel products from China in 2019, but depending on how US Customs enforces this order, it could target a much broader array of products, Lu said. The order also sends a strong signal that the issue of forced labor in Xinjiang is not over yet and there could be other actions in the future, he said.Detention FacilitiesThe Trump administration has already sanctioned scores of Chinese companies and Xinjiang party chief Chen Quanguo over their ties to a security state that has detained between tens of thousands and “upwards of 1 million” Uighurs, according to a United Nations’ assessment. China has continued to expand its detention facilities in the region, the Australian Strategic Policy Institute said in September report based on satellite imagery, government documents, media reports and witness accounts.China defends the camps as “vocational education centers” intended to “purge ideological diseases,” including terrorism and religious extremism. Authorities dispute outside population estimates of the camps, without providing figures of their own. The facilities were built after a spate of deadly attacks involving Uighurs in 2013 and 2014, prompting President Xi Jinping to order authorities to “strike first” against Islamist extremism.Still, the latest measure stopped short of banning all cotton from Xinjiang, as Cuccinelli told Bloomberg TV in September the U.S. was considering. The decision whether to take further action may be left to the President-elect Joe Biden, who has labeled China’s policies regarding the Uighurs as “genocide” and called for an international effort to make a united stand against the campaign.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-bans-cotton-imports-from-chinese-firm-on-slave-labor/story-PoD4nLsoDwNUPNrHIAJCnI.html

The Justice Department sued Alphabet Inc’s Google in October.More than 40 states plan to sign on to the lawsuit, one source said, without naming them.Facebook declined to comment. A spokesman for the New York attorney general’s office declined to comment.The Federal Trade Commission, whose commissioners met on Wednesday, could file a related complaint with an administrative law judge or in district court.It is not known what the states plan to include in their complaint.

These include Instagram in 2012 and WhatsApp in 2014.Facebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg has argued in congressional testimony that the company has a range of competitors, including other tech giants. He has defended controversial acquisitions like Instagram and WhatsApp by saying the social media platform helped them expand from small, insignificant companies into powerhouses.The Justice Department and FTC in 2019 began antitrust investigations into the four big tech companies, which also include Amazon.com Inc and Apple Inc.

03-12-2020||World||WeChat deletes Australian PM’s appeal to Chinese community||Chinese social media platform WeChat has deleted a post by Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison, accusing him of misleading the public, as the diplomatic spat between the two nations shows no sign of easing.In a direct appeal to the Chinese community, Morrison promoted Australia as a “free, democratic, liberal country” and explained that an official probe is underway into alleged atrocities by Australian soldiers in Afghanistan. That post was removed for the use of “misleading words” to “distort historical events and deceive the public,” according to a message displayed in its place.Both China and Australia have taken to social media in recent days as tensions between the two nations continue to simmer. Morrison angrily demanded a public apology earlier this week after a diplomat in Beijing tweeted a fake image purporting to show an Australian soldier holding a knife to the throat of an Afghan child.Australia’s Treasurer Josh Frydenberg on Thursday said WeChat’s action was “unnecessary.”While stressing the importance of the trading relationship with China, he said Australia won’t give ground on a list of Chinese grievances against the government. They range from Australia meddling in domestic affairs in Hong Kong to calling for a probe into the coronavirus outbreak.Also Read | Australian PM sends WeChat message to Chinese diaspora in spatAustralia is “not going to give way on those,” Frydenberg said. “They go to the heart of who we are. Our national identity, a free press, a democratically elected parliament and obviously upholding our national interest when it comes to things like foreign investment.”Morrison created his WeChat public account in February 2019, becoming one of the few heads of state who have a presence on China’s largest social network with 1 billion users. He has since posted regularly in Chinese to communicate his government’s policies. During last year’s federal election in Australia, leaders of the main political parties took to the platform to conduct question-and-answer sessions with Chinese-Australian voters.Like all media in China, WeChat works with the Beijing government to censor sensitive content. The Chinese microblogging site Weibo Corp., a more popular platform for foreign government leaders and politicians, has a history of blocking or removing posts from foreign embassies on topics ranging from human rights to stock market manipulation, according to a 2018 report by the Australian Strategic Policy Institute.WeChat operator Tencent Holdings Ltd. didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.Ties between the major trading partners have been strained since 2018 when Canberra barred Huawei Technologies Co. from building its 5G network and introduced anti-foreign interference laws aimed at halting Beijing’s “meddling” in domestic affairs. Relations have been in a deep freeze since April, when Morrison’s government called for independent investigators to enter Wuhan to probe the origins of the coronavirus.A string of commodities have since been targeted with tariffs or bans in what Canberra says amounts to “economic coercion.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/wechat-deletes-australian-pm-s-appeal-to-chinese-community/story-bRt5VGRDUSE4A2TxePbOMO.html

03-12-2020||World||Psaki, next White House press secretary, a veteran messenger||After four years of President Donald Trump serving as his own chief spokesperson and frequently peddling false information and conspiracy theories in the process, successor Joe Biden is pledging to return to a more traditional approach to communicating with Americans.Much of that work will fall to Jen Psaki, Biden’s pick for White House press secretary. She’s a veteran communications staffer who has worked on many top Democratic campaigns and held leading roles under President Barack Obama, including deputy press secretary and White House communications director, as well as spokesperson for the State Department.She’ll assume the role at a critical time, facing a public that’s skeptical of messages from institutions and a press corps whose relationship with the White House has been highly strained during the Trump era. Psaki, who turned 42 on Tuesday, is well-known in Washington, but she’s not a household name.Yet.“This job becomes one of the most recognizable people representing both the administration and the government writ large,” said Robert Gibbs, a former Obama press secretary. “She’ll be recognized when she travels overseas. She’ll be recognized when she goes to the grocery store.”Trump went through four press secretaries and often preferred to engage directly with the electorate, tweeting at all hours or holding his own press briefings — especially at the start of the coronavirus pandemic. Both the president and his media team were frequently at odds with White House reporters while routinely spreading falsehoods.One of Trump’s press secretaries, Stephanie Grisham, never held a single briefing during her tenure. His most recent choice, Kayleigh McEnany, has used her sporadic briefings to scold reporters on their choice of questions, lecture them about the content of their stories, and reinforce baseless claims by the president.Biden has promised to restore daily press briefings, and Psaki says she views the core of her new job as seeking to rebuild trust in government, especially during the pandemic.“It’s difficult to imagine now how different this is going to be in a couple of months,” said Stuart Stevens, chief strategist for Republican Mitt Romney’s 2012 presidential campaign when Psaki was press secretary for Obama’s reelection campaign.Stevens, a fierce Trump critic, said that after Inauguration Day on Jan. 20, White House communications staffers won’t be “graded upon their willingness to lie for the president.”Former Obama chief of staff Denis McDonough remembered Psaki once coming into his office and “pushing back quite strongly” on a policy point, seeking to get “answers that she knew she would be asked about.” He said the exchange simultaneously annoyed and impressed him.“She was not a passive participant who was just taking messaging to pass along,” McDonough said.Still, simply returning to the way things were during the Obama administration is not something all journalists are looking forward to. While its relationship with the press was not as combative as the current administration’s, the Obama White House tightly controlled access to information, was obstructionist on many Freedom of Information Act requests and offered aggressive spin on key events.It also used the 1917 Espionage Act in unprecedented ways, prosecuting more people for leaking sensitive information to the public than all previous presidents combined.Harold Holzer, a onetime congressional press secretary and author of the book “The Presidents and the Press,” said many White House journalists “were horrified by their treatment in the Obama administration.”“They were being told to consult the White House website for answers to their questions, Obama never showed up ... unless it was to go give a cupcake on someone’s birthday, he didn’t answer FOIA requests,” Holzer said.Psaki has already led calls with reporters to discuss the progress of Biden’s transition to the White House, though those haven’t come daily. Biden, meanwhile, has held only two formal press conferences since Election Day. Trump went weeks after his victory in 2016 without convening a press conference, but his team did provide daily updates by phone to reporters.Holzer noted that Biden “is friendly, but he’s guarded and he’ll be more protective.”Presidential press corps combativeness long predates Trump and Obama.John Adams signed a sedition law prohibiting “malicious writing” about the president and executive branch. Abraham Lincoln imprisoned editors during the Civil War, and Franklin Delano Roosevelt admonished a journalist to go to the corner and wear a dunce cap. Early in Bill Clinton’s term, the corridor between the briefing room and the press secretary’s office was closed to journalists — causing an uproar among their ranks and a reversal of the policy.“It’s happened before. It’s just that it wasn’t on social media,” Holzer said.A native of Stamford, Connecticut, and a graduate of William & Mary, Psaki is part of an all-female senior communications team for the Biden White House. She declined an interview request through a Biden transition team spokesperson.McDonough recalled recruiting Psaki back to the White House from the State Department on the president’s behalf in 2015 — and her saying that she was having a family and that nothing would keep her from achieving that goal.“I’ll never forget having that conversation with her and how insistent she was,” McDonough said.Psaki and her husband, Gregory Mecher, have two children, ages 2 and 5.Gibbs worked closely with Psaki in the Obama press office and said she has a good relationship with Biden and with reporters, excels at message planning and can be “calm inside a building that, even on the best day of the administration, is a bit chaotic.”“You get calls at 2 in the morning from the Situation Room, you’re up early reading news,” Gibbs said of the post Psaki is taking on. “You have to be ready to react to what you know is going to happen and what you have no idea’s going to happen. And that really doesn’t turn off from the moment you start the job until the moment you finish it.”Current and former colleagues say Psaki is careful to take care of those around her, even people she far outranks. A 2008 Obama communications intern recalled Psaki providing an air mattress to use for the summer after a housing mix-up.Biden aides say that the president-elect decided on Psaki because she ran point for the Obama press office on the economy, especially stimulus spending — an issue that then-Vice President Biden, and the man he’s tapped as his administration’s first chief of staff, Ron Klain, were leading voices on. That’s important since Biden has promised to spend billions creating green jobs and making infrastructure improvements to better combat climate change and to reduce economic inequality while reviving the post-pandemic economy.Psaki also has extensive foreign policy experience from her time at the State Department. That, combined with her White House years, makes her among the most practically experienced people to take on the role of press secretary while giving her deep knowledge of key issues, aides say.Psaki is also remembered for some tense exchanges with journalists during State Department press briefings. Videos of some of those have now begun to resurface in Russia. State media there is often critical of U.S. political figures but in the past singled out Psaki, turning her last name into a verb, “Psaking,” meant to denote making mistakes while speaking publicly.Still, Stevens, the Romney 2012 top strategist, said any media dust-ups will be grounded in a public and political reality that evaporated during the Trump era.“I’m sure she’s going to have a lot of fights with reporters, and reporters are going to have frustrations. And that’s how it should be,” he said. “But they will be people living in the same universe. They’re not going to be debating about whether gravity’s a reasonable phenomenon.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/psaki-next-white-house-press-secretary-a-veteran-messenger/story-vugh9Knos3Zxj6TjU9R2NN.html

Click here for complete coverage of Covid-19 Britain on Wednesday approved the use of the Pfizer vaccine, jumping ahead of the rest of the world in the race to begin the most crucial mass inoculation programme in history. But John Skerritt, the head of Australia’s Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) said it would likely complete its review by “late January” and has told staff not to plan a holiday to get the work done. “My staff have been told to put away their swimsuits and towels and to work as quickly as we can but also in significant depth,” Skerritt told reporters in Canberra.Pfizer’s is one of the four Covid-19 vaccines Australia has agreed to buy, including from Novavax, AstraZeneca and CSL Ltd should trials prove successful.Health Minister Greg Hunt said the January timetable does not accelerate plans to begin vaccinations.“We are on track for first vaccinations beginning with our health workers and our aged care residents subject to approvals in March,” Hunt told reporters in Canberra.Also Read | Covid-19 vaccine: Is Pfizer approval hasty?

03-12-2020||World||Hong Kong media tycoon Jimmy Lai denied bail on fraud charge||Outspoken Hong Kong pro-democracy advocate and media tycoon Jimmy Lai was refused bail on Thursday on a fraud charge amid a growing crackdown on dissent in the semi-autonomous city.Jimmy Lai of Next Digital, which publishes the Apple Daily newspaper, was among 10 people arrested August 10 on what police said was suspicion of violating a national security law and collusion with a foreign country.Lai, 73, was later released on bail but police raided his company’s offices in October and took away documents.On Wednesday, Lai and two Next Digital executives were charged with fraud over accusations that they violated lease terms for Next Digital office space.Lai appeared in court Thursday and was denied bail. His case has been adjourned till April 16.Hong Kong police said in a statement Wednesday that it had arrested three men on charges of fraud, without naming them. It also said that one of them had been suspected of violating the national security law, and that it was still under investigation.Beijing imposed the national security law in response to protests in Hong Kong that began in June 2019 over a proposed extradition law and expanded to include demands for greater democracy in the former British colony.The sweeping legislation prompted more public protests and led to complaints that Beijing is violating the autonomy promised to Hong Kong when it returned to China and damaging its status as a business center.Apple Daily criticized the law on its front page on July 1, calling it the “final nail in the coffin” of the territory’s autonomy.The British government had slammed Lai’s August arrest and said the security law was being used to crush dissent.The law is “being implemented in a way that undermines freedom of speech,” the British government said in a report this month on the status of the 1984 agreement for Hong Kong’s return to China.“It is imperative that this freedom is fully respected,” the report said.Lai was earlier arrested in February and April on charges of taking part in unauthorized protests. He also faces charges of joining an unauthorized vigil marking the anniversary of the June 4, 1989, crackdown on pro-democracy protests in Beijing’s Tiananmen Square.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hong-kong-media-tycoon-jimmy-lai-denied-bail-on-fraud-charge/story-nW8GsfqbSdD1B5tmSyQ2DJ.html

This portion starts at Changling city in Jilin and ends at Yongqing city in Hebei. The pipeline also connects the existing gas pipelines in northeastern and northern China, as well as the gas storage projects in Dalian, Tangshan and Liaohe.The northern part of the China-Russia East gas pipeline started operations in December 2019 and has transmitted nearly 4 billion cubic metres (bcm) natural gas, according to PipeChina.China had started construction on the southern portion of the China-Russia East pipeline in July, extending the route to Shanghai in eastern China. Volumes of Russian gas transported via the pipeline could reach 38 bcm per annum once the line is completed by 2025.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-launches-1-100-km-section-of-china-russia-east-gas-pipeline/story-JVlZ9rfMbnjX4LqLhe08OJ.html

Japan’s industry ministry will map out a plan by the year-end, chief government spokesman Katsunobu Kato told a news conference on Thursday.The ministry is considering requiring all new vehicles to be electric cars including hybrid vehicles, NHK reported earlier, adding the ministry would finalise a formal target following expert-panel debates as early as the year-end.In Japan, the share of electricity vehicles is expected to increase to 55% in 2030, Boston Consulting Group said in a report on prospects for battery-powered cars. Globally, “the speed of expansion of the share of electric vehicles will accelerate due to the fact that battery prices are falling more rapidly than previously expected,” Boston Consulting said in the report. The United Kingdom will ban sales of new petrol and diesel powered cars and vans from 2030, bringing forward the phase-out date by five years in what Prime Minister Boris Johnson called a “green revolution.”Japan, China and South Korea recently announced firm targets to end net emissions of carbon, which has given momentum for companies and banks to push for cutbacks to keep global warming in check. Policies and investments in the next few years will be crucial to setting the pathways to carbon neutrality, climate activists and energy transition strategists all agree.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/japan-may-ban-sale-of-new-gasoline-powered-vehicles-in-mid-2030s/story-fGauDbppFCYJaqMnkA7CkL.html

The United States will be represented by Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar.The President of the UNGA, Turkish diplomat Volkan Bozkir, will host the assembly’s 31st special session Thursday to Friday in response to the Covid-19 pandemic.“Following 1.5 million deaths, more than 62 million cases worldwide and one of the largest social and economic crises in living memory, controlling and recovering from Covid-19 is the international community’s top priority,” according to a UNGA press release.The two-day special session will primarily consist of a general debate on Thursday and interactive dialogues with experts, UN agencies and leading scientists, on Friday. Serum Institute of India Chief Executive Officer Adar Poonawalla will also address the session through a pre-recorded video on December 4.President Donald Trump is not listed as a speaker for the session and the United States has reportedly claimed that the United Nations meeting of world leaders on the Covid-19 pandemic was being designed to allow Beijing to spread “propaganda.”The U.N. General Assembly agreed in October to hold the Covid-19 special session by adopting a resolution with 150 votes in favor. The United States, Israel and Armenia abstained and the remaining members didn’t vote.Bozkir’s spokesman Brenden Varma said the president thought that the meeting was “already too late” and should have happened in the summer. Varma added the meeting was created as a way to promote multilateralism in a time of crisis.The point is “to bring countries together, along with U.N. actors, with the private sector, with vaccine developers to work together ... to take stock and to identify gaps and challenges,” Varma said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/un-to-open-special-session-on-coronavirus-crisis-india-s-secretary-west-listed-as-speaker/story-nGo48ZCFtK3xxDKiIqw5qM.html

The content of the depositions wasn’t disclosed or described.The White House declined to comment.Filed in January in District of Columbia Superior Court, the case is one of numerous and varied legal actions Trump, his family and associates face as the president reenters private life next month.Racine, a Democrat, argues that Trump’s inaugural committee made an unjustified payment of more than $1 million to the Trump hotel for events from Jan. 17 to Jan. 20, 2017, after failing to consider less expensive alternatives.The depositions were reported earlier by CNN.The case is District of Columbia v. 58th Presidential Inaugural Committee, 2020 CA 000488 B, Superior Court of the District of Columbia.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/ivanka-trump-questioned-in-suit-over-inaugural-hotel-cost/story-fAjei6YbIpgBldS9d0FkWP.html

November improvements were not big enough to offset the previous month’s jump.“The targets set for this winter appeared soft, but now a surge in industrial output is putting even these lenient targets at risk,” CREA said.Hebei province, which surrounds Beijing, produced 210.8 million tonnes of crude steel in the first 10 months alone, up 4.1% on the year. Output in October stood at 20.95 million tonnes, up 17% from a year earlier.China’s top steelmaking province has pledged to cut annual production capacity to 200 million tonnes by the end of the year, but “this target is being rendered meaningless by ‘creative accounting’ of steel capacity,” said CREA.The environment ministry aims to keep average PM2.5 concentrations in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region at under 63 micrograms per cubic metre from October to December, and then under 86 micrograms from January to March 2021.The figure is still more than double China’s official air quality standard of 35 micrograms.China also promised that it would avoid large-scale industrial closures this year, but Hebei and other provinces have already started to shut down cement factories in December in a bid to reduce smog build-ups.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-could-fall-short-on-smog-targets-as-industry-surges-says-study/story-9fDwd86gidBumYvCysn0zI.html

They also jailed Wong’s colleagues Agnes Chow and Ivan Lam for 10 and seven months, respectively.

03-12-2020||World||Australia approves tough new veto powers over foreign agreements amid China row||Australia’s parliament on Thursday passed legislation giving the federal government power to veto any agreement struck with foreign states, a move likely to anger China and intensify a bitter diplomatic spat between the two countries.The law allows the Commonwealth to block any agreement between Australian states, councils or institutions and a foreign government, such as a controversial 2018 deal between the state of Victoria and China.“Australia’s policies and plans, the rules that we make for our country are made here in Australia according to our needs and our interests,” Prime Minister Scott Morrison told reporters in Canberra.Morrison has stressed the law is not aimed at any country but it is widely seen by analysts as directed at China.“It creates another trigger for the relationship to deteriorate,” said Melissa Conley Tyler, research fellow at the Asia Institute of the University of Melbourne.Under the terms of the new law, the foreign minister can veto any agreements with foreign governments if they “adversely affect Australia’s foreign relations” or are “inconsistent with Australian foreign policy”.One deal expected to come under the spotlight is Victoria’s participation in China’s Belt and Road Initiative, which Morrison said weakens the federal government’s ability to control foreign policy.Morrison declined to comment on whether that arrangement would be vetoed.Relations between Australia and China, its largest trading partner, have soured since Morrison called for an independent international investigation into the origins of the coronavirus pandemic earlier this year.Beijing has also take umbrage at Canberra’s blocking of a recent agricultural deal, its barring of Chinese tech giant Huawei from its 5G network and legislation outlawing foreign interference in Australia’s domestic politics.China has blocked billions of dollars worth of Australian exports from lobsters to wine in recent months, all the while refusing to accept phone calls from Australian ministers.Ties soured further this week when a senior Chinese official posted a fake image of an Australian soldier holding a knife with blood on it to the throat of an Afghan child, prompting Morrison to demand an apology from Beijing.Australian universities earn billions of dollars in tuition fees from Chinese students but some of their agreements with state-backed Chinese institutions may now come under closer scrutiny.Last year Australia’s New South Wales state scrapped a Chinese-funded language programme in schools amid fears over foreign influence.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/australia-approves-tough-new-veto-powers-over-foreign-agreements-amid-china-row/story-VazzWcYCARIRnzUBKAwtJN.html
03-12-2020||World||Biden facing growing pressure over secretary of defense pick||President-elect Joe Biden is facing escalating pressure from competing factions within his own party as he finalises his choice for secretary of defense.Black leaders have encouraged the incoming president to select an African-American to diversify what has so far been a largely white prospective Cabinet, while others are pushing him to appoint a woman to lead the Department of Defense for the first time.At the same time, a growing collection of progressive groups is opposing the leading female contender, Michèle Flournoy, citing concerns about her record and private-sector associations.A coalition of at least seven progressive groups warned Biden to avoid Flournoy in an open letter to Biden obtained Wednesday by The Associated Press that referenced her record of “ill-advised policy decisions” — particularly in relation to Saudi Arabia, Yemen and Afghanistan — and an “opaque history of private-sector activity.” “Ms. Flournoy’s consistent support for military interventions has contributed to devastating crises around the world, including in Yemen,” said Jehan Hakim, chairperson of the Yemeni Alliance Committee, which helped organize the letter.Other contenders are emerging, including retired Army Gen. Lloyd Austin and Jeh Johnson, who served as the Pentagon’s top lawyer and then as head of the Department of Homeland Security during President Barack Obama’s second term. Both Austin and Johnson are Black.The competing pressures are intensifying less than a month into Biden’s urgent push to build an administration while trying to preserve the broad coalition that fueled his victory over President Donald Trump last month.And facing massive governing challenges once he takes office on Jan. 20, Biden can perhaps least afford to lose the backing of the Democratic Party’s fiery progressive base. Nearly 100 House Democrats belong to the Progressive Caucus, which may wield significant influence over Biden’s policy agenda as Democrats cling to their narrowest House majority in a century.Biden has already promised to enact a sweeping pandemic relief bill while overhauling health care, immigration and education systems and fighting for the most aggressive environmental protections in US history.Progressive groups have cheered a handful of Biden’s early hires — particularly Heather Boushey and Jared Bernstein to his Council of Economic Advisers — but have been far from satisfied overall. Despite early disappointment, they have resisted the temptation to embrace an adversarial tone as they decide how to flex their muscles most effectively in the new political climate, especially with several major Cabinet positions and senior positions yet to be filled.Justice Democrats spokesperson Waleed Shahid called Biden’s early picks “a mixed bag,” but noted that they have generally been more progressive than Obama’s early picks after his 2008 election victory.“The thing that was alarming to me was when Joe Biden said, ‘We already have a significant number of progressives in our administration,’” Shahid said. “I talked to a lot of people, and they said, ‘We have no idea what he’s talking about.’” Beyond the Defense Department, progressives are gearing up for the possibility of more aggressive fights on Commerce, Labor, Education, Interior and Justice, among other unfilled Cabinet posts. They have already signaled intense opposition to the likes of Rahm Emanuel, a former Obama White House chief being considered for transportation secretary, and Mike Morell, another Obama-era figure being eyed for CIA director.Flournoy, meanwhile, had been seen as the leading candidate for defense secretary under a Democratic president since Hillary Clinton’s failed 2016 campaign.She stood out as deeply experienced, respected on Capitol Hill and well known on the international stage. But soon after Biden’s victory, her stock seemed to slip as others, including Austin and Johnson, came into consideration.A leading Black voice in Congress, South Carolina Rep. James Clyburn, has openly called for Biden to choose more Black men and women for Cabinet positions. The Pentagon job, which has never been held by a woman or a Black person, is one of the last remaining opportunities for Biden to demonstrate his commitment to diversity at the senior levels of his national security team.Liberal critics have suggested Flournoy’s views are more hawkish than the president-elect’s, particularly on the Afghanistan War, and some have pointed to her position as a co-founder of consulting firm WestExec Advisors, which provides what it calls “unique geopolitical and policy expertise to help business leaders” and which has become a source of Biden selections for other national security positions. Another of WestExec’s founders, Antony Blinken, is Biden’s nominee for secretary of state, and Avril Haines, the nominee for director of national intelligence, is a former WestExec principal.There was no reference to race or gender in Wednesday’s letter opposing Flournoy. The signatories include the Yemen Relief and Reconstruction Foundation; Justice Democrats, which is aligned with Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders; Demand Progress; and Just Foreign Policy, among others.They were especially critical of reports that Flournoy had resisted calls to end the Saudi-led war in Yemen. Biden has promised to end US support for the war.The letter offers support for two potential Flournoy alternatives: Sens. Tammy Duckworth of Illinois and Kirsten Gillibrand of New York.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-facing-growing-pressure-over-secretary-of-defense-pick/story-rkKqmC1QXRmtNx4pzMpcwN.html
03-12-2020||World||Want Americans to have faith in current and future elections, says Trump||Reiterating his allegations of massive voters fraud and electoral malpractice in the presidential polls, US President Donald Trump has told his supporters his fight was to ensure that Americans have faith in this and future elections. “Within days after the election, we witnessed an orchestrated effort to anoint a winner, even while many key states were still being counted. The Constitutional process must be allowed to continue. We are going to defend the honesty of the vote by ensuring that every legal ballot is counted and that no illegal ballot is counted,” Trump told his supporters at a White House Christmas Party on Tuesday. “This is not just about honoring the votes of 74 million Americans who voted for me. It’s about ensuring that Americans can have faith in this election, and in all future elections,” Trump said, according to a transcript of his 45-minutes speech at the event which was closed for the press, but one of his supporters had it live on Facebook. Trump alleged the “corrupt mail-in balloting scheme that Democrats systematically put into place” allowed voting to be altered, especially in swing states, which they had to win. “While it has long been understood that the Democrat political machine engages in voter fraud, from Detroit to Philadelphia to Milwaukee, Atlanta, so many other places, what changed this year was the Democrat party’s relentlessly push to print and mail out tens of millions of ballots, sent to unknown recipients with virtually no safeguards of any kind,” he said. This allowed, he alleged, fraud and abuse to occur on a scale never seen before. Using the pandemic as a pretext, Democrat politicians and judges drastically changed election procedures, just months, and in some cases, weeks, before the election, he said. Very rarely were legislatures involved which was Constitutionally required, he said. “But very, very rarely, and you’ll see that as we continue to file our suits, it’s Constitutionally, absolutely incorrect what took place, even from a legal standpoint. “Many states, such as Nevada and California, sent millions of live ballots to every person on their voter rolls, whether those individuals had requested ballots or not,” he said. Whether they were dead or alive, they got the ballots, he claimed. Other states, such as Minnesota, Michigan and Wisconsin instituted universal absentee balloting right in the middle of an election year sending absentee ballot request forms to all voters, on all rolls, he said. This colossal expansion of mail-in voting opened the floodgates to massive fraud, alleged the president. Notably, election officials and media have said there has been no evidence of massive voters fraud as being alleged by Trump. “It is a travesty that in the year 2020 we do not have any means of verifying the eligibility of those who cast ballots in an election, and such an important election it is, for determining who they are, whether they live in the state or whether they are even American citizens,” Trump alleged. He alleged that the Dominion voting system switched his votes to rival Joe Biden, who is now the President-elect. “Ninety-six percent of the company’s political donations went to Democrats, not surprisingly. And frankly, when you look at who’s running the company, who’s in charge, who owns it, which we don’t know, where are the votes counted, which we think are counted in foreign countries, not in the United States,” he said.Trump said that China is happy with the election results as it did not want him to win. “We’re going to show it, and hopefully the courts; in particular, the Supreme Court of the United States; will see it. And respectfully, hopefully, they will do what’s right for our country. Because our country cannot live with this kind of an election. We could say, ‘Let’s go on to the next one’. But no, we have to look also at our past. We can’t let this happen.” Trump said that the “fraud” that his campaign has collected in recent weeks is overwhelming, having to do with the election. “Everyone is saying, ‘Wow, the evidence is overwhelming’, when they get to see it. But really, it’s too late to change the course of an election. It’s too late to change the outcome. In fact, there is still plenty of time to certify the correct winner of the election and that’s what we’re fighting to do,” he said. This is a national disgrace, he said, adding many European countries have instituted major restrictions on mail-in voting specifically because they recognise the nearly unlimited potential for fraud. “The pandemic simply gave the Democrats an excuse to do what they have been trying to do for many, many years. In fact, the very first bill that House Democrats introduced when Nancy Pelosi became speaker was an attempt to mandate universal mail-in voting and eliminate measures such as voter ID, which is so necessary,” he said. “Dramatically eroding the integrity of our elections was the Democrat’s number one priority for a simple reason: they wanted to steal the 2020 presidential election,” he alleged. Trump said that the only way to determine whether there was an honest vote is to conduct a full review of the envelopes in the relevant states. “You will find that many of them, tens of thousands, have fraudulent signatures. A full forensic audit is required to ensure that only legal ballots from lawfully registered voters that were properly cast are included in the final count,” he said. “This election was rigged,” he alleged.

He was 82.Carney had recently recovered from Covid-19, but had Alzheimer’s disease for more than a decade, the Wichita Eagle reported. He died at 4:30 a.m. at an assisted living facility in Wichita, his wife and brother told the Eagle.Frank Carney was a 19-year-old student at Wichita State University when he and his 26-year-old brother, Dan, borrowed $600 from their mother to start a pizza business in 1958 near their family’s Carney’s Market.“When you are starting a business that’s going to pay your way through college, you don’t even think about what the economy is doing,” Carney once told a 1992 entrepreneurship conference at Wichita State.“We didn’t care about who was in the White House or what the unemployment rate was,” he said. “The entrepreneur, all he thinks about is: Is there a market for the product? Can I sell it?” PepsiCo bought Pizza Hut for $300 million in 1977. Over the years, he got involved in various business ventures, including other food companies, real estate, oil and gas, automotive, rental and recreational businesses.Only five of about 20 of the companies made him money, which his brother contends is actually not a bad average.“He probably lost most of what he had made in Pizza Hut,” Dan Carney said. “He was not depressed. He was just aggressive to build something different.” When PepsiCo decided to move the Pizza Hut headquarters from Wichita to Dallas - a decision Frank Carney thought was a mistake - it solidified his decision to become a Papa John’s Pizza franchisee in the 1990s and compete against his former business associates in the Wichita market.Frank Carney had one of the largest Papa John’s franchises and kept working until Alzheimer’s struck.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pizza-hut-co-founder-frank-carney-dies-from-pneumonia-at-82/story-3ozqyIX5DKn28WRXwK5mKI.html

03-12-2020||World||Survey finds race and sex-based harassment ‘common’ at FEMA||More than a quarter of employees at the Federal Emergency Management Agency said they were harassed or discriminated against based on their gender or race, according to a survey released Wednesday as part of the fallout from allegations of sexual harassment by a senior official at the organization.The survey by the RAND Corp. found that such civil rights violations were “common” at FEMA, reported by about 29% of the employees surveyed last year.FEMA requested the survey in response to an internal report that found that the former head of the agency’s personnel office had improper sexual relationships with subordinates and created a “toxic” work environment, including by giving preferential treatment to his fraternity brothers.The official resigned from FEMA and the agency took steps to address the allegations, including creating an office of professional responsibility and requiring all of the nearly 20,000 employees to undergo anti-harassment training.FEMA Administrator Pete Gaynor said the agency would be taking additional measures in the coming months.“Even though the data from this survey is more than a year and a half behind us, these findings are alarming and simply not acceptable,” Gaynor said in a statement issued as the RAND survey data was released.The report featured responses from nearly 9,000 employees at the agency that leads the US response to natural disasters and managed an airlift to bring in huge supplies of protective medical gear and equipment in the early stages of the Covid-19 pandemic.It found that 20% of FEMA employees reported harassment and discrimination on the basis of sex. A little more than 18% reported violations based on their race or ethnicity.Few people felt comfortable reporting the violations, with employees saying they believed their complaint would not be addressed or they would face retaliation.There are few, publicly available studies of employee discrimination with comparable data, so it is difficult to compare the FEMA results with other organizations. RAND conducted a similar study at the Department of Defense, but that population is more male and younger.That earlier survey found 24% of women in the military experienced sexual harassment, slightly higher than what was found for women at FEMA.The findings are also in line with an Edison Research 2018 poll that found 21% of Americans said they had experienced sexual harassment in the workplace, including 27% of women and 14% of men.Coreen Farris, the lead author of RAND’s report on FEMA, said the results will provide a baseline for a follow-up survey planned for this spring. “Changing organizational culture and climate is no easy task, but one vital component is measurement of the problem,” she said.FEMA requested the study after the allegations against the former head of personnel led to an internal investigation that revealed systemic problems at the agency. The former official, Corey Coleman, resigned in June 2018, as the probe was underway.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/survey-finds-race-and-sex-based-harassment-common-at-fema/story-jUyCZ8mR81DG8ThCKCdmwM.html
03-12-2020||World||Nearly 100 world leaders to speak at UN session on Covid-19||Nearly 100 world leaders and several dozen ministers are slated to speak at the UN General Assembly’s special session starting Thursday on the response to Covid-19 and the best path to recovery from the pandemic which has claimed 1.5 million lives, shattered economies, and left tens of millions of people unemployed in countries rich and poor.Assembly President Volkan Bozkir said when he took the reins of the 193-member world body in September that it would have been better to hold the high-level meeting in June. Nonetheless, he said Wednesday it “provides a historic moment for us to come together to beat Covid-19.”“With news of multiple vaccines on the cusp of approval, and with trillions of dollars flowing into global recovery efforts, the international community has a unique opportunity to do this right,” he said. “The world is looking to the UN for leadership. This is a test for multilateralism.”When financial markets collapsed and the world faced its last great crisis in 2008, major powers worked together to restore the global economy, but the Covid-19 pandemic has been striking for the opposite response: no leader, no united action to stop the pandemic that has circled the globe.UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres sent a letter to leaders of the Group of 20, the world’s richest nations responsible for 80 percent of the global economy ahead of their summit in late March as Covid-19 was starting its killing spree urging that they adopt a “wartime” plan and cooperate on an international response to suppress the coronavirus. But there was no response.The two-day special session will not be raising money to finance vaccine immunizations or taking any political action, and there will be no final declaration, just a summary document from Bozkir.“The real point of this special is to galvanize concrete action to approach our response to Covid-19 in a multilateral and collective way,” General Assembly spokesman Brenden Varma said Wednesday. He added that there are currently many responses to the pandemic, but what’s needed now is to bring together all countries, UN actors, the private sector and vaccine developers.Leaders and ministers from over 140 countries will deliver pre-recorded speeches on Thursday after an in-person opening in the General Assembly including speeches by Bozkir and Guterres.Among the leaders slated to address the session are French President Emmanuel Macron, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, Japan’s Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga, South African President Cyril Ramaphosa, and European Union chief Charles Michel. The United States will be represented by Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar.Friday’s session will focus on three virtrual panels, the first on the UN’s response to Covid-19 and the second on vaccines that will include representatives from producers BioNTech and Oxford University-AstraZeneca, and the World Health Organization’s ACT-Accelerator which is working to get vaccines to the world’s poorest people. The final panel is on recovery from Covid-19. WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus is expected to participate in all three panels.Canada’s UN deputy ambassador Louise Blais, who organized the special session with Azerbaijan’s Ambassador Yashar Aliev, said it will be the first time that the UN system is bringing key players together to focus on Cpvid-19′s “myriad impacts.”“Countries around the world are facing their own internal impacts, but it’s important that the U.N. continue to advocate ... that this crisis impacts us all and the solutions are global,” she told The Associated Press in an interview. “So, we have to work together in order to ensure that all of us get out of this, because until everyone does, no one is really safe.”Blais said the session is “an important step” and will focus on implementing the three resolutions adopted by the General Assembly on Covid-19, especially the wide-ranging measure approved in September.The special session “comes at a critical time,” Blais noted, “because we now know that there are a number of vaccines that have proven to be effective.”“Now, all eyes are on the critical distribution of vaccines,” she said, adding that this is expected to be a key them during the special session and it’s one “where the world is expecting us to work together and make sure that we have an equitable distribution of vaccine globally.”UN spokesman Stephane Dujarric said secretary-general Guterres will be focusing on the need for all countries and people everywhere to have access to vaccines.“The vaccine needs to be treated as a `global public good’ and that will be the basis of the secretary-general’s message” on Thursday, Dujarric said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nearly-100-world-leaders-to-speak-at-un-session-on-covid-19/story-jsoDZ75I2QUEu5a7EdBPkM.html
03-12-2020||World||India makes its move, invites Boris Johnson to be Republic Day chief guest||UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson is expected to be chief guest at the 2021 Republic Day , and if he accepts an invitation from Prime Minister Narendra Modi it will make him the first British PM since John Major in 1993 to be guest of honour at the event.Prime Minister Modi formally invited him to be Republic Day chief guest in a November 27 telephone conversation, HT learns. Johnson, on his part, invited PM Modi to the G-7 summit in the UK next year.New Delhi is tight-lipped on the decision, but diplomats say that it is a well-thought-out strategy by PM Modi to invite his UK counterpart as a hard Brexit looms on the horizon and London wonders about its special relationship with Washington under the incoming administration of President-elect Joe Biden.In a November 27 tweet, PM Modi said that he had an excellent discussion with his friend, Johnson, on an ambitious road-map for India-UK ties in the next decade.“We agreed to work towards a quantum leap in our cooperation in all areas — trade and investments, defence and security, climate change and fighting Covid-19,” PM Modi wrote in the tweet.According to people based in the UK familiar with the details, the conversation between the two PMs was very positive, with Johnson offering a free trade agreement with India and to deepen cooperation on climate change issues. The leaders discussed ways to boost the partnership and put up a strong anti-Covid-19 response.While the UK is aspiring to become Global Britain from Great Britain, the January 1 Brexit will put serious pressure on London -- 47% of the UK’s exports have until now been bound for the European Union. With Europe prepared for a hard border and incoming US President Joe Biden having expressed his apprehensions about Brexit, the UK is facing uncertainty on trade issues.From the Indian point of view, it is necessary for New Delhi to engage London as the latter is part of the P-5 (the five permanent members of the UN Security Council) and still has the ear of the US on Afghanistan and Pakistan. The UK also has a strong political lobby from Mirpur in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK), which often steers its course on issues such as Jammu and Kashmir.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/india-makes-its-move-invites-boris-johnson-to-be-republic-day-chief-minister/story-AUTDCjNSTvX6kJ1iozBrzM.html
