I was feeling very sad, just like him.”“Eventually he felt better and he stopped crying,” Varon told CNN on Monday, which he said was his 256th consecutive day of work.“I don’t know why I haven’t broken down,” the doctor said. “My nurses cry in the middle of the day.”Varon said the isolation of the Covid unit was difficult for many patients, particularly the elderly.“You can imagine,” he said. “You are inside a room where people are coming in spacesuits.“When you are an elderly individual, it’s more difficult because you are alone,” he said.“Some of them cry. Some of them try to escape,” he said. “We actually had somebody who tried to escape through a window the other day.”Varon said the elderly man in the picture is “doing much better.”“We are hoping that before the end of the week he’ll be able to get out of the hospital,” he said.Varon also had a message for people who are not taking precautions amid the pandemic.“People are out there in bars, restaurants, malls,” the doctor said. “It is crazy. People don’t listen and then they end up in my ICU.“What people need to know is I don’t want to have to be hugging them.“They need to do the basic things -- keep your social distance, wear your masks, wash their hands, and avoid going to places where there are a lot of people,” he said. “If people would do that, healthcare workers like me could hopefully rest.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/photo-of-texas-doctor-comforting-elderly-covid-patient-goes-viral/story-fOyGiKqLAhknFBtjR5ZmsM.html

Tony Allen, the African American CEO of a Delaware university, will head it as CEO.Trump remains dug in, refusing to accept the result. With Republican-ruled Arizona and Democratic Nevada certifying Biden’s victory, all six swing states that Trump have now made their election outcomes official: Biden wins with 306 electoral votes to Trump’s 232.The Trump campaign has continued to file lawsuits, none of which withstood even the most cursory scrutiny in courts, and lobby Republican-controlled legislatures in these states to reject the outcome and send their own list of electors, who, according to the plan, will vote for Trump on December 14, and not for Biden as they should in the winner-takes-all system of electoral college voting.Trump called into a briefing his lawyers Rudy Giuliani and Jenna Ellis gave Republican legislators of Arizona, which has been wrongly portrayed as a “hearing”, as he had in Pennsylvania last week.“What they did is they played game, and games like nobody has ever seen before,” Trump said on the call, referring to Democrats. “This is the first time that Republicans or the first time anyone has fought back.” He went on to falsely claim he actually won the swing states that have certified Biden the winner.Meanwhile, Melania Trump, the first lady, unveiled season decorations for what will be the family’s last Christmas in the White House. “During this special time of the year, I am delighted to share “America the Beautiful” and pay tribute to the majesty of our great Nation. Together, we celebrate this land we are all proud to call home,” she wrote in a tweet with a one-minute video of the decorations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-assembles-administration-as-trump-cries-foul-in-another-call-in/story-sSu4gDSCcXId2e853yOCDM.html

Now the air defence ‘heavy artillery’ has arrived. The so-called large air defence system: the S-300V4,” Zvezda said.The Soviets seized the islands, known as the Southern Kuriles, at the end of World War Two and a territorial row over them has prevented the two sides signing a formal peace treaty since and strained relations for years.Japan is highly sensitive to military moves by Russia on the strategically important chain of islands that stretch northeast from Japan’s Hokkaido to the Russian Far East region of Kamchatka.Russia said in October it planned to deploy the missile system on the islands for the first time, but that the move would be part of military drills and not for combat duty.The deployment comes not long after former Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, who mounted a push to resolve the dispute and tried to win over Russian President Vladimir Putin, announced he was stepping down in August.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russia-deploys-advanced-s-300-missiles-to-disputed-islands-near-japan/story-NVqkx0T2D2DgJZJBSminlI.html

The board, which Facebook created in response to criticism of its handling of problematic content, said it had received 20,000 cases since it opened its doors in October.Three of the six cases involved content that Facebook removed for breaking hate speech rules.An Oversight Board spokesman said hate speech cases had been “the most significant proportion” of appeals received.“Hate speech is an especially difficult area,” Jamal Greene, one of the board’s co-chairs and a professor at Columbia Law School, told Reuters in an interview. “It’s not that easy ... for an algorithm to get the context of” such speech.In November, Facebook for the first time disclosed numbers on the prevalence of hate speech on the platform, saying that out of every 10,000 content views in the third quarter, 10 to 11 included hate speech.The global board’s other chosen cases involved content removed from Facebook or Instagram for violating rules on adult nudity, dangerous individuals and organizations, and violence and incitement. Greene said they raised “important line-drawing questions.”One case was submitted by Facebook itself. The company said this case highlighted the challenge it faced when dealing with the risks of offline harm caused by misinformation about the Covid-19 pandemic.Facebook can also ask the board for non-binding policy recommendations, but Greene said it had not yet done so.The board has opened a week-long public comment period on the first cases, which will be reviewed by five-member panels. There is a 90-day deadline for decisions on the cases to be reached and for Facebook to act on them.The board, which has been criticized for its limited remit, aims to start hearing cases from users in early 2021 about content that has been left on the site or taken down. This week, a group of Facebook critics dubbed “The Real Facebook Oversight Board” said it would hear three cases not yet eligible for users to take to the official oversight board, including a dispute about the Facebook account of Steve Bannon, President Donald Trump’s former adviser.Asked about this group, a spokeswoman for Facebook’s Oversight Board said: “Lots of people have opinions about Facebook. The Oversight Board is focused on making binding decisions and issuing policy recommendations that will hold Facebook to account.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/from-hate-speech-to-nudity-facebook-s-oversight-board-picks-its-first-cases/story-GT7sUrsWXJlMPOVqqPZJ5I.html
01-12-2020||World||Facebook-backed digital coin Libra renamed Diem in quest for approval||Facebook-backed cryptocurrency Libra has been rebranded “Diem” in a renewed effort to gain regulatory approval by stressing the project’s independence.Plans for Libra, first floated by Facebook last year, were slimmed-down in April after regulators and central banks raised concerns it could upend financial stability, erode control over monetary policy and threaten privacy.Tuesday’s name switch is part of a move to emphasise a simpler, revamped structure, Stuart Levey, CEO of the Geneva-based Diem Association behind the planned digital coin, said.“The original name was tied to an early iteration of the project that received a difficult reception from regulators. We have dramatically changed that proposition,” Levey told Reuters.Diem, which means “day” in Latin, now aims to initially launch a single dollar-backed digital coin, he added. He declined to comment on timing for the launch, which the Financial Times reported last week could be as early as January, saying only that it would only go ahead after approval by the Swiss markets watchdog.Facebook, which changed the name of its payments unit Calibra to Novi Financial in May, remains one of 27 members of the Diem Association, formerly the Libra Association. Novi’s head, David Marcus, is one of Diem’s five board members. “They are a critically-important member of the association,” said Levey of Facebook’s continuing involvement.“We are not trying to cut all ties, by any stretch. It (the name change) is to signify that the association is operating autonomously and independently,” he added.Diem aims to set itself apart from others by its focus on aspects of concern to regulators and western governments, including sanction controls and financial crime, Levey said. The project has said it would develop policies on anti-money laundering, terrorist financing and sanctions compliance and has ditched earlier plans to allow anyone to join its network.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/facebook-backed-digital-coin-libra-renamed-diem-in-quest-for-approval/story-N3PU0c7XZl1Pz3tx2uFFqN.html
01-12-2020||World||White House Christmas decorations over the years||Ever since US First Lady Melania Trump was secretly recorded showering profanity over decorating the White House for Christmas, holiday cheer there has taken a hit. But people’s curiosity has since peaked. Melania Trump seems to have finally got the hang of holiday decorations and the New York Times went so far as to declare this year’s theme, ‘America the beautiful’ to be “strikingly normal”.The history of Christmas celebrations at the White House has evolved over the years, and each first couple has left their unique imprint on the celebrations, marked by the presence of a German tradition in the First House of America.Richard Nixon and the Pageant of PeaceThe annual tree lighting ceremony in the White House, where the president turns on the lights of the Christmas tree was known as the Pageant of Peace. The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) sued former president Richard Nixon over the display of a Nativity Scene on White House grounds, stating that it amounted to ‘government sponsorship of religion’. The lawsuit was discarded later by the US Court of Appeals.Jacqueline Kennedy and the Nutcracker ChristmasJacqueline Kennedy is credited with commencing the first themed Christmas celebration in the White House, an example her successors would dutifully follow. She decorated the Christmas tree with figurines of the sugar plum fairy, ornamental birds, toys, and angels modelled after Pyotr Tchaikovsky’s Nutcracker Suite ballet. She reused these decorations for Christmas next year.Michelle Obama’s environmentally-conscious Christmas decorations‘Reflect, Rejoice, and Renew’ was the environmentally-conscious theme Michelle Obama went for in her first White House Christmas celebrations. The trees were lit with low energy consuming LED lights, and six of the trees were replanted by the National Parks Service after being displayed.A military ChristmasObama’s 2011 theme of ‘Shine, Give and Share’ cherished military families and their contributions. Children of military parents sent cards and toys for decorations; the Christmas tree was decorated with medals of military veterans. They repeated this tradition in 2014 and 2015 by inviting military families to tour the decorated White House grounds.Trump’s Rose Garden ChristmasA curious addition to Melania Trump’s Christmas this year is the addition of the Rose Garden to the White House-themed gingerbread house. The Rose Garden, where the announcement of Amy Coney Barrett’s nomination to the Supreme Court was made, was the scene of a super-spreader event during which both Donald and Melania Trump, their son, and numerous high-profile guests are said to have contracted the coronavirus disease. Commentators and critics have come up with hilarious speculations for this addition but official White House sources have clarified that it was added because the First Lady recently took part in its renovations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/white-house-christmas-decorations-over-the-years/story-0QewMc5VarnNu0PGNLN6TO.html

But we still see that a shortage for the network remains, and so we are working with the trade and industry ministry on additional deliveries from abroad,” he said.New daily infection numbers, which stood at 26,402 on Tuesday, have been gradually decreasing since hitting a record high on Nov 27. Anna Popova, head of consumer health watchdog Rospotrebnadzor, said the growth of the disease was slowing.However Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin said the situation remained quite tense in many of Russia’s more than 80 regions.In 17 regions, hospital bed capacity was less than 5%, said Murashko, with the Baltic exclave of Kaliningrad and St Petersburg presenting the greatest cause for concern.Russia has resisted imposing lockdowns during the second wave of the virus, preferring targeted curbs.With 2,322,056 infections, Russia has the fourth-largest number of Covid-19 cases in the world behind the United States, India and Brazil.

01-12-2020||World||Biden plan to end US fossil fuel subsidies faces big challenges||President-elect Joe Biden’s promise to end US fossil fuel subsidies worth billions of dollars a year for drillers and miners could be hard to keep due to resistance from lawmakers in a narrowly divided Congress, including from within his own party.The challenge reflects just one of the obstacles that Biden will need to overcome as he seeks to usher in sweeping measures to combat climate change and transform the nation’s economy to net-zero emissions within three decades. Biden has said axing fossil fuel subsidies will generate money to help pay for his broader $2 trillion climate plan.While Biden can take executive action to reverse President Donald Trump’s rollbacks of rules meant to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, reforming tax breaks that allow companies to produce oil, gas and coal more cheaply will require Congress to pass legislation. Doing so could be hard, even though Biden spent 36 years in the Senate where he is known as a dealmaker.“It’s dead on arrival in the Senate,” said Gilbert Metcalf, a former deputy assistant secretary for environment and energy at the Treasury Department under former President Barack Obama, referring to any standalone legislation ditching the tax breaks if Republicans maintain control of the chamber. Even if two of Biden’s fellow Democrats win runoff votes in Georgia on Jan. 5, bringing the Senate to a 50-50 split with Vice President-elect Kamala Harris acting as tie breaker, chances of passing a tax package are slim, experts said.That is because moderate Democrats from fossil fuel producing states, like Senators Martin Heinrich of New Mexico and Joe Manchin of West Virginia, the top Democrat on the Senate Energy Committee, could stymie the effort. “In states like New Mexico, where senators might be green enough to support a climate bill ... a measure that merely strips tax provisions looks like a non-starter,” said Kevin Book, an analyst at ClearView Energy Partners. Neither Manchin’s office, nor Heinrich’s responded to requests for comment.Obama also wanted to ditch tax breaks for fossil fuels to send a signal to the world that the United States was serious about speeding a transition away from fossil fuels to tackle climate change. But even with a commanding Democratic majority in the Senate in Obama’s first six years in office, he was unable to kill the subsidies.The Biden transition team did not respond to a request for comment. Doing away with tax breaks on producers of fuels that emit greenhouse gases would fit neatly with Biden’s pro-climate agenda, which marks a reversal from Trump’s efforts to roll back climate regulations while boosting fossil fuel output. It would help establish the United States as a global leader on climate, potentially helping convince other big emitters to axe fossil fuel subsidies. Leaders in the G20 resolved in 2009 to ditch the subsidies but have made little progress.“It’s harder for us to get a country to do something if we’re not doing it ourselves,” said Metcalf. Estimates of the value of fossil fuel subsidies, which mainly take the form of tax breaks, vary.Bob McNally, the president of the consultancy Rapidan Energy Group, estimates they run $15 billion a year. The nonprofit Environmental and Energy Study Institute puts them at $20 billion annually. Estimates that consider the health care costs linked to pollution from fossil fuels put the subsidies even higher.One U.S. tax break, called intangible drilling costs, allows producers to deduct a majority of their costs from drilling new wells. The Joint Committee on Taxation, a nonpartisan panel of Congress, has estimated that ditching it could generate $13 billion for the public coffers over 10 years.Another, the percentage depletion tax break which allows independent producers to recover development costs of declining oil gas and coal reserves, could generate about $12.9 billion in revenue over 10 years, according to the panel.Biden and Congress will be under pressure to reduce the federal deficit by cutting such tax breaks. But wider tax reforms will also take up debate such as corporate tax rates and boosting taxes on the biggest earners, some of which might take priority. Any bill to alter the tax provisions for the fossil fuel sector will also face heavy resistance from lobbyists, some of whom may point out that solar, wind and other non-fossil energy sources also receive substantial taxpayer support.The American Petroleum Institute, the country’s biggest oil and gas lobby group, will “advocate for a tax code that supports a level playing field for all companies regardless of economic sector,” said Frank Macchiarola, a senior vice president at the industry group.API will push for “pro-development policies that sustain and grow the billions of dollars in government revenue our industry generates at the state and federal level,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-plan-to-end-us-fossil-fuel-subsidies-faces-big-challenges/story-WfXDX0XD1gOktUaNS5OTUJ.html

The WHO guidelines stipulate that victims can be “buried or cremated.” UN Rapporteurs and international rights watchdogs had urged the Sri Lankan government to review the decision and respect the Muslim community’s burial rights.The court decision came as the country is currently gripped in a second wave of the pandemic. The number of cases and deaths has increased six times since the early October.According to the Johns Hopkins University data, Sri Lanka has reported 23,987 cases and 118 deaths.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/sri-lanka-s-highest-court-rejects-petitions-from-muslims-against-covid-19-cremations/story-Ycfwp9DREqw1ihAWJwx7tJ.html

However, experimental screening of drug combinations is very slow and expensive, and therefore, often fails to discover the full benefits of combination therapy, they said. “The model gives very accurate results. For example, the values of the so-called correlation coefficient were more than 0.9 in our experiments, which points to excellent reliability,” Rousu said. In experimental measurements, a correlation coefficient of 0.8-0.9 is considered reliable, the researchers said. The model accurately predicts how a drug combination selectively inhibits particular cancer cells when the effect of the drug combination on that type of cancer has not been previously tested, they said. “This will help cancer researchers to prioritise which drug combinations to choose from thousands of options for further research,’ said Tero Aittokallio from the University of Helsinki in Finland. The researchers noted that the same machine learning approach could be used for non-cancerous diseases. They said, in that case, the model would have to be re-taught with data related to that disease. For example, the model could be used to study how different combinations of antibiotics affect bacterial infections or how effectively different combinations of drugs kill cells that have been infected by the SARS-Cov-2 coronavirus, according to the researchers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-ai-model-may-help-treat-cancer-more-effectively-study-says/story-lP9ihoN20tJUXaw45UlyBP.html
01-12-2020||World||South Korea passes law allowing BTS to postpone mandatory military service||South Korea’s parliament on Tuesday passed a bill to allow globally recognised K-pop artists such as BTS to postpone their mandatory military service to age 30.All able-bodied South Korean men aged between 18 and 28 must serve in the military for about two years as part of the country’s efforts to guard against North Korea.The amendment to the Military Service Act was designed to provide exceptions for K-pop megastars who improve the country’s cultural status and boost the economy.South Korea allows eligible students to defer their duties up to age 28 and has granted exemptions for high-profile classical musicians and athletes who won Olympic medals or a gold at the Asian Games, including Tottenham Hotspur forward Son Heung-min.No K-pop stars had received exemptions but the new bill will ensure entertainers recommended by the culture minister can defer their service to age 30.The oldest member of BTS, 27-year-old Jin, is nearing enlistment at a time when the seven-member boy band is rewriting K-pop history.Since launching in 2013, BTS has driven the global K-pop craze with catchy, upbeat music alongside lyrics and social campaigns aimed at empowering young people.It recently notched a first ever No.1 hit single on the US Billboard charts with the song “Dynamite”, and bagged an unprecedented Grammy nomination as a K-pop band.“Pop artists tend to make their highest achievements in their 20s but many of them had to pursue a graduate degree to delay their service,” said Jeon Yong-gi, who co-authored the bill.BTS’s management, Big Hit Entertainment, did not respond to a request for comment on the legislative change, but Jin and other band members have previously said they would fulfil their duties as required.Military service is a contentious issue in South Korea. A poll released last month by local news outlet E-Today showed some 53% of respondents supported special treatment for BTS, while 47% opposed it.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/south-korea-passes-law-to-allow-bts-to-postpone-mandatory-military-service/story-Kpx0NpxsuXl1YEEBQi1B6N.html

01-12-2020||World||Nirav Modi’s UK jail remand extended again||The Westminster Magistrates Court on Tuesday further extended the prison remand of diamantaire Nirav Modi, who is facing a trial for extradition to India to face charges of major financial offences linked to a Mumbai branch of the Punjab National Bank (PNB).The remand needs to be extended every 28 days, which means he will remain in the Wandsworth jail in west London at least until December 29, when it is likely to be extended again.Concluding statements in the ongoing extradition trial are due to be made on January 7 and 8 by the Crown Prosecution Service on India’s behalf and by Modi’s lead lawyer, Claire Montgomery.At the last hearing on November 3, citing the December 2018 judgment on the extradition of businessman Vijay Mallya, the court had rejected objections by Modi’s defence team on admitting evidence submitted by the Indian government in the latter’s extradition case.District judge Samuel Goozee said he was bound by the Mallya judgment delivered by chief magistrate Emma Arbuthnot, who also dealt with the issue of admissibility of India’s evidence and decided to accept them. He said he would adopt the “approach taken in Mallya”.Statements of several witnesses to Modi’s alleged fraud are part of India’s documentation in the case, including individuals who alleged that they were threatened at the behest of Modi.Modi is the subject of two extradition requests; one processed by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) and the other by the Enforcement Directorate (ED).Charges against Modi involve the PNB’s Mumbai branch that extended his companies loans worth over Rs 11,300 crore. The CBI case relates to large-scale fraud upon PNB, through the fraudulent obtaining of Letters of Understanding (LOUs/ loan agreements); the ED case relates to the laundering of the proceeds of that fraud.The second extradition request was made on the basis of two additional offences as part of the CBI case, relating to allegations that Modi interfered with the CBI investigation by “causing disappearance of evidence” and intimidating witnesses (“criminal intimidation to cause death”).The magistrates court had cleared Mallya’s extradition in December 2018. His appeals in the high court were also turned down, but the extradition currently awaits resolution of a legal process, widely believed to be an application for asylum.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nirav-modi-s-uk-jail-remand-extended-again/story-CndLxUmq0dEY0JqHdpCn7L.html

The UK government said that the winter plan will minimise damage to the economy and society, jobs and livelihoods.In its winter plan summary, the government has stated that lifting national restrictions have become possible because the ongoing restrictions have slowed the spread of the virus and eased the pressure on the National Health Service (NHS). On December 2, shops, personal care, gyms and the wider leisure sector will reopen regardless of tier.The winter plan also provides for the resumption of collective worship, weddings and outdoor sports. According to the plan, the stay-at-home requirement will end and travel will be allowed, subject to the guidance in each tier. However, the government cautioned that the coronavirus pandemic is still present and that’s why a regional, tiered approach will be introduced.Also Read | Boris Johnson defends ‘tough’ England tiers to buy time for Covid vaccinesWhile Tier 1 indicates ‘medium alert’, Tier 2 and Tier 3 indicate ‘high’ and ‘very high alert’ respectively.

01-12-2020||World||UK was poorly prepared for Covid-19 pandemic, says Venki Ramakrishnan||Identifying Brexit and the Covid-19 pandemic as two issues that defined his tenure as president of the Royal Society, Nobel laureate Venki Ramakrishnan, who left the role after five years on Monday, said the UK was “poorly prepared” to deal with the coronavirus pandemic.Ramakrishnan, who won the Nobel Prize for Chemistry in 2009, was the first Indian-origin scientist elected president of the society in 2015. The society is a fellowship of many of the world’s most eminent scientists and is the oldest scientific academy in continuous existence. The new president is statistician Adrian Smith.Delivering the anniversary day address 2020, Ramakrishnan, 68, dwelt on various issues, focusing on the impact of Brexit on science and the ways in which the UK government dealt with the pandemic.He said, “It is not surprising that in this rapidly evolving situation, there were missteps and mistakes. Despite a pandemic being the No. 1 item on the national risk register, we were poorly prepared. We did not take the virus seriously enough, early enough.”“It does not strike me as a coincidence that in January and perhaps even part of February, we were distracted by Brexit and our main focus was on plans for a post-EU Britain. We did not have the PPE needed; we were slow to go into lockdown; we spread infection from our hospitals to our care homes; we did not have the procedures in place to stem infections in hospitals; our understanding of who was being impacted the most was hindered by a failure to gather and understand data – that left some groups more exposed; we had insufficient testing capacity; and we likely went into a second lockdown too late as well, despite scientific advice to the contrary,” he added.Ramakrishnan, who will return to his research role in the MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology in Cambridge, is a member of the UK government’s Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies that is key to decisions on dealing with the pandemic. He also led groups in Royal Society on issues related to Covid-19.On the impact of Brexit on the UK’s position in science, he said it was vital that London retains highly-skilled scientists working and ensures that talented people from around the world still choose to come and contribute to the country’s globally competitive science. The establishment of the global talent visa has been a significant step, he added.Recalling that he thought of himself as an “unlikely choice” when he was elected president of the society in 2015, he noted the turn of history that eventually led to an Indian-origin scientist leading it.“When I was approached, I must confess I thought of myself as an unlikely choice and made that clear. Ironically, the first fellows to come into contact with India were colonisers like Robert Clive and Warren Hastings, or colonial administrators like Thomas Macaulay and Richard Temple. They certainly did not regard Indians as their equals in any way, and would frankly have been astonished that one day, someone born in India would go on to become a fellow, let alone a president of the Society.“I came to Britain relatively late in life, and spent much of the time since in the confines of the LMB in Cambridge working on ribosomes. I had neither the large networks of someone who grew up here, nor indeed any familiarity with the British establishment.”“So it was particularly broad-minded and generous, and perhaps a bit foolish of you to have entrusted me with this position. I was very touched that you did so, and in turn, I have given it my best in what has been an exceptionally challenging and turbulent five years. Perhaps being a somewhat naïve outsider who tried to see both sides of issues may actually have helped make the case to people of divergent political persuasions,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-was-poorly-prepared-for-covid-19-pandemic-says-venki-ramakrishnan/story-Ma2wHetkT4lllr4Fk98q9H.html
01-12-2020||World||Germany says emergency Covid-19 aid can’t continue indefinitely||Germany can’t continue compensating businesses for lost sales beyond next month and more targeted measures will be needed instead, according to senior officials in Chancellor Angela Merkel’s government.Germany has been in partial lockdown since the beginning of November, with restaurants, bars, gyms and cultural venues shut to try to limit the spread of the coronavirus. The restrictions are likely to remain in force into next year, but Economy Minister Peter Altmaier suggested the emergency compensation, which is costing at least 15 billion euros ($18 billion) a month, won’t be extended beyond December.“We certainly won’t be able to continue with these very broad packages which compensate for lost sales,” Altmaier said Monday in an interview with DLF radio. He noted that the government has extended so-called bridge aid for companies until the end of June, which will help pay for fixed costs such as rent and heating.“The state is in a position to act now as we made provisions in the good times, but it’s also true that we can’t continue with these policies for years,” he added. “And we won’t have to, as we’re all hoping that the vaccines are rolled out next year.”Merkel and regional leaders agreed on the latest shutdown measures to try to stem a surge in infections that has taken the total number of cases well beyond 1 million, with more than 16,000 deaths. Cases have almost doubled since the start of November, stretching capacity in intensive care units.Some officials at the federal level have been arguing that the 16 states should make more of a contribution to funding aid measures, a dispute that bubbled to the surface Monday at a meeting of Merkel’s CDU leadership.Ralph Brinkhaus, the head of Merkel’s caucus in the lower house of parliament, had a heated exchange on the issue with Volker Bouffier, the premier of the state of Hesse, according to an official familiar with the discussion who asked not to be identified.Merkel also criticized some state leaders for opening hotels over the Christmas period. The clashes underscore tensions between national policy makers and regional officials about Germany’s strategy in dealing with the virus.‘New Impetus’Altmaier said that the current virus trend is “not the one that we would have liked” and that around 85% of districts still have numbers which are “much too high” to allow for effective contact tracing.Helge Braun, Merkel’s chief of staff, was quoted as saying Monday that support for businesses needs to be more targeted from January and compensating for sales can’t be a long-term strategy.“The decision for November aid was an ad-hoc measure,” Braun said in an interview with Handelsblatt newspaper. If necessary, the government will provide “new impetus” for the economy next year, he added.“We will have to see in the summer,” he said. “If we can get through the winter safely, and a vaccine is available for many people in the spring, then that could boost the economy.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/germany-says-emergency-covid-19-aid-can-t-continue-indefinitely/story-b0ioUmuKfALQzhTv2BzhAI.html
01-12-2020||World||Pennsylvania Supreme Court to hear appeal of Bill Cosby’s 2018 sexual assault conviction||The Pennsylvania Supreme Court on Tuesday will hear a two-pronged appeal of Bill Cosby’s 2018 sexual assault conviction, with the disgraced entertainer’s lawyers asking the justices to either grant him a new trial or drop the case.Cosby’s lawyers blame his conviction in part on the national fervor in 2018 surrounding the #MeToo movement, which sought to hold powerful men accountable for unpunished sexual assaults. Cosby was the first celebrity convicted of sexual abuse after the start of the movement.“The American criminal justice system was designed to convict defendants based upon their conduct - not on their general character,” Cosby’s lawyers argue in their brief. “The fervor of the #MeToo movement rendered this cherished constitutional tenet obsolete at Cosby’s trial.”Cosby, a comedian and actor best known as the lovable father from the 1980s TV hit “The Cosby Show,” was convicted of three counts of aggravated indecent assault after drugging a former friend, Andrea Constand, in January 2004 at his suburban Philadelphia mansion. At the time Constand was director of operations of Temple University women’s basketball team. Cosby is serving a three-to-ten-year sentence in a state prison near Philadelphia.One prong of Cosby’s appeal, which will be heard virtually by the seven justices because of pandemic restrictions, attacks the decision by Montgomery County Judge Steven O’Neill to allow testimony at the trial by five “prior bad act” witnesses.Prosecutors hoped the testimony of five women who over the years have also accused the entertainer of sexual assault, would show a pattern of behavior by Cosby of befriending younger women with promises of career help and then drugging and raping them.They were among some 50 women who accused Cosby, now 83, of sexual assaults going back decades, though all the accusations but Constand’s were too old to prosecute.Cosby’s legal team, led by Jennifer Bonjean, a Brooklyn lawyer, will argue that the five women’s claims are too dissimilar to Constand’s complaint to have been allowed.His lawyers will also argue that Cosby was given immunity from prosecution by former Montgomery County District Attorney Bruce Castor in 2005 in return for his deposition in Constand’s civil suit.Montgomery County District Attorney Kevin Steele’s legal team, led by Adrienne Jappe, an assistant prosecutor at the 2018 trial, disagrees on both counts.“The trial court properly denied the non-prosecution claim. Its credibility determination and factual-finding that there was no promise is supported by the record. Even if it existed, the district attorney lacked the authority to grant non-statutory immunity,” they write in their brief.Prosecutors note that testimony by the five women and the invalidity of Castor’s supposed non-prosecution agreement with Cosby passed muster both with O’Neill and the Pennsylvania Superior Court, the state’s intermediate appellate court.In December 2019, a Pennsylvania appeals court dismissed Cosby’s bid to overturn his conviction. It is unlikely that the Supreme Court will render a decision on Tuesday. It typically takes weeks or even months to hand down rulings.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pennsylvania-supreme-court-to-hear-appeal-of-bill-cosby-s-2018-sexual-assault-conviction/story-I4LBvp6ylwLBn11q9NbSgO.html
01-12-2020||World||Iran’s parliament advances bill to stop nuclear inspections||Iran’s parliament Tuesday advanced a bill that would end UN inspections of its nuclear facilities and require the government to boost its uranium enrichment if European signatories to the 2015 nuclear deal do not provide relief from oil and banking sanctions.The vote to debate the bill, which would need to pas through several other stages before becoming law, was a show of defiance after the killing of a prominent Iranian nuclear scientist last month. Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has the final say on all nuclear policies.The official IRNA news agency said 251 lawmakers in the 290-seat chamber voted in favor, after which many began chanting “Death to America!” and “Death to Israel!”The bill would give European countries three months to ease sanctions on Iran’s key oil and gas sector, and to restore its access to the international banking system. The US imposed crippling sanctions on Iran after President Donald Trump unilaterally withdrew from the nuclear agreement, triggering a series of escalations between the two sides.The bill would have authorities resume enriching uranium to 20%, which is below the threshold needed for nuclear weapons but higher than that required for civilian applications. It would also commission new centrifuges at nuclear facilities at Natanz and the underground Fordo site.Parliament would need to hold another vote to pass the bill, which would also require approval by the Guardian Council, a constitutional watchdog. Lawmakers have pressed for a more confrontational approach since the US withdrew from the nuclear agreement in 2018.Cabinet spokesman Ali Rabiei acknowledged the limitations of such an approach on Tuesday, saying the nuclear file is under the authority of the Supreme National Security Council, and “nobody can work on it independently.” President Hassan Rouhani, a relative moderate, heads the council, which answers to the supreme leader.The bill was first tabled in parliament in August but gained new momentum after the killing of Mohsen Fakhrizadeh, who headed a program that Israel and the West have alleged was a military operation looking at the feasibility of building a nuclear weapon. The International Atomic Energy Agency says that “structured program” ended in 2003. US intelligence agencies concurred with that assessment in a 2007 report.Israel insists Iran still maintains the ambition of developing nuclear weapons, pointing to Tehran’s ballistic missile program and research into other technologies. Iran long has maintained that its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes.Iran has blamed Fakhrizadeh’s killing on Israel, which has long waged a covert war against Tehran and its proxies in the region. Israeli officials have declined to comment on the killing, and no one has claimed responsibility.Some Iranian officials have suggested that the International Atomic Energy Agency, which has been regularly inspecting Iran’s nuclear facilities in recent years as part of the 2015 agreement, may have been a source of intelligence for Fakhrizadeh’s killers.Iran began publicly exceeding uranium enrichment levels set by the nuclear agreement after the US restored sanctions. It currently enriches a growing uranium stockpile up to 4.5% purity.That’s still far below weapons-grade levels of 90%, though experts warn Iran now has enough low-enriched uranium to reprocess into fuel for at least two atomic bombs if it chose to pursue them.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/iran-s-parliament-advances-bill-to-stop-nuclear-inspections/story-KpOucLEXSCA8tyGgsU8hWL.html
01-12-2020||World||Brexit from January 1: UK’s new points-based visa system opens||A month before the UK completes the Brexit process and begins a new phase from January 1, 2021, a new points-based immigration system that treats professionals from EU countries at par with those from India and other countries opened on Tuesday.Under the new set-up, designed along the lines of Australia’s points system, points will be awarded for a job offer at the appropriate skill level, knowledge of English and for a minimum salary of £25,600 per year. Skilled worker visas will be awarded to those who gain enough points.When the UK was a member of the EU - it formally left in January this year and is in the transition period - citizens from member-states were able to move and work in the UK under the “freedom of movement” facility. This facility ends with the completion of the Brexit process and the end of the transition period on December 31 this year, making it mandatory for EU citizens to go through the same visa rules as applicable to others.The UK’s home office said that applications can be made online, with decisions expected within three weeks. Applicants will need to have enough money to pay the application fee (ranging from £610 to £1,408), the healthcare surcharge (usually £624 per year), and be able to support themselves (usually by having at least £1,270 available). The visa lasts for up to five years before it needs to be extended.UK home secretary Priti Patel said, “This government promised to end free movement, to take back control of our borders and to introduce a new points-based immigration system. Today, we have delivered on that promise.“This simple, effective and flexible system will ensure employers can recruit the skilled workers they need, while also encouraging employers to train and invest in the UK’s workforce. We are also opening routes for those who have exceptional talent or show exceptional promise in the fields of engineering, science, tech or culture.”Besides the skilled worker visas, other visas also opened on Tuesday, including global talent visas for people who can show they have exceptional talent or exceptional promise in the fields of science, engineering, humanities, medicine, digital technology or arts and culture.Also open are innovator visas for persons seeking to establish businesses in the UK based on innovative, viable and scalable business ideas, and start-up visas for persons seeking to establish businesses in the UK for the first time.The student route and child student route opened on October 5, 2020 to eligible international students from across the globe, the home office said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/brexit-from-january-1-uk-s-new-points-based-visa-system-opens/story-u15vNPTRlCjFNzpaD2iPGO.html
01-12-2020||World||China #MeToo case heads to court after two year delay||Zhou Xiaoxuan’s says her prestigious internship with Chinese state TV soured after a popular host forcibly kissed her.Outraged, Zhou took the previously taboo step of filing a lawsuit in 2018, joining the global #MeToo movement against sexual harassment. But the ruling Communist Party dislikes such grassroots activism and offers few ways to pursue complaints. Zhou waited two years for a hearing, while the host fought back by filing a defamation lawsuit.On Wednesday, Zhou’s case goes to trial in Beijing, highlighting the growing willingness of Chinese women to speak up about sexual harassment despite official resistance and censorship that eroded #MeToo’s impact.“There are very few sexual harassment cases who have a court hearing,” Zhou said. “We hope each individual case can be a type of push forward.” The ruling party, whose late leader Mao Zedong famously declared, “women hold up half the sky,” has improved their legal and social status but is far from delivering on its promise of equality. In some areas, conditions are deteriorating: Women have disappeared from leadership roles over the past three decades.#MeToo’s global spread helped to encourage activism in China. But that came at a time when President Xi Jinping’s government is tightening controls and stamping out dissent.Women who complain face censorship and official resistance. It was only in 2019 that sexual harassment was added to court regulations as grounds for a suit.Zhou accuses CCTV host Zhu Jun of groping and forcibly kissing her in 2014. She is asking for a public apology as well as 50,000 yuan ($7,600) in damages.In a series of social media posts, she said she was alone with Zhu in his dressing room for a few minutes. She said he tried to reach into her dress and drag her onto himself, and then forcibly kissed her. The posts were shared widely and reposted by many on the Chinese internet and prompted a great amount of media coverage.When Zhou filed suit in 2018, such complaints were treated as labor disputes or under other laws that didn’t relate directly to sexual harassment. Zhou’s was termed a “personality rights dispute.” Her lawyers have asked for it to be heard under the new legal provision that explicitly cites sexual harassment.Zhu, the CCTV host, has denied the allegations. A call to his phone wasn’t answered. A person who answered at the number in public records for the law firm that represents him said the firm had moved and had no new number.Zhu has a countersuit pending against Zhou asking for damages of 650,000 yuan ($100,000).Zhou expressed hope her case will show “there are problems in the legal process.” The movement took off in 2018 in China when a college student in Beijing publicly accused her professor of sexual harassment.In a rare victory, a woman who used the alias Liu Li won a sexual harassment suit against her former boss in July. The boss, a social worker in the western city of Chengdu, was required to issue a public apology but no damages were awarded.Activists want more legislative changes and legal tools.“No matter what the result is, we feel that doing this has meaning,” Zhou said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-metoo-case-heads-to-court-after-two-year-delay/story-uDOEKg0ccxgepy7zDdH6qK.html
01-12-2020||World||On World AIDS Day, South Africa finds hope in new treatment||Health officials are hoping that new, long-acting drugs to help prevent HIV infection will be a turning point for the fight against a global health threat that’s been eclipsed by the coronavirus pandemic.South African President Cyril Ramaphosa highlighted the new drug in a weekly newsletter, saying the long-term acting and injectable HIV drug has “the potential to significantly strengthen our response to the epidemic.”The region is especially hard-hit. South Africa has the biggest epidemic in the world with 7.7 million people living with HIV, according to UNAIDS.In separate studies of men and women earlier this year, including one by the HIV Prevention Trials Network and the Reproductive Health and HIV Institute (RHI) at the University of Witwatersrand in South Africa, the drug — Cabotegravir — had successful trials. The shot given every two months has been proven to be 90% more effective than the daily pill known as PrEP.Ramaphosa’s message noted, however, that South Africa’s battle against HIV had suffered because of the coronavirus pandemic and the resultant strain on health services, a situation repeated in many countries with a high prevalence of HIV/AIDS.In her World AIDS Day message, UNAIDS executive director Winnie Byanyima lamented the fact that more than 12 million people are still waiting to get on HIV treatment, while 1.7 million people were infected with HIV in 2019 because of lack of access.She called on companies to “openly share their technology and know-how and to waive their intellectual property rights” so that the world can produce vaccines, including for Covid-19, at the scale required. There is no vaccine for HIV.She also stressed that the global AIDS response was off track even before Covid-19 and the world needed to reset its targets if it is to meet the goal of ending HIV/AIDS as a public health threat by 2030.The response against Covid-19 has shown what can be achieved by working together, UNAIDS said.Fears that the world is losing focus on the AIDS epidemic were reflected by figures in South Africa that showed 225,000 HIV/AIDS patients in the country’s largest province of Gauteng had discontinued their vital anti-retroviral treatment this year, partly but not only because of difficulties accessing care during the virus pandemic.Yet, amid the stark figures, health officials and women, hold onto hope that cabotegravir could mean less visits to health centers as many look to reduce exposure to Covid-19.Dr. Sinead Delany-Moretlwe, director of research at the Johannesburg-based RHI, said women in sub-Saharan Africa, who are disproportionately affected, were among those who will benefit significantly from the drug.Some research suggests women may be at greater risk of getting HIV through sex than men are, but Delany-Moretlwe added that social issues also contribute significantly to their increased risk.“Women do not always have power in relationships, and up until fairly recently, negotiated condom use was a challenge particularly in relationships where women rely on their partners for financial support or where the threat of violence is enough to keep women quiet,” said Delany-Moretlwe.Women such as 26-year-old Khanyiswa Kwatsha, who is currently taking the daily PrEP pill and promotes it among young women, are eagerly anticipating access to the new treatment, saying it will be much easier for them to protect themselves with an injectable drug they only have to take every eight weeks.“I am very happy because drinking a pill every day is not easy, while you know that you are not sick but you are drinking it to protect yourself,” Kwatsha said. She said that while PrEP has been pivotal, this new injectable drug will make life easier.The clinical trials were conducted among more than 3,200 women at research sites in South Africa, Uganda, Eswatini, Kenya, Malawi, Botswana and Zimbabwe.Cabotegravir is being developed by ViiV Healthcare, which is mostly owned by GlaxoSmithKline, with Pfizer Inc. and Shionogi Limited. The study was sponsored by the U.S. National Institutes of Health, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and ViiV. The drugs were provided by ViiV and Truvada’s maker, Gilead Sciences.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/on-world-aids-day-south-africa-finds-hope-in-new-treatment/story-MwoYG7oNiizoLZbUvfe8xM.html

01-12-2020||World||Cambridge’s chemistry department named after Indian scientist Yusuf Hamied||The department at the University of Cambridge where Indian scientist Yusuf Hamied, chairman of pharma major Cipla, studied has been named the Yusuf Hamied department of chemistry until 2050, the university announced on Tuesday.Hamied, 84, who was a student at Christ’s College, has retained close links with Cambridge over the past 66 years, the university said, adding that in 2018, he endowed one of the world’s oldest academic chairs in chemistry, now known as the Yusuf Hamied 1702 chair.The naming of the department follows a “generous benefaction” from Hamied, whose father, K A Hamied, started Cipla in Mumbai. He has pioneered the supply of HIV/AIDS medicines to developing countries at lost cost.He said, “Cambridge gave me the foundation of an education in chemistry, taught me how to live and showed me how to contribute to society. As a scholarship student myself, I am delighted to be able to support future generations of students. I will always be indebted to this great institution and everything it stands for.”The university said that Hamied’s gift endows both a fund to attract and support the world’s brightest academic talent in chemistry, including exceptional early career researchers in disciplines such as synthetic organic chemistry, and outstanding doctoral students from the UK and around the world through the new Hamied Scholars Programme.Vice-chancellor Stephen J Toope said, “Yusuf Hamied has demonstrated an unequivocal commitment to changing and improving lives since his time at Cambridge. I am profoundly grateful for his remarkable gift to the department of chemistry, which will benefit generations of students and researchers.”Hamied’s honours include an honorary fellowship of Christ’s College in 2004; the Padma Bhushan in 2005; an honorary fellowship of the Royal Society of Chemistry in 2012; and an honorary Doctorate of Science from the University of Cambridge in 2014. In 2019, he was elected an Honorary Fellow of the Royal Society and a Fellow of the Indian National Science Academy.Head of the chemistry department James Keeler said, “We are extremely thankful to Dr Hamied for his visionary support for Chemistry at Cambridge, which will allow us to respond flexibly to future opportunities. His gift will ensure we continue to attract outstanding scientists who will make the discoveries that help tackle some of the most pressing challenges in global society.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/cambridge-s-chemistry-department-named-after-indian-scientist-yusuf-hamied/story-iJCd5JzG4HvijmGrY7wQcL.html
01-12-2020||World||‘Google map of universe’: Australian scientists map millions of galaxies||A group of Australian scientists have mapped around three million galaxies in just 300 hours to create a “new atlas of the universe”, said a new study. The Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) said on Tuesday that its new telescope, Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder (ASKAP), conducted its first survey of the entire southern sky in “record speed and detail.”CSIRO, the national science agency, said in a statement that the survey is like a “Google map of the Universe” in which most of the star-like points are distant galaxies. The design and initial results of the study has been published in the Publications of the Astronomical Society of Australia. CSIRO chief executive Dr Larry Marshall said ASKAP generate more raw data at a faster rate than Australia’s entire internet traffic.“In a time when we have access to more data than ever before, ASKAP and the supercomputers that support it are delivering unparalleled insights and wielding the tools that will underpin our data-driven future to make life better for everybody.Also Read | NASA shares pic of nebula taken by Hubble telescope. Can you spot something else in it?According to CSIRO, the new data will enable astronomers to study and analyse the huge number of galaxies the same way social scientists use information from a national census. David McConnell, the lead author and CSIRO astronomer, said that the astronomers from around the world will be able to use the survey to explore the unknown and study how galaxies and their supermassive black holes evolve and interact.“For the first time, ASKAP has flexed its full muscles, building a map of the Universe in greater detail than ever before, and at record speed. We expect to find tens of millions of new galaxies in future surveys,” McConnell said in a statement.What is ASKAP?ASKAP is a new type of radio telescope, designed and built by CSIRO, which makes images of radio signals from the sky, enabling astronomers to view the universe at wavelengths that our eyes cannot see.

01-12-2020||World||Brexit talks still stuck because EU is asking too much, UK says||Brexit trade talks are stuck on fishing, governance rules and dispute resolution because the European Union is asking too much of Britain, a senior member of the British government said on Tuesday.Just 30 days before Britain leaves the EU’s orbit following a transition period since it formally quit the bloc, the sides are trying to agree a trade deal to avoid a turbulent rupture that could snarl almost $1 trillion in annual trade.With each side urging the other to compromise, a French official said Britain must clarify its positions and “really negotiate”, and cautioned that the EU would not accept a “substandard deal”. Even if a trade accord is secured, it is likely to be just a narrow deal on goods, and some disruption is almost certain as border controls are erected between the world’s biggest trading block and Britain.Talks have snagged on fishing in Britain’s rich waters, on what EU rules London will accept and on how any dispute might be resolved.“The EU still wants to take the lion’s share of the fishing in our waters - which is just not fair given that we are leaving the EU,” Michael Gove, Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster and a senior ally of Prime Minister Boris Johnson, told Sky.“The EU still want us to be tied to their way of doing things,” Gove said. “The EU are at the moment reserving the right, if there is any sort of dispute, not quite to rip everything up but to impose some really penal and tough restrictions on us, and we don’t think that’s fair.”A trade deal would not only safeguard trade but also buttress peace in British-ruled Northern Ireland, though some disruption is almost certain at the busiest EU-UK border points.Failure to secure a deal would snarl borders, spook financial markets and disrupt delicate supply chains that stretch across Europe and beyond -- just as the world grapples with the vast economic cost of the COVID-19 outbreak.Gove said the process was close to conclusion but avoided repeating an earlier prediction of a 66% probability of a deal. He declined to put a figure on the probability.German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Europe’s most powerful national leader, has said some of the EU’s 27 member states are getting impatient. “The priority is for the British to clarify their positions and really negotiate to find a deal,” a French presidency official told Reuters. “The EU also has interests to fight for, those of a fair competition for its businesses and those of its fishermen.”“The Union has made a clear and balanced offer for a future partnership with Britain. We will not accept a substandard deal which would not respect our own interests,” the official said.Irish Prime Minister Micheal Martin said a deal could be done this week.“There is a landing zone for an agreement,” Martin told the Irish Times in an interview. “We are now really in the endgame if a deal is to be arrived at this week.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/brexit-talks-still-stuck-because-eu-is-asking-too-much-uk-says/story-oaSk3C1Snq1cVKpWnNUPCI.html
01-12-2020||World||China’s fight with Australia risks backfiring as Biden era nears||China’s economic offensive against Australia is partly designed to warn countries against vocally opposing Beijing’s interests, particularly with Joe Biden looking to unite US allies. Yet it’s already showing signs of backfiring.China last week imposed anti-dumping duties of up to 212% on Australian wine, the latest in a slew of measures curbing imports from coal to copper to barley. Tensions escalated further on Monday after a Chinese Foreign Ministry official tweeted a fake photo of an Australian soldier holding a knife to the throat of an Afghan child.Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison quickly called on China to apologize for the “repugnant” tweet. China’s Foreign Ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying, in turn, questioned whether he lacks “a sense of right and wrong” and said overall ties deteriorated because Australia “took wrong measures on issues bearing on China’s core interests.”To Beijing, the attacks on Australia are meant to deter others like Canada, the European Union and Japan from joining a U.S.-led campaign to counter China’s rise. Communist Party officials see Morrison’s government as one of their most vocal critics, and an easy target: China accounts for about 35% of Australia’s total trade, three times more than the next highest country, Japan. Australia accounts for less than 4% of China’s commerce.“It is only natural that China wants to sound some precautionary alarm” to warn countries off building an anti-China alliance, said Zhu Feng, professor of international relations at Nanjing University. “After all, confrontation is the least wanted by the world now.”China is betting that most Western countries will avoid provoking Beijing and risking the kind of trade retaliation Australia is suffering, particularly with their economies weighed down by the pandemic. At the same time, it has sought to strengthen ties with Japan, South Korea and nations in Southeast Asia, in part by offering more trade, investment in 5G networks and access to Covid-19 vaccines.Yet China’s moves are adding to worries about its use of economic coercion, and could end up pushing middle powers closer to the US camp. President-elect Biden has vowed to rebuild relationships with allies damaged by Donald Trump’s “America First” policies, which in turn would make it more palatable for some allies to align more closely with his administration.“Biden is planning is to resume US international policy after a four-year hiccup,” said Jeff Moon, the US’s assistant trade representative for China for part of the Obama administration, adding that the scope of China’s actions against Australia was “breathtaking.”“The leverage is to work together,” he added. “That is what they most fear, and they see that coming.”While it’s still unclear how exactly that would work, several key groupings including the Quad -- the US, Japan, Australia and India -- as well as Five Eyes -- the US, Australia, UK, Canada and New Zealand -- have been revived in recent years. New initiatives have also been floated, including one that would give countries an alternative to Huawei Technologies Co. for 5G networks and another that would find alternative supply chains to China.The Wall Street Journal reported in November that the Trump administration was formulating a joint retaliation plan that would allow the West to push back against the kind of economic coercion China is inflicting on Australia. The European Union also plans to call on the US to seize a “once-in-a-generation” opportunity to forge a new global alliance that would counter China, the Financial Times reported Monday, citing a set of draft policy proposals.For its part, the Trump administration is continuing to pressure China with moves to prevent some of its biggest companies from accessing American technology. Senior officials have also stepped up visits to Asia ahead of the planned inauguration for Biden on Jan. 20: Following a visit to Japan in November, National Security Adviser Robert O’Brien said leaders in Tokyo saw the Quad as a “game changer.”“China against any individual country, including quite powerful countries like South Korea or Thailand or even Japan, China would be dominant,” said Malcolm Rifkind, a former British foreign secretary. “But in the real world when you have such a situation, your potential victims join up to ensure a collective and coordinated response.”‘Evil’ AustraliaPart of China’s aggressive response is for a domestic audience. State news agency Xinhua carried a commentary that called Morrison’s request for an apology “utterly absurd,” while the Communist Party’s Global Times called Australia “evil” in an editorial. Social media users on Weibo and Wechat commended Hua, the Foreign Ministry spokesperson, for exuding the “style of a great power” in her responses to repeated questions by foreign journalists.Still, in an early sign that Beijing’s Afghan tweet may have galvanized some of Australia’s partners into responding, New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said on Tuesday that her own diplomats had directly registered concern with Chinese authorities over the “unfactual post.” China rejected that, with Hua telling reporters in Beijing that she was “astonished” to hear about New Zealand’s comments.Lawmakers in the U.K. also condemned China’s actions, with former Conservative party leader Iain Duncan Smith urging Britain to do more to stand with Australia, the Sydney Morning Herald reported. A group he’s a member of consisting of lawmakers from a range of countries released a video urging people to drink Australian wine to stand up to China’s bullying.Beijing has also sought to distinguish between countries that step out of line, in effect playing them off each other. Earlier this year the Global Times said China should deliver “public and painful” retaliation to the U.K. for banning Huawei but avoid a full-fledged confrontation because it saw Britain as the “weak link” in the Five Eyes.In a phone call with his EU counterpart Josep Borrell last week, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi also signaled the bloc should think twice before strengthening ties with the incoming Biden administration, as the two sides look to complete an investment treaty by the end of the year. “Strategic autonomy is a necessary character for staying independent,” Wang said, adding that it involves “opposing man-made ‘decoupling’, opposing confrontation among different blocs and a new ‘Cold War.’”Australia, on the other hand, has faced China’s unabashed wrath ever since Morrison’s government called for Beijing to allow independent investigators into Wuhan to discover the origins of Covid-19. Chen Hong, director of the Australian Studies Centre at East China Normal University who said he had his visa to Australia revoked this year because he was labeled a national security risk, said Australia’s actions differentiated it from New Zealand, which maintained relatively good ties with Beijing.“Australia has been purposefully echoing the Washington’s anti-China policy and coordinated with Trump’s strategic intentions,” Chen said.Call for TalksIn Canberra, Australian officials have said Morrison’s government is speaking out for its own interests regardless of the U.S. on issues like China’s increasing grip over Hong Kong and assertiveness in the South China Sea. Morrison himself has also sought to portray Australia as stuck in the middle of the U.S. and China -- a view also shared by Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, who said in an interview in November that many nations in Asia aren’t keen to join an anti-China bloc.Even after he called on China to apologize for the Afghan tweet on Monday, Morrison again sought to restart talks with Beijing without conditions. The next day he also warned government lawmakers against further amplifying the fight over the image, according to Australian Associated Press.“Countries around the world are watching this, they are seeing how Australia is seeking to resolve these issues and they are seeing these responses,” Morrison told reporters on Monday. “This impacts not just on the relationship here, but with so many other sovereign nations not only in our own region, but like-minded countries around the world.”The spat has only hardened attitudes toward China within Australia, to the point where even business groups have stopped pushing for warmer ties, according to Natasha Kassam, a former Australian diplomat who worked in China and is now a research fellow at the Sydney-based Lowy Institute. At the same time, she said, it’s “impossible to imagine” China apologizing to Australia.“While there may be an emboldening of countries in the region responding to China,” she said, “it’s equally likely that a number of countries will see the way in which Australia’s export industry has been punished and think twice about making their own criticisms.”(Updates with comments from Chinese spokeswoman in 16th paragraph, reports about PM Scott Morrison in fourth-to-last paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2020 Bloomberg L.P.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-s-fight-with-australia-risks-backfiring-as-biden-era-nears/story-04Cav1b8izS6RytXuzIcMP.html

The proposal still requires final approval by parliament and the Guardian Council that vets laws.In accordance with the multi-party nuclear pact struck five years ago, Iran agreed to give United Nations inspectors more intrusive access to atomic sites.Also Read | Air strike kills Iranian commander at Iraq-Syria border: OfficialsThe draft legislation would also revive the mothballed core of a contentious reactor and increase Iran’s stockpile of uranium enriched to 20%, which could then be purified to weapons-grade material at short notice.The legislation was first proposed in early November as a signal to the US ahead of its presidential election, but the conservative-majority parliament fast-tracked it after a top Iranian nuclear scientist was assassinated on Friday in an attack Iran blamed on Israel.US President-elect Joe Biden has said he aims to rejoin the agreement President Donald Trump quit two years ago, provided Iran returns to the full compliance it abandoned in response to the US withdrawal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/iran-moves-ahead-on-bill-that-could-end-nuclear-inspections/story-Cjfh7c4ljDIdBVbrgBTvbL.html

Despite the high deficit, the government is preparing to spend up to an additional C$100 billion ($77.2 billion) to boost an economy that has been impact by the coronavirus crisis.“This recession is worse than 2008,” the statement said, adding, “It stands to reason we will need to invest more, not less.”The deficit is expected to touch C$381.6 billion by March next year. It could, however, increase as the country is now in the grip of a second wave of infections, sparking fresh curbs in some provinces.An official statement issued by the country’s finance department said that once the virus is under control, the government will “invest in a growth plan” of about 3-4% of GDP, between up to C$70-100 billion over a period of three years to “jump-start” the country’s “recovery”.“Time-limited investments will build Canada out of this recession towards an economy that is cleaner, more inclusive, more innovative and more competitive,” the statement added.The statement quoted Freeland as saying, “We will do whatever it takes to help Canadians through this crisis. We will invest in every necessary public health measure. We will support Canadians and Canadian businesses in a way that is targeted and effective. And we will ensure the Canadian economy that emerges from this pandemic is greener, more inclusive, more innovative, and more competitive than the one that preceded it, with a stronger, more resilient middle-class.”According to projections, the fiscal deficit will not return to pre-Covid-19 levels till 2026. It has also far outstripped the deficit recorded during the global financial crisis of 2008-2009.The number of confirmed Covid-19 cases in Canada rose by 6,103 to reach 377,806, while the death toll is at 12,130.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pandemic-effect-canada-facing-all-time-high-deficit-of-c-381-billion/story-PIH4A301Hgy0NeIuTurrcK.html

The 44 in their name stands for the fourth letter in the alphabet, DD, and is an abbreviation for Division Dirlewanger. Oskar Dirlewanger was a known Nazi war criminal and commander of a Nazi SS special unit.The far-right group was founded in 2016. It is known for possessing illegal weapons and members have participated in far-right protests.Earlier this year, the German government banned other far-right groups including the Combat 18 and the Nordadler, dpa reported.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/germany-bans-far-right-pro-nazi-group-police-raid-homes/story-F318ldWzmCfRxogwGErDRN.html
01-12-2020||World||Nobel laureate says pandemic raising violence, trafficking||Nobel Peace Prize laureate Nadia Murad said the coronavirus pandemic has increased trafficking of women and gender-based violence, leaving the health and safety of women “on the line.”The 27-year-old activist, who was forced into sexual slavery by Islamic State fighters in Iraq, said curfews, lockdowns and travel restrictions imposed by governments to slow the spread of the virus “have had unintended consequences on women worldwide.”“Rather than reducing human trafficking and gender-based violence, the pandemic has increased the risk of exploitation and brutality against those most vulnerable,” she said. “Numerous countries have seen increases in reports of domestic violence since the pandemic began.”Murad said domestic tensions have intensified in confined living spaces, and stay-at-home orders “are increasing human trafficking farther underground, out of sight of law enforcement.”“The few resources designated for prevention, rescue and rehabilitation are being stretched thin,” she said. “As a result, women’s health and safety are on the line. It is now difficult for many women to access psychological support (and) health care.”A member of Iraq’s Yazidi minority, Murad was among thousands of women and girls who were captured and forced into sexual slavery by Islamic State militants in 2014. Her mother and six brothers were killed by IS fighters in Iraq. She became an activist on behalf of women and girls after escaping and finding refuge in Germany and shared the Nobel Peace Prize in 2018.Also Read | Covid-19 crisis widens gap between Russia’s richest and poorest regionsMurad spoke virtually at a UN meeting Monday titled “Locked Down and Locked-In: Standing Against Sexual Violence and Human Trafficking during the Covid-19 Pandemic.” It was organized by Nadia’s Initiative, the nonprofit organization she founded in 2018 that advocates for survivors of sexual violence and aims to rebuild communities in crisis, along with UN Women and the UN Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC).Murad, a UNODC goodwill ambassador for trafficking survivors, noted that Monday was International Women Human Rights Defenders Day, and expressed hope that the spotlight would “amplify the urgent need to combat gender-based violence and human trafficking.”Phumzile Mlambo-Ngcuka, the head of UN Women, said 72% of trafficking victims detected globally are women and girls -- and 77% of identified female survivors were trafficked for sexual exploitation.The Covid-19 pandemic will push 47 million more women and girls into extreme poverty, she said, “but business is booming for the traffickers.”“During pandemic lockdowns, two-thirds of anti-trafficking workers reported seeing an increase in online recruitment by traffickers for the purpose of sexual exploitation online,” Mlambo-Ngcuka said.She said the pandemic has reduced access to health care and compromised the capacity of governments and the United Nations “to report on violations, provide protection and combat impunity.”Mlambo-Ngcuka called for urgent and coordinated global action and cited one promising response -- 146 countries answered UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres’ call for measures to prevent violence against women and girls and promote “peace in the home” as part of their plans to tackle Covid-19.Actress and activist Ashley Judd, a UN Population Fund goodwill ambassador, criticized “the toxic masculinity” taught to men and boys who attack and sexually exploit women.“I am looking forward to the day when we have no sexual and gender-based violence, especially under Covid, from which to be resilient,” she said in a virtual speech.Germany’s Foreign Office Minister of State Michelle Müntefering said the coronavirus makes fighting for gender equality even more important.“We will not allow sexual and gender-based violence and human trafficking to slip into the shadow,” she said, pledging support to Murad and others “who fight for just and equitable societies every day.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nobel-laureate-says-pandemic-raising-violence-trafficking/story-2pZdONF3wMBvjK6nGvo0uM.html

The situation is concerning,” he said, in the first comments his government has made on the issue.“Canada will always be there to defend the right to peaceful protest. We believe in the importance of dialogue and that’s why we’ve reached out through multiple means directly to the Indian authorities to highlight our concerns,” he added.Trudeau said it was understandable that there were members of the Sikh community in Canada who were concerned about their friends and family in India, which was a “reality” for many of them. He made these remarks during the event that also featured all three Sikh ministers in his Cabinet, diversity, inclusion and youth minister Bardish Chagger; innovation, science and industry minister Navdeep Bains; and defence minister Harjit Sajjan.Trudeau’s comments followed statements made in Canada’s House of Commons by MPs who criticised “violence” in India against the protesting farmers, who are mainly from Punjab. Among those that spoke in this context were Liberal MP Ruby Sahota and Conservative MP Tim Uppal.This came after the leader of the opposition New Democratic Party Jagmeet Singh had remarked that the “violence perpetrated” by the Indian government against “peacefully protesting” farmers as “appalling”. He said that he stood in “solidarity” with the farmers and called upon the Indian government to “engage in peaceful dialogue” with them.Indian officials have not formally reacted to the statements coming out of Canada, and from the country’s prime minister. However, the Twitter handle for the Indian High Commission in Ottawa posted a set of infographics, saying, “Busting some myths around the farm bills.

01-12-2020||World||Thousands flee as activity in Indonesian volcanoes increases||Indonesian authorities are closely monitoring several volcanoes after sensors picked up increased activity in recent weeks, prompting the evacuation of thousands of people.Hot ash tumbled as far as 3,000 meters (9,800 feet) down the slopes of Mount Semeru early Tuesday, triggering panic among villagers, said Raditya Jati, the National Disaster Mitigation Agency spokesman. Falling ash and sulfur blanketed several villages around its slopes.The 3,676-meter (12,060-feet) mountain in Lumajang district is the highest volcano on Indonesia’s most densely island of Java.Jati said authorities are still trying to evacuate about 550 people living on the mountain’s slopes. There were no reports of injuries or serious damage, he said.Indonesia’s Volcanology and Geological Hazard Mitigation Center did not raise Semeru’s alert status, which already was at the third-highest level since it began erupting in May. Villagers and tourists are advised to stay 4 kilometers (2.4 miles) from the crater, the agency said.Tuesday’s eruption came two days after Mount Ili Lewotolok shot out columns of hot clouds as high as 4,000 meters (13,100 feet) into the sky. More than 4,600 people were evacuated from the slopes of the mountain, located on Lembata island in East Nusa Tenggara province.The volcanology agency raised Ili Lewotolok’s alert to the second-highest level on Sunday after sensors picked up increased activity. The 1,423-meter (4,660-foot) mountain has been rumbling since October 2017.The Transportation Ministry said a flight warning was issued after the eruption and a local airport was closed as ash rained down on many areas of the island.In another part of Java island, authorities have evacuated more than 1,800 people living on the volatile Mount Merapi volcano’s fertile slopes since early November following an increase in volcanic activity.Local administrations in Central Java and Yogyakarta provinces are closely monitoring the mountain after the geological agency raised Merapi’s alert to the second-highest level and people were advised to stay 5 kilometers (3 miles) from the crater.The 2,968-meter (9,737-foot) mountain is about 30 kilometers (18 miles) from Yogyakarta city center. About a quarter million people live within a 10-kilometer (6-mile) radius of the volcano.Merapi spewed ash and hot gas as high as 6 kilometers (3.7 miles) into the sky in June, but no casualties were reported. Its last major eruption in 2010 killed 347 people and caused the evacuation of 20,000 villagers.Authorities in North Sumatra province are also closely monitoring Mount Sinabung after sensors picked up increasing activity since August. Villagers were advised to stay 5 kilometers (3 miles) from the crater and be aware of the peril of lava.Mirzam Abdurrahman, a volcanologist from the Bandung Institute of Technology, said volcanic activity can increase relatively simultaneously in the different mountains with the same triggers, because the volcanoes are in the same Sunda Arc which covers the islands of Sumatra, Java, Bali, West Nusa Tenggara and East Nusa Tenggara.The mountains are among more than 120 active volcanoes in Indonesia, which is prone to seismic upheaval due to its location on the Pacific “Ring of Fire,” an arc of volcanoes and fault lines around the Pacific Ocean.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/thousands-flee-as-activity-in-indonesian-volcanoes-increases/story-ht9WnuM4iLq6DMJ5ptMJeN.html
01-12-2020||World||New Zealand joins Australia in denouncing China’s tweet||New Zealand has joined Australia in denouncing a graphic tweet posted by a Chinese official that shows a fake image of a grinning Australian soldier holding a bloodied knife to a child’s throat.Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said Tuesday that New Zealand has voiced its concerns directly with Chinese authorities.“This is an image that wasn’t factual. It wasn’t correct. And so in keeping with our principled position where images like that are used, we will raise those concerns and we’ll do it directly,” Ardern told reporters.China has not backed down from the tweet and said there will be no apology.Ardern’s criticism was more muted than Australia’s. She faced an awkward choice of how far to get involved in a conflict between New Zealand’s closest ally, Australia, and its biggest trading partner, China.Also Read |  ‘Need to know origin of novel coronavirus, let’s not politicize probe’: WHO chief TedrosAustralian Prime Minister Scott Morrison on Monday called the image “repugnant” and demanded an apology from the Chinese government. The post took aim at alleged abuses by Australian soldiers during the conflict in Afghanistan.The incident is further souring already tense relations between Australia and China.The image, which appeared to show the soldier slitting the child’s throat, was posted by Zhao Lijian, a spokesman for China’s foreign ministry. He wrote a caption with his tweet: “Shocked by murder of Afghan civilians & prisoners by Australian soldiers. We strongly condemn such acts, & call for holding them accountable.” He was referring to a disturbing report by Australia’s military earlier this month which found evidence that elite Australian troops unlawfully killed 39 Afghan prisoners, farmers and civilians during the Afghanistan conflict. The report recommended that 19 soldiers be referred to federal police for criminal investigation.Asked about the issue at a daily briefing, foreign ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying cast blame on the Australian side.“What Australia should do is to reflect deeply, bring the perpetrators to justice, make a formal apology to the Afghan people, and solemnly promise to the international community that they will never commit such terrible crimes again,” Hua said.Morrison said Zhao’s tweet was “utterly outrageous” and a terrible slur against Australia’s military.It “is truly repugnant. It is deeply offensive to every Australian, every Australian who has served in that uniform,” he told reporters in Canberra. “The Chinese government should be totally ashamed of this post. It diminishes them in the world’s eyes.” Morrison said his government contacted Twitter asking it to take the post down. The post had a warning tag on it on Tuesday but could still be viewed. Zhao’s account comes with a Twitter label stating that it’s a Chinese government account.Despite China blocking Twitter and other US social media platforms within the county, Chinese diplomats and state media have established a strong presence on them.Zhao was criticised by the US in March after tweeting a conspiracy theory that US soldiers may have brought the coronavirus to China. He is considered a leading representative of China’s high-pitched new strain of assertive foreign relations.Morrison acknowledged there were tensions between China and Australia.“But this is not how you deal with them,” he said. “Australia has patiently sought to address the tensions that exist in our relationship in a mature way, in a responsible way, by seeking engagement at both leader and ministerial level.” The rift between the two nations has grown since the Australian government called for an independent inquiry into the origins of the coronavirus pandemic. China has since imposed tariffs and other restrictions on a number of Australian exports.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-zealand-joins-australia-in-denouncing-china-s-tweet/story-gQKZcIqasNunpEmc3fkaPN.html

That’s more than twice the record $17 billion that donors have provided for the international humanitarian response so far this year — and a target figure that is almost certain to go unmet.“The picture we’re painting this year is the bleakest and darkest perspective on humanitarian needs we’ve ever set out, and that’s because the pandemic has reaped carnage across the most fragile and vulnerable countries on the planet,” said UN humanitarian chief Mark Lowcock, who heads OCHA.“For the first time since the 1990s, extreme poverty is going to increase, life expectancy will fall, the annual death toll from HIV, tuberculosis and malaria is set to double,” he said. “We fear a near doubling in the number of people facing starvation.”Lowcock told a UN briefing in New York on the overview that he thinks the UN appeal will probably raise a record $20 billion by the end of the year -- $2 billion more than last year. But he said the gap between needs and funding is growing and the UN is looking to “new players” coming on the scene in 2021, including US President-elect Joe Biden’s new administration.The UN aims to reach about two-thirds of those in need, with the Red Cross and other humanitarian organizations trying to meet the rest, Lowcock explained.UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said humanitarian aid budgets are now facing dire shortfalls as the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic continues to worsen, and said extreme poverty has risen for the first time in more than a generation.“The lives of people in every nation and corner of the world have been upended by the impact of the pandemic,” he said. “Those already living on a knife’s edge are being hit disproportionately hard by rising food prices, falling incomes, interrupted vaccination programs, and school closures.”The overview, which is billed as one of the most comprehensive looks of the world’s humanitarian needs, has put together nearly three dozen individual response plans for a total of 56 “vulnerable” countries.Lowcock said the biggest problem is in Yemen where there is danger of “a large-scale famine” now, saying a prime reason is lack of funding from Gulf countries that were major donors in the past which has led to cuts in aid and the closing of clinics.He said the biggest financial request is for the Syrian crisis and its spillover to neighbouring countries where millions of Syrians have fled to escape the more than nine-year conflict.OCHA said other countries in need include Afghanistan, Congo, Haiti, Nigeria, South Sudan, Ukraine, and Venezuela. Newcomers to this year’s list are Mozambique, where extremist activity has increased in the north, Pakistan and Zimbabwe.Lowcock said it’s not the pandemic, but its economic impact that’s having the greatest effect on humanitarian needs.“These all hit the poorest people in the poorest countries hardest of all,” he said. “For the poorest, the hangover from the pandemic will be long and hard.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/un-warns-the-coronavirus-pandemic-will-fan-darkest-surge-in-humanitarian-needs-in-2021/story-ckG4YBQVOUssIYT1QZDI5J.html

The latest to keep the buzz alive is a mysterious structure’s existence and retreat.This structure - a monolith - was detected in the US desert of Utah weeks ago. But now, in an interesting turn of events, the structure has disappeared from Utah and a similar monolith has surfaced in Romania. The monolith’s mystery has made the brains of conspiracy theorists run amok. Speculations that celestial creatures are behind this phenomenon is all over the internet.The Daily mail reported that the 13 ft-metallic pillar in a triangular shape was found close to an archaic landmark Petrodava Dacian Fortress in Romania’s Piatra Neamt.The newly discovered monolith in the heritage part of Romania has a mirrored surface and appears to be adorned graffiti as well. So the #Monolith first appeared in #Utah and then disappeared yesterday. Then seemingly instantly appeared on the other side of the globe in less than 24 hours in #Romania ?!?!? pic.twitter.com/MrgG3La5vEThe ‘first’ monolith that was discovered in the remote desert went viral due to its sparkling resemblance to the work of the artist John McCracken that made its cameo in the ‘2001: A Space Odyssey’.On the disappearance of the quirky geological structure, the US Bureau of Land management in a statement said that the monolith was removed by an “unknown party”.The monolith’s appearance has also baffled Romania’s authorities. “It is on private property, but we still don’t know who the monolith’s owner is yet. It is in a protected area on an archaeological site. Before installing something there, they needed permission from our institution, one that must then be approved by the Ministry of Culture,” Neamt Culture and Heritage official Rocsana Josanu told The Daily Mail.Such bizarre mysteries have been generating a lot of comments on Twitter and other social media platforms.“No one else thinks that it is noteworthy that on the same night that Darth Vader died, the recently-discovered mysterious 12 foot tall metallic monolith, that had been anchored 3 feet deep into a base of solid bedrock in the remote Utah desert disappears?” one user tweeted.Others were disheartened by the disappearance of the monolith from Utah. “Well this made me absolutely cry. Can we not have nice things?!? Must 2020 take away even the small glints of joy?!? tweeted another user.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/monolith-appears-in-romania-after-a-suspenseful-disappearance-of-the-structure-from-utah/story-MWmzYYZziaPpIDNQxhSHZO.html

The country’s actual numbers are believed to be much higher partly because of low testing levels.“The number of increasing cases and deaths in Mexico is very worrisome,” he said in a press briefing.Mexican President Andrés López Obrador has been criticized for often not wearing a mask and while not mentioning names or specific cases, the WHO chief urged the country’s leaders to take the pandemic seriously.“We would like to ask Mexico to be very serious,” he said. “We have said it in general, wearing a mask is important, hygiene is important and physical distancing is important and we expect leaders to be examples ...”The Mexican government’s pointman on the pandemic, Hugo López-Gatell, said all the comments are valuable but noted the government had already warned that with the arrival of winter the situation would worsen.

01-12-2020||World||Canada PM Trudeau expresses concern at farmers’ protest; India says remarks ‘unwarranted’||Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said on Tuesday that Ottawa has conveyed its concerns about the protest by Indian farmers to New Delhi, but the external affairs ministry dismissed his remarks as “unwarranted” as they pertained to the country’s internal affairs. Trudeau made the remarks while participating in a Facebook video interaction organised by Canadian MP Bardish Chagger to mark Guruparb or the 551st birth anniversary of Guru Nanak, the founder of the Sikh religion. The event was joined by Canadian ministers Navdeep Bains and Harjit Sajjan and members of the Sikh community. In his opening remarks during the interaction, Trudeau said: “I would be remiss if I didn’t start also by recognising the news coming out of India about the protest by farmers. The situation is concerning and we’re all very worried about family and friends. “I know that’s a reality for many of you. Let me remind you, Canada will always be there to defend the right of peaceful protest. We believe in the importance of dialogue and that’s why we’ve reached out through multiple means directly to the Indian authorities to highlight our concerns.” Hours later, external affairs ministry spokesperson Anurag Srivastava said in a brief statement: “We have seen some ill-informed comments by Canadian leaders relating to farmers in India. Such comments are unwarranted, especially when pertaining to the internal affairs of a democratic country.” Also read | Farmers’ protest: All you need to knowSrivastava added, “It is also best that diplomatic conversations are not misrepresented for political purposes.” People familiar with developments said on condition of anonymity that Trudeau’s comments appeared to be aimed at Canada’s influential Indian-origin diaspora. Trudeau also referred to the Covid-19 pandemic and said this “is a moment for all of us to pull together”. He added, “We’re going to be there to continue to work together as we are there to help each other out.” He also said it was important to remember Guru Nanak’s teachings of compassion, equality and selfless service, which are at the heart of both Sikhism and Canadian values. Trudeau is probably the first world leader to comment on the protest by Indian farmers, which entered its fifth day on Monday. The protest is aimed at against a set of laws to liberalise farm trade and open up agricultural markets. The Union government has offered talks to the protestors camping at New Delhi’s borders, but they have insisted on the repeal of the laws. The comments weren’t seen favourably in New Delhi, especially at a time when both India and Canada have been taking steps to restore normalcy to bilateral ties that were hit by Trudeau’s perceived softness on pro-Khalistan activists in Canada during his first term.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/farmers-protest-canada-pm-trudeau-expresses-concern/story-TIi2M7BnDN9NCqlhUddV1K.html
01-12-2020||World||Rahm Emanuel could be Biden’s pick for transportation secretary||President-elect Joe Biden is considering former Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel, a substantial and somewhat divisive figure in Democratic Party politics, to serve as his transportation secretary. Here is everything you need to know about Biden’s possible pick: Who is Rahm Emanuel?Emanuel, a former three-term congressman who served as Barack Obama’s first White House chief of staff and was a senior adviser in Bill Clinton’s administration, has been a significant force in Democratic Party politics for much of the last three decades. He also turned reviving Chicago’s ragged public transportation system and overhauling the city’s two busy, worn airports into a top issue during his eight years as mayor. Why is Emanuel considered as a controversial pick?Emanuel announced in September 2018 that he would not run for a third term as Chicago mayor, citing a desire to step away from the hectic life of elected office. The decision came as he saw his popularity erode in the city’s large African American community following the McDonald police shooting. The death of McDonald, who was shot 16 times, became a touchstone moment in the ongoing national conversation about racial injustice. He faced rebuke from some Black leaders in the city who accused him and his administration of covering up the shooting. Emanuel denied the coverup allegations but did not run for office again. What has the Democrat party said about Emanuel’s candidacy?His candidacy threatens to pull at the divisions among Democrats that Biden has largely managed to avoid as he begins to fill out his administration. Progressive leaders, including Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, have been especially vocal in criticizing the prospect of Emanuel joining the Cabinet because of the controversies that have surrounded him. “What is so hard to understand about this? Rahm Emanuel helped cover up the murder of Laquan McDonald. Covering up a murder is disqualifying for public leadership,” Ocasio-Cortez tweeted last week. “This is not about the ‘visibility’ of a post. It is shameful and concerning that he is even being considered.” What is so hard to understand about this?Rahm Emanuel helped cover up the murder of Laquan McDonald.

Australia’s Bureau of Meteorology (BoM) expects temperatures to break records in the coming days due to the heat wave, which has been building across much of the country’s outback interior over the last week.“While bursts of heat and heat wave are normal for this time of year, what’s making this burst of heat exceptional is temperatures up to 18 degrees (Celsius) above average,” BoM Meteorologist Dean Narramore said.People flocked to beaches and pools to cool off after a slight reprieve from the heat when temperatures stayed in the mid-20s on Monday. “It’s been a long time since anyone had to deal with that sort of heat and when it comes and it hits you like that, not fun for anyone,” Louis Chris, cooling off in Bronte Baths near Sydney’s iconic Bondi beach, told Reuters.The heat wave, which is now slowly moving to the northeast, has also elevated the risks of fires.More than 30 fire crews are trying to contain a massive blaze at world heritage listed site Fraser Island off the coast of Queensland. The fires have razed nearly half of the popular tourist island’s land area, authorities said. Total fire bans have been enforced across the east amid the first major heat wave of Australia’s fire season, which usually runs from late southern hemisphere spring through summer.Last summer’s bush fires - which Prime Minister described as Australia’s “black summer” - killed 33 people and billions of native animals but the risk this year is from grasslands, which are expected to dry soon and spark fires.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/heat-wave-returns-to-australia-on-first-day-of-summer/story-dFeKitKPXmI0NpwmDhMTuJ.html

On the other hand, trial data from Pfizer Inc with partner BioNTech SE, Moderna Inc and AstraZeneca Plc have shown their experimental vaccines are effective in preventing coronavirus. India’s Serum Institute (SII) will also apply for emergency license of Covid-19 vaccine in the next two weeks. As countries race towards finding a vaccine for the coronavirus disease, here’s a look at where things stand in Asia in terms of supply deals and clinical trials: IndiaThe head of the Serum Institute of India, which makes the AstraZeneca vaccine, said on November 23 the positive late-state trial result of the candidate will allow it to seek emergency use approval by year-end, before securing the OK for a full rollout by February or March. India is also conducting a late-stage trial of Russia’s Sputnik V.ChinaChina has not announced supply deals with Western drugmakers, which instead have partnered with private companies. AstraZeneca’s vaccine may be approved in China by mid-2021 and its Chinese partner Shenzhen Kangtai Biological Products plans annual production capacity of at least 100 million doses by end-2020. For the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, a unit of Shanghai Fosun Pharmaceutical Group plans a Phase II trial. Tibet Rhodiola Pharmaceutical Holding is bringing in Russian vaccine candidate Sputnik V and plans early and mid-stage trials in China. China has also approved three vaccine candidates developed by Sinovac and state-owned Sinopharm for emergency use, and Sinopharm hopes its two candidates will get conditional approval for general use this year.Click here for complete coverage of Coronavirus pandemicBangladeshBangladesh signed a deal with India’s Serum Institute to buy 30 million doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine. It also expects to receive 68 million doses from GAVI at a subsidised rate, a senior health ministry official said. JapanJapan has deals to buy 120 million doses from Pfizer/BioNTech in the first half of next year and 120 million from AstraZeneca, the first 30 million of which will be shipped by March 2021, and 250 million from Novavax. It is also in talks with Johnson & Johnson and has a deal with Shionogi & Co. Experts said vaccine makers would need to conduct at least Phase I and II trials in Japan before seeking approval.South KoreaSouth Korea aims to secure vaccines for 10 million people from COVAX and for 20 million more from separate deals with drugmakers by year-end. It has an “optional purchase” arrangement with COVAX to select vaccines from specific makers. The timing of procurement and the amount depend on the output schedule of those vaccines, say health officials. Inoculation is likely to start in the second quarter of next year to allow time to observe possible side effects.TaiwanTaiwan aims to secure around 15 million doses initially, both via the COVAX scheme and by directly purchase from manufacturers, and may buy an additional 15 million doses. The government has said it hopes to begin vaccinations in the first quarter next year.MalaysiaIt agreed to buy 12.8 million doses of Pfizer vaccine, becoming the first country in Southeast Asia to announce a deal with the U.S. drugmaker after some expressed reservations over the need for ultra-cold storage. Pfizer will deliver the first batch of 1 million doses in the first quarter of next year.The PhilippinesIt announced a deal on November 27 for 2.6 million doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine and is discussing a possible 1 million more, covering about 1% of a population of 108 million. It is also seeking 20 million to 50 million doses from Sinovac and is in talks with others, including Pfizer. Vaccine makers can seek approval from Philippine regulators even if no clinical trial is done there.IndonesiaGrouped among 92 low- and middle-income economies, it is entitled to access vaccines through COVAX for a fifth of its population, or about 106 million to 107 million doses, if each person gets two injections. Indonesia is testing Sinovac vaccine and preparing mass vaccination for medical staff and other frontline workers to start as soon as late January.VietnamA government official COVAX vaccines would cover only 20% of the population and the country is likely to have a chance to secure separate deals soon, as demand is very high.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/coronavirus-crisis/when-and-which-covid-19-vaccines-are-likely-to-be-available-in-asia/story-3oDD8LDUDQUKzjzslH7ZWJ.html

The protests on Saturday drew huge crowds -- as many as 300,000 by some estimates -- and though largely peaceful at the start, violence broke out in pockets later on in the day, with groups of individuals dressed in black attacking police and reports of officers beating protesters.The mood on the streets of France has soured since a video was posted on social media last week showing three police officers beating Black music producer Michel Zecler during an arrest at the entrance of his Paris studio on Nov. 21 while a fourth throws a tear-gas canister through the window.The footage contradicted the officers’ account of the events, French media reported, and opponents of Macron’s plan say that it would allow such brutality to go unchecked and infringe on civil liberties.Also Read |  Uproar in France over proposed limits on filming policeIn an interview with the Journal du Dimanche published Sunday, Veaux said he and all his colleagues were shocked by the images, while warning that increasing numbers of officers are themselves victims of violence. Three officers were charged late on Sunday, with two of them placed in custody while the investigation continues into the alleged assault of the music producer.Government U-TurnOn Monday, the French government announced that it will rewrite Article 24 of the “global security law” that would have made it a crime punishable by a year in prison and a 45,000-euro ($54,000) fine to publish the face or any other identifying feature of a police officer with intent to cause them “physical or psychological harm.”In announcing the rewriting of article, Christophe Castaner, head of Macron’s ruling party in the parliament, said the provision will be entirely redrafted, while insisting that the aim remains to better protect the police and to defend freedom of the press both for professional journalists and for citizens posting images on social media.“France should be the country of no violence or any infringement of any freedom whatsoever,” he said.Macron has been trying to position himself as the law and order candidate in a country where campaigning for presidential elections in two years time has already begun.In the immediate aftermath of the Oct. 16 beheading of a teacher by an Islamist militant he saw a bounce the polls, but enthusiasm for his tough stance was short lived and Macron is now under fire on multiple fronts as he tries to respond to the resurgence of jihadism and contain the spread of the coronavirus.Also Read | 4 French cops held after black music producer beaten, abusedMacron had sought to douse the anger over the video on Friday, asking his government to come up with proposals to restore the public confidence in the police. He said the beating of Zecler “shames us,” and condemned violence both against and by the police, but he and Darmanin have repeatedly denied systemic racism with the security forces.Officers who use force in a disproportionate way “must be punished and have no place in the police,” Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin told lawmakers at the National Assembly on Monday evening.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/macron-s-u-turn-leaves-french-police-chief-to-take-heat-over-abuse/story-mxkXXiQYaTm6rjWh8QTy8I.html

The threat of digital services taxes has prompted threats of trade retaliation from outgoing US President Donald Trump’s administration.The new tax would come into effect on Jan. 1, 2022, and remain in place until a common approach is agreed upon. The measure would raise federal revenues by C$3.4 billion ($2.6 billion) over five years, starting in the 2021-22 fiscal year.Also Read | Coronavirus: Canada extends travel restrictions for those entering the country“Canadians want a tax system that is fair, where everyone pays their fair share,” Finance Minister Chrystia Freeland told legislators in the fall economic update.“Canada will act unilaterally, if necessary, to apply a tax on large multinational digital corporations, so they pay their fair share just like any other company operating in Canada.”Foreign-based vendors with no physical presence in Canada will also have to start collecting sales taxes on products such as mobile apps, online video gaming and streaming. The measure should raise C$1.2 billion over five years.Ottawa also plans to oblige people renting out short-term accommodation to charge sales taxes, saying popular digital rental platforms do not currently have to impose the taxes. That puts hotels at a disadvantage, it added.The government is also clamping down on the award of stock options to prevent “high-income individuals employed at large, long-established, mature firms” from taking unfair advantage. From now on, a C$200,000 annual limit will apply to stock option grants for those people. Ottawa did not provide a definition of high-income individuals or mature firms.The rules will not apply to startups or emerging companies, which often cannot afford to pay competitive salaries and instead offer stock options. The new rules will generate about C$200 million in federal revenues, the Finance Department said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canada-plans-digital-tax-in-2022-on-global-tech-giants-such-as-facebook-google/story-Ch3imnZPPAad9g8nMg6hoM.html

He was sentenced for the charges of wire fraud conspiracy and general conspiracy to commit identification fraud, access device fraud, money laundering, and impersonation of a federal officer or employee. Patel was also ordered to pay restitution of USD 8,970,396 to identified victims of his crimes.“The defendant defrauded vulnerable US victims out of tens of millions of dollars by spearheading a conspiracy whose members boldly impersonated federal government officials and preyed on victims’ fears of adverse government action,” said Acting Attorney General Brian C. Rabbitt of the Justice Department’s Criminal Division. For years, Patel preyed on the fears of his victims to perpetuate a global scheme to manipulate US institutions and taxpayers, said Special Agent in Charge Mark B Dawson of US Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) Houston.According to admissions in his plea agreement, Patel and his co-conspirators perpetrated a complex scheme in which employees from call centers in Ahmedabad impersonated officials from the IRS and U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), and engaged in other telephone call scams designed to defraud victims throughout the country. US victims were threatened with arrest, imprisonment, fines or deportation if they did not pay alleged monies owed to the government. Those who fell victim were instructed how to provide payment, including by purchasing general purpose reloadable (GPR) cards or wiring money. Upon payment, the call centers would immediately turn to a network of “runners” based in the United States to liquidate and launder the fraudulently obtained funds, federal prosecutors alleged.In his plea, Patel admitted to operating and funding several India-based call centers from which the fraud schemes were perpetrated, including the call center HGLOBAL. Patel corresponded by email and WhatsApp messaging frequently with his co-defendants to exchange credit card numbers, telephone scam scripts, and call center operations instructions. The scripts included IRS impersonation, USCIS impersonation, Canada Revenue Agency impersonation, Australian Tax Office impersonation, payday loan fraud, US Government grant fraud, and debt collection fraud.Patel was prosecuted in the United States after being extradited from Singapore in April 2019 to face charges in this large-scale telefraud and money laundering scheme. Singapore authorities apprehended Patel at the request of the United States pursuant to a provisional arrest warrant in September 2018, after Patel flew there from India.The indictment in this case, which was unsealed in October 2016, charged Patel and 60 other individuals and entities with general conspiracy, wire fraud conspiracy and money laundering conspiracy. A total of 24 domestic defendants associated with this transnational criminal scheme were previously convicted and sentenced to terms of imprisonment of up to 20 years in the Southern District of Texas, District of Arizona and Northern District of Georgia. The defendants were also ordered to pay millions of dollars in victim restitution and money judgments and to forfeit seized assets. Some defendants were ordered to be deported based on their illegal immigration status, with another defendant having his U.S. citizenship revoked due to a separate conviction for immigration fraud. Charges remain pending for other India-based defendants.

Correspondents Association on Monday that “to beat this pandemic, we also have to defeat the parallel pandemic of distrust.”He said there is “a growing hesitancy about vaccines in general, and about a COVID vaccine in particular” around the world, pointing to a recent Johns Hopkins University study in 67 countries that found vaccine acceptance declined significantly in most countries from July to October this year.In a quarter of countries, Rocca said, the study found that the acceptance rate for a vaccine against the coronavirus was near or below 50 percent, with Japan dropping from 70 percent to 50 percent acceptance, and France dropping from 51 percent to 38 percent acceptance.He stressed that the lack of trust “is by no means a Western phenomenon,” citing the federation’s research in recent months in eight African countries -- Congo, Cameroon, Gabon, Zimbabwe, Sierra Leone, Rwanda, Lesotho and Kenya -- which showed a steady decline in the perceptions of the risk of COVID-19 infection.A growing number of people indicated the virus doesn’t affect young people or Africans, that the disease doesn’t exist now but did exist and the pandemic has ended, he said. “In several African countries, we have seen a common skepticism towards vaccines in general, with a common belief being that foreigners use Africa as a medical ‘testing ground.’”Surprisingly, Rocca said, some typically vulnerable and marginalized groups aren’t even aware of the pandemic, pointing to a federation survey in Pakistan which found 10 percent of respondents didn’t know about COVID-19.“We believe that the massive, coordinated efforts that will be needed to roll out the COVID vaccine in an equitable manner need to be paralleled by equally massive efforts to proactively build and maintain trust,” Rocca said.This will require the same kind of sustained community engagement that recently defeated Ebola in Congo, he said.The federation operates in 192 countries with almost 14 million volunteers and painstaking community outreach and engagement are at the heart of its COVID-19 response, Rocca said.So far, Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, with federation support, have reached 243 million people with COVID-19 activities including tracking community perceptions, responding to questions and suggestions, “and providing accurate and timely information in local languages through diverse channels,” he said.Rocca said he has watched with concern in recent weeks “as the imminent arrival of a possible vaccine has, at least in some countries, washed away the commitments that were made over the summer to ensure an equitable distribution of vaccines between and within countries.”He said “politicizing the vaccines is a huge mistake” and strongly backed the international initiative to distribute COVID-19 vaccines to countries worldwide known as COVAX as “the correct approach both for rich countries and the rest of the world.”“If a few wealthy nations insist on a `vaccine nationalism’ approach, then many other countries — maybe even most other countries — will not be able to access them, both because of exclusive deals between wealthy countries and pharmaceutical companies and the inevitable lag in manufacturing enough doses,” he said..”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/fake-news-on-covid-19-vaccines-a-second-pandemic-says-red-cross-chief/story-evVn5BwypGVaMnLwiZ5aTL.html
01-12-2020||World||Donald Trump’s science adviser Scott Atlas leaving White House job||Dr. Scott Atlas, a science adviser to President Donald Trump who was skeptical of measures to control the coronavirus outbreak, is leaving his White House post.A White House official confirmed that the Stanford University neuroradiologist, who had no formal experience in public health or infectious diseases, resigned at the end of his temporary government assignment. Atlas confirmed the news in a Monday evening tweet.Atlas joined the White House this summer, where he clashed with top government scientists, including Dr. Anthony Fauci and Dr. Deborah Birx, as he resisted stronger efforts to contain the COVID-19 pandemic that has killed more than 267,000 Americans.Atlas has broken with government experts and the overwhelming consensus of the scientific community to criticize efforts to encourage face covering to slow the spread of the virus. Just weeks ago on Twitter he responded to Michigan’s latest virus restrictions by encouraging people to “rise up” against the state’s policies.His views also prompted Stanford to issue a statement distancing itself from the faculty member, saying Atlas “has expressed views that are inconsistent with the university’s approach in response to the pandemic.”“We support using masks, social distancing, and conducting surveillance and diagnostic testing,” the university said Nov. 16. “We also believe in the importance of strictly following the guidance of local and state health authorities.”Atlas defended his role in his resignation letter, saying, “I cannot think of a time where safeguarding science and the scientific debate is more urgent.”Atlas was hired as a “special government employee,” which limited his service to government to 130 days in a calendar year — a deadline he reached this week.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-s-science-adviser-scott-atlas-leaving-white-house-job/story-IqAHjpKH5r5wDQSPFCT7BM.html

01-12-2020||World||California at Covid ‘tipping point’ as Trump admin hopes for vaccines by Christmas||California’s governor said on Monday the state was at a “tipping point” in the Covid-19 pandemic that would soon overwhelm hospitals as political leaders nationwide turn to increasingly aggressive measures to hold back the latest surge.Governor Gavin Newsom said he may clamp new “stay-at-home” orders on California’s roughly 40 million residents in the face of infections and hospitalizations that are still rising weeks before emergency vaccines are predicted for release.“(California) has worked hard to prepare for a surge - but we can’t sustain the record high cases we’re seeing,” Newsom said on Twitter. “Current projections show CA will run out of current ICU beds before Christmas Eve.The governor told reporters discussions were underway among state health officials over the potential stay-at-home order. He expects to issue a decision in the next day or two.Last week he ordered a daily curfew barring social gatherings and other non-essential activities across most of the state between 10 p.m. and 5 a.m. daily.Newsom, who has largely banned indoor dining in the state, has apologized after photos surfaced of the first-term Democrat eating dinner with 11 other people, including a prominent lobbyist, at a French restaurant near Napa. None wore masks.Also Read: Americans face new coronavirus restrictions after ThanksgivingMore than 4.2 million new Covid-19 infections and 36,000 Covid-19 related deaths were reported across the United States in November, according to a Reuters tally. Hospitalizations are at a pandemic high and deaths the most in six months.Nearly 93,000 Americans are currently hospitalized with Covid-19, up 11% from last week and double the number reported a month ago, according to a Reuters analysis of state and county public health reports. Americans who have endured eight months of restrictions, lockdown and business closures in the face of the pandemic are pinning their hopes on vaccines developed by drug companies Pfizer Inc and Moderna that are awaiting US government approval for emergency use.VACCINES BY CHRISTMAS?US Health Secretary Alex Azar said Pfizer’s medication could be authorized and shipped within days of a Dec. 10 meeting of outside advisers to the Food and Drug Administration.Moderna’s vaccine could follow a week later, Azar said, after the company announced on Monday it would apply for emergency authorization both in the US and Europe.“So we could be seeing both of these vaccines out and getting into people’s arms before Christmas,” Azar said on CBS’ “This Morning.”Health officials in many states say that even after the vaccines are approved the rollout to Americans nationwide could be slowed by shortages of personal protective equipment and other factors.The non-partisan Government Accountability Office reported on Monday that some diagnostic test kits and accompanying reagents, as well as PPE are hard to come by “due to a supply chain with limited domestic production and high global demand.”In Los Angeles, health officials on Friday banned all public and private gatherings for at least three weeks and urged residents to stay home as much as possible.In New York, Governor Andrew Cuomo on Monday ordered all elective surgeries to cease in one county and told hospitals statewide to plan on increasing their capacity by 50% if necessary or set up and staff field hospitals. “Hospital capacity is the top concern,” Cuomo said. New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy said that as of Saturday he was re-tightening the limit on most outdoor gatherings to 25 people.Murphy, who has brought back a series of Covid-19 restrictions in recent weeks, also said all indoor youth and adult sports will be put on hold from Dec. 5 through Jan. 2, 2021, also with exemptions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/california-at-covid-tipping-point-as-trump-admin-hopes-for-vaccines-by-christmas/story-W3cXGxPrqmdqybgwyUfe3M.html

There is no possibility that humans will contract bird flu from eating poultry or eggs, the ministry said.Japan’s worst outbreak since at least 2016 started last month in Kagawa prefecture on Shikoku island, which is adjacent to Kyushu island.The 40,000 chickens at the Miyazaki farm will be slaughtered and buried, while exports in a 3 km (1.8 mile) radius around the farm will be restricted.The new action means more than 1.8 million chickens will have been culled since the latest outbreak began.Japan’s last outbreak of bird flu was in January 2018, also in Kagawa prefecture, when 91,000 chickens were culled.The last big outbreak was between November 2016 and March 2017, when a total of 1.67 million chickens were culled due to the H5N6 strain of bird flu.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/japan-bird-flu-outbreak-spreads-to-farm-in-fourth-prefecture/story-U2Gc61fDzKJMxTIeeKURGO.html

01-12-2020||World||Moderna files for US vaccine authorization, will seek EU nod||Moderna Inc said on Monday it has applied for US emergency authorization for its Covid-19 vaccine after full results from a late-stage study showed it was 94.1% effective with no serious safety concerns.The US Food and Drug Administration said an advisory committee would meet to discuss the request on Dec. 17, making Moderna’s candidate the second highly effective vaccine likely to receive US regulatory backing and a potential roll out this year.A shot developed by Pfizer Inc and BioNTech SE that was 95% effective in its pivotal trial is set to be reviewed by a panel of outside experts a week earlier. The FDA will decide on the emergency use authorizations (EUA)after the advisers make their recommendations. Also Read: Dictionary.com picks ‘pandemic’ as its 2020 word of the yearModerna, which also plans to seek European approval, reported that its vaccine’s efficacy was consistent across age, race, ethnicity and gender demographics as well as having 100% success in preventing severe cases of the disease that has killed nearly 1.5 million people worldwide.“We believe that we have a vaccine that is very highly efficacious. We now have the data to prove it,” Moderna Chief Medical Officer Tal Zaks said. “We expect to be playing a major part in turning around this pandemic.”Of the 196 people who contracted Covid-19 out of over 30,000 trial volunteers, 185 had received a placebo and 11 the vaccine. Moderna reported 30 severe cases, all in the placebo group. Moderna shares rose 3% in extended trading after closing up 20%. They have gained about 700% this year.“As the numbers of cases reported grows, confidence grows that this amazing protection will be maintained in a product that can be rolled out to protect the public,” said Alexander Edwards, associate professor in biomedical technology at Britain’s University of Reading.In addition to filing its US application, Moderna said it would seek conditional approval from the European Medicines Agency and continue to talk with other regulators doing similar rolling reviews.“Although we await the full details of these results in published form, we can now assume that this vaccine will be approved for use in December,” said Gillies O’Bryan-Tear, chair of policy and communications at Britain’s Faculty of Pharmaceutical Medicine.He expected Britain’s Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency to approve the vaccine within two weeks.‘JUST OVERWHELMING’Moderna said it was on track to have about 20 million doses of its vaccine ready to ship in the United States by the end of 2020, enough to inoculate 10 million people.Switzerland’s Lonza Group , which has a contract with Moderna to supply ingredients for the vaccine, rose 4.4%.The vaccines developed by Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech use a new technology called synthetic messenger RNA (mRNA) whereas others, such as AstraZeneca’s , employ more traditional methods.AstraZeneca has announced an average efficacy rate of 70% for its vaccine, and as much as 90% for a subgroup of trial participants who got a half dose, followed by a full dose. Some scientists have expressed doubts about the robustness of the 90% efficacy figure for the smaller group. Also Read: PM Modi to chair all-party meet to take stock of Covid-19 pandemicModerna’s final efficacy result was slightly lower than an interim analysis released on Nov. 16 of 94.5% effectiveness, a difference Zaks said was not statistically significant.“At this level of effectiveness, when you just do the math of what it means for the pandemic that’s raging around us, it’s just overwhelming,” said Zaks, who said he cried when he saw the final results over the weekend.Both the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines proved more effective than anticipated and far superior to the 50% approvable benchmark set by FDA.The past few weeks of positive vaccine results have ignited hopes for an end to a pandemic that has battered economies and come as new infections and Covid-19 hospitalizations are at record levels across the United States. Almost immediately after receiving an EUA, Moderna expects its vaccine to be shipped to distribution points across the United States by the government’s Operation Warp Speed program and drug distributor McKesson Corp.Distribution is expected to be less complicated than for Pfizer’s vaccine. While it needs to be stored in a freezer, it does not require the ultra-cold temperature or specialized equipment needed for Pfizer’s vaccine.CONSISTENT ACROSS AGE AND ETHNICITYModerna said the 196 Covid-19 cases in its trial included 33 adults over 65 years old and 42 volunteers from racially diverse groups, including 29 Latinos, 6 Blacks, 4 Asian Americans and 3 multiracial participants. There was one death related to Covid-19 in the placebo group during the trial.“This is as black and white as an effect on a population will be. Your chances of actually being sick if you’ve been vaccinated are decreased 20-fold,” said Moderna’s Zaks.Moderna reported no new side effects since its interim analysis, the most common of which were fatigue, injection site redness and pain, headache and body aches, which rose after the second dose and were short-lived.Zaks said the vaccine caused significant flu-like symptoms in some participants which, “goes hand-in-hand with having such a potent vaccine.” But it has not caused any significant safety concerns so far, he said.Moderna plans to start a new trial to test the vaccine in adolescents before the end of the year, followed by another in even younger volunteers early in 2021. It hopes to have the vaccine available for adolescents by September, Zaks said.Other vaccine makers have said they are studying their vaccines in younger people as well..||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/moderna-files-for-us-vaccine-authorization-will-seek-eu-nod/story-TwMtgMMWSitZtGZLdxOY0J.html
01-12-2020||World||Taliban-Afghan government agreement marred by document’s wording||A breakthrough on an initial agreement reached between Taliban and government negotiators has been held up at the last minute after the insurgent group balked at the document’s preamble because it mentioned the Afghan government by name.Teams representing the Taliban and the Afghan government have been negotiating in the Qatari capital since September to reach a consensus on the modalities of peace talks, moving forward to help end decades of war in Afghanistan.“The negotiating teams have so far agreed on all 21 articles that provide guiding principles for the negotiations,” Afghan President Ashraf Ghani’s spokesman Sediq Sediqqi said in a statement on Monday. “At this time, they continue to debate the preamble, in which some issues need further clarification”. Government and diplomatic sources told Reuters that when it came to signing the document in November, which was to include references to the “Islamic Republic of Afghanistan” - the official name of the Afghan government, - the Taliban backed off.The Taliban refuse to refer to the Afghan negotiating team as representatives of the Afghan government, as they contest the legitimacy of Ghani’s election. “(The government and Taliban) prepared to sign the agreement,” a diplomat in Kabul familiar with process told Reuters, adding that the chief Afghan government negotiator was to sign the agreement as “chief negotiator for the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan”. “The Taliban refused to accept that,” the diplomat said. The Taliban did not immediately respond to request for comment on the specific incident but had earlier told Reuters that their stance was to negotiate with Afghans broadly and would not recognise them as negotiators representing the government.“We are ready to take the talks forward with the current team as Afghans; we don’t know them as a government team,” Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid told Reuters on Monday. Mujahid said the Taliban’s stance, from day one, was that they did not recognise the government.Another diplomatic source said there had been ongoing discord over the term “republic” and the Taliban’s reference to itself as an “Islamic Emirate,” which underscored the differences between the warring sides.“The differences over the words “republic” and “emirate” triggered a deep suspicion between the negotiators,” he said. “The problem is complex as it leads to (implications over) the vision and aspiration of a country and how it wants to projected and perceived.”The Afghan government side took the Taliban’s reservations to Ghani who said he will not agree to such a demand, according to two well-placed government sources.One source said the Taliban’s insistence was based on its desire to have Ghani’s elected government replaced with a caretaker administration once the peace process begins. “The Taliban from day one have tried to delegitimise the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan, and are pushing a vague title of “Intra-Afghan” (talks) to undermine the legitimacy of the government,” the source said.The U.S.-Taliban agreement, signed in February, does not mention the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan by name either and envisages the formation of a “new post-settlement Afghan Islamic government as determined by the intra-Afghan dialogue and negotiations”.It also refers to the peace talks as “Intra-Afghan” talks. One Afghan government source said the Afghan delegation will not walk away from talks, but feared the consequences of the new standoff would be “bitter for both sides,” including a further escalation of violence on the ground in Afghanistan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taliban-afghan-government-agreement-marred-by-document-s-wording/story-DSPG3ZFmGupRSuc6iUCSoJ.html
01-12-2020||World||Americans face new coronavirus restrictions after Thanksgiving||Americans returning from Thanksgiving break faced strict new coronavirus measures around the country Monday as health officials brace for a disastrous worsening of the nationwide surge because of holiday gatherings over the long weekend.Los Angeles County imposed a stay-at-home order for its 10 million residents, and Santa Clara County, in the heart of Silicon Valley, banned high school, college and professional sports and decreed a quarantine for those who have traveled more than 150 miles outside the county.In Hawaii, the mayor of Hawaii County said trans-Pacific travelers arriving without a negative Covid-19 test must quarantine for 14 days, and even those who have tested virus-free may be randomly selected for another test upon arrival. New Jersey is suspending all youth sports.“The red flags are flying in terms of the trajectory in our projections of growth,” said Gov. Gavin Newsom. “If these trends continue, we’re going to have to take much more dramatic, arguably drastic, action.”Health experts had pleaded with Americans to stay home over Thanksgiving and not gather with anyone who didn’t live with them. Nevertheless, almost 1.2 million people passed through US airports Sunday, the most since the pandemic gripped the country in March, and others took to the highways to be with family and friends.Now they’re being urged to watch for any signs of illness and get tested right away if they experience symptoms.Some families are already seeing the fallout from Thanksgiving gatherings.Jonathan Eshnaur lugged his 32-inch TV to a Thanksgiving Day family gathering at his sister’s home in Olathe, Kansas, so he could watch football outside. He wore a mask and only went into her house for the prayer and to use the bathroom.One day later, his father began feeling terrible and tested positive. His mother now is showing symptoms, and the six others at the gathering are concerned that they caught it, too.“I think we all have a tendency to think it won’t happen to me,” said Eshnaur, a 34-year-old special education teacher. “But that is kind of the issue with these kinds of viruses is it does happen, especially when we have widespread community spread that is going on.”Priya Patel, 24, is isolating at her parents’ home in San Antonio after visiting friends over the weekend and coming down with a sore throat.Patel, who works in public health in New York City, said she had been careful, wearing masks in public and staying out of restaurants and bars. But she spent time at a friend’s home in Texas over Thanksgiving.“I’m an extremely extroverted person, and there is just so much time I can spend with my parents at home,” said Patel, who will stay away from her parents, both of whom have preexisting medical conditions, and wear a mask inside their home for the next 14 days.Health officials are urging people to remain vigilant until a vaccine becomes widely available, which is not expected to happen for at least a few months.On Monday, Moderna Inc. said it will ask US and European regulators to allow emergency use of its Covid-19 vaccine as new study results confirm the shots offer strong protection. Pfizer is also seeking approval for its vaccine and hopes to begin administering shots in the US in December.The virus is blamed for over 267,000 deaths and more than 13.4 million confirmed infections in the US The country on average is seeing more than 160,000 new cases per day and over 1,400 deaths — a toll on par with what the nation witnessed in mid-May, when New York City was the epicenter.A record 90,000 people were in the hospital with the virus in the US as of Sunday, pushing many medical institutions to the limit.West Virginia Gov. Jim Justice said hospitals across the state will reduce elective surgeries to ensure there is room for coronavirus patients. The number of people hospitalized with Covid-19 jumped 29% in the past week. In Kansas City, Kansas, hospital and nursing officials said they fear there will not be enough nurses to staff new hospital beds in the metro area if Covid-19 cases continue unchecked. Health officials on Monday added 4,425 confirmed infections and 87 hospitalizations to the state’s pandemic tally since Friday.Rhode Island’s hospitals reached their Covid-19 capacity on Monday, the same day the state’s two-week pause took effect. Under restrictions announced by Gov. Gina Raimondo, some businesses will be required to shut down, while others are restricted. Residents are also asked to limit their social circles to people in their household.“This will not be easy, but I am pleading with you to take it seriously,” Raimondo said in a statement.In suburban St. Louis, a hospital official warned that hospitalizations could double in two to three weeks if people don’t quarantine after Thanksgiving gatherings. SSM Health DePaul Hospital in Bridgeton, Missouri, last week brought in a morgue trailer to store the dead, canceled elective surgeries and doubled up patients in rooms.“We will be absolutely overwhelmed,” said Shelly Cordum, vice president of patient care services and chief nursing officer. “I can’t even imagine what we are going to be facing in three weeks if we stay on this path.”Dr. Anthony Fauci, the government’s foremost infectious-disease expert, warned on ABC over the weekend that the country could see a “surge upon surge” of infections tied to Thanksgiving. And White House cornonavirus task force coordinator Dr. Deborah Birx told CBS that people who traveled should “assume that you were exposed and you became infected,” and get tested if they experience symptoms.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/americans-face-new-coronavirus-restrictions-after-thanksgiving/story-8MTYBV68RTiKnuRHkHwPgO.html
01-12-2020||World||Did pollution kill Brit girl? Inquest to find out||The mother of a nine-year-old girl who died from acute respiratory failure after repeated asthma attacks on Monday said she hoped a coroner’s inquest would conclude that air pollution played a role in her death.Ella Adoo-Kissi-Debrah died in February 2013 after nearly three years of repeated attacks, which saw her being taken to hospital 30 times.But a specialist in 2018 noticed a “striking link” between levels of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and harmful particulate matter at the times she was admitted for treatment.A ruling that air pollution was a factor in her death would be a legal first in Britain.“I hope, and I’m keeping my fingers crossed that the coroner, after hearing all the evidence, will come to the conclusion that air pollution either caused or contributed to her death, and that’s all I’m asking for,” Ella’s mother Rosamund said.“I will finally have the reason why she passed away on her birth certificate,” she told AFP.“All children have a right to breathe cleaner air and I’ll keep on saying that because children shouldn’t die from asthma.”The first coroner’s inquest in 2014 determined that Ella died of acute respiratory failure brought on by severe asthma. But the ruling was set aside after the specialist’s report.The second hearing, which is due to last 10 days from Monday, will examine the levels of pollution the young girl was exposed to.The family lived less than 30 metres (100 feet) from the South Circular, a busy and regularly congested arterial road, in Lewisham, southeast London.Coroner’s inquests are held in England and Wales in the event of a sudden or unexplained death. They establish the causes and circumstances of deaths on the balance of probability.They do not determine criminal or civil liability, guilt or blame, but set out facts in the public interest.The lawyer representing the family, Jocelyn Cockburn, said reaching the second inquest was a “significant achievement”.“Rosamund’s account of Ella’s struggle is very powerful and illustrates the human suffering behind the statistics,” she said.Since her eldest daughter’s death, Rosamund Addo-Kissi-Debrah has campaigned for improvements to air quality and awareness of asthma, particularly in children.She said the pollution near the family home was “definitely not visible”, but the government needed to clean up the air, given the number of people who live near busy roads.“There are thousands of children all over the UK with asthma and every time there’s a spike in air pollution, some of them will end up in hospital,” she said.According to figures from the Mayor of London, World Health Organization (WHO) recommended limits for air pollution are broken in 99% of the British capital.The WHO says air pollution kills some seven million people across the globe every year and nine out of 10 people breathe air that exceeds guideline limits on pollutants.Low- and middle-income countries are worst affected and the problem contributes to premature deaths.Last month, the executive director of the Clean Air Fund, Jane Burston, said children in London were “4.2 per cent more likely to be hospitalised for asthma on days with high NO2 pollution”.Also in October, Mayor of London Sadiq Khan released figures showing improvements in air quality due to changes made since his election in 2016. These measures have included the introduction of an “ultra low emission zone” which requires drivers of the most polluting vehicles to pay a daily tax when entering central London.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/did-pollution-kill-brit-girl-inquest-to-find-out/story-GdA48uhZrak5EBcY5HvVZL.html
01-12-2020||World||Shipping Covid vaccines: Global airlines face ‘mission of century’||In cooled warehouses on the fringes of Frankfurt airport, Deutsche Lufthansa AG is preparing its depleted fleet for the gargantuan task of airlifting millions of doses of the vaccines meant to end the global pandemic.Lufthansa began planning in April in anticipation of the shots that Pfizer to Moderna and AstraZeneca are developing in record time. A 20-member task force is at work devising how to fit more of the crucial payload onto the airline’s 15 Boeing Co 777 and MD-11 freighters, along with hold space in a vast passenger fleet now flying at just 25% of capacity.Laid low by a Covid-19 outbreak that’s decimated passenger demand, airlines will be the workhorses of the attempt to eradicate it, hauling billions of vials to every corner of the globe. It’s an unprecedented task, made more difficult by the carriers’ diminished state after culling jobs, routes and aircraft to survive a crisis that’s reduced air traffic globally by an estimated 61% this year.“This will be the largest and most complex logistical exercise ever,” said Alexandre de Juniac, chief executive officer of the International Air Transport Association, the industry’s chief lobby. “The world is counting on us.” IATA estimates that the equivalent of 8,000 loads in a 110-tonne capacity Boeing 747 freighter will be needed for the airlift, which will take two years to supply some 14 billion doses, or almost two for every man, woman and child on Earth. It’s a tall order, given about one-third of the global passenger fleet is still in storage, based on data from Cirium.Katherine O’Brien, the World Health Organization’s head of immunisation, likens the task of distributing the vaccines after the months-long development sprint to summiting Mount Everest having reached base camp.“The climb to the peak is really about delivering the vaccines,” she said on November 16.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/shipping-covid-vaccines-global-airlines-face-mission-of-century/story-6TuISRDii9R2JxDEpKXyFK.html
01-12-2020||World||Indian-American Neera Tanden named in Joe Biden’s top economic team||US President-elect Joe Biden on Monday named Neera Tanden director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) that oversees the administration’s budget and federal agencies, making her the first Indian-descent American to be appointed to a federal cabinet in a Democratic administration.Biden also named former Fed Chair Janet Yellen as secretary of treasury, making her the first women to hold that position, and Cecilia Rouse, a labor economist from Princeton University economist, as the first African American to chair the Council of Economic Advisers. Tanden is the first woman of color and South Asian to head the OMB. Yellen and Tanden will need to be confirmed by US senate.“As we get to work to control the virus, this is the team that will deliver immediate economic relief for the American people during this economic crisis and help us build our economy back better than ever,” President-elect Biden said in a statement announcing the new appointments.“This team looks like America and brings seriousness of purpose, the highest degree of competency, and unwavering belief in the promise of America. They will be ready on day one to get to work for all Americans.”President-elect Biden, who injured an ankle playing with one of his dogs Sunday, also announced a path-breaking all-female press team for his White House with Jen Psaki as the most visible face of the team as press secretary. She is a veteran from the Obama administration.Biden made history earlier when he chose Kamala Harris his running mate. She is now the first woman, first black and first American of Indian, Asian and South Asian descent elected vice-president.Though the first Indian American in the cabinet of a Democrat president, Tanden will be second overall for the community. Nikki Haley was the first of Indian descent to be named to the federal cabinet as President Donald Trump’s US ambassador to the UN, a cabinet-rank position that was downgraded for her successors.“Big job and a real important first in the Cabinet. She has a great story (single mother, knows what it is to be poor) but went to Harvard and is the most well-versed person in progressive economics I have ever met,” said Shekar Narasimhan, a top fundraiser for Biden and a and close adviser to the campaign and the transition team. “I am (a) huge Neera fan!” Narasimhan, who has known Tanden for a long time, confessed.Tanden studied law at Yale and served as senior adviser for health reform in the US Department of Health and Human Services developing policies and provisions of the Affordable Care Act, President Barack Obama’s signature law that is now called Obamacare. She was born in Massachusetts in 1970 to parents from India, who divorced when she was five. Tanden and her brother were brought up by their mother. Tanden has spoken of her family banking on food coupons to get by.“On the heels of Kamala Harris set to become the next Vice-President, it is great to see another well qualified Indian American woman be nominated for a Cabinet level position,” said MR Rangaswami, founder of Indiaspora, an advocacy group for the community. “It is gratifying to see someone who has dedicated herself to public service be recognized for this important role to manage the budget of the country.”Two more Indian Americans are in the mix of names speculated about for other cabinet positions. Vivek Murthy, a physician and former surgeon general, is a leading contender for secretary of health and human services, a possibility that has been boosted by his appointment by Biden as co-chair of his advisory board on combatting Covid-19, which, the president-elect has said will be his first task after assuming office in January. Others in the race are Michelle Lynn Lujan Grisham, the Hispanic governor of New Mexico, and Jeffery D Zients, director of President Obama’s National Economic Council.The second Indian American among cabinet potentials is Arun Majumdar. He is reported to be in the running for secretary of energy, to head a department whose key mandate includes the upkeep — not deployment or use — of America’s nuclear arsenal; the department traces its origin to the Manhattan Project.Majumdar, an alumnus of IIT Bombay, heads Stanford University’s Precourt Institute for Energy and is up against Ernest Moniz, Obama’s energy secretary who played a leading role in the shaping of the Iran nuclear deal, a signature foreign policy achievement of the Obama-Biden administration that President Trump has sought to wreck by pulling the US out of it. Biden may revive it if, as his aides have indicated, Iran covenants compliance.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/indian-american-neera-tanden-named-in-joe-biden-s-top-economic-team/story-2fQdhy9HDELx75oBFiXzbL.html
