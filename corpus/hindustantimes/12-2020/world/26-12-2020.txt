26-12-2020||World||Europe rolls out Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine in bid to leave Covid-19 pandemic behind||Europe launches a cross-border vaccination programme of unprecedented scale on Sunday as part of efforts to end a Covid-19 pandemic that has crippled economies and claimed more than 1.7 million lives around the world.The region of 450 million people has secured contracts with a range of suppliers for over two billion vaccine doses and has set a goal for all adults to be inoculated during 2021.While Europe has some of the best-resourced healthcare systems in the world, the sheer scale of the effort means that some countries are calling on retired medics to help out while others have loosened rules for who is allowed to give the injections.With surveys pointing to high levels of hesitancy towards the vaccine in countries from France to Poland, leaders of the 27-country European Union are promoting it as the best chance of getting back to something like normal life next year. “We are starting to turn the page on a difficult year,” Ursula von der Leyen, president of the Brussels-based European Commission coordinating the programme, said in a tweet.“Vaccination is the lasting way out of the pandemic.”After European governments were criticised for failing to work together to counter the spread of the virus in early 2020, the goal this time is to ensure that there is equal access to the vaccines across the entire region.But even then, Hungary on Saturday jumped the gun on the official roll-out by starting to administer shots of the vaccine developed by Pfizer and BioNTech to frontline workers at hospitals in the capital Budapest.Countries including France, Germany, Italy, Austria, Portugal and Spain are planning to begin mass vaccinations, starting with health workers on Sunday. Outside the EU, Britain, Switzerland and Serbia have already started in recent weeks.The distribution of the Pfizer-BioNTech shot presents tough challenges. The vaccine uses new mRNA technology and must be stored at ultra-low temperatures of around -80 degrees Celsius (-112°F).France, which received its first shipment of the two-dose vaccine on Saturday, will start administering it in the greater Paris area and in the Burgundy-Franche-Comte region.Germany, meanwhile, said trucks were on their way to deliver the vaccine to care homes for the elderly, which are first in line to receive the vaccine on Sunday.Beyond hospitals and care homes, sports halls and convention centres emptied by lockdown measures will become venues for mass inoculations. In Italy, temporary solar-powered healthcare pavilions will spring up in town squares around the country, designed to look like five-petalled primrose flowers, a symbol of spring.In Spain, doses are being delivered by air to its island territories and the North African enclaves of Ceuta and Melilla. Portugal is establishing separate cold storage units for its Atlantic archipelagos of Azores and Madeira.“A window of hope has now opened, without forgetting that there is a very difficult fight ahead,” Portuguese Health Minister Marta Temido told reporters.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/europe-rolls-out-pfizer-biontech-vaccine-in-bid-to-leave-covid-19-pandemic-behind/story-NYbqqn5RZBDgYitlN8663N.html
26-12-2020||World||Widespread outages continue in Tennessee after Nashville Christmas morning explosion||Sweeping communications outages continued to plague large swaths of Tennessee on Saturday as federal investigators combed the site for clues into the explosion of a recreational vehicle that rocked sleepy downtown Nashville on Christmas.Police emergency systems in Tennessee, Kentucky and Alabama, as well as Nashville’s Covid-19 community hotline and a handful of hospital systems, remained out of service due to an AT&T central office being affected by the blast. The building contained a telephone exchange, with network equipment in it — but the company has declined to say exactly how many people have been impacted.Meanwhile, investigators shutdown the heart of downtown Nashville’s tourist scene - an area packed with honky-tonks, restaurants and shops - as they shuffled through broken glass and damaged buildings to learn more about the explosion. While authorities are certain that this was a deliberate act, they have been mum on saying publicly who did this and why.Mayor John Cooper has enforced a curfew in the downtown area until Sunday via executive order to limit public access to the area.AT&T said restoration efforts are facing several challenges, which include a fire that “reignited overnight and led to the evacuation of the building.” This has forced their teams to work with safety and structural engineers and drilling access holes into the building in order to reconnect power.“Our teams continue to work around the clock on recovery efforts from yesterday morning’s explosion in Nashville,” the company said in a Saturday statement. “We have two portable cell sites operating in downtown Nashville with numerous additional portable sites being deployed in the Nashville area and in the region.”Gov. Bill Lee asked the White House on Saturday for federal assistance due to the “severity and magnitude” of the explosion’s impact. At least 41 buildings were damaged, and communications systems — including residential and cell phone service and 911 call centers — failed across the state, he said. Kentucky and northern Alabama were also affected, he said.Ray Neville, president of technology at T-Mobile, said on Twitter that service disruptions affected Louisville, Nashville, Knoxville, Birmingham and Atlanta. “We’re working diligently w/ our partner on restoration. We apologize for any inconvenience. Updates to follow,” he said in a tweet late Friday.The outages had even briefly grounded flights at the Nashville International Airport, but service was continuing normally as of Saturday.According to Metro Nashville Police Chief John Drake, police officers responded on Friday to a report of shots fired when they encountered the RV blaring a recorded warning that a bomb would detonate in 15 minutes. Police evacuated nearby buildings and called in the bomb squad. The RV exploded shortly afterward.Law enforcement officials have said they believe the blast was intentional but don’t yet know a motive or target.“This morning I toured the site of the bombing,” Gov. Bill Lee tweeted Saturday. “The damage is shocking and it is a miracle that no residents were killed. (First lady Maria) and I continue to pray for those who sustained injuries from the blast.”Lee had been in quarantine due to his wife contracting Covid-19. However, the Republican said that he and Maria had both tested negative, allowing the two to visit downtown Nashville. Lee said the first lady had “fully recovered.”On Friday, Drake told reporters that investigators at the scene “have found tissue that we believe could be remains, but we’ll have that examined and let you know at that time.” No new information regarding the tissue was made available Saturday.Three people taken to area hospitals for treatment were in stable condition Friday evening.The FBI has taken the lead in the investigation, agency spokesman Joel Siskovic said. Federal investigators from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives are also involved in the investigation. The FBI is the primary law enforcement agency responsible for investigating federal crimes, such as explosives violations and acts of terrorism.In West Virginia, a hospital system said Saturday that it was experiencing network connection issues directly related to the Nashville explosion. South Charleston-based Thomas Health, which operates two hospitals, said on its Facebook page that it didn’t have an estimated time of restoration.Similarly, Sumner Regional Medical Center in Gallatin, Tennessee, said on its Facebook page that it was operating without access to some of its systems, including medical records.“We prepare for situations like this and moved immediately to paper records. There has been no disruption to the delivery of patient care, and no cause for concern for this temporary issue,” the center said in a post Friday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/widespread-outages-continue-in-tennessee-after-nashville-christmas-morning-explosion/story-R0cgmk2uctBsTS6Tnk6SvL.html
26-12-2020||World||French investigators to question Carlos Ghosn in Lebanon||A team of French investigators will come to Beirut next month to participate in interrogating former Renault-Nissan boss Carlos Ghosn, a Lebanese justice ministry official said Saturday.The official gave no specific date or details of what information the investigators would seek from Ghosn.Former auto executive Ghosn, who is a Lebanese, Brazilian and French national, fled Japan in a dramatic escape that drew headlines last year, arriving in Lebanon on Dec. 30, 2019.In addition to his trial in Japan, the 66-year-old businessman is facing a number of legal challenges in France, including tax evasion and alleged money laundering, fraud and misuse of company assets while at the helm of the Renault-Nissan alliance.The Lebanese official, speaking on condition of anonymity in line with regulations, said the French investigators would be working alongside their Lebanese counterparts.Information about investigations is secret under French law, and French judicial officials did not respond to requests for comment Saturday on the report.After leading the Japanese automaker Nissan for two decades, Ghosn was arrested in Japan in November 2018 on charges of breach of trust, misusing company assets for personal gains and violating securities laws by not fully disclosing his compensation. He denied wrongdoing and fled Japan while out on bail awaiting trial. He is unlikely to be extradited from Lebanon, where he has been since last year.At least two Ghosn-related investigations were opened in France. One focused on suspicious transactions between Renault and a distributor in Oman, as well as suspected payments for private trips and events paid by Renault-Nissan’s Netherlands-based holding company RNBV.Another investigation focused on suspected misuse of company funds for a party for Ghosn at Versailles.The French inquiry aims to determine who is at fault for a string of alleged financial violations between 2009 and 2020.That includes “suspicious financial flows” between Renault and the SBA car dealership in Oman. This aspect of the inquiry is targeting several million euros of travel and other costs paid by the Netherlands-based Renault-Nissan holding RNBV but suspected to have been for Ghosn’s personal use.Ghosn’s French lawyers have said the payments to SBA were “justified bonuses” for having boosted car sales in the Persian Gulf and denied allegations that the funds benefited Ghosn or his family personally.Renault last year said an internal audit with Nissan found 11 million euros in questionable expenses at RNBV allegedly linked to Ghosn, including for air travel, personal spending and donations to nonprofit organizations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/french-investigators-to-question-carlos-ghosn-in-lebanon/story-WdhK2ZuZedWjCoMeHIU5iK.html
26-12-2020||World||Explainer: How will the EU-UK trade deal change ties?||British and EU negotiators clinched a wide-ranging free trade deal on Christmas Eve, meaning commerce between the trading bloc of 450 million consumers and the sixth-biggest global economy will keep on flowing without tariffs or quotas from Jan. 1.Britain has hailed the agreement as a clean break with the European Union that will allow London to set its own agenda, while the bloc has also welcomed a “good deal” that will let the 27 member states move on.But much will be different once Britain completes its journey out of the EU, its single market and customs union, at the end of this year. There are also areas left unfinished that will require more negotiation.Here are examples of what will change.LEVEL PLAYING FIELDThis issue almost derailed the talks when Britain accused the EU of introducing a new demand that would give the bloc a unilateral right to impose tariffs on Britain if it was deemed to have moved too far away from fair competition rules.The agreement means that now both sides have the right to challenge the other through an arbitration mechanism if any regulatory divergence is deemed to have resulted in a competitiveness issue. It also says that if such mechanisms are used too often and too long, it can trigger a renegotiation of the relevant parts of the treaty.MORE CHECKS AND RED TAPE IN TRADE IN GOODS Unlike so far, goods moving between Britain and the EU will be subject to customs, regulatory and animal safety checks, leading to more red tape requirements. Ireland, the EU country most affected by Brexit, estimated in September that import and export declarations could increase 12-fold to as many as 20 million per year. END TO FREE MOVEMENT OF PEOPLE While the EU and the UK agreed to sidestep visas for short-term stays, the current free movement of people will end. That means EU citizens going to the UK, and vice-versa, will be subject to more extensive border screening. EU citizens’ right to live and work in the UK - as well as British citizens’ ability to do the same in Europe - will diminish. Pet passports will no longer be automatically recognised across the EU-UK border.REDUCED SECURITY INFORMATION SHARINGBritain hailed the deal for ensuring a range of fast and effective security capabilities but there are significant changes to the way Britain and the EU will share security, police and intelligence data. The UK will no longer participate in Europol or Eurojust, and will lose access to the Schengen Information System, though there are ways to share passenger, fingerprints, DNA and vehicle data.A senior member of the UK negotiating team said the “extensive” deal allowed Britain to collaborate with Europol or Eurojust, but those involved would have to get used to a different process.CURBS ON TRANSPORTUK licences for passenger or cargo flights will no longer be sufficient to operate between EU destinations or from the EU onwards. Britain and EU states can, however, run flights between one another, and will cooperate on aviation safety and slots.For road transport, cabotage will be reduced though hauliers carrying loads between the EU and the UK can operate with no limits and there are full transit rights. CHANGES TO FISH QUOTAS, LIMITED ACCESS TO WATERS Full access to one another’s fishing waters ends after a 5-1/2-year transition period from 2021, during which catch quotas will also be gradually moved from the EU to the UK. Both sides have agreed that 25% of EU boats’ fishing rights in British waters will be transferred to the UK fishing fleet, over that period. After that, there will be annual talks to set the amount EU boats can catch in British waters and vice versa.The senior negotiating team member said both sides had had to compromise, but that at the end of the transition, Britain will have full control of its waters and access to them.FINANCIAL SERVICESFrom Jan 1, British-based financial services groups lose automatic access to the EU’s single market. Both sides have said new market access must be negotiated outside the trade agreement in specific equivalence deals.The two sides will also aim to agree by March 2021 a memorandum of understanding on regulatory cooperation in financial services.SEPARATE ARRANGEMENTS FOR ENERGY AND CLIMATEBritain will no longer participate in the EU’s internal energy market or be part of the bloc’s emissions trading scheme. The British government said this month it would establish a domestic emissions trading scheme (UK ETS) from Jan. 1.STATE AIDOn state aid, the two have agreed to create a body to provide independent oversight and to work within six overarching principles. But Alexander Rose, director at legal business DWF, said: “We know we will have a new UK Subsidy Control regime, but at this point ... we don’t know which body will oversee this, what the rules are and whether block exemptions (used for 99% of awards) will remain.” ROAMING CHARGESEU member states have agreed to drop roaming charges for mobile connections and data within their single market, a legal requirement on mobile operators that will no longer apply to Britain from the start of 2021. Should telecom firms introduce such charges, as is the case with Switzerland, citizens crossing between the EU and the UK will have to turn their data roaming off or face higher charges.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/explainer-how-will-the-eu-uk-trade-deal-change-ties/story-um04W59UM635qRP1mNKatI.html
26-12-2020||World||Hungary gives 1st vaccine shots a day before EU’s rollout||Hungarian doctors and health care workers began getting vaccinated Saturday with one of the continent’s first shipments of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine against Covid-19, upsetting plans for a coordinated rollout on Sunday of the first shots across the 27-nation European Union.The first shipments of coronavirus vaccines arrived across the bloc late Friday and early Saturday. It was not immediately clear why Hungarian authorities began their vaccinations a day early. Authorities in Slovakia also announced that they planned to begin administering their first doses on Saturday evening.European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen released a video celebrating the vaccine rollout, calling it “a touching moment of unity.”“Today, we start turning the page on a difficult year. The Covid- 19 vaccine has been delivered to all EU countries. Vaccination will begin tomorrow across the EU,” she said.In Hungary, the first shipment of 9,750 doses — enough to vaccinate 4,875 people, since two doses are needed per person — arrived by truck early Saturday and were taken to the South Pest Central Hospital in Budapest. The government said four other hospitals, two in Budapest and two others in the eastern cities of Debrecen and Nyíregyháza, would also receive vaccines from the initial shipment.The vaccines developed by BioNTech and Pfizer arrived by truck in very cold conditions were delivered warehouses across the continent on Friday and early Saturday after being sent from a manufacturing center in Belgium before Christmas.The rollout marks a moment of hope for a region that includes some of the world’s earliest and worst-hit virus hot spots, including Italy and Spain, and others, like the Czech Republic, that were spared the worst early on only to see their health care systems near their breaking points in the fall.Altogether, the 27 EU member states have seen at least 16 million cases of the coronavirus and more than 336,000 deaths.“It’s here, the good news at Christmas,” German Health Minister Jens Spahn said at a news conference Saturday. “This vaccine is the decisive key to end this pandemic.”“It is the key to getting our lives back,” Spahn said.The rollout is the result of coordination on the part of all 27 member states, helping the bloc to also project a sense of unity in a lifesaving mission of logistical complexity after difficulties in negotiating a post-Brexit trade deal with Britain.The first doses, however, are limited just under 10,000 doses in most countries, with the mass vaccination programs expected to begin only in January.Each country is deciding on its own who will get the first shots — but they are all putting the most vulnerable first.French authorities said they will prioritize the elderly, based on the high impact on older populations in previous virus surges in France. The French medical safety agency will monitor for eventual problems.Germany, where the pandemic has cost more than 30,000 lives, will begin with those over 80 and people who take care of vulnerable groups.Spanish authorities said early Saturday that the first batch of the coronavirus vaccine to reach the country had arrived in the central city of Guadalajara — where the first shots will be administered on Sunday morning at a nursing home.In Italy, which leads Europe in confirmed known deaths, a nurse in Rome at Spallanzani Hospital, the main infectious diseases facility in the capital, should be the first in the country to receive the vaccine, followed by other health personnel.In Poland, the first two people to be vaccinated on Sunday will be a nurse and a doctor at the Interior Ministry hospital in Warsaw, the main coronavirus hospital in the capital, followed by medical personnel in dozens of other hospitals.Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki recently called it the patriotic duty of Poles to get vaccinated — a message directed at a society where there is a high degree of vaccine hesitancy born from a general distrust of authorities.In Bulgaria, where suspicions also run high, the first person to get the shot will be Health Minister Kostadin Angelov, who has promised an aggressive campaign to promote the benefits of the shots.In Croatia, where the first batch of 9,750 vaccines arrived early on Saturday, a care home resident in Zagreb, the capital, will be the first to receive the vaccine on Sunday morning, according to state HRT TV.HRT TV also reported that authorities would launch a pro-vaccination campaign that will include celebrities and other public figures getting the vaccine on camera.“We have been waiting for this for a year now,” Romanian Prime Minister Florin Catu said on Saturday after the first batch of the vaccine arrived at a military-run storage facility there.The vaccinations begin as the first cases of a new variant of the virus that has been spreading in the U.K. have now been detected in France and Spain. The new variant has caused several European countries to restrict traffic with Britain.A French man living in England arrived in France on Dec. 19 and tested positive for the new variant Friday, the French public health agency said in a statement. He has no symptoms and is isolating in his home in the central city of Tours.Meanwhile, health authorities in the Madrid region said they had confirmed the variant in four people, all of whom are in good health. Regional health chief Enrique Ruiz Escudero said that the new strain had arrived when an infected person flew into Madrid’s airport.German pharmaceutical company BioNTech is confident that its coronavirus vaccine works against the new UK variant, but further studies are needed to be completely certain.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hungary-gives-1st-vaccine-shots-a-day-before-eu-s-rollout/story-cQ5ktG9dOSOkVi5l3aoAcO.html

Israeli emergency medical services said several people were treated for shock.The latest fire from the Palestinian enclave came over a month after one rocket was launched from the coastal strip into Israel.Islamist group Hamas, which Israel considers a terrorist organisation, seized control of Gaza from rival Palestinian movement Fatah in 2007 in a near civil war.Since then, Hamas has fought three devastating wars with Israel in the territory, where about two million Palestinians live.Israel has since maintained a crippling blockade on the Gaza Strip to prevent Hamas from arming.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hamas-says-barbaric-israeli-strike-damaged-children-s-hospital/story-sT3qQ3MJqfq3vkRURJcO1K.html
26-12-2020||World||US testing requirement for UK travellers may not be enough to contain Covid-19 variant. Here’s why||Amid concerns over new variants of SARS-CoV-2 causing rapid spread of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) on Friday announced new testing requirements for inbound travellers from the United Kingdom. The US health agency said that the air passengers arriving from the UK would require to show a negative Covid-19 test result obtained within 72 hours before the departure. The testing requirement is aimed at curbing the spread of new Covid-19 variant in the United States, a country already overwhelmed by infections.“Airlines must confirm the negative test result for all passengers before they board. If a passenger chooses not to take a test, the airline must deny boarding to the passenger,” the CDC order reads.Why is the new testing requirement may not be enough?The CDC acknowledged in its order that testing “does not eliminate all risk”, but when combined with other measures like self-monitoring for Covid-19 symptoms, wearing masks, and social distancing, “it can make travel safer.” The researchers on the CDC’s Covid-19 response team reportedly said that testing three days before a flight may reduce the risk of spreading the virus by only 5-9%. According to a CNN report, Dr Paul Offit, an infectious disease specialist at the University of Pennsylvania, said that the new testing requirement “is like putting up a chain link fence to keep out a mosquito.” The latest advisory doesn’t mandate institutional quarantine, a measure announced by several countries for incoming travellers from the UK. In the case of false Covid-19 negative results, the new testing requirement could fail to contain the new variant of the coronavirus, which is believed to have originated in southeast England. Also Read | Oxford Covid-19 vaccine may become the first to get Indian regulator’s nod for emergency useA report by CDC scientists, published in November, suggests that testing on the day of departure can reduce the risk of transmission by 37-61%. It also said that a 14-day quarantine after arrival, without symptom monitoring or testing, can reduce risk by 97-100% on its own. The report is based on mathematical modelling and has not been peer-reviewed.Earlier this week, the top infectious disease expert of the United States, Dr Anthony Fauci, said that it’s “certainly possible” that the new variant of coronavirus has already reached the US. During an interview on ABC’s Good Morning America, Dr Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease, had called travel ban a “dramatic step”, but indicated that there could be a requirement to test travellers before they arrive in the country.“When you have this amount of spread within a place like the UK, that you really need to assume that it’s here already, and certainly is not the dominant strain, but I would not be surprised at all if it is already here,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-testing-requirement-for-uk-travellers-may-not-be-enough-to-contain-covid-19-variant-here-s-why/story-kH5j9aNX6EGrbqyqYSJ2QJ.html
26-12-2020||World||Chinese ships illegally enter Japan’s territorial waters||Two Chinese ships have illegally entered the Japanese territorial waters near the disputed Senkaku Islands on Saturday, according to Japan’s security service.Citing NHK broadcaster, Sputnik reported that the incident occurred at 16:00 pm (07:00 GMT), with the Japanese Coast Guard Service urging violators to leave the country’s territorial waters.This is despite Japanese Defence Minister Nobuo Kishi last week conveying to his Beijing counterpart Wei Fenghe about Tokyo’s strong concerns over Beijing’s regular attempts to “unilaterally change the status quo by coercion”.In October, two Chinese vessels stayed in the disputed waters for about 50 hours, marking the longest intrusion into the waters in eight years.This year, Japan has registered 24 cases of Chinese ships’ violation of its sea border, Sputnik said.China has been increasing its maritime activities in both the South China Sea and the East ChinaSea over the past few months, partly in response to Beijing’s concerns over the increasing US military presence in the region because of escalating Sino-US tensions.The Japanese government maintains the islands are an inherent part of Japan’s territory, in terms of history and international law. It says there is no issue of sovereignty to be resolved over them.Beijing’s rising assertiveness against counter claimants in the East and South Sea has resulted in unprecedented agreement across the Indo-Pacific.

26-12-2020||World||Police search for clues to mysterious RV blast in Nashville||Police and federal agents in Nashville sought clues on Saturday to determine how and why a motor home was blown to pieces in an apparent bombing on Christmas Day that injured three people and damaged dozens of buildings in the heart of America’s country music capital.The motor home, parked on a downtown street of Tennessee’s largest city, exploded at dawn on Friday moments after police responding to reports of gunfire in the area noticed the recreational vehicle and heard an automated message emanating from it warning of a bomb.The means of detonation and whether anyone was inside the RV when it blew up were not immediately known, but investigators were examining what they believed might be human remains found in the vicinity of the blast, police said.Police offered no possible motive, and there was no claim of responsibility, though Nashville Metropolitan Police Department officials called the blast an “intentional act” and vowed to determine its origin.Agents of the FBI and the US Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives were assisting in the probe.Adding to the cryptic nature of the incident was the eerie preamble described by witnesses - a crackle of gunfire followed an apparently computer-generated female voice from the RV reciting a minute-by-minute countdown to an impending bombing.Police scrambled to evacuate nearby homes and buildings and called for a bomb squad, which was still en route to the scene when the RV blew up just outside an AT&T building where it had been parked.Police later posted a photo of the motor home, which they said had arrived in the area about four hours prior to the explosion.The fiery blast, heard for miles away, destroyed a number of other vehicles parked nearby, shattered windows and heavily damaged several adjacent buildings. Mayor John Cooper said a total of 41 businesses were damaged.Fire officials said three people were taken to hospitals with relatively minor injuries and were listed in stable condition. Authorities said quick action by police to clear the area of bystanders likely prevented more casualties.Damage to AT&T facilities from the blast caused widespread disruptions of telephone, internet and fiber optic TV service in central Tennessee and parts of several neighboring states, including Mississippi, Kentucky, Alabama and Georgia, the company said. Police Chief John Drake said authorities had received no threats of an attack prior to the reports of gunfire at the outset of the incident.The explosion occurred about two blocks from Lower Broadway, where some of Nashville’s famous live music venues are located. The Ryman Auditorium, former home of the Grand Ole Opry and just three blocks from the blast scene, was undamaged. The Gaylord Opryland and current Grand Ole Opry complexes, which sit outside the downtown area, were not impacted. “It’s a startling thing to have it happen in Nashville so close, and on Christmas, but we understand that America is in very tumultuous times right now,” country singer John Rich, who owns a honky-tonk club a block from the explosion, told Reuters.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/police-search-for-clues-to-mysterious-rv-blast-in-nashville/story-jFyNggVZNmh9PmuME8VdAJ.html
26-12-2020||World||Archaeologists uncover ancient street food shop in Pompeii||Archaeologists in Pompeii, the city buried in a volcanic eruption in 79 AD, have made the extraordinary find of a frescoed hot food and drinks shop that served up the ancient equivalent of street food to Roman passersby.Known as a termopolium, Latin for hot drinks counter, the shop was discovered in the archaeological park’s Regio V site, which is not yet open the public, and unveiled on Saturday.Traces of nearly 2,000-year-old food were found in some of the deep terra cotta jars containing hot food which the shop keeper lowered into a counter with circular holes. The front of the counter was decorated with brightly coloured frescoes, some depicting animals that were part of the ingredients in the food sold, such as a chicken and two ducks hanging upside down.“This is an extraordinary find. It’s the first time we are excavating an entire termopolium,” said Massimo Ossana, director of the Pompeii archaeological park.Archaeologists also found a decorated bronze drinking bowl known as a patera, ceramic jars used for cooking stews and soups, wine flasks, and amphora.Pompeii, 23 km (14 miles) southeast of Naples, was home to about 13,000 people when it was buried under ash, pumice pebbles and dust as it endured the force of an eruption equivalent to many atomic bombs.“Our preliminary analyses shows that the figures drawn on the front of the counter, represent, at least in part, the food and drink that were sold there,” said Valeria Amoretti, a site anthropologist.Amoretti said traces of pork, fish, snails, and beef had been found in the containers, a discovery she called a “testimony to the great variety of animal products used to prepare dishes”.About two-thirds of the 66-hectare (165-acre) ancient town has been uncovered. The ruins were not discovered until the 16th century and organised excavations began about 1750.A rare documentation of Greco-Roman life, Pompeii is one of Italy’s most popular attractions and a UNESCO World Heritage Site.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/archaeologists-uncover-ancient-street-food-shop-in-pompeii/story-t20hFNHe3hHUDTWkiYm8NK.html

The new variant has also been detected in a man who visited the UK and a family member - the first cases of infected people found outside airport checks - Nippon TV reported on Saturday.The new strain adds to worries about a surge in cases as Tokyo reported another record rise on Saturday.Infections of the virus that causes Covid-19 hit a record 949 in the capital just as Japan heads into New Year holidays that normally see people stream from the capital into the provinces.Serious cases were unchanged from a day earlier at 81.Tokyo transport hubs were subdued, local media said, a day after Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga, under pressure as cases continue to climb, urged the nation to stay home and avoid social mixing.With New Year celebrations centered around family gatherings and mass visits to temples and shrines, experts have warned public restraint will be essential to prevent infection rates from rising further amid concerns of pandemic fatigue.Suga’s initial political honeymoon after taking his post in September has ended, with his popularity sliding after criticism he was slow to react to rising infections in Tokyo and for attending a group steak dinner in defiance of his own calls for caution||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/japan-bans-new-entries-of-foreigners-after-new-coronavirus-variant-arrives/story-7jha5gEpnBfA8WSkuLSgeO.html
26-12-2020||World||Ahead of holidays, China ramps up measures to control new Covid-19 cases||Beijing residents were on Saturday asked to wear face masks before going out of their houses and advised not to travel out of the capital as the city has reported new Covid-19 cases while the Chinese port city of Dalian went into a war-time mode to deal with the new cases.Health officials are ramping up measures ahead of the upcoming Spring Festival and Chinese New Year holidays following the emergence of new cases, official media reports said.China has controlled the pandemic after it emerged in Wuhan in December last year but new cases continued.The Chinese mainland on Friday reported 20 newly confirmed Covid-19 cases, including eight locally transmitted ones and 12 arriving from outside China, the National Health Commission (NHC) said on Saturday.Six of the locally transmitted cases were reported in northeast China’s Liaoning province, while two were reported in Beijing, the commission said in its daily report.Meanwhile, an official of Beijing’s health authority has advised the residents to stay in the city before they get Nucleic Acid Test (NAT) results and not to travel outside Beijing or China if not necessary.Pang Xinghuo, deputy director of the Beijing Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, said that residents should wear masks while going out and practice social distancing.In May this year, Beijing health officials said that there is no need to wear masks as the virus has been brought under control.Pang also asked residents to disinfect surfaces of packages from areas under risk and wash hands when handling frozen food.State-run Global Times on Saturday quoted Beijing local government asking companies not to arrange business trips outside of the capital and abroad, and advising residents not to leave the city during the Spring Festival holidays in addition to schools and companies staggering their holidays.Chen Bei, deputy secretary-general of the Beijing municipal government, said in order to reduce the clustering of people, Beijing will strictly review applications for holding major events, and not organise big gatherings such as sports events or temple fairs.Cinemas, libraries, museums and entertainment venues have to operate at 75 per cent capacity, Chen said.On reducing risks during travel, the capital urged operators of airlines, railways and expressways to strictly implement temperature checking and disinfection, the Global Times report said.Meanwhile, the port city of Dalian has ordered all of its local medical institutions to enter into a wartime mode on Sunday, after the city reported a new confirmed Covid-19 case on Saturday, the report said.About 8.13 lakh people in the city have conducted the nucleic acid tests so far, it said.China has so far reported 86,933 Covid-19 cases since early this year. This includes 328 patients who are still receiving treatment.A total of 81,971 people has been discharged in the mainland while 4,634 have died of the virus, the NHC report added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/ahead-of-holidays-china-ramps-up-measures-to-control-new-covid-19-cases/story-k01qpgxbbBSoLjIly8vuTM.html
26-12-2020||World||‘Window of hope’: Europe prepares to launch Covid-19 vaccinations||Hungary stole a march on its fellow EU nations as it began vaccinating its people against Covid-19 on Saturday, a day ahead of rollouts in several other countries including France, Germany and Spain as the pandemic surges across the continent.Mass vaccination across the European Union, home to almost 450 million people, would be a crucial step towards ending a pandemic that has killed more than 1.7 million around the world, crippled economies and destroyed businesses and jobs.Hungary administered the vaccine, developed by Pfizer and BioNTech, to frontline workers at hospitals in1the capital Budapest after receiving its first shipment of enough doses to inoculate 4,875 people. The first worker to receive the shot was Adrienne Kertesz, a doctor at Del-Pest Central Hospital.Hungary has reported 315,362 Covid-19 cases with 8,951 deaths. More than 6,000 people are still in hospital with Covid-19, straining the central European country’s care system.“We are very happy that the vaccine is here,” Zsuzsa and Antal Takacs, a couple aged 68 and 75, said while playing table tennis in a Budapest park. “We will get the vaccination because our daughter had a baby in France last month and we want to go see them. We do not dare travel before we get the vaccine,” Zsuzsa said. The Hungarian rollout came a day before countries including France, Germany, Italy, Austria, Portugal and Spain are planning to begin mass vaccinations, starting with health workers. The distribution of the Pfizer-BioNTech shot, which was first rolled out in Britain earlier this month, presents tough challenges. The vaccine uses new mRNA genetic technology, which means it must be stored at ultra-low temperatures of around -80 degrees Celsius (-112°F).NEW VARIANT IN FRANCE, SPAINFrance, which received its first shipment of the two-dose Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine on Saturday, will start administering it on Sunday in the greater Paris area and in the Burgundy-Franche-Comte region.“We have 19,500 doses in total, which amounts to 3,900 vials. These doses will be stored in our freezer at minus 80 degrees (Celsius) and will be then distributed to different nursing homes and hospitals,” said Franck Huet, head of pharmaceutical products for the Paris public hospital system.The French government is hoping to get around one million people vaccinated in nursing homes during January and February, and then a further 14-15 million in the wider population between March and June.The Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine was approved by the French medical regulator on Thursday.France reported more than 20,000 new Covid-19 infections on Friday for the second day running, something not seen since Nov. 20. The seven-day moving average of daily new cases, which evens out reporting irregularities, is at a one-month high of 14,969.France’s number of confirmed Covid-19 cases now totals 2,547,771, the fifth-highest tally in the world, while its Covid-19 death toll stands at 62,427, the seventh-highest.In a concerning development, the health ministry said on Friday that a man who recently arrived from London had tested positive for a new variant of the virus that has been spreading rapidly in southern England and is thought to be more infectious.In Spain, Madrid health authorities said on Saturday they had confirmed four cases of the new variant of the virus, as the country received its first deliveries of the vaccine. The boxes arrived by truck at a storage facility near Madrid as dawn broke. Employees at Spain’s medicines agency unpacked the vaccine, which is stored in dry ice, with gloved hands.“Vaccination will start tomorrow in Spain, coordinated with the rest of Europe,” Health Minister Salvador Illa wrote on Twitter. “This is the beginning of the end of the pandemic.”Doses will be taken by air to the Spanish islands and the North African enclaves of Ceuta and Melilla, and by road to other regions of the country, where a total of about 50,000 people have died from the disease.‘WINDOW OF HOPE HAS OPENED’Germany, meanwhile, said trucks were on their way to deliver the vaccine to care homes for the elderly, which are first in line to receive the vaccine on Sunday.The number of confirmed Covid-19 cases in the country rose by 14,455 to 1,627,103, data from the Robert Koch Institute for infectious diseases showed on Saturday. More than 29,000 people have died, in total.The federal government is planning to distribute more than 1.3 million vaccine doses to local health authorities by the end of this year and about 700,000 per week from January. “There may be a few hiccups at one point or another in the beginning, but that is quite normal when such a logistically complex process begins,” said Health Minister Jensen Spahn. In Portugal, a truck escorted by police dropped off the first batch of Covid-19 jabs at a warehouse in the country’s central region. From there, the nearly 10,000 shots will be delivered to five big hospitals. “It is a historic milestone for all of us, an important day after such a difficult year,” Health Minister Marta Temido told reporters outside the warehouse. “A window of hope has now opened, without forgetting that there is a very difficult fight ahead.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/window-of-hope-europe-prepares-to-launch-covid-19-vaccinations/story-mOaEqEcAB247QOAHLP50aP.html

26-12-2020||World||Man accused of killing US journalist to walk free: All you need to know about Daniel Pearl case||A Pakistani court on Thursday ordered to release four men accused of kidnapping and murder of American journalist Daniel Pearl, triggering a strong reaction from the United States. The key accused in the case, UK-born al-Qaeda leader Ahmed Omar Saeed Sheikh and his three aides, are set to walk out of the prison on Saturday, PTI reported.The US State Department’s Bureau of South and Central Asian Affairs raised deep concerns over the Pakistani court’s ruling to “release multiple terrorists responsible for the murder of Daniel Pearl”. Soon after the verdict, the US State Department said the government has been assured that the accused have not been released “at this time”, adding that they will be closely following the case.“We are deeply concerned by the reports of the December 24 ruling of Sindh High Court to release multiple terrorists responsible for the murder of Daniel Pearl. We have been assured that the accused have not been released at this time,” tweeted the Bureau of South and Central Asian Affairs. (1/3)We are deeply concerned by the reports of the December 24 ruling of Sindh High Court to release multiple terrorists responsible for the murder of Daniel Pearl. We have been assured that the accused have not been released at this time.Here’s all you need to about the Daniel Pearl murder case:1. Daniel Pearl, an American journalist who worked as the South Asia bureau chief of The Wall Street Journal, was abducted in Karachi in January 2002 while working on a story about terror groups linked to al Qaeda. About a month later, a graphic video of Pearl’s beheading was sent to the US consulate in Karachi, sparking global outrage.2. Owing to international pressure, Sheikh and three of his aides were arrested, and, later, convicted by an anti-terrorism court in Pearl’s kidnapping and murder case. Sheikh was sentenced to death and his aides were sentenced for life in prison. In April 2020, the Sindh High Court of Karachi overturned the murder conviction and found Sheikh only guilty of kidnapping the WSJ journalist.Also Read | Men charged in Daniel Pearl’s murder case to be released on Saturday, says lawyer3. The court commuted Sheikh’s death sentence to seven years of imprisonment, while acquitted the three others - Fahad Nasim Ahmed, Syed Salman Saqib and Sheikh Adil. The Pakistan Peoples Party-led provincial government of Sindh then challenged the ruling in the Supreme Court and refused to release the four accused. The government kept them in detention under the Maintenance of Public Order for three months and extended it further under the Anti-Terrorism Act, 1997.4. However, a division bench of the Sindh High Court expressed displeasure over the government’s decision to keep the men behind bars, declaring the detention illegal. The court ordered the government to immediately release them and asked authorities to place their names on the Exit Control List (ECL), Pakistan’s no-fly list, since the country’s top court is hearing appeals of the Sindh government and Pearl’s family against the high court’s ruling.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/man-accused-of-killing-us-journalist-to-walk-free-all-you-need-to-know-about-daniel-pearl-case/story-gRXh0val7QtEWkOOgpFhCL.html
26-12-2020||World||George Blake, last in line of Cold War spies who betrayed Britain, dies at 98||George Blake, who died in Russia on Saturday at the age of 98, was the last in a line of British spies whose secret work for the Soviet Union humiliated the intelligence establishment when it was discovered at the height of the Cold War.Britain says he exposed the identities of hundreds of Western agents across Eastern Europe in the 1950s, some of whom were executed as a result of his treason. His case was among the most notorious of the Cold War, alongside those of a separate ring of British double agents known as the Cambridge Five.Unmasked as a Soviet spy in 1961, Blake was sentenced to 42 years in London’s Wormwood Scrubs prison. In a classic cloak-and-dagger story, he escaped in 1966 with the help of other inmates and two peace activists, and was smuggled out of Britain in a camper van. He made it through Western Europe undiscovered and crossed the Iron Curtain into East Berlin.He spent the rest of his life in the Soviet Union and then Russia, where he was feted as a hero.Reflecting on his life in an interview with Reuters in Moscow in 1991, Blake said he had believed the world was on the eve of Communism. “It was an ideal which, if it could have been achieved, would have been well worth it,” he said. “I thought it could be, and I did what I could to help it, to build such a society. It has not proved possible. But I think it is a noble idea and I think humanity will return to it.”Becoming a committed communistBlake was born in Rotterdam in the Netherlands on November 11, 1922, to a Dutch mother and an Egyptian Jewish father who was a naturalised Briton.He escaped from the Netherlands in World War Two after joining the Dutch resistance as a courier and reached Britain in January 1943. After joining the British navy, he started working for the British Secret Intelligence Service, MI6, in 1944. After the war, Blake served briefly in the German city of Hamburg and studied Russian at Cambridge University before being sent in 1948 to Seoul where he gathered intelligence on Communist North Korea, Communist China and the Soviet Far East. He was captured and imprisoned when North Korean troops took Seoul after the Korean War began in 1950. It was during his time in a North Korean prison that he became a committed Communist, reading the works of Karl Marx and feeling outrage at heavy US bombing of North Korea.After his release in 1953, he returned to Britain and in 1955 was sent by MI6 to Berlin, where he collected information on Soviet spies but also passed secrets to Moscow about British and US operations.“I met a Soviet comrade about once a month,” he said in a 2012 interview published by Russian government newspaper Rossiyskaya Gazeta.Blake described how, for these meetings, he had travelled to the Soviet-controlled sector of Berlin on a rail link joining different parts of the divided city. His contact would be waiting for him in a car and they would go to a safe house.“I handed over films and we chatted. Sometimes we had a glass of Tsimlyansk champagne (Soviet sparkling wine).”Blake was eventually exposed by a Polish defector and brought home to Britain, where he was sentenced and jailed.When he escaped from Wormwood Scrubs, he left behind his wife, Gillian, and three children. After Gillian divorced him, Blake married a Soviet woman, Ida, with whom he had a son, Misha. He worked at a foreign affairs institute before retiring with her to a dacha, or country house, outside Moscow.Sipping martinis with Philby Blake, who went by the Russian name Georgy Ivanovich, was awarded a medal by Russian President Vladimir Putin in 2007 and held the rank of lieutenant colonel in the former KGB security service, from which he received a pension.“These are the happiest years of my life, and the most peaceful,” Blake said in the 2012 interview marking his 90th birthday. By then, he said, his eyesight was failing and he was “virtually blind”. He did not voice regret about his past.“Looking back on my life, everything seems logical and natural,” he said, describing himself as happy and lucky.Though he worked separately from the Cambridge Five - a spy ring of former Cambridge students who passed information to the Soviet Union - Blake said that during his retirement he got to know two of them, Donald Maclean and Kim Philby.He reminisced about drinking martinis, the preferred cocktail of fictitious British spy James Bond, with Philby but said he was closer in spirit to Maclean. Maclean died in Russia in 1983, and Philby in 1988. Of the rest of the Cambridge Five, Guy Burgess died in Russia in 1963, and Anthony Blunt in London in 1983.John Cairncross, the last to be publicly identified by investigative journalists and former Soviet intelligence officers, died in England in 1995.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/george-blake-last-in-line-of-cold-war-spies-who-betrayed-britain-dies-at-98/story-tKm3EuoxAbtp5n4EYYeo8L.html

26-12-2020||World||UK scientists trial instant immunity antibody drug treatment for Covid-19||Scientists in the UK have begun trials of innovative antibody drug treatments that they hope could provide instant protection against Covid-19.The University College London Hospitals NHS Trust (UCLH) said that the researchers in the Storm Chase study believe a Long Acting AntiBody (LAAB) known as AZD7442, developed by AstraZeneca, may offer immediate and long-term protection to people who have been recently exposed to the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus and prevent them developing Covid-19.The study, led by UCLH virologist Dr Catherine Houlihan, recruited the first participant in the world to the study earlier this month and has recruited 10 participants since then.“We know that this antibody combination can neutralise the virus, so we hope to find that giving this treatment via injection can lead to immediate protection against the development of Covid-19 in people who have been exposed – when it would be too late to offer a vaccine,” said Houlihan.UCLH said its new vaccine research centre is running two clinical trials testing a LAAB combination treatment to protect against Covid-19.The second Provent study is looking at the use of AZD7442 in people who may not respond to vaccination, for instance where someone has a compromised immune system or are at increased risk of Covid-19 infection due to factors such as age and existing conditions.“We will be recruiting people who are older or in long-term care, and who have conditions such as cancer and HIV which may affect the ability of their immune system to respond to a vaccine.“We want to reassure anyone for whom a vaccine may not work that we can offer an alternative which is just as protective,” said Dr Nicky Longley, UCLH infectious diseases consultant leading the Provent study.Antibodies are protein molecules that the body produces to help fight infections. Monoclonal antibodies are artificially produced in a laboratory and designed as possible medical treatments. They are designed to be injected directly into the body, unlike vaccines which “train” the immune system itself to produce antibodies.“These two clinical trials are an important addition to testing new therapeutic approaches, as antibody treatments may offer an alternative to patient groups who cannot benefit from a vaccine, such as immunocompromised patients,” said Professor Stephen Powis, the medical director of National Health Service (NHS) England.The LAABs have been engineered with AstraZeneca’s “proprietary” half-life extension technology to increase the durability of the therapy for six to 12 months following a single administration. The combination of two LAABs is also designed to reduce the risk of resistance developed by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which causes Covid-19.“AZD7442 has the potential to be an important preventative and therapeutic medicine against Covid-19, focusing on the most vulnerable patients. This work complements our vaccine development programme,” said Mene Pangalos, AztraZeneca Executive Vice-President for BioPharmaceuticals Research and Development. “Storm Chaser is exploring the use of a combination of monoclonal antibodies given intramuscularly in those who have been exposed to SARS-CoV-2 – a setting where vaccination would not have time to work and we have no other proven therapies to date. This makes Storm Chaser an important study that may have a large impact on our ability to control this infection,” noted Professor Andrew Ustianowski, who is the chief investigator of the new studies.UCLH said that in both Provent and Storm Chaser, researchers will assess whether the treatment reduces the risk of developing Covid-19 and/or reduces the severity of infection compared to placebo.Key participant groups in the Storm Chaser trial will include healthcare workers, students who live in group accommodation, and patients who are exposed to anyone with the SARS-CoV-2 virus as well as residents of long-term care facilities and industrial/military settings.Both trials are taking place at the newly-created Vaccine Research Centre at UCLH, which opened this month to help accelerate the development of new vaccines and treatments during the Covid-19 pandemic.“Both Storm Chaser and Provent are crucial to finding a solution to this pandemic,” said Professor Vincenzo Libri, who leads the UCLH Clinical Research Facility backed by the UK’s National Institute for Health Research (NIHR).“The opening of our new Vaccine Research Centre will help to propel our fight against the virus, meet our aspiration to save as many lives as possible, and ensure a return to normality,” he said.“The recent progress on vaccines is hugely welcome, and developing these additional treatments will be vital to ensure everyone in society can be offered protection against Covid-19,” Professor Marcel Levi, UCLH Chief Executive, said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-scientists-trial-instant-immunity-antibody-drug-treatment-for-covid-19/story-b75M7pwIYBcp7zun4xsyhK.html
26-12-2020||World||Russia revives Soviet-era lab to test weapons in Arctic climate: All you need to know||Russia has revived a Soviet-era research facility to test weapons in severe Arctic conditions as the Kremlin aims to boost its defence in the resource-rich region. This also comes at a time when the country faces military challenges along its western borders. Sergei Karasev, senior official at the Central Scientific-Research Institute for Precision Machine Engineering, Russia’s weapons maker, announced in a statement on Thursday that it had restored testing chambers at the facility to simulate extreme conditions, including extreme heat, cold and wet weather.Here’s everything you need to know about Russia’s decision to revive the lab:1. The laboratory, which has unique testing technology, was shut down in 1991 after the disintegration of the former Soviet Union. The Central Scientific-Research Institute for Precision Machine Engineering will run the facility.2. The lab can now test-fire small arms as well as special grenade launchers and small-cannon munitions at temperatures of between minus 60 and plus 60 degrees Celsius.3. Funding for maintenance of the testing chambers dried up in the early 1990s which resulted in the military company closing it, thus making the equipment outdated. “Certification was the final technical stage in restoring the unique testing technology that was lost after the Soviet collapse and that was only owned by our institute,” Sergei Karasev said.4. Russia’s President Vladimir Putin has repeatedly called the Arctic region crucial for the military interests and resource procurement of the country. As climate change continues to make the region more accessible, Putin has focused on building up military infrastructure in the area in response to the growing presence of Nato forces.5. This is not a new step for the country as efforts to reopen abandoned Soviet-era military, air and radar bases on remote Arctic islands as well as constructing new ones were found out by analysts in January 2017 amid reports that Moscow was engaged in the biggest military push in the Arctic since the breakup of the Soviet Union.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russia-revives-soviet-era-lab-to-test-weapons-in-arctic-climate-all-you-need-to-know/story-IQgpneN54wChzvxqcgNeXJ.html

Dr Ashish K Jha, the dean of Brown University School of Public Health, said more than a million people have been vaccinated against Covid-19 and less than 10 people have had allergic reactions, highlighting that one in 2,000 courses of penicillin also leads to an allergic reaction.Jha’s comment came after media reports about a US doctor reportedly suffering a severe allergic reaction to Moderna’s Covid-19 vaccine surfaced. US health agencies have already been investigating at least six cases of allergic reactions after receiving the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine.“To be clear, we absolutely should identify, publicly report these reactions...But this is the most high profile roll out of a vaccine in recent history...Am pleasantly surprised how well its going...Its early -- but so far, these reactions are totally in line with expectations,” he tweeted. To be clear, we absolutely should identify, publicly report these reactionsBut this is the most high profile roll out of a vaccine in recent historyAm pleasantly surprised how well its goingIts early -- but so far, these reactions are totally in line with expectationsPeter Hotez, a vaccine scientist, said that severe allergic reactions to vaccines based on mRNA technology have a potentially higher frequency than flu, HPV, MMR vaccines. However, the ratio is one in 50,000 or maybe a million, which is “still rare”, he tweeted.Also Read | Coronavirus: Here’s how our brains track where we and others goThe United States began its Covid-19 vaccination drive after the Food and Drugs Administration (FDA) granted emergency use authorisation to Pfizer-BioNTech, followed by Moderna. Earlier this week, US President Donald Trump’s Covid-19 vaccine czar had reportedly said that the frequency of allergic reactions to Pfizer’s vaccine is greater than expected.“That frequency, as it stood yesterday (December 22), is superior to what one would expect with other vaccines,” Dr Moncef Slaoui, chief scientific adviser for Operation Warp Speed, was quoted as saying by CNN.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/allergic-reactions-to-covid-19-vaccines-rare-in-line-with-expectations-experts/story-awWmz1spEJrB9vtra51vLP.html

But the CoronaVac needs to be administered in two shots, which means the amount Turkey signed for will be enough only for 25 million of its citizens out of a population of more than 83 million people.Most vaccines either consist of inactive pieces of a virus or proteins from a virus made through genetic engineering. When injected into the body, they trigger a lasting immune response similar to that of a person who has been infected and recovered.By contrast, the mRNA technology being used by Pfizer and its partner BioNTech as well as Moderna Inc. relies on the body’s own cells to produce viral proteins. Once injected into the body, the RNA slips into human cells and tells them to make virus-like proteins, in this case the “spike” protein on the surface of the coronavirus.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/turkey-signs-deal-with-biontech-for-covid-19-vaccine/story-h8SHAcDbLxyHVcMs8TXoMO.html
26-12-2020||World||China hails its ‘extraordinary’ success curbing coronavirus ahead of WHO probe||China’s ruling Communist Party leaders have congratulated themselves on their “extremely extraordinary” success in handling the Covid-19 outbreak domestically, ahead of a World Health Organization probe into the disease’s origins.China faced a barrage of criticism at home and abroad over its initial handling of the virus, which emerged in the central city of Wuhan last December.China’s Politburo, the top decision-making body of the Communist Party, said late Friday that the party leadership “played a decisive role in leading ... China in prevailing over the rare risks and challenges this year.”“At the critical moment ... the Party Central Committee took a long-term view ...achieving an extremely extraordinary glory in this extremely unusual year,” state news agency Xinhua reported, citing a statement issued after the two-day meeting.China has largely curbed the spread of the virus, and was one of the only major economies to report growth this year. But it has been accused of covering up the initial outbreak, and so contributing to the virus’ spread internationally.At home, Beijing has attempted to stifle criticism by punishing at least eight whistleblowers.A Chinese citizen journalist who reported on Wuhan’s outbreak, Zhang Zhan, has been detained since May and is expected to go on trial on Monday.Zhang is a former lawyer who travelled to the city in February to report on the chaotic initial stages of the outbreak, through livestreams and critical essays widely shared on social media platforms banned in China.The two-day Politburo meeting comes shortly before an international team of WHO experts is expected to arrive in China to investigate the animal origins of Covid-19, during which trip they will visit Wuhan.An expert from the team told AFP this week that the investigation was “not about finding a guilty country or a guilty authority”, but about “about understanding what happened to avoid that in the future”.Beijing has recently attempted to cast doubts on the origins of the virus -- the state-run People’s Daily newspaper said in a Facebook post in early November that “all available evidence suggests that the coronavirus did not start in central China’s Wuhan”.China has also tried to enhance its soft power push during the pandemic -- promising to share its vaccines with developing countries, and engaging in “mask diplomacy” -- donating personal protective gear to countries in need.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-hails-its-extraordinary-success-curbing-coronavirus-ahead-of-who-probe/story-1EJ7A2nMGShzBDaNt8hiQI.html
26-12-2020||World||Pelosi sets up showdown on Trump’s $2,000 checks after GOP balks||A surprise scuffle over pandemic relief is set to run up against a crucial federal funding deadline next week as Democrats side with President Donald Trump in his demand for $2,000 payments to most Americans and Republicans take up his criticism of government spending.House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is planning a full floor vote Monday on pandemic aid that includes the $2,000 payments that Trump says he wants, replacing the $600 in the original legislation. Republicans blocked Majority Leader Steny Hoyer’s attempt to make that switch on Thursday.Trump renewed his insistence Friday on the larger sum while spending Christmas at his Mar-a-Lago resort, temporarily finding common cause with Pelosi as she maneuvers a vote that will force Republicans to accept the bigger payments or break with Trump. But unlike the speaker, Trump didn’t explicitly call attention to the fact that it was GOP lawmakers who had balked at spending more.“Why would politicians not want to give people $2000, rather than only $600?” Trump said in a tweet. “Give our people the money!”Pelosi pinned the blame on the GOP on Thursday after the failure of an initial gambit to pivot to $2,000 checks as part of the Covid-relief package.“House and Senate Democrats have repeatedly fought for bigger checks for the American people, which House and Senate Republicans have repeatedly rejected – first, during our negotiations when they said that they would not go above $600 and now, with this act of callousness on the Floor,” Pelosi said in a statement.The standoff over stimulus payments comes after months of intense negotiations finally yielded a compromise to inject $900 billion into the US economy -- including forgivable loans for small businesses, supplemental unemployment benefits, support for renters facing eviction and funds for vaccine distribution. Those measures were combined with $1.4 trillion in annual government spending, and now the entire package is in limbo.Trump hasn’t explicitly said he would veto the legislation, which Congress finished processing Thursday after it passed both chambers on Monday. The White House didn’t respond to multiple requests for comment. The bill has been flown to Florida, according to a person familiar with the matter.Trump played a Christmas Day round of golf at his private club in West Palm Beach with Republican Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, an ally of the president who has urged him to sign the measure.If the president doesn’t do so by Monday night, the government -- now operating under temporary funding -- would begin a partial shutdown starting on Tuesday. The House may attempt to pass another stopgap funding measure on Monday if Trump hasn’t acted.The president tweeted a video Tuesday criticizing the $2.3 trillion bill. His call for $2,000 payments, which most Republicans rejected as too costly, surprised GOP lawmakers.“Republicans in Congress and the White House can’t agree on what they want,” Hoyer told reporters Thursday at the Capitol. “Surely, the president of the United States, whether he is in Mar-a-Lago or someplace else, ought to empathize with the suffering and apprehension and deep angst people are feeling this Christmas Eve.”Senator Roy Blunt, a member of the GOP leadership, said there were not enough Republican votes in the Senate to pass the $2,000 payments.“I hope the president looks at this again and reaches that conclusion that the best thing to do is to sign the bill,” Blunt told reporters.The House will reconvene Monday to vote on the Cash Act, a bill introduced by Ways and Means Chairman Richard Neal to increase stimulus checks to $2,000. Democrats will have a video conference call before the vote to discuss Congress’s pandemic response, according to a person briefed on the plan.Republicans on Thursday tried to seek unanimous consent on a measure to examine taxpayer money spent on foreign aid, but Democrats blocked that move. In his complaint Tuesday about Congress’s combined virus aid and government spending bill, Trump criticized federal resources spent on international programs, even though such spending was included in his budget and was allocated as part of the bipartisan appropriations process.Trump’s conflict with Congress further escalated this week with his veto Wednesday of the National Defense Authorization Act, which passed both chambers by large bipartisan margins earlier this month. The House plans to vote to override Trump’s veto Monday, with the Senate following suit on Tuesday. It would be the first time Congress overrules Trump.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pelosi-sets-up-showdown-on-trump-s-2-000-checks-after-gop-balks/story-f3Kql79Q216ClXCbqKOmhJ.html

The deadline for the deal was by the end of the year and as days went by without any agreement, both the administration and the people of UK were worried about trade with the EU in the future.Here are the key points of the post-Brexit trade deal:Goods trade: The trade deal does not impose any tariffs or quotas on goods traded between the EU and UK, however, British exporters will have to contend with new regulatory hurdles which will make it costlier to do business with Europe.Financial services: The trade agreement does not shed much light on the operation of financial firms. It only features standard provisions on financial services, meaning it doesn’t include commitments on market access.Transparency: The EU and UK have both agreed to uphold their environmental, social, labour and tax transparency standards.Disputes: Any disputes on the trade between the two parties are subject to negotiation by both but EU courts will have no say in the matter.Fishing norms: This was one of the most disputed subjects of the trade deal. The agreement was that the UK would get 25% of the current EU catch in British waters in a phased manner over a period of five years. A phased transition period of five-and-a-half years will also be present during which time reciprocal access rights to each other’s waters would nit change.Customs: The EU and UK have agreed to limit customs red tape including through programs for trusted traders called Authorised Economic Operators (AEO).Aviation: As per the British government, the EU will no longer grant automatic recognition to British aerospace designs and products.Data flow: There is a temporary provision in the deal that allows the flow of data between the EU and UK until the bloc a data adequacy decision.Energy: The UK will no longer have access to the EU’s internal energy market. However, there will be new arrangements made on this front in 2022 to ensure smooth trading.Professional services: There will no longer be automatic mutual recognition of professional qualifications.Travel for business: Both parties have come to the agreement that people on short-term business trips would not need a work permit or undergo economic needs tests.Taxes: UK’s domestic tax regimes or tax rates would not be constrained as per the government and both sides were committed to upholding the global standards on tax transparency.Agriculture: Agricultural products would not be subject to tariffs or quotas, however, shippers would face new challenges and higher costs thanks to new border requirements.Law: There will be cooperation between the EU and the UK, especially in cases of investigating terrorism and other serious crime. Exchange of DNA, fingerprint and airline passenger information is allowed under the new deal.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/from-goods-trade-to-travel-norms-key-points-of-post-brexit-trade-deal/story-l0RpGFq3EBSPfGSAzDRoqI.html

They see the Taliban as a tool for themselves,” Khattak said in an interview with TOLOnews this week.“We can say that their (the Taliban’s) approach has changed if they stop violence and say that they will feel the people’s pain,” Khattak said.Khattak remarks come on the heels of Taliban deputy political leader Abdul Ghani Baradar’s visit to Pakistan last week. A video released on social media showed Baradar among a group of people, apparently the Taliban members, in Karachi, Pakistan, where he said that all decisions about the peace process are being finalized in consultation with the Taliban’s leadership and the Taliban’s cleric council in Pakistan.Baradar said the Taliban’s leadership exists in Pakistan.The Taliban have so far not commented about the place of Baradar’s meeting with wounded members of the group.The Afghan Ministry of Foreign Affairs on Friday reacted to Baradar’s video in Pakistan and said the presence of the Taliban leaders and their fighters in Pakistan is a “clear violation of Afghanistan’s national sovereignty.”The ministry called on Pakistan to prevent terrorists from using its territory against Afghanistan, adding that closing the safe havens of insurgents and terrorists is pivotal for a peaceful end to the crisis in Afghanistan.Pakistan has been long blamed for providing support to Taliban terrorists in Afghanistan.The UN Analytical Support and Sanctions Monitoring Team to the 1988 Sanctions Committee, which oversees sanctions on the Taliban, in its 2019 report had acknowledged that nearly 5,000 terrorists belonging to Lashkar-e-Tayyiba, which is based in Pakistan, were active in Kunar and Nangarhar provinces of Afghanistan alone.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-using-taliban-as-tool-for-dominance-in-afghanistan-says-former-senator/story-D5YFTyohViyvI0b3L9OzfO.html

It’s a last-ditch effort||China’s President Xi Jinping has ordered a high-level team of communist party officials to travel to Kathmandu to stop the Nepal Communist Party from splitting. President Xi’s decision to rush the four-member team to Kathmandu comes after an SOS message from ambassador Hou Yanqi who hadn’t succeeded in her attempts to stop the key players in the Nepal Communist Party (NCP) from pulling the party in different directions, people familiar with the matter said.The team led by Guo Yechau, vice minister of the International Department of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, will land in Kathmandu on Sunday and is scheduled to spend the next four days in the Himalayan nation.Also Read: China sells 50 armed drones to Pakistan, begins psyops. It’s a reminder | AnalysisAccording to sources based in Kathmandu, Ambassador Hou has already scheduled their meetings with prominent players in Nepal’s ruling party from both sides.It is, however, not clear yet if Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli, who had earlier turned down requests from Ambassador Hou to meet her, would meet the Chinese delegation. Chances of PM Oli, who has taken a staunch Nepali nationalist role, meeting the visiting delegation are slim. He has already conveyed to Ambassador Hou that China should not interfere in internal affairs of Nepal since the legal challenge to the decision to dissolve Parliament is already before the Supreme Court.Also Read: Virtual summits’: PM Modi set the template, then nudged the world | AnalysisA Nepal watcher said the ambassador had been in touch with PM Oli camp but had been unable to get through to the prime minister. She has had more than one meeting with Prachanda, the last one on Thursday last week.On Sunday last, PM Oli had stunned his detractors within the party and China’s communist party when he dissolved Parliament amid a prolonged tussle for power between him and former prime minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal ‘Prachanda’ within the ruling dispensation. PM Oli, who also got President Bidhya Devi Bhandari to sign off on his cabinet’s recommendation to hold parliamentary elections on April 30 and May 10, later told the country in a televised address that his rivals within the party hadn’t been letting him function and had planned to move a vote of no-confidence against him.Also Read: Chinese ambassador steps up as Nepal’s communist party stares at a splitPushpa Kamal Dahal ‘Prachanda’ and PM Oli have been co-chairs of the Nepal Communist Party formed in 2018 by the merger of PM Oli’s Communist Party of Nepal (Unified Marxist–Leninist) and Prachanda’s Communist Party of Nepal- Maoist Centre.India has adopted a hands-off approach to the developments in the neighbourhood, saying it was an internal matter that should be handled in keeping with the country’s democratic processes.“As a neighbour and well-wisher, India will continue to support Nepal and its people in moving forward on the path of peace, prosperity and development,” India’s external affairs ministry spokesperson Anurag Srivastava told a news conference on Thursday.China, however, has been determined to prevent a split in the ruling communist party and has intervened more than once this year to engineer a patch-up between PM Oli and Prachanda, his lead rival in the ruling Nepal Communist Party.Also Read: Nepal PM Oli seeks control of communist party, rivals ‘sack’ him as party bossDiplomats in Kathmandu who have been tracking the political developments said the Chinese team is expected to focus on leaders in both the factions who are in favour of the NCP staying united irrespective of the changes that might be required to achieve this objective.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/prez-xi-sending-team-to-stop-the-nepal-party-split-it-s-a-last-ditch-effort/story-ftnFGPYV1QV7cCOhkz2DdP.html

26-12-2020||World||Nepal’s Oli govt recommends calling winter session of upper house on Jan 1||Embattled Prime Minister K P Sharma Oli-led government has recommended the president to summon the winter session of Parliament’s upper house on January 1, nearly a week after the lower house was dissolved. Nepal plunged into a political crisis after President Bidya Devi Bhandari dissolved the House of Representatives and announced dates for mid-term elections at the recommendation of Prime Minister Oli on Sunday, sparking protests from a section of the ruling party and various opposition parties. The ruling Nepal Communist Party has now been virtually divided more than two years after it was formed following the merger of CPN-UML led by Oli and CPN-Maoist Centre led by Pushpa Kamal Dahal ‘Prachanda’ in May 2018. A Cabinet meeting held on Friday evening decided to recommend that the president summon the winter session of the National Assembly on January 1, Hridayesh Tripathi, who was made minister for health earlier on Friday, told Kathmandu Post. The meeting was held after Prime Minister Oli reshuffled the Cabinet to induct eight ministers, five of them former Maoist leaders, and change the portfolio of five of his ministers. On Sunday, after the dissolution of the House of Representatives, seven ministers close to Prachanda-led faction had resigned from their posts. The budget session of Parliament was prorogued on July 2 by the president on the recommendation of the government. According to the Constitution of Nepal, the gap between the two house sessions cannot exceed six months. Oli, who was increasingly under pressure from his opponents in the NCP to resign, was also facing pressure to call the winter session of Parliament. Instead, Oli on Sunday decided to dissolve the lower house, in a move that has been widely criticised by experts on constitutional matters as unconstitutional. The Supreme Court is hearing as many 13 writs against the house dissolution. On Friday, the Supreme Court issued a show-cause notice to the Oli government, asking it to submit a written clarification over its decision to abruptly dissolve the 275-member House of Representatives. The court also asked the government to submit an original copy of the recommendations made by it to dissolve the House and the decision made by the President to authenticate the government’s recommendations within 10 days. Both factions of the party have intensified efforts to retain official party recognition along with the election symbol. The two factions are now busy making strategies to wrest control of the party. The Election Commission will decide which faction of the NCP is legitimate to carry the party name and election symbol.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nepal-s-oli-govt-recommends-calling-winter-session-of-upper-house-on-jan-1/story-Xj2wPn0bHvcgM4ZdpVya0H.html
26-12-2020||World||Saudi Crown Prince gets Covid-19 vaccine||Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman received the Covid-19 vaccine on Friday, state media reported. The country’s Health Minister Dr Tawfiq al-Rabiah extended his gratitude to the Crown Prince for his “keenness and continuous follow-up” to provide vaccines to citizens.“Within the framework of Vision 2030, there is a policy of prevention is better than cure, which was represented by intensifying preventive measures, emphasising that human health is first, and providing safe and internationally approved vaccine in record time and providing it to citizens and residents. The Kingdom is one of the best countries in the world in facing the coronavirus pandemic,” Al Arabiya news channel quoted al-Rabiah as saying.This comes after Saudi Arabia received shipments of the coronavirus vaccine developed by Pzifer and BioNTech earlier this month, The Hill reported.According to the Health Ministry of the kingdom, there are 3,61,903 Covid-19 cases in the country while 352,815 cases have recovered from the illness. So far, 6,168 have died due to the Covid-19 related complications.Prince Mohammed is among the few world leaders who have received the vaccine. Last week, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was vaccinated on live television. Earlier this week, US President-elect Joe Biden had received the first dose of the coronavirus vaccine.“Today, I received the COVID-19 vaccine. To the scientists and researchers who worked tirelessly to make this possible -- thank you.

26-12-2020||World||Donald Trump made lasting impact on federal courts||On this, even President Donald Trump’s most fevered critics agree: he has left a deep imprint on the federal courts that will outlast his one term in office for decades to come.He used the promise of conservative judicial appointments to win over Republican skeptics as a candidate. Then as president, he relied on outside conservative legal organizations and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell to employ an assembly line-like precision to install more than 230 judges on the federal bench, including the three newest justices of the Supreme Court. Trump never tired of boasting about it.Indeed, undeterred by Democratic criticism, the Senate was still confirming judges more than a month after Trump lost his reelection bid to Joe Biden.“Trump has basically done more than any president has done in a single term since (President Jimmy) Carter to put his stamp on the judiciary,” said Jonathan Adler, a law professor at Case Western Reserve University School of Law in Cleveland, Ohio, adding that Congress created around 150 new judgeships during Carter’s presidency.The impact will be enduring. Among the Trump-appointed judges, who hold lifetime positions, several are still in their 30s. The three Supreme Court picks could still be on the court at the 21st century’s midpoint, 30 years from now.Beyond the Supreme Court, 30 percent of the judges on the nation’s court of appeals, where all but a handful of cases reach their end, were appointed by Trump.But numbers don’t tell the entire story. The real measure of what Trump has been able to do will be revealed in countless court decisions in the years to come on abortion, guns, religious rights and a host of other culture wars issues.When it came to the president’s own legal challenges of the election results, however, judges who have him to thank for their position rebuffed his claims. But in many other important ways, his success with judicial appointments already is paying dividends for conservatives.When the Supreme Court blocked New York from enforcing certain limits on attendance at churches and synagogues in areas designated as hard hit by Covid-19, Justice Amy Coney Barrett, the newest member of the court, cast the decisive fifth vote. Previously, the court had allowed restrictions on religious services over the dissent of four justices, including the other two Trump nominees, Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh.Five Trump appointees were in the majority of the 6-4 decision by the full 11th US Circuit Court of Appeals in September that made it harder for felons in Florida to regain the right to vote. The Atlanta-based court had a majority of Democratic-appointed judges when Trump took office.Last month, Judges Britt Grant and Barbara Lagoa, both named by Trump, formed the majority on a three-judge 11th circuit panel that struck down local Florida bans on therapy that seeks to change the sexual orientation of LGBTQ minors. Other appeals courts around the country have upheld the conversion therapy bans.In one early look at Trump’s appointees to federal trial courts, political science professors Kenneth Manning, Robert Carp and Lisa Holmes compared their decisions with more than 117,000 opinions published dating back to 1932.“Trump has appointed judges who exhibit a distinct decision-making pattern that is, on the whole, significantly more conservative than previous presidents,” the political scientists concluded in an October 2020 working paper.The one constant of the past four years — through impeachment, the coronavirus pandemic and Trump’s election loss — has been his nomination of and Senate confirmation of judges.The president has had several partners in the judicial effort, but none more important than McConnell, who takes particular pride in reshaping the Supreme Court.“I think it’s far and away the most consequential thing I’ve ever been involved in,’’ the 78-year-old McConnell said in an interview. “And it’s the most long-lasting accomplishment of the current administration, by far.’’They might not have called it a partnership at the time, but their mutually reinforcing work began even before Trump’s election in 2016.Trump used the issue of the federal judiciary to win trust with voters who might have questions about the conservative credentials of a billionaire real estate developer who had once supported abortion rights and did not have a track record in politics.He put in writing a list of potential nominees, provided by the conservative Federalist Society and Heritage Foundation, he would select from in filling a Supreme Court vacancy.Kellyanne Conway, who served as his campaign manager in 2016, said it was a move that people who had been in office for years and wanted to ascend to the presidency “didn’t have the courage to do, which is name names.”As it happens, there was a high court opening at the time, following the death of Justice Antonin Scalia in February.Enter McConnell. The Republican blocked President Barack Obama’s nomination of Merrick Garland, refusing so much as a hearing for the respected appeals court judge whom Republicans had previously identified as a high court nominee they could support.It was a gamble at a time when Trump’s electoral prospects seemed dim, but it paid off with his stunning victory over Hillary Clinton.And the high court seat wasn’t the only one waiting to be filled when Trump took office in January 2017. One hundred four judgeships were open after Republicans used their Senate majority to grind the nomination process to a near halt in Obama’s final two years in office. Only 28.6% of his nominees were confirmed in that stretch.The pace quickened almost immediately. Republicans moved with an urgency on confirmations that hasn’t let up. In Trump’s first two years, they pushed through 30 appellate court judges and 53 district court nominees. It was the highest number of appellate court confirmations in a two-year period since Ronald Reagan and nearly double the number that Obama secured in his first two years.McConnell and top Republicans on the Senate Judiciary Committee eliminated rules that had allowed the opposition party to delay confirmations, most notably requiring just a simple majority, instead of 60 votes, to move Supreme Court nominees. Democrats, bitter over the stalled Garland nomination, otherwise would have blocked Gorsuch’s confirmation in April 2017.Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, D-RI, a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee and a sharp Trump critic, said Trump’s judicial legacy “is a lot less about what he’s done than what he’s allowed others to do in his name.’’Whitehouse said Trump essentially “outsourced” judicial nominations to McConnell and the Federalist Society, specifically the group’s leader Leonard Leo and former White House counsel Don McGahn, a Federalist Society member who made judicial nominations a top priority.At the same time, the Federalist Society and other conservative groups, including the Judicial Crisis Network and Americans for Prosperity, have taken millions of dollars in anonymous donations and waged public and behind-the-scenes campaigns for right-wing judges, Whitehouse said.Trump “opened the channel for special-interest interference in judicial selection. That I think is very novel and obviously lends itself to corruption,’’ Whitehouse said. “Right wing forces have for decades sought the kind of influence in judicial nominations that the Trump administration outright gave them.’’McConnell scoffed at the criticism. “The reason a lot of them belong to the Federalist Society is because that is sort of the core mission of the Federalist Society -- to get the courts back to doing what they’re supposed to do and not legislate from the bench,” he said.On the campaign trail and at White House events, Trump would often cite his record on judicial appointments as an example of accomplishment, while ignoring the obstructions that occurred during the Obama years.“You know, when I got in, we had over 100 federal judges that weren’t appointed. Now, I don’t know why Obama left that. It was like a big, beautiful present to all of us. Why the hell did he leave that? Maybe he got complacent,” Trump boasted at one point, omitting the essential fact that McConnell had blocked Obama’s nominees.The high court vacancy at the start of Trump’s term was, in essence, a gift from McConnell. Justice Anthony Kennedy’s decision to retire in 2018 allowed Trump to replace the court’s swing justice with the more conservative Kavanaugh, who survived his own bruising confirmation hearings that included allegations he sexually assaulted a woman when they were both in high school decades ago. Kavanaugh denied the claims.Less than two months before the 2020 election, Trump was handed another opening with the death of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. Trump and Senate Republicans didn’t hesitate. He nominated Barrett even before Ginsburg was buried at Arlington National Cemetery and McConnell ensured the confirmation was done before the election.The Senate has continued confirming Trump nominees even after his defeat for reelection, breaking a norm that has stood since 1900 with one exception, said Russell Wheeler, a visiting fellow at the Brookings Institution. Federal prosecutor Thomas Kirsch was confirmed as Barrett’s replacement on the federal appeals court based in Chicago on Dec. 15, on a mostly party-line vote.The exception was the Senate’s bipartisan acceptance in 1980 of a former Senate staff member as a federal appeals court judge. That nominee was Stephen Breyer, now a Supreme Court justice.Along with the question of legacy is whether Trump’s record on judges spurs major changes to the judiciary.Wheeler, at Brookings, said one of the most striking features of the teamwork of Trump and McConnell is that they acted as though they had the support of most Americans. They did not, he said.“My main beef with this current group is that there’s just no mandate to turn the judiciary so far to the right,” Wheeler said. “Trump lost the popular vote massively in 2016, but nevertheless has behaved as if he had a mandate to reshape the federal judiciary at the Supreme Court and Court of Appeals level and I think that’s just unfounded.”Liberal groups already have been pushing for changes at the highest level, including expansion of the Supreme Court and term limits for justices. The political prospects for both ideas are uncertain, at best.But there’s less doubt from any vantage point about what Trump has wrought.The US “will be living with the legacy of Donald Trump for decades to come as a result of his judicial appointments,’’ said Brian Fallon, executive director of Demand Justice, a liberal advocacy group. People who accepted judicial appointments from Trump will “wear the moniker of ‘Trump judge’ for the rest of their lives,’’ Fallon said.Not so, in Conway’s view. “It will be one of the most lasting pieces of his legacy, distinguished and durable,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-made-lasting-impact-on-federal-courts/story-s7LQrHg6c8lajugaQe18RK.html
26-12-2020||World||WHO releases list of 10 global health issues to track in 2021||The World Health Organization (WHO) released a list of global health issues that the world could have to deal with in 2021 as inadequacies of health systems across countries lay bare at the hands of the coronavirus disease that has claimed over 1.75 million lives worldwide.The pandemic could set back the global health progress achieved in the past 20 years and in 2021, the world would have to work hard to repair and reinforce their health systems if they want to effectively deliver vaccines, the WHO said.The ten ways to help countries strengthen preparedness for emergencies in 2021 are:1. Build global solidarity for worldwide health security: Countries need to work together to improve their preparedness for health emergencies. Support needs to be targeted to the most vulnerable communities, including in urban settings, small island countries and conflict settings. 2. Speed up access to Covid-19 tests, medicines and vaccines: WHO aims to achieve equitable access to vaccines and treatments and to ensure a smooth delivery to the needy. The WHO will distribute 2 billion vaccines; 245 million treatments; establish testing for 500 million people in low- and middle-income countries; and strengthen the health systems needed to support them.3. Advance health for all: During the next year, countries would need to strengthen their health systems so that they can respond to emergencies such as Covid-19.4. Tackling health inequities: WHO will work with countries to address health inequities related to income, gender, ethnicity, education, occupation/employment conditions, disability etc. 5. Provide global leadership on science and data: Countries would need to strengthen the capacity of their health data and information systems to report on progress towards their health-related goals, the WHO has said adding that it would monitor and evaluate all scientific developments around Covid-19 and other emergencies, identifying opportunities to harness those advances to improve global health.6. Revitalize efforts to tackle communicable diseases: Next year, the WHO will help countries get vaccines for polio and other diseases to the people who missed out during the pandemic. 7. Combat drug resistance: Countries will be able to beat infectious diseases only if they have effective medicines to treat them. WHO said it will improve global monitoring and continue to support national action plans, ensuring that antimicrobial resistance is factored into health emergencies preparedness plans.8. Prevent and treat NCDs and mental health conditions: According to the WHO, noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) were responsible for 7 of the top 10 causes of death in 2019 and 2020 taught us how people with NCDs were vulnerable to Covid-19. The year 2021 should focus on ensuring that that screening and treatment programmes for diseases are accessible to the needy.9. Build back better: Covid-19 has given us an opportunity to build back a “better, greener, healthier world” in 2021, WHO said.10. Act in solidarity: There is a need for everyone to demonstrate greater solidarity. Nations, institutions, communities and individuals should “close the cracks” in defences, the WHO said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/who-releases-list-of-10-global-health-issues-to-track-in-2021/story-RUubhFpkj9hUcJi3aTY8zO.html
26-12-2020||World||Politics blunts Christmas as US government shutdown nears, virus aid unsure||President Donald Trump spent Christmas Day golfing at his West Palm Beach club while millions of Americans faced the risk of losing jobless benefits on Saturday and the threat of a partial government shutdown next week if he refuses to sign a $2.3 trillion coronavirus aid and spending package.Trump stunned members of both parties when he unexpectedly announced this week his dislike of the spending bill, which had taken members of Congress months to negotiate. The bill provides $892 billion in coronavirus relief, and $1.4 trillion in regular government appropriations. A source familiar with the situation said many White House officials were caught by surprise. While Trump’s strategy going forward on the bill is unclear, he could still sign the package given he has not made an explicit veto threat.Trump, who had not objected to the terms prior to the votes in the House of Representatives and the Senate, complained that the package was too full of money for special interests and foreign aid, and said the $600 in direct payments to most Americans was too small, demanding that the amount be increased to $2,000.On Christmas Day, Trump spent most of the day golfing, with close ally and Republican Senator Lindsey Graham, according to a source familiar with his activities. In a tweet, he said he has had many telephone calls and meetings at his golf club and urged lawmakers to give people more money.“Why would politicians not want to give people $2000, rather than only $600? It wasn’t their fault, it was China. Give our people the money!” he said, referring to the coronavirus, which originated last year in China.The bill is now at Mar-a-Lago, Trump’s Florida resort, where he is spending the holidays, awaiting his decision. Without Trump’s signature on the coronavirus aid bill, about 14 million people will lose unemployment benefits on Saturday, and a partial government shutdown will begin on Tuesday.On Christmas Eve, Trump tweeted a series of grievances, repeating baseless claims about the election result, including one aimed at Senate Republicans, whom he accuses of abandoning him because many now publicly recognize Biden as the winner. On Christmas Day, Trump followed his tweet about aid payments to Americans with a flurry of posts, lashing out at the media in two with cries of “Fake News” as he said that he was going to hold a video conference with members of the military.Separately, the White House said Trump was briefed on a Nashville vehicle explosion Saturday morning that injured three people in what police described as an “intentional act.”Democratic President-elect Joe Biden, whose victory Trump still refuses to acknowledge nearly two months after the November 3 election, spent the day at his Delaware home and had no public events, according to his staff. Biden takes office on January 20.Americans face an unprecedented holiday season amid a pandemic that has killed more than 320,000 people in the United States, with a daily death toll now repeatedly well over 3,000 people, the highest since the pandemic began. Trump this week issued dozens of pardons, including to former aides and four private security guards convicted of killing unarmed Iraqi civilians.Meanwhile, Congress, which normally is adjourned the last week of December, will be preparing to return to work.On Monday, following the Christmas weekend, the House is scheduled to vote on overriding Trump’s veto of a $740 billion bill authorizing the country’s defense programs. If the House vote succeeds, the Senate could hold its vote as early as Tuesday..Trump could also choose to take advantage of a situation known as a “pocket veto,” rather than outright vetoing the coronavirus aid package. Because the current Congress expires on January 3, Trump could let the normal 10-day period that a president has to sign or veto a bill simply run out. Bills die if they are not enacted during the Congress in which they are introduced.If he does issue a veto, the House and Senate could try to override it next week. Congress might also have to pass a stopgap spending bill on Monday, before money that funds government operations expires at midnight. Also on Monday, the Democratic-controlled House plans to vote on legislation providing one-time, $2,000 checks to individuals to help them during the coronavirus pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/politics-blunts-christmas-as-us-government-shutdown-nears-virus-aid-unsure/story-a5qQOLePIc702RAOTATzKJ.html

26-12-2020||World||Russia opens criminal case against ally of Kremlin critic Navalny||Russia launched a criminal case on Friday against Lyubov Sobol, an ally of Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny, over accusations she had violently entered a flat that her supporters said was linked to a secret agent involved in plot to kill Navalny.The move against Sobol is the latest in a clampdown on the Kremlin’s opponents before next year’s parliamentary election. Sobol aims to run for office, although outspoken critics of the Kremlin are often prevented from standing.Sobol was detained for 48 hours after questioning, Navalny, one of the Kremlin’s fiercest opponents, wrote on Twitter.Russia’s Investigative Committee, which handles serious crimes, said on its website on Friday it had launched a criminal case against Sobol. It did not mention any detention.Sobol’s supporters and the authorities gave different accounts of events leading up to Friday’s actions.Her supporters said she rang the doorbell on Monday of an apartment owned by the family of a man who Navalny has said was an FSB security service officer involved in a bungled attempt to poison him using a nerve agent.The FSB has dismissed Navalny’s account of the poisoning.In its account, the Investigative Committee said Sobol and several others tried to gain entry to an old woman’s flat in Moscow, wearing uniforms used by the state consumer health watchdog. It accused her of tricking a delivery courier to enter the apartment block before barging into the woman’s flat when she opened the door. It said Sobol was suspected of using violence to enter illegally, an offence that can carry a jail term of up to two years.Navalny wrote on Twitter: “They are locking up the mother of a small child for two days to tell everybody: don’t dig into this case. Don’t dare to mess with our killers and poisoners and knock on their doors. These killers are untouchable.”Germany and other Western nations say Navalny was poisoned with a Soviet-style Novichok nerve agent in a murder attempt. The Kremlin has repeatedly denied the accusations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russia-opens-criminal-case-against-ally-of-kremlin-critic-navalny/story-yfxjbkwOAV7sqVseJBnqHO.html

According to the IDF, two rockets have been fired from the exclave and both of them have been intercepted by the Iron Dome aerial defence system.“In response to the rockets fired from Gaza toward Israel tonight, the Israeli Air Force struck Hamas terror targets including rocket manufacturing site, underground infrastructure, a military post,” the IDF wrote on its Twitter page.Hamas, a Palestinian Sunni militant organization in control of the Gaza Strip, has been locked in a protracted on-and-off conflict with Israel, which still refuses to recognize Palestine as an independent political and diplomatic entity. Israel holds Hamas responsible for any attack coming from the Gaza Strip.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/israeli-air-force-strikes-hamas-facilities-in-gaza-strip/story-WHmgbECX2YXE7gHHJ6OCAO.html
26-12-2020||World||Donald Trump golfs in Florida as Covid relief hangs in the balance||President Donald Trump spent his Christmas golfing in Florida as a government shutdown looms and Covid relief hangs in the balance.Trump, at his Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach for the holidays, had no events on his public schedule after throwing the future of a massive Covid relief and government funding bill into question. Failure to sign the bill, which arrived in Florida on Thursday night, could deny relief checks to millions of Americans on the brink and force a government shutdown in the midst of the pandemic.The White House declined to share details of the president’s schedule, though he played golf Friday with South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham, a close ally.White House spokesman Judd Deere said Trump was briefed on the explosion in downtown Nashville early Friday that authorities said appeared to be intentional, but the president said nothing publicly about it in the hours after.Trump tweeted that he planned to make “a short speech to service members from all over the world” by video conference Friday to celebrate the holiday, but declared: “Fake News not invited!” Without giving details, the White House said only that Trump would work “tirelessly” during the holidays and has “many meetings and calls.”Trump’s vacation came as Washington was still reeling over his surprise, eleventh-hour demand that an end-of-year spending bill that congressional leaders spent months negotiating give most Americans $2,000 Covid relief checks — far more than the $600 members of his own party had agreed to. The idea was swiftly rejected by House Republicans during a rare Christmas Eve session, leaving the proposal in limbo.Also Read| Human remains found near Nashville explosion: ReportThe bipartisan compromise had been considered a done deal and had won sweeping approval in the House and Senate this week after the White House assured GOP leaders that Trump supported it. If he refuses to sign the deal, which is attached to a $1.4 trillion government funding bill, it will force a federal government shutdown, in addition to delaying aid checks and halting unemployment benefits and eviction protections in the most dire stretch of the pandemic.“Made many calls and had meetings at Trump International in Palm Beach, Florida. Why would politicians not want to give people $2000, rather than only $600?” he tweeted after leaving the golf course Friday afternoon. “It wasn’t their fault, it was China. Give our people the money!”Graham tweeted Friday night that Trump was still intent on getting changes in yearend legislation before signing it.“After spending some time with President @realDonaldTrump today, I am convinced he is more determined than ever to increase stimulus payments to $2000 per person and challenge Section 230 big tech liability protection.” he said in his tweet “Both are reasonable demands, and I hope Congress is listening. The biggest winner would be the American people.”In addition to the Covid aid, Graham was referring to another Trump priority: to get a repeal of Section 230 of the 1996 Communications Decency Act, a law that protects online platforms from liability for content posted by users.Trump’s decision to attack the Covid bill has been seen, at least in part, as political punishment for what he considers insufficient backing by congressional Republicans of his campaign to overturn the results of the Nov. 3 election with unfounded claims of voter fraud.“At a meeting in Florida today, everyone was asking why aren’t the Republicans up in arms & fighting over the fact that the Democrats stole the rigged presidential election?” Trump tweeted Thursday.“I will NEVER FORGET!” he later added.Trump for weeks now has refused to accept the results of the election and has been pushing new, increasingly outrageous schemes to try to overturn the results. He has been egged on by allies like his lawyer, former New York mayor Rudy Giuliani, who accompanied the president to Florida aboard Air Force One.Also Read: Japan urges Biden to be strong in support of Taiwan against ChinaTrump has provided no credible evidence to support his election claims, which have been refuted by a long list of officials, among them judges, former Attorney General William Barr, Republican governors and local election administrators.Meanwhile, the nation continues to reel as the coronavirus spreads, with record infections and hospitalizations and more than 327,000 now dead. And millions are now going through the holidays alone or struggling to make ends meet without adequate income, food or shelter thanks to the pandemic’s economic toll.The Justice Department said Acting Attorney General Jeff Rosen also was briefed on the Nashville blast and directed that all department resources be made available to help. The FBI will be taking the lead in the investigation, agency spokesman Joel Siskovic said.Three people were treated in hospitals after a recreational vehicle, blaring a recorded warning of an imminent detonation, exploded in Nashville’s downtown. The blast caused widespread communications outages that took down police emergency systems and grounded flights at the city’s airport.To mark the holiday, the president and first lady Melania Trump tweeted out a pre-recorded video message in which they wished Americans a merry Christmas and thanked first responders and members of the military.“As you know, this Christmas is different than years past,” said Mrs. Trump, who focused on the acts of “kindness and courage” the pandemic had inspired .Trump hailed the vaccine doses now being delivered and thanked those responsible. “It is a truly a Christmas miracle,” he said.Meanwhile, Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin have been trying to salvage the year-end legislation to try to prevent a shutdown. Democrats will call House lawmakers back to Washington for a vote Monday on Trump’s $2,000 proposal, though it would probably die in the Republican-controlled Senate. They are also considering a vote Monday on a stop-gap measure at least to avert a federal shutdown and keep the government running until Democrat Joe Biden is inaugurated Jan. 20.In addition to the relief checks, the Covid bill that passed would establish a temporary $300 per week supplemental jobless benefit, provide a new round of subsidies for hard-hit businesses, restaurants and theaters and money for schools, and provide money for health care providers and to help with Covid vaccine distribution.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-golfs-in-florida-as-covid-relief-hangs-in-the-balance/story-AufSe9TtX3vX9QUy4Zsf7H.html
26-12-2020||World||China to overtake US as world’s biggest economy by 2028: Report||China will overtake the United States to become the world’s biggest economy in 2028, five years earlier than previously estimated due to the contrasting recoveries of the two countries from the Covid-19 pandemic, a think tank said.“For some time, an overarching theme of global economics has been the economic and soft power struggle between the United States and China,” the Centre for Economics and Business Research said in an annual report published on Saturday.“The Covid-19 pandemic and corresponding economic fallout have certainly tipped this rivalry in China’s favour.” The CEBR said China’s “skilful management of the pandemic”, with its strict early lockdown, and hits to long-term growth in the West meant China’s relative economic performance had improved.China looked set for average economic growth of 5.7% a year from 2021-25 before slowing to 4.5% a year from 2026-30.While the United States was likely to have a strong post-pandemic rebound in 2021, its growth would slow to 1.9% a year between 2022 and 2024, and then to 1.6% after that.Japan would remain the world’s third-biggest economy, in dollar terms, until the early 2030s when it would be overtaken by India, pushing Germany down from fourth to fifth.The United Kingdom, currently the fifth-biggest economy by the CEBR’s measure, would slip to sixth place from 2024.However, despite a hit in 2021 from its exit from the European Union’s single market, British GDP in dollars was forecast to be 23% higher than France’s by 2035, helped by Britain’s lead in the increasingly important digital economy.Europe accounted for 19% of output in the top 10 global economies in 2020 but that will fall to 12% by 2035, or lower if there is an acrimonious split between the EU and Britain, the CEBR said.It also said the pandemic’s impact on the global economy was likely to show up in higher inflation, not slower growth.“We see an economic cycle with rising interest rates in the mid-2020s,” it said, posing a challenge for governments which have borrowed massively to fund their response to the Covid-19 crisis. “But the underlying trends that have been accelerated by this point to a greener and more tech-based world as we move into the 2030s.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-to-overtake-us-as-world-s-biggest-economy-by-2028-report/story-uXapBHkvj9GqpIRVX6pC8I.html

David Kibbe, a spokesman at the Boston Medical Center, said in a statement on Friday that Dr. Sadrzadeh “felt he was developing an allergic reaction and was allowed to self-administer his personal epi-pen. He was taken to the Emergency Department, evaluated, treated, observed and discharged.

Shortly after the take-off, the pilots received an “engine indication” and “decided to shut down one engine,” an Air Canada spokesman said. “The aircraft then diverted to Tucson, where it landed normally and remains.” The incident took place on December 22.The crew received a left engine hydraulic low pressure indication and declared a PAN PAN emergency before diverting the flight, Belgian aviation news website Aviation24.be reported.“Modern aircraft are designed to operate with one engine and our crews train for such operations”, the Air Canada statement added.

26-12-2020||World||Chinese vaccine CoronaVac efficacy at 50%-90% in Brazilian trials: Official||The CoronaVac Covid-19 vaccine developed by China’s Sinovac Biotech Ltd showed efficacy between 50% and 90% in Brazilian trials, Sao Paulo’s state health secretary said, and its Brazilian producer said full trial results will be released by January 7.Results of trials in Brazil are known exclusively by Sao Paulo state’s Butantan Institute biomedical research center, which has an agreement with Sinovac to produce the vaccine, said health secretary Jean Gorinchteyn. First trials showed efficacy above 50%, the minimum required by Brazilian health regulator Anvisa, and below 90%, Gorinchteyn said in an interview with CBN radio aired late on Thursday.At Sinovac’s request, Sao Paulo’s health department has not received the Chinese drugmaker’s full trial results, he said, adding that the company will review the data before announcing final results.Butantan will disclose the data trial results in up to 15 days, or by January 7, the institute said in a note on Friday.The South American country has registered 7,448,560 confirmed coronavirus cases and 190,488 deaths from Covid-19, the country’s Health ministry said on Friday.On Wednesday, Butantan had declined to specify the efficacy rate from a trial with 13,000 volunteers, citing contractual obligations with Sinovac, raising questions about transparency.The CoronaVac vaccine showed 91.25% efficacy in Turkey, according to an announcement on Thursday of interim data from a late-stage trial in the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinese-vaccine-coronavac-efficacy-at-50-90-in-brazilian-trials-official/story-ep1M1E9ynZ9ZN39fpaG5HI.html
26-12-2020||World||Japan urges Biden to be strong in support of Taiwan against China||A top Japanese defence official on Friday urged US President-elect Joe Biden to “be strong” in supporting Taiwan in the face of an aggressive China, calling the island’s safety a “red line.”“We are concerned China will expand its aggressive stance into areas other than Hong Kong. I think one of the next targets, or what everyone is worried about, is Taiwan,” State Minister of Defense Yasuhide Nakayama told Reuters.In an interview, Nakayama, Japan’s deputy defence minister, urged Biden to take a similar line on Taiwan as outgoing President Donald Trump, who has significantly boosted military sales to the Chinese-claimed island and increased engagement.Japan’s engagement with Taiwan has also flourished in recent years on a largely non-governmental basis. Tokyo maintains a “one China” policy, delicately balancing its relationships with neighbouring giant China and its longtime military ally in Washington.Japan shares strategic interests with Taiwan, which sits in sea lanes through which much of Japan’s energy supplies and trade flow.“So far, I haven’t yet seen a clear policy or an announcement on Taiwan from Joe Biden. I would like to hear it quickly, then we can also prepare our response on Taiwan in accordance,” Nakayama said.During the presidential campaign, Biden called for strengthening ties with Taiwan and other “like-minded democracies.”Decades ago as senator, Biden questioned whether the United States had an “obligation” to defend Taiwan. But many in his foreign policy circles acknowledge that US imperatives have changed as a rising, authoritarian China has become more assertive and sought to shape global institutions.An official in Biden’s transition team said the president-elect believes US support for Taiwan “must remain strong, principled, and bipartisan.”“Once in office, he will continue to support a peaceful resolution of cross-strait issues consistent with the wishes and best interests of the people of Taiwan,” the official said.Beijing has been angered by increased US support for Taiwan, including arms sales and visits to Taipei by senior U.S. officials, further straining already poor Sino-US ties. China considers democratically run Taiwan one of its provinces and has never renounced the use of force to bring it under Beijing’s control.“Taiwan is China’s internal affair,” Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin said on Friday. “We firmly oppose interference in China’s internal affairs by any country or anyone by any means.”In Taipei, Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Joanne Ou noted the strong bipartisan US support for Taiwan based on the “shared language” of freedom and democracy.“Taiwan looks forward to working closely with the Biden team, to continue to steadily improve Taiwan-US relations on the basis of the existing solid friendship,” she said.US officials in Tokyo could not be reached as the embassy was closed for Christmas.“There’s a red line in Asia - China and Taiwan,” Nakayama said, citing a red line that former President Barack Obama declared over Syria’s use of chemical weapons - a line Damascus then crossed. Biden was Obama’s vice president.“How will Joe Biden in the White House react in any case if China crosses this red line?” said Nakayama, who attended a memorial for the late former Taiwanese president Lee Teng-hui in August, before taking his defence position. “The United States is the leader of the democratic countries. I have a strong feeling to say: America, be strong!”Chinese fighter jets in recent months have conducted waves of forays, including crossing the sensitive mid-line between China and Taiwan, ratcheting up pressure tactics to erode Taiwan’s will to resist, say current and former senior Taiwanese and US military officers.Taiwan deployed its navy and air force on Sunday as a Chinese aircraft carrier group led by the country’s newest carrier sailed through the sensitive Taiwan Strait, a day after a U.S. warship transited the same waterway.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/japan-urges-biden-to-be-strong-in-support-of-taiwan-against-china/story-gQkQijzgjxbBg5vqIWDLPO.html
26-12-2020||World||Judge delays execution of only woman on US death row||A federal judge said the Justice Department unlawfully rescheduled the execution of the only woman on federal death row, potentially setting up the Trump administration to schedule the execution after president-elect Joe Biden takes office.US District Court Judge Randolph Moss also vacated an order from the director of the Bureau of Prisons that had set Lisa Montgomery’s execution date for January 12. Montgomery had previously been scheduled to be put to death at the Federal Correctional Complex in Terre Haute, Indiana, this month, but Moss delayed the execution after her attorneys contracted coronavirus visiting their client and asked him to extend the amount of time to file a clemency petition.Moss prohibited the Bureau of Prisons from carrying out Lisa Montgomery’s execution before the end of the year and officials rescheduled her execution date for January 12. But Moss ruled on Wednesday that the agency was also prohibited from rescheduling the date while a stay was in place.“The Court, accordingly, concludes that the Director’s order setting a new execution date while the Court’s stay was in effect was ‘not in accordance with law,’” Moss wrote.A spokesperson for the Justice Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Under the order, the Bureau of Prisons cannot reschedule Montgomery’s execution until at least January 1. Generally, under Justice Department guidelines, a death-row inmate must be notified at least 20 days before the execution. Because of the judge’s order, if the Justice Department chooses to reschedule the date in January, it could mean that the execution would be scheduled after Biden’s inauguration on January 20.A spokesperson for Biden has told The Associated Press the president-elect “opposes the death penalty now and in the future” and would work as president to end its use in office. But Biden’s representatives have not said whether executions would be paused immediately once Biden takes office.Montgomery was convicted of killing 23-year-old Bobbie Jo Stinnett in the northwest Missouri town of Skidmore in December 2004. She used a rope to strangle Stinnett, who was eight months pregnant, and then a kitchen knife to cut the baby girl from the womb, authorities said.Prosecutors said Montgomery removed the baby from Stinnett’s body, took the child with her, and attempted to pass the girl off as her own. Montgomery’s legal team has argued that their client suffers from serious mental illnesses.“Given the severity of Mrs. Montgomery’s mental illness, the sexual and physical torture she endured throughout her life, and the connection between her trauma and the facts of her crime, we appeal to President Trump to grant her mercy, and commute her sentence to life imprisonment,” one of Montgomery’s lawyers, Sandra Babcock, said in a statement.Two other federal inmates are scheduled to be executed in January but have tested positive for coronavirus and their attorneys are also seeking delays to their executions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/judge-delays-execution-of-only-woman-on-us-death-row/story-MMfqjuYsOCvvOe7zkadMUO.html

The man in question arrived from London on Dec. 19. He was currently self-isolating and felt alright, the ministry added.British Health Secretary Matt Hancock had said on Dec. 14 that a spike in Covid cases in the United Kingdom might have been linked to the new variant of the virus in the country.Hancock said more than 1,000 cases of the new variant had been identified, mainly in southeastern England.Countries around the world have in recent days closed their borders to both Britain and South Africa following the identification of cases of the new, fast-spreading variant of the coronavirus in those countries.France registered 20,262 new, confirmed Covid-19 cases and 159 more related deaths in hospitals in the last 24 hours.France’s number of confirmed Covid-19 cases now stands at 2,547,771 while its Covid-19 death toll stands at 62,427 - the seventh-highest in the world.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/first-case-of-new-covid-variant-found-in-france-as-cases-rise/story-o2d8QYR19gL571XMmBkDoJ.html
26-12-2020||World||US requires tests for UK flyers on worry over Covid variant||(Bloomberg) -- The US will require passengers flying from the UK to show proof of a negative test for coronavirus, amid rising concerns over a more-contagious Covid-19 strain that is spreading after first emerging in England.Travellers arriving from the UK need to get a negative polymerase chain reaction or antigen test no more than 72 hours before leaving, according to a statement from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The CDC said the order will be signed by President Donald Trump on Friday and come into effect Dec. 28.Regions from Hong Kong to Canada have temporarily suspended travel from the UK as the new coronavirus variant alarmed scientists and governments around the world. Early analysis suggests it may be as much as 70% more transmissible than other circulating strains.Passengers from the UK must provide written documentation of their test to their airline, according to the CDC statement. Carriers must confirm the negative result for all passengers boarding, and deny entry to those who don’t take a test. The CDC said earlier this week that the new variant described in the UK could already be circulating in the US undetected.Governments around the world are also taking action as a fast-spreading variant sweeps through South Africa, with the UK banning flights from that country. Hong Kong banned all recent travellers from South Africa and extended a mandatory quarantine for most other visitors in an attempt to prevent a spread of Covid-19 cases in the city.South Africa, meanwhile, has pushed back against the UK, rejecting allegations that a new Covid variant was contributing to a second wave of UK infections.A new virus variant that was detected in the UK has a mutation occurring at a site common with the South African strain, known as 501.V2, but they are “two completely independent lineages,” Health Minister Zweli Mkhize said in a statement late Thursday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-requires-tests-for-uk-flyers-on-worry-over-covid-variant/story-OVRDODLkxOhRyVUsezhZZN.html
26-12-2020||World||‘Many just want a hug for Christmas this year,’ says Queen Elizabeth||All many people want for Christmas this year is a simple hug, Britain’s Queen Elizabeth said in her annual festive message, saying it would be hard for those who lost loved ones to Covid-19 pandemic or were separated by curbs on social mixing.In her traditional pre-recorded Christmas Day address to the nation, the 94-year-old monarch repeatedly spoke of hope for the future whilst acknowledging millions of Britons would be unable to have their usual family celebrations this year. “Of course for many, this time of year will be tinged with sadness; some mourning the loss of those dear to them, and others missing friends and family members distanced for safety when all they really want for Christmas is a simple hug or a squeeze of the hand,” Elizabeth said. “If you are among them, you are not alone. And let me assure you of my thoughts and prayers.” The queen herself has had to eschew her traditional Christmas celebrations, and is spending the festive season quietly at Windsor Castle with her husband Prince Philip, 99.Usually, all the Windsors gather at her home on the Sandringham estate in eastern England, the walk to a nearby church for a Christmas Day service is a staple of the royal calendar.However, Britain is currently battling to curb the spread of a new variant of the novel coronavirus, with the number of new infections reaching record levels this week and the number of hospital admissions and death soaring.Much of the country has been placed under tight restrictions, and for London and the surrounding areas, households are not allowed to mix at all over Christmas, while for other areas there are strict curbs limiting contact to just a single day.“Remarkably, a year that has necessarily kept people apart has in many ways brought us closer,” said the queen, adding the royals had been inspired by stories of those who volunteered to help others in need.“In the United Kingdom and around the world, people have risen magnificently to the challenges of the year and I’m so proud and moved by this quiet indomitable spirit.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/many-just-want-a-hug-for-christmas-this-year-says-queen-elizabeth/story-dc3fp5fVLnD0xo3j0FAjhN.html

The apology came after his secretary was on Thursday summarily indicted over the issue and fined 1 million yen ($9,650).“Even though the accounting procedures happened without my knowledge, I feel morally responsible for what happened,” Abe told a parliamentary committee. “I reflect on this deeply and apologise from my heart to the citizens and to all lawmakers.”Abe also filed corrected political funding reports for the last three years.The public apology marks a sharp reversal of fortune for Abe, a political blue-bloods whose grandfather and great-uncle also served as premiers.

Suga, who has been beset by other controversies and seen his support ratings slide less than a year before the next lower house election must be called, has apologised for making inaccurate statements.Abe did not respond to questions from opposition MPs about whether he would take political responsibility for the scandal by resigning as an MP. He struggled to explain why he was able to file detailed updated funding reports even though he says his office does not have the underlying receipts for the parties.Abe’s statements to parliament from the end of 2019 contradicted the findings of the prosecutors at least 118 times, several domestic media reported, citing a parliamentary research bureau.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/japan-ex-pm-shinzo-abe-apologises-for-making-repeated-false-denials-in-parliament-on-funding-scandal/story-h6PUjyruwMucHNwpZZQFdL.html
26-12-2020||World||Human remains found near Nashville explosion: Report||Two law enforcement officials tell The Associated Press that authorities have found human remains in the vicinity of the explosion that rocked downtown Nashville early Christmas morning.It is unclear how the remains are related to the Friday explosion or whether they might belong to the person believed to be responsible or a victim.The officials could not discuss an ongoing investigation publicly and spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity.Authorities have said they believe the blast was intentional.The city’s police chief said officers responded to a report of a shots fired before discovering the RV that was blaring a recorded warning that a bomb would detonate in 15 minutes. Police evacuated nearby buildings and called in the bomb squad. The RV exploded shortly afterward.THIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE. AP’s earlier story follows below.NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) — A recreational vehicle parked in the deserted streets of downtown Nashville exploded early Christmas morning, causing widespread communications outages that took down police emergency systems and grounded holiday travel at the city’s airport. Authorities said they believe the blast was intentional.Police were responding to a report of shots fired Friday when they encountered the RV blaring a recorded warning that a bomb would detonate in 15 minutes, Metro Nashville Police Chief John Drake said. Police evacuated nearby buildings and called in the bomb squad. The RV exploded shortly afterward, Drake said at a midday news conference.“It looks like a bomb went off on Second Avenue,” Nashville Mayor John Cooper said after touring the area.Police did not immediately indicate a possible motive or the target.Surveillance video published on a Twitter account Friday that appeared to be across the street from the blast captured the warning issuing from the RV, “... if you can hear this message, evacuate now,” seconds before the explosion.The blast sent black smoke and flames billowing from the heart of downtown Nashville’s tourist scene, an area packed with honky-tonks, restaurants and shops. Buildings shook and windows shattered streets away from the explosion near a building owned by AT&T that lies one block from the company’s office tower, a landmark in downtown.“We do not know if that was a coincidence, or if that was the intention,” police spokesman Don Aaron said. Aaron said earlier that some people were taken to the department’s central precinct for questioning but declined to give details.AT&T said the affected building is the central office of a telephone exchange, with network equipment in it. The blast interrupted service, but the company declined to say how widespread outages were.“Service for some customers in Nashville and the surrounding areas may be affected by damage to our facilities from the explosion this morning. We are in contact with law enforcement and working as quickly and safely as possible to restore service,” AT&T spokesman Jim Greer said in an emailed statement.The AT&T outages site showed service issues in middle Tennessee and Kentucky, including Bowling Green about 65 miles (105 kilometers) north of Nashville. Several police agencies reported that their 911 systems were down because of the outage, including Murfreesboro and Knox County, home to Knoxville about 180 miles (290 kilometers) east of Nashville.The Federal Aviation Administration temporarily halted flights out of Nashville International Airport because of telecommunications issues associated with the explosion.Three people were taken to area hospitals for treatment after the blast, although none were in critical condition, Aaron said. Authorities don’t know whether anyone was in the vehicle when it exploded. Cooper said the city was lucky that the number of injuries was limited.The FBI will be taking the lead in the investigation, agency spokesman Joel Siskovic said. Federal investigators from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives were also on the scene. The FBI is the primary law enforcement agency responsible for investigating federal crimes, such as explosives violations and acts of terrorism.A Philadelphia man staying in a nearby hotel said that when he heard the blast, he was knew it wasn’t harmless.“We tried to rationalize it that it was an earthquake or something, but it was obvious it wasn’t an earthquake,” Joseph Fafara said. He said he traveled to Tennessee with his family on Christmas because the state has looser COVID-19 restrictions than Philadelphia.When he went to look at the damage, police barricades had already been put in place. At noon, police dogs continued to search cars and buildings in the nearby area.Buck McCoy, who lives near the area, posted videos on Facebook that show water pouring down the ceiling of his home. Alarms blare in the background along with cries of people in distress. A fire is visible in the street outside.McCoy said he heard gunfire 15 minutes before the explosion rocked his building, set cars in the street on fire and blew trees apart.“All my windows, every single one of them got blown into the next room. If I had been standing there it would have been horrible,” he said.“It felt like a bomb. It was that big,” he told The Associated Press.President Donald Trump has been briefed, according to White House spokesperson Judd Deere. The U.S. Justice Department said Acting Attorney General Jeff Rosen was also briefed and directed all department resources be made available to help with the investigation.Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee said on Twitter that the state would provide the resources necessary “to determine what happened and who was responsible.”The American Red Cross of Tennessee announced that it was working with officials to open a shelter for victims.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/human-remains-found-near-nashville-explosion-report/story-DhMpdOYJdrVNlgCOifaBsN.html
26-12-2020||World||Don’t squander sacrifices of 2020: WHO chief||The sacrifices made to protect people during the coronavirus pandemic must not be squandered over the festive period, the World Health Organization’s chief said in a Christmas message.Millions were making “heart-wrenching sacrifices” by staying away from loved ones on Christmas Day, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said in a video clip posted to Twitter late Thursday, while others will have a missing face at the family table.He said vaccines, now beginning to be deployed in countries around the world, were starting to offer a way out of the crisis that has engulfed the planet this year.“As 2020 draws to an end, a pandemic of historic proportions is preventing many of us from celebrating in the ways we would like,” Tedros said.“Instead, hundreds of millions of people are today making great, heart-wrenching sacrifices by staying apart to stay safe.“But in doing so, they are giving the most precious gifts: the gifts of life and health.”The novel coronavirus has killed at least 1.7 million people since the outbreak emerged in China last December, while almost 78.7 million cases have been registered, according to a tally from official sources compiled by AFP.“All around the world, throughout this most trying of years, we have seen over and over again the sacrifices of so many people to protect and preserve life,” said Tedros.“We must not squander their sacrifices, nor those made by so many families who, this holiday season, will sit at family tables missing a familiar face.“Despite so much loss, we have built so much hope. Vaccines are offering the world a way out of this tragedy. But it will take time for the whole world to be vaccinated.”According to the WHO’s overview of different candidate vaccines, 61 have entered human trials, 16 of which have reached final-stage mass testing.A further 172 candidate vaccines are being developed in laboratories with a view to eventual human testing.Tedros said: “We must continue taking comfort in the fact that by caring for others, through acts of solidarity and safety, we can share the greatest gift of all: the gift of life.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/don-t-squander-sacrifices-of-2020-who-chief/story-hcUcUPtvXvLiml7vHRTL1O.html
26-12-2020||World||US will require negative Covid-19 tests for all UK passengers||The US government will require all airline passengers arriving from the United Kingdom to test negative for Covid-19 within 72 hours of departure starting Monday amid concerns about a new coronavirus variant that may be more transmissible.The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said in a statement that all airline passengers arriving from the UK must test negative in order to fly to the United States. The decision was a turnaround after the Trump administration told US airlines on Tuesday it was not planning to require any testing for arriving UK passengers. The decision follows the emergence of a highly infectious new coronavirus variant in Britain that has prompted many countries to shut their borders to travelers from there.The British Embassy in Washington did not immediately respond to a request for comment late on Thursday.Earlier on Thursday, United Airlines and Delta Air Lines said they were requiring all passengers on flights from the United Kingdom to the United States to present a negative Covid-19 test taken within 72 hours of departure.The CDC said late on Thursday passengers must test negative via either a PCR or Antigen test. The CDC said “viruses constantly change through mutation, and preliminary analysis in the UK suggests that this new variant may be up to 70% more transmissible than previously circulating variants.”The CDC noted that in March President Donald Trump suspended entry of nearly all foreign nationals who visited the United Kingdom in the past 14 days, which has reduced air travel to the US from Britain by about 90%.Under the new policy, passengers departing from the UK for the United States must provide written documentation of their laboratory test result (in hard copy or electronic) to the airline, the CDC said. Airlines must confirm negative test results for all passengers before they board. If passengers choose not to take a test, the airline must deny boarding.The CDC said the order will be signed on Friday and is effective Monday.Delta’s policy, expanded from its decision on Monday to require the screenings on UK flights to New York’s JFK Airport, is effective Dec. 24, while United’s requirement begins Dec. 28.On Monday, the three airlines that fly from London to JFK Delta, British Airways and Virgin Atlantic - agreed to a request from New York Governor Andrew Cuomo that they screen passengers from Britain.US airlines have already drastically scaled back flying to the United Kingdom, as well as the rest of Europe.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-will-require-negative-covid-19-tests-for-all-uk-passengers/story-wufc4dJFqvxXOKikGOYf5L.html
