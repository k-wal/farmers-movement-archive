And light does more than create a festive mood - light brings hope. For Christians, Jesus is ‘the light of the world’, but we can’t celebrate his birth today in quite the usual way.“People of all faiths have been unable to gather as they would wish for their festivals, such as Passover, Easter, Eid and Vaisakhi. But we need life to go on. Last month, fireworks lit up the sky around Windsor, as Hindus, Sikhs and Jains celebrated Diwali, the festival of lights, providing joyous moments of hope and unity - despite social distancing.”The queen, 94, Prince Philip, 99, and other members of the British royal usually spend Christmas in the country retreat of Sandringham, Norfolk, but the royal couple has been living in Windsor and will not visit other family members due to Covid-19 restrictions.Across the Commonwealth, she said stories of people volunteering in communities had inspired her and her family. Paying tributes to nurses, the youth and others who rose to the challenges of the year, she said, “There is hope in the new dawn.”She said, “Of course, for many, this time of the year will be tinged with sadness: some mourning the loss of those dear to them, and others missing friends and family-members distanced for safety, when all they’d really want for Christmas is a simple hug or a squeeze of the hand.“If you are among them, you are not alone, and let me assure you of my thoughts and prayers,” she added, wishing people “a very happy Christmas”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/queen-elizabeth-hails-diwali-in-christmas-message/story-Xz6g6eLdi1LtzFiTWAab8K.html
25-12-2020||World||Japan confirms cases of new coronavirus variant||Japan’s health ministry has confirmed the country’s first cases of infection with the new variant of the coronavirus that was identified in Britain.The five people arrived between December 18 and December 21, before Japan stepped up border control on Friday for entrants from Britain. A man in his 60s developed fatigue, but the other four were without symptoms.Health Minister Norihisa Tamura said the five were sent to quarantine straight from the airports.After they tested positive for the virus, further analysis conducted at the National Institute of Infectious Diseases determined they had the British variant that is 70 per cent more transmissible, the ministry said in a statement.Shigeru Omi, head of a government taskforce, called for tighter border control to prevent new variants.

25-12-2020||World||UK deploys soldiers to clear backlog of truck drivers as France closes border||Around 1,000 British soldiers were spending Christmas Day trying to clear a huge backlog of truck drivers stuck in southeast England after France briefly closed its border to the U.K., then demanded coronavirus tests from all amid fears of a new, apparently more contagious, virus variant.Even though an estimated 4,000 or so international truck drivers are spending yet another day cooped up in their cabs, some progress was evident Friday, with traffic around the English Channel port of Dover moving in an orderly fashion towards the extra ferries that were put on to make the short crossing across to Calais in northern France. Rail operator Eurotunnel was also back in action, offering a way back into France.The military personnel were directing traffic and helping a mass testing program for the drivers, who must test negative to enter France. French firefighters have also been drafted to help the military test drivers for coronavirus. Poland’s Territorial Defense Force also sent reinforcements to help with testing and food distribution.British Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said he had instructed the army to take control of testing as part of efforts to get “foreign hauliers home with their families as quickly as we can.”Officials from the transport department have said that all but three of the tests conducted so far have been negative. Those testing positive are being offered accommodation. Most of the testing is being conducted at a disused airfield at Manston Airport, 20 miles (33 kilometers) from Dover.France closed its border for 48 hours to the U.K. last Sunday after British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said a variant of the virus that is 70% more transmissible is driving the rapid spread of infections in London and surrounding areas. As a result, the capital and many other parts of England have seen lockdown restrictions tightened and family holiday gatherings canceled.Free food and drink was being sent to the stranded truck drivers and more than 250 portable toilets were put in at Manston, with 32 others placed along the gridlocked M20 highway. Britain’s coast guard said its teams in the Dover area had so far delivered 3,000 hot meals, 600 pizzas and 2,985 packed lunches.“The most reassuring thing is that food is getting through at Manston, and I have to say a big thank you to everyone who volunteered to help drivers stick it out in cold conditions in the days leading up to Christmas,” said Duncan Buchanan of Britain’s Road Haulage Association.The mood among the stranded drivers appeared to be mostly sanguine, especially compared to their anger earlier this week at the situation and the lack of facilities.The virus has been blamed for over 1.7 million confirmed deaths worldwide, including nearly 70,000 in Britain, the second-highest death toll in Europe behind Italy.On Saturday, Britain is extending tighter lockdown restrictions to more areas as authorities try to stem the spread of the new variant. Over the past two days, the U.K. has recorded its two highest daily infection numbers, at just below 40,000. That is stoking fears that the country’s beloved National Health Service will face acute capacity issues in its hospitals soon and thousands more people will die from the virus.In a video message to the nation, Johnson said this Christmas was “not about presents, or turkey, or brandy butter” but about hope, in the form of coronavirus vaccine shots being delivered and more vaccines being developed.“We know there will be people alive next Christmas, people we love, alive next Christmas precisely because we made the sacrifice and didn’t celebrate as normal this Christmas,” the prime minister said.Johnson said Thursday that more than 800,000 people in Britain have received the first dose of the vaccine developed by American pharmaceutical firm Pfizer and German biotechnology company BioNTech. The U.K. was the first country in the world to approve the vaccine and began inoculations for health workers and those over 80 on Dec. 8.___Follow AP coverage of the coronavirus pandemic at https://apnews.com/hub/coronavirus-pandemic and https://apnews.com/hub/coronavirus-vaccines and https://apnews.com/UnderstandingtheOutbreak||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-deploys-soldiers-to-clear-backlog-of-truck-drivers-as-france-closes-border/story-EstY1dNEb7DbbqsGSIDepK.html

Authorities said they believed the blast was intentional. The FBI is leading the investigation.Police spokesman Don Aaron said the 6:30 a.m. explosion was believed to be “an intentional act.” Police earlier said they believe a vehicle was involved in the explosion. Aaron said three people were taken to area hospitals for treatment, although none were in critical condition.The FBI will be taking the lead in the investigation, said spokesman Joel Siskovic. Federal investigators from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives were also on the scene. The FBI is the primary law enforcement agency responsible for investigating federal crimes, such as explosives violations and acts of terrorism. Investigators from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives were also on the scene.Black smoke and flames were seen early Friday billowing from the area, which is packed with bars, restaurants and other retail establishments and is known as the heart of downtown Nashville’s tourist scene.Buildings shook in the immediate area and beyond after a loud boom was heard.Buck McCoy, who lives near the area, posted videos on Facebook that show water pouring down the ceiling of his home. Alarms blare in the background and cries of people in great distress ring in the background. A fire is visible in the street outside. McCoy said the windows of his home were entirely blown out.“All my windows, every single one of them got blown into the next room. If I had been standing there it would have been horrible,” he said.“It felt like a bomb. It was that big,” he told The Associated Press.“There were about four cars on fire. I don’t know if it was so hot they just caught on fire, and the trees were all blown apart,” he said.Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee said on Twitter that the state would provide the resources necessary “to determine what happened and who was responsible. Please join @MariaLeeTN and me in praying for those who were injured and we thank all of our first responders who acted so quickly this morning.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/explosion-in-nashville-believed-to-be-intentional-says-police/story-EQDuBWbiTaCzXEhUBclc9O.html
25-12-2020||World||Men charged in Daniel Pearl’s murder case to be released on Saturday, says lawyer||British-born al-Qaeda leader Ahmed Omar Saeed Sheikh and his three aides, whose release in the abduction and murder case of US journalist Daniel Pearl was ordered by a court here, would walk out of the prison on Saturday, police and lawyer said on Friday.In a surprise move, a two-judge bench of the Sindh High Court on Thursday directed security agencies not to keep Sheikh and other accused under “any sort of detention” and declared all notifications of the Sindh government related to their detention “null and void”.The court observed that the four men’s detention was “illegal”. According to the Jail Superintendent, the four men could not be released from Karachi’s Central Jail on Thursday as the prison authorities received orders from the Sindh High Court for their release very late.The legal counsel for the four men said that they would now be released on Saturday as Friday is a public holiday in the country.Meanwhile, the United States on Friday expressed “deep concern” over Sindh High Court’s order to release Sheikh and his aides and said it will continue to monitor any developments in the case.“We are deeply concerned by the reports of the December 24 ruling of Sindh High Court to release multiple terrorists responsible for the murder of Daniel Pearl. We have been assured that the accused have not been released at this time,” the US State Department said in a tweet.It said that the US will continue to monitor any developments in the case and will continue to support the Pearl family “through this extremely difficult process” while honouring the legacy of Pearl as a “courageous journalist”.The US has been mounting pressure on Pakistan, demanding justice for Pearl.Ruth and Judea Pearl - the parents of Pearl - condemned the decision made by the Sindh High court and expressed full confidence in the Supreme Court of Pakistan to provide justice for their son and reinforce the paramount of the freedom of the press, the Express Tribune reported.“We refuse to believe that the Pakistani government and the Pakistani people will let such a travesty of justice tarnish the image and legacy of Pakistan,” they said in a statement.In April, a two-judge Sindh High Court bench commuted the death sentence of 46-year-old Sheikh to seven years imprisonment. The court also acquitted his three aides who were serving life terms in the case – almost two decades after they were found guilty and jailed.However, the Sindh government refused to release them and kept them in detention under the Maintenance of Public Order. Their continuous detention was challenged in the Sindh High Court, which ordered their release. However, it asked authorities to place their names on the no-fly list so that they could not leave the country. It also directed them to appear before the court whenever summoned. Pearl, the 38-year-old South Asia bureau chief for The Wall Street Journal, was abducted and beheaded while he was in Pakistan investigating a story in 2002 on the links between the country’s powerful spy agency ISI and al-Qaeda.A three-judge apex court bench headed by Justice Mushir Alam is hearing the appeal by the Sindh government and the family of the slain journalist against the acquittal of Sheikh. Pearl’s murder took place three years after Sheikh, along with Jaish-e-Mohammad chief Masood Azhar and Mushtaq Ahmed Zargar, was released by India in 1999 and given safe passage to Afghanistan in exchange for the nearly 150 passengers of hijacked Indian Airlines Flight 814.He was serving a prison term in India for kidnappings of Western tourists in the country.

25-12-2020||World||European Union assesses Brexit trade deal with UK||Ambassadors from the European Union’s 27 nations convened on Christmas Day to start assessing the free trade deal the bloc has struck with former member Britain, a historic accord that takes effect in just a week.At Friday’s exceptional meeting, the EU delegations asked for more time to study the texts before sending them to lawmakers at the European Parliament, according to an EU diplomat. The ambassadors are expected to meet again on Monday.British Prime Minister Boris Johnson hailed Thursday’s agreement as a “new beginning” for the U.K. in its relationship with its European neighbors.In a Christmas message, Johnson sought to sell the deal to a weary public after years of Brexit-related wrangling since the U.K. voted narrowly to leave the EU in 2016. Although the U.K. formally left the bloc on Jan. 31, it remains in a transition period tied to EU rules until the end of this year.Without a trade deal to set out the terms of their new relationship, tariffs and other impediments would have been imposed on trade between the two sides starting Jan. 1. Both sides would have suffered economically from a failure to secure a trade deal, with the British economy taking a bigger hit at least in the near-term, as it is more reliant on trade with the EU than vice versa.“I have a small present for anyone who may be looking for something to read in that sleepy post-Christmas lunch moment, and here it is, tidings, glad tidings of great joy, because this is a deal,” Johnson said in his video message, brandishing a sheaf of papers.“A deal to give certainty to business, travelers and all investors in our country from Jan. 1. A deal with our friends and partners in the EU,” he said.Both sides claim the 2,000-page agreement protects their cherished goals. Britain said it gives the U.K. control over its money, borders, laws and fishing grounds. The EU says it protects the EU’s single market and contains safeguards to ensure that Britain does not unfairly undercut the bloc’s standards.Under the deal, there will be no tariffs or quotas on trade between the two sides, though there will be more red tape for businesses because the U.K. is leaving the EU’s frictionless single market and customs union. Firms will have to file forms and customs declarations for the first time in years. There will also be different rules on product labeling as well as checks on agricultural products.“The principle is not business as usual. There will be a lot of changes starting next week,” Barnier said on France-2 television Thursday night.EU leaders voiced their sadness at the rupture with Britain but were relieved that the tortuous aftermath of the Brexit vote had come to a conclusion. They are unanimously expected to back the agreement as are lawmakers from the European Parliament who can only give their consent next month retrospectively as they have already broken up for Christmas.Yet some British fishermen were disappointed.“In the end, it was clear that Boris Johnson wanted an overall trade deal and was willing to sacrifice fishing,” said Barrie Deas, chief executive of the National Federation of Fishermen’s Organizations.Under the terms of the deal, the EU will give up a quarter of the quota it catches in U.K. waters, far less than the 80% Britain initially demanded. The system will be phased in over 5 1/2 years, after which the quotas will be reassessed.The French government, which had fought hard for fishing access, announced aid for its fishing industry to help deal with the smaller quota, but insisted that the deal protects French interests.The president of the French ports of Calais and Boulogne-sur-Mer, Jean-Marc Puissesseau, said no matter what is in the Brexit trade deal, life for his port will become more difficult because “there will no longer be free movement of merchandise.”Some 10,000 jobs in the Boulogne area are tied to fishing and its seafood-processing industry, he said, and about 70% of the seafood they use comes from British waters.“Without fish, there is no business,” he told The Associated Press.___Angela Charlton in Paris contributed.___Follow all AP stories on the Brexit trade talks at https://apnews.com/Brexit||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/european-union-assesses-brexit-trade-deal-with-uk/story-weBPBgsnvzNI9KQyNbyy9I.html
25-12-2020||World||Japan’s PM Suga urges citizens to have a quiet and distanced New Year||Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga urged the nation on Friday to spend a quiet New Year period without the usual social gatherings to prevent the spread of Covid-19, which has been breaking infection records almost on a daily basis.Suga also announced a package of $2.6 billion for hospitals treating Covid-19 patients which have come under strain due to the rapid rise in cases across the northern island of Hokkaido as well as large cities like Tokyo and Osaka.“I want you to spend a quiet New Year,” the premier told a news conference in Tokyo with the government’s leading coronavirus expert Shigeru Omi. “The infections aren’t coming down and if we keep going like this, we won’t be able to avoid further spread of the virus.”The country confirmed its first cases of the new, faster- spreading variant of the virus, in two citizens who had arrived from the United Kingdom, domestic media reported late on Friday.Japan has banned entry from United Kingdom, with the exception of returning Japanese nationals and those with residence permits. Japan does not celebrate Christmas, but the New Year period is an extended national holiday, with many people usually travelling back to their hometowns and spending time with family and friends.Omi warned that it was critical that “all citizens move in the same direction,” to get a grip on the health crisis.“If we don’t bring infections down now, once they surge again after the New Year period it won’t be easy to change the downward trend,” he said. “It would take time, and would probably be impossible to control over a period of weeks,” he said.Omi said shared meals were a major cause of infections and called on people to refrain from holding large gatherings and to limit meals to four people one regularly ate with, or fewer.While Japan has avoided the huge infection numbers seen in other parts of the world, the number of new daily cases surpassed 3,000 for the first time this month. Tokyo reported 884 infections on Friday, near Thursday’s record 888.HOSPITALS, VACCINESUnderscoring the strain on the hospitals, five national groups of doctors and other medical workers made an emergency request to Suga on Friday, asking for strong anti-pandemic measures and support for the medical sector.With hospitals equipped for treating Covid-19 filling up, other hospitals are being forced to accept patients with the disease, according to Tsuyoshi Masuda, president of the Japan Federation of Democratic Medical Institutions.“These small and medium-sized hospitals, which have been supporting medical services in their respective regions, are facing a crisis that is threatening their survival,” Masuda told reporters at a separate news conference on Friday.He also warned that the risk of in-hospital infections was high at institutions not specialized in dealing with infectious diseases.Japan, with a population of 126 million, has struck deals to buy 290 million vaccine doses from Pfizer Inc, AstraZeneca Plc and Moderna Inc, or enough for 145 million people.A health ministry panel said that people aged 65 or older should get priority for vaccination against Covid-19, as well as frontline healthcare workers and people with underlying medical conditions.It specified chronic heart disease, chronic respiratory disease and chronic kidney disease, among others, as underlying conditions that should determine priority.The panel’s recommendations would mean 36 million elderly people and 8.2 million people with medical conditions would be the first to receive shots.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/japan-s-pm-suga-urges-citizens-to-have-a-quiet-and-distanced-new-year/story-Kf1ETdDY0jg8gv9qpVdA5K.html
25-12-2020||World||South Africa rejects UK claims over new coronavirus variant||South Africa’s government rejected allegations that a new variant of the coronavirus found in the country has contributed to a second wave of infections in the UK and criticized its decision to impose travel restrictions.A new virus variant that was detected in the UK has a mutation occurring at a site common with the South African strain, known as 501.V2, but they are “two completely independent lineages,” Health Minister Zweli Mkhize said in a statement late Thursday. There’s no evidence that 501.V2 causes more severe disease or increased mortality than any other variant that’s been sequenced around the world, he said.Mkhize’s comments came a day after UK Health Secretary Matt Hancock announced that flights from South Africa will be banned and that anyone who’s been there in the past two weeks must quarantine immediately. Several other countries have also halted flights from South Africa.The new UK strain was identified about a month before the South African variant appeared to have developed, Mkhize said, citing ongoing research by the Network for Genomic Surveillance in South Africa, which was launched in June. He described Hancock’s announcement as “unfortunate.”“It is the widely shared view of the scientific community that, given the current circumstantial evidence, the risks of travel bans may outweigh the benefits, and that it is possible to contain the variants while sustaining international travel,” Mkhize said. “We, therefore, maintain that non-pharmaceutical interventions and strict containment measures remain most important to reduce the risk of transmission.”Coronavirus infections in South Africa have surged since the government eased most restrictions several months ago, and a second wave is now coinciding with the summer holidays. The Health Ministry registered a record 14,305 new cases on Thursday, bringing the cumulative total to 968,563.Experts in South Africa lead the field of genomics surveillance alongside those from institutions in Australia, Denmark, the Netherlands and the UK, and have shared all information on the evolution of the coronavirus with the World Health Organization, Mkhize said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/south-africa-rejects-uk-claims-over-new-coronavirus-variant/story-EKYgU0IcJlJsAsr9S1rgCK.html
25-12-2020||World||Indian sailors stranded due to Covid measures, not standoff, says China||China on Friday said there was no link between the situation of the Indian sailors on two cargo ships carrying Australian coal stranded at Chinese ports and the current state of ties between the countries.The Chinese foreign ministry said the two vessels were stuck at the ports because of quarantine measures in place due to the Covid-19 pandemic.As many as 39 Indian seafarers on two cargo vessels - MV Jag Anand and MV Anastasia -- have been stranded in waters off the Chinese ports of Jingtang and Caofeidian in the northern province of Hebei for several months.The ships have not been allowed to discharge their cargo, and the crew have not been allowed to disembark either, impacting their mental and physical health, according to reports.India’s external affairs ministry had questioned the Chinese authorities’ decision to not allow the ships to leave the ports.“We understand that some other ships, which arrived after the Indian ships arrived, have actually managed to discharge cargo and leave. The reasons for this are not clear,” external affairs ministry spokesperson Anurag Srivastava said at a news briefing.Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson, Wang Wenbin, on Friday responded to a question on whether the ships and its crew were stuck because of currently sour ties involving China and India and Australia over military and trade disputes.“We stated repeatedly that China has clear stipulations on quarantine measures. Concerning this, China has stayed in close communication with the Indian side and [has been] responding to their requests as well as providing necessary assistance to them,” Wang said at a ministry briefing on Friday.“As far as I understand, China allows the crew change while meeting certain quarantine conditions,” he said.“But this Jingtang port (where the ship Jag Anand is stranded) is not in the list for such crew changes… As to whether this has anything to do with the bilateral relations, I don’t see any link,” Wang said.There are 23 Indian crew members on the bulk cargo vessel MV Jag Anand, in anchorage near Jingtang port in Hebei province since June 13. Another 16 Indian crew members were on the MV Anastasia, in anchorage near Caofeidian port since September 20. Both vessels are waiting to discharge cargo.A report by ANI in November had said the 23 Indian crew members on board were seeking help from the Indian government to return home, and some are suffering from health issues and the ship is running short of medicines, the report said.“Our embassy in Beijing has been in constant touch with provincial and central government authorities in China, requesting that the ships be allowed to dock and/or the crew be allowed to be changed,” Srivastava had said on Thursday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/indian-sailors-stranded-due-to-covid-measures-not-standoff-says-china/story-LPBTCagB9vJOXVmMU3izRO.html
25-12-2020||World||Nepal’s Supreme Court issues show-cause notice to Oli govt over Parliament dissolution||Nepal’s Supreme Court on Friday issued a show-cause notice to Prime Minister K P Sharma Oli-led government, asking it to furnish a written clarification over its decision to abruptly dissolve Parliament. The notice was issued after a preliminary hearing at the five-member Constitutional bench headed by Chief Justice Cholendra Shumsher Rana on the writ petitions filed against the government’s decision to dissolve the 275-member House of Representatives, My Republica newspaper reported. The bench sought the written clarification from the Office of the Prime Minister and Council of Minister and Office of the President as they are made defendants in all the writ petitions, it said. The court has also asked the government to furnish an original copy of the recommendations made by the government to dissolve the House and the decision made by President Bidya Devi Bhandari to authenticate the government’s recommendations. The five-member bench comprises justices Bishwambhar Prasad Shrestha, Tej Bahadur KC, Anil Kumar Sinha and Hari Krishna Karki. On Wednesday, Chief Justice Rana’s single bench forwarded all writ petitions to the Constitutional bench. Altogether 13 writ petitions have been registered at the apex court challenging the government’s decision to dissolve Parliament. Meanwhile, Prime Minister Oli has called a Cabinet meeting on Friday evening, amid an intensified struggle between the two warring factions of the ruling Nepal Communist Party to wrest control of the party. Oli is likely to reshuffle the Cabinet following the resignation of seven ministers close to the Prachanda-led faction, the paper said, citing a source familiar with the Prime Minister’s Office. The Oli-led Cabinet now has 18 members including ministers and ministers of state. On Thursday, Chinese ambassador Hou Yanqi met Nepal Communist Party’s executive chairman Pushpa Kamal Dahal ‘Prachanda’, who claims control over the ruling party after removing Prime Minister Oli from the posts of the party’s parliamentary leader and chair. In a meeting of the Central Committee members close to him on Thursday, Oli announced the removal of Prachanda from the post of the party’s Executive Chairman. Earlier, the Prachanda-led faction of the ruling party elected him as the new parliamentary leader, replacing Prime Minister Oli. Nepal plunged into a political crisis after President Bhandari dissolved the House of Representatives and announced dates for mid-term elections at the recommendation of Prime Minister Oli on Sunday, sparking protests from a section of the ruling party and various opposition parties, including Nepali Congress. The ruling party has now been virtually divided more than two years after it was formed following the merger of CPN-UML led by 68-year-old Oli and CPN-Maoist Centre led by 66-year-old Prachanda in May 2018. Both factions of the party have intensified efforts to retain official party recognition along with the election symbol. The two factions are now busy making strategies to wrest control of the party.

Few others have signed agreements for vaccine delivery while some are still in the process of testing candidates.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageAs the fight against the pandemic reaches a crucial stage, here’s where different countries stand with regards to their vaccination drives:1. In India, the Union ministry of health and family welfare (MoHFW) said on Friday it has planned a two-day dry run in four states of Andhra Pradesh, Assam, Gujarat and Punjab next week. The dry run will take place on December 28 and 29, and will include necessary data entry in Co-WIN, an online platform for monitoring of vaccine delivery, the ministry said.2. Ireland on Friday said that it had approved the Pfizer-BioNTech SE vaccine, with health minister Stephen Donnelly announcing that the first batch of vaccines is expected to arrive on December 26. Donnelly further said that the vaccination drive will begin next Wednesday.3. The British government on Thursday said that more than 600,000 people have been vaccinated since immunisation drive began on December 8. Till December 20, the government said, 616,933 people had been vaccinated against Covid-19. The United Kingdom was the world’s first country to start a full-fledged vaccination drive, having approved the Pfizer-BioNTech SE vaccine earlier this month.4. Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau tweeted on Thursday that the country had received the first batch of Moderna’s Covid-19 vaccine, just a day after approving it. These, Trudeau said, were a part of the 168,000 doses that Canada will get from Moderna before the end of the month, as well as part of the total 40 million doses guaranteed to it by the American drug maker. Canada has already started the vaccination drive of Pfizer’s candidate.5. Mexico and Chile on Thursday joined the list of countries which have started vaccination drives. Both countries have approved the Pfizer-BioNTech SE vaccine. 59-year-old Maria Irene Ramirez and 46-year-old Zulema Riquelme became the first citizens in Mexico and Chile respectively to receive a vaccine shot.6. Turkey on Thursday said that late-stage trials of a vaccine developed by China’s Sinovac Biotech had shown that it was 91.25% effective. Researchers said that during the trials, no major side effects were seen, except for a case of an allergic reaction. On Wednesday, the same candidate was found to be more than 50% effective in Phase 3 trials in Brazil.7.

Those tests are relatively independent from each other and conducted according to different protocols, rather than subject to unified norms that typically govern such trials, said the person, who asked not to be identified because the data isn’t public.Researchers in Brazil earlier this week delayed releasing complete information on Sinovac’s vaccine, saying only that it was found to be more than 50% effective. Sao Paulo state Health Secretary Jean Gorinchteyn offered more specific guidance on Thursday, saying the vaccine “didn’t reach 90%” efficacy, which would make it less successful than those developed by Pfizer Inc. and Moderna Inc.“We don’t know how much more than 50% it was, whether it was 60%, 70% or 80%, but it’s at levels that allow us to reduce the impact of the disease on our population,” Gorinchteyn said in an interview with Brazil’s CBN Radio. “We knew that the effectiveness would never reach 90%.”Turkey TrialAdding to the confusion, Turkey said a trial of Sinovac’s vaccine taking place in its country showed an estimated efficacy rate of 91.25%. That trial, however, is based on only 29 cases, which is considered insufficient to draw a definitive conclusion on the shot’s effectiveness, according to the person familiar with the trials. The trial will continue to collect Covid-19 cases to get a more finalized reading, the person said.A Sinovac spokesman declined to comment on questions about the vaccine’s efficacy.The delay in the announcement of definitive results has created confusion over the effectiveness of Sinovac’s shot. Chinese developers have been slow compared with their western peers in releasing efficacy data, risking an erosion of confidence in these candidates as the world puts a laser focus on which vaccines are most successful in fighting the pandemic.Pfizer and Moderna’s shots, meanwhile, have been shown to reduce symptomatic cases by well over 90%.The reason Brazil hasn’t yet disclosed complete efficacy numbers is because Sinovac and its partners are reviewing all the Covid-19 cases found among participants, the person said. The Brazil trial has yielded more than 170 cases, but Sinovac needs to verify them to see whether they all meet the criteria set out by the Chinese drug regulator.Regulators from China and Brazil, as well as Sinovac and its partners are still in the process of analyzing data from the Brazil trial, according to the person. Ultimately, Sinovac hopes to see unified standards to ensure equal comparisons across different trial sites, the person said. The protocol for the Brazil trial says Covid-19 cases are diagnosed in line with guidance from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.The late-stage trial of Sinovac’s vaccine in Brazil, involving about 13,000 participants, suggested the shot is “safe and effective,” authorities at the Butantan Institute and the state of Sao Paulo said earlier in the week.Saving LivesSinovac is betting on a successful vaccine to inoculate more people around the world and save lives, especially in developing countries like Brazil that will have limited access to the Pfizer and Moderna shots. Sinovac’s shot is potentially better suited to developing countries because it can be kept at normal refrigerator temperatures, while vaccines from Pfizer and Moderna require deep-freeze conditions for storage and transportation.The Sinovac vaccine has been at the center of a political dispute between Sao Paulo Governor Joao Doria and President Jair Bolsonaro, who says a vaccine from China can’t be trusted. Bolsonaro again cast doubt on the effectiveness of the Sinovac vaccine in a Christmas Eve address broadcast on Facebook.“I want to make it very clear that the label of this vaccine will be ‘we are not responsible for any side effect.’ Responsibility is yours,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/sinovac-vaccine-shot-s-efficacy-uncertain-despite-brazil-turkey-results/story-oapZWFIBXB4pU22RHv4WdM.html

These are part of the 168,000 doses we will be getting before the end of the month, and part of the 40 million doses we are guaranteed from Moderna overall,” Trudeau tweeted late on Thursday.According to Public Services Minister Anita Anand, these vaccine batches would be the first to be deployed to the country’s north.Apart from the Moderna vaccine, Canada has secured up to 20 million doses of the Pfizer vaccine against the coronavirus, expecting 1.2 million doses from both manufactures to be delivered to the country by the end of next month.The government expects to vaccinate up to three million of its citizens in early 2021.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canada-gets-first-batch-of-168-000-moderna-covid-19-vaccine-doses/story-QseAoBAYUaFg4pwRi3MsbN.html
25-12-2020||World||Japan delays gender-equality goals in new five-year plan||Japan on Friday adopted a plan that delays women’s advancement goals by up to a decade after failing to reach even half of the 30% target by 2020 and other measures.Under the new five-year gender equality plan, approved by Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga’s Cabinet, the government has postponed the goal for women to account for at least 30% of leadership positions until “as early as possible during the 2020s.” The earlier goal was set by Suga’s predecessor, Shinzo Abe, under his “womenomics” policy designed to promote more women in the workforce to make up for Japan’s fast-aging population.The plan called for a society with no gender bias by 2030s. But it said that Japan is still largely bound by traditional gender roles, making it difficult for women to pursue careers in business and politics while fulfilling expected responsibilities in homemaking and childrearing.The plan backpedaled from a draft and fell short of promoting proactive steps, including a possible legal revision on family names, to allow married couples a right to choose whether to keep their maiden names. The current civil law says a married couple must choose either family name, most often causing women to adopt their husbands’ household names under Japan’s paternalistic tradition.The government draft had called for taking “necessary steps” to address inconveniences and burdens on women. But the final plan, reflecting conservative views of Suga’s ruling lawmakers, said family name options should be carefully studied, taking into consideration Japanese tradition and possible impact on children and a sense of family unity.Japan especially lags in women’s advancement in politics. Women account for less than 10% of lawmakers in the more powerful of its two-chamber parliament. About 40% of local assemblies have no female members or only one. Suga’s 20-member Cabinet has only two female ministers.“We cannot say we are close to achieving the 30% target,” the new plan said.“While women’s advancement is progressing faster in other countries, Japan has fallen behind.” Japan placed 121st in the global gender-equality ranking of 153 countries in the 2020 World Economic Forum report, falling from 101st when Abe took office in 2012.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/japan-delays-gender-equality-goals-in-new-five-year-plan/story-G9h4uzQpPImfmL1zfkJbkM.html

It aims to boost hydrogen consumption to 3 million tonnes by 2030 and to about 20 million tonnes by 2050 from 200 tonnes now, in areas such as power generation and transportation. The strategy identifies 14 industries, such as offshore wind and fuel ammonia, target the installation of up to 45 gigawatts (GW) of offshore wind power by 2040.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/japan-aims-to-eliminate-gasoline-vehicles-by-mid-2030s-boost-green-growth/story-Q6Tvy0WfiwcUcrKe2zs0dL.html
25-12-2020||World||7 US lawmakers write to Mike Pompeo on farmers’ protest in India||A group of seven influential US lawmakers, including Indian-American Congresswoman Pramila Jayapal, have written to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, urging him to raise the issue of farmers’ protest in India with his Indian counterpart.India has called the remarks by foreign leaders and politicians on protests by farmers as “ill-informed” and “unwarranted”, asserting that the matter pertains to the internal affairs of a democratic country.“We have seen some ill-informed comments…relating to farmers in India. Such comments are unwarranted, especially when pertaining to the internal affairs of a democratic country,” External Affairs Ministry Spokesperson Anurag Srivastava said earlier this month.This is an issue of particular concern to Sikh Americans linked to Punjab, although it also heavily impacts the Indian Americans belonging to other Indian states, the lawmakers said in their letter to Pompeo dated December 23.“Many Indian Americans are directly affected as they have family members and ancestral land in Punjab and are concerned for the well-being of their families in India. In view of this serious situation, we urge you to contact your Indian counterpart to reinforce the United States’ commitment to the freedom of political speech abroad,” they said.In their letter, the lawmakers said that the US as a nation that is familiar with political protests can offer counsel to India during their current period of social disturbance.“As national legislators, we respect the right of the government of India to determine national policy, in compliance with existing law. We also acknowledge the rights of those in India and abroad who are currently protesting peacefully against agricultural laws that many Indian farmers see as an attack on their economic security,” the lawmakers said.Thousands of farmers from Punjab, Haryana and several other states have been protesting on various borders of Delhi since November 26, seeking repeal of three farm laws enacted in September.Dubbing these laws as “anti-farmer”, these farmers claim that the newly enacted legislations would pave the way for the dismantling of the minimum support price system, leaving them at the “mercy” of big corporations.However, the government has maintained that the new laws will bring farmers better opportunities and usher in new technologies in agriculture. There have been multiple rounds of talks between representatives of the protestors and the Indian government but the logjam continues.In addition to Jayapal, the letter has been signed by Congressmen Donald Norcross, Brendan F Boyle, Brian Fitzpatrick, Mary Gay Scanlon, Debbie Dingell and David Trone.Over the past few weeks, more than a dozen US Congressmen have expressed their concerns on the ongoing protest by the farmers in India.Earlier this month, Congressman John Garamendi, Co-Chair of the American Sikh Caucus, along with Congressman Jim Costa and Congresswoman Shelia Jackson Lee —members of the American Sikh Caucus— sent a letter to Indian Ambassador to the US Taranjit Singh Sandhu, expressing solidarity with the protestors and defending their right to peaceful protest.Democratic American lawmaker David Trone on Tuesday urged the Indian government to provide safety to the protesting farmers and hailed the recent offers of dialogue and a proposal from India’s Supreme Court to set up mediation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/seven-us-lawmakers-write-to-mike-pompeo-on-farmers-protest-in-india/story-Q29XXk9GHz7bk5f4ymPL5I.html

We are sure this is going to be the beginning of the end of the pandemic.”Other doctors and nurses rolled up their sleeves in the chill morning air at outside vaccination stations in the cities of Toluca and Queretaro. The country’s 1.4 million health workers will be the first to get the shots, followed by the elderly, those with underlying health conditions that make them more vulnerable to the disease, and teachers.Foreign Relations Secretary Marcelo Ebrard said Mexico was the first country in Latin America to get the vaccine, though others were close behind.Chile also began its inoculation program Thursday, with 42-year-old nurse Zulema Riquelme getting the first jab as President Sebastián Piñera looked on.“I am calm, happy, very excited,” Riquelme told Piñera, who noted “a lot of people have gone to a lot of effort to reach this moment.”Chile said it had received 10,000 doses of the Pfizer vaccine, and has a deal for a total of 10 million. Health workers and the elderly will be first in line.In Costa Rica, which is the third country in the region to begin using the Pfizer vaccine, the first shot was given Thursday to Elizabeth Castillo, 91.“This moment represents for the country the beginning of the road to end the Covid-19 pandemic,” Costa Rican President Carlos Alvarado said at the event that opened the vaccination.Argentina, which has run into problems obtaining the Pfizer vaccine, received a flight carrying 300,000 doses of the Russian Sputnik V vaccine.Argentina plans to become the first country in Latin America to administer the Russian vaccine starting next week. It won’t yet be given to people older than 60 due to a lack of testing data.Argentine Health Secretary Ginés González García vowed the Russian vaccine was safe and said it could be used on those 60 and older once Russian authorities certify it. He said 5 million more doses were expected to arrive in January.While Mexico got only 3,000 doses of the Pfizer vaccine in the first shipment Wednesday, Ebrard said about 53,000 more doses would arrive by Tuesday, about 1.4 million doses in January and a total of about 11.75 million by mid-year.Ebrard said two vaccines are currently undergoing Phase 3 studies in Mexico and another three are awaiting approval to start.Other countries around the region are engaged in testing several vaccines, in studies that involve tens of thousands of volunteers.Latin America has been among the regions hardest hit by the pandemic.Mexico reported over 1.35 test-confirmed cases so far and 120,311 deaths, the fourth-highest toll in the world. However, estimates based on excess deaths this year suggest Mexico’s real death toll is closer to 180,000.Argentina has 1.5 million cases and over 42,000 deaths, while Chile has seen 590,000 cases and 16,000 deaths.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/mexico-starts-giving-first-shots-of-pfizer-biontech-vaccine-for-covid-19/story-S1AfqwIcaYcDWfXWIdwdAI.html

Along with an organist, he provided the musical accompaniment for the choir.“It was the first time we had all been back at Notre-Dame cathedral since the fire, so it was a moment full of emotion,” he said in an interview with television station franceinfo.The cathedral, a landmark of Gothic architecture dating to the 13th century and a major tourist attraction, caught fire on April 15, 2019. The blaze destroyed the spire and roof.French President Emmanuel Macron undertook to restore the cathedral within five years.But to date, most work on the site has focused on making the building safe, including clearing up toxic lead from the roof and spire that melted in the fire.In the meantime, Notre-Dame is closed to the public and masses are cancelled.In April this year, seven people were allowed to attend a religious ceremony in the cathedral to mark Good Friday, when Christians commemorate the death of Jesus Christ.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/with-choir-in-hard-hats-fire-ravaged-notre-dame-rings-in-christmas/story-Eor0XT5HwGk8oiorOLHqxL.html
25-12-2020||World||With pardons, Trump seeks to erase stain of Russia probe||President Donald Trump’s pardons of five people from his 2016 election campaign caps his effort to bleach out the stain on his tenure of the Russia interference investigation.The US leader never accepted the conclusions of US intelligence and special counsel Robert Mueller that Moscow intervened in the election four years ago to aid his upset victory, calling it a “hoax” and “fake news.”He has also claimed that his predecessor Barack Obama and a so-called “deep state” of anti-Trump officials conspired with the investigation to destroy his presidency from the beginning. Also Read: Donald Trump golfs in Florida as Covid relief hangs in the balanceThose pardoned in the past month -- Michael Flynn, Paul Manafort, Roger Stone, George Papadopoulos and Alex Van Der Zwaan -- pleaded guilty or were convicted at trial as a result of Mueller’s probe into whether the Trump campaign conspired with Moscow.For Trump, the pardons delivered a rebuke to those alleging his election victory was tainted by Russian help. Flynn, his former national security advisor who admitted lying to the FBI about secret contacts with Russians, was victim of a “relentless, partisan pursuit of an innocent man,” Trump said as he announced the pardon on November 25.The probe into Flynn, he said, was part of “a coordinated attempt to subvert the election of 2016.” On Tuesday Trump pardoned Papadopoulos -- a campaign advisor who had tried to hide his contacts with individuals linked to Russian intelligence -- and Van Der Zwaan, who also lied to investigators.And on Wednesday Trump announced the pardons of political consultant Stone and campaign chairman Manafort, both convicted of obstructing the investigations and lying. Manafort was also jailed over multiple financial fraud charges.All, the White House said, had been victimized by Mueller.“Mr. Manafort has endured years of unfair treatment and is one of the most prominent victims of what has been revealed to be perhaps the greatest witch hunt in American history,” the White House said.Trump blames ‘dirty cops’ Trump has fought hard since coming to office, attacking his own Justice Department and threatening officials’ jobs, to convince the public that the allegations about Russian interference were groundless and politically motivated.That was seen as the main reason why, in November 2018, he fired attorney general Jeff Sessions, who supported Mueller, and replaced him with Bill Barr.Also Read: Trump pardons more allies and Kushner’s father, sparking fresh outrageFour months later, when Mueller released a final report outlining efforts by the Trump campaign to cooperate with Russia, and multiple instances in which Trump sought to obstruct the investigation, Barr declared there was nothing significant there and refused to act.Instead, at Trump’s urging Barr began investigating the investigators, coming up with enough minor faulty behavior for Trump to claim that he was the target of “dirty cops” at the FBI.“FBI & DOJ had NO EVIDENCE to start an investigation against President Trump,” the president tweeted earlier this year.Meanwhile, Barr intervened against his own department prosecutors and judges in the cases of Flynn and Stone, suggesting they had been scapegoated.He ordered the case dropped against Flynn -- who had pleaded guilty -- and that Stone’s recommended sentence be slashed. ‘Mob boss’Trump’s pardons angered the Russia meddling investigators.They were “what you would expect to get if you gave the pardon power to a mob boss,” said Andrew Weissman, one of the lead investigators on the Mueller team.FBI counterintelligence agent Peter Strzok said the pardons “shock the conscience” and send the message that “if you work for (Trump), it’s OK to lie to the FBI about Russia.”Yet Trump hasn’t finished avenging his tarnished reputation. On December 1 Barr formally named a Mueller-like special counsel to conduct an independent “criminal” probe into the Russian investigators, including Mueller himself.That could continue for months after Trump cedes the White House to Democrat Joe Biden on January 20.For Biden, who has signaled he wants to turn the page, the probe could keep the focus right where his predecessor wants it -- on the alleged wrongs done to Trump.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/with-pardons-trump-seeks-to-erase-stain-of-russia-probe/story-OKs3OZ5dmN9Qu2jcZiAUUM.html

Other Syrian media said Syrian air defences responded to an Israeli attack near the town in the Hama province.There was no immediate word on what the target was or whether there were any casualties.Israeli jets regularly violate Lebanese airspace and have often struck inside Syria from Lebanese territory. But the Christmas Eve flights were louder than usual, frightening residents of Beirut who have endured multiple crises in the past year, including the catastrophic August 4 explosion at the city’s port that killed over 200 people and destroyed parts of the capital. That explosion resulted from the detonation of a stockpile of ammonium nitrates that was improperly stored at the facility.There was no immediate word from Israel on Friday’s flights and alleged attacks on Syria.In the past few years, Israel has acknowledged carrying out dozens of airstrikes in Syria, most of them aimed at suspected Iranian weapons shipments believed to be bound for Hezbollah. In recent months, Israeli officials have expressed concern that Hezbollah is trying to establish production facilities to make precision guided missiles.Masyaf is a significant military area for Syrian President Bashar Assad’s regime that includes a military academy and a scientific research center.

25-12-2020||World||Donald Trump golfs in Florida as Covid relief hangs in the balance||After tossing a grenade that threatens to blow up a massive Covid relief and government funding bill and force a government shutdown in the midst of a pandemic, President Donald Trump spent his Christmas Eve golfing in Florida.Failure to agree on the bill could deny checks to millions of Americans on the brink.Trump had no events on his public schedule on the first day of his winter vacation Thursday, but traveled to his Palm Beach golf club, where he was spotted by CNN cameras on the links. Reporters were given no details of his schedule for the day, but told that, “As the Holiday season approaches, President Trump will continue to work tirelessly for the American People. His schedule includes many meetings and calls.” Trump’s departure came as Washington was still reeling over his surprise, eleventh-hour demand that an end-of-year spending bill that congressional leaders spent months negotiating give most Americans $2,000 Covid relief checks — far more than the USD 600 members of his own party had agreed to. The idea was swiftly rejected by House Republicans during a rare Christmas Eve session, leaving the proposal in limbo.The bipartisan compromise had been considered a done deal and had won sweeping approval in the House and Senate this week after the White House assured GOP leaders that Trump supported it. If Trump refuses to sign the deal, which is attached to a USD 1.4 trillion government funding bill, it will force a federal government shutdown, in addition to delaying aid checks and halting unemployment benefits and eviction protections in the midst of the most dire stretch of the pandemic.It was a final raised middle finger to Republicans from a president who has been raging over his November 3 loss to President-elect Joe Biden and trying to come up with new, increasingly outrageous schemes to try to overturn the results of a Democratic election. He has been egged on by allies like his lawyer, former New York mayor Rudy Giuliani, who accompanied the president to Florida aboard Air Force One.Trump’s ire has been focused, in part, on Republicans in Congress whom he believes have been insufficiently supportive of his quest to delegitimize Biden’s win by lobbing unfounded claims of mass voter fraud before Congress meets to tally the Electoral College votes on Jan. 6.In Florida, Trump continued to rail against the results, complaining to members that he had been robbed of the election and voicing frustrations about the year-end spending bill.“At a meeting in Florida today, everyone was asking why aren’t the Republicans up in arms & fighting over the fact that the Democrats stole the rigged presidential election?” Trump tweeted after he’d returned to his private Mar-a-Lago club. “Especially in the Senate, they said, where you helped 8 Senators win their races.” “I will NEVER FORGET!” he wrote in another, The statements underscored concerns that Trump is blowing up negotiations to punish lawmakers for what he sees as their insufficient support loyalty.Trump has provided no credible evidence to support his election claims, which have also been refuted by a long list of officials, from former Attorney General William Barr to Republican governors, judges and local election administrators.Meanwhile, the nation continues to reel as the coronavirus spreads, with record infections and hospitalizations and more than 327,000 now dead. And millions are now facing the prospect of spending the holidays alone or struggling to make ends meet without adequate income, food or shelter thanks to the pandemic’s economic toll.To mark the holiday, the president and first lady Melania Trump tweeted out a pre-recorded video message in which they wished Americans a Merry Christmas and thanked first responders and members of the military.“As you know, this Christmas is different than years past,” said Mrs. Trump, who focused on the acts of “kindness and courage” the pandemic had inspired .Trump hailed the vaccine doses now being delivered and thanked those responsible. “It is a truly a Christmas miracle,” he said.Meanwhile, Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin have been trying to salvage the year-end legislation to try to prevent a shutdown. Democrats will recall House lawmakers to Washington for a vote Monday on Trump’s USD 2,000 proposal, though it would likely die in the GOP-controlled Senate. They are also considering a Monday vote on a stop-gap measure to at least avert a federal shutdown and keep the government running until Biden is inaugurated January 20.In addition to the relief checks, the Covid bill that passed would establish a temporary USD 300 per week supplemental jobless benefit, provide a new round of subsidies for hard-hit businesses, restaurants and theaters and money for schools, and provide money for health care providers and to help with Covid vaccine distribution.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-golfs-in-florida-as-covid-relief-hangs-in-the-balance/story-CzNGRhNkoqT6bEkYnBz12H.html

25-12-2020||World||What now for British economy with UK-EU trade deal reached?||The last-minute trade deal between the UK and the European Union means businesses will be spared new tariffs and border disruption at the start of the new year - an economic shock that would have compounded the employment and financial troubles inflicted by the pandemic.News of the agreement Thursday brought sighs of relief from the offices of corporate bosses and politicians, as well as from consumers anticipating produce shortages and transport workers facing the potential of long backups at border crossings.Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey recently warned that a failure to secure a UK-EU trade deal would have a greater long-term impact on the British economy than the long-term impact of the coronavirus pandemic, which has led to the country’s deepest recession in more than three centuries.The deal still must win approval from the British and EU parliaments. Here’s a look at the changes to come and their likely implications.WHAT IS THE UK LEAVING ON JANUARY 1? Though the U.K. left the EU on January 31, it is following the bloc’s rules until the end of this year as part of a transition period to the new economic relationship. The problem was, what comes after that? The UK is leaving the European single market, which after its departure will encompass around 450 million people. At its heart, the single market aims to make trade as simple as possible, regardless of where a business is located within the European Economic Area, which in addition to the 27 EU member states includes non-EU nations including Iceland and Norway. The rules governing trade are the same across the single market and are based on the free movement of goods, services, capital and people.The U.K. is also leaving the customs union, which eliminated tariffs between members and created a common external tariff to non-members. Under the customs union, the EU negotiates international trade deals on behalf of its members — giving it a weight in the global economy that no single member would have. WHAT IS THE NEW RELATIONSHIP?  Under the terms of the new deal, there will be no tariffs on goods traded between the U.K. and the EU. For car manufacturers, for example, that’s a relief as without a deal a 10% charge would have applied from Jan. 1. There will also be no quotas, meaning that exporters can still transport as many vehicles as they wish.Still, trade will not be as seamless as before as the U.K. leaves the single market and the customs union. Firms will have to file forms and customs declarations for the first time in years. There will also be different rules on product labeling as well as sanitary checks on agricultural products, for example.The government has estimated that the new red tape will result in an extra 215 million customs declarations each year at an annual cost of about 7 billion pounds.But a deal averts what could have been considerable chaos and a deeper blow to trade, since new tariffs would have added to the cost of doing business between the UK and the EU for many different categories of good. That has many viewing Thursday’s deal as making the best of a bad situation for business. WHAT WILL THE IMMEDIATE IMPACT BE? It is possible that it will take time to adjust, likely leading to further traffic jams on both sides of the English Channel as well as delays at the ports in the days and weeks after Jan. 1. Early expectations are that some food prices, notably of imported meat and dairy products, will rise in the weeks ahead.  HOW WILL THE NEW TRADE RELATIONSHIP AFFECT ECONOMIC GROWTH?  Economists agree that the deal is better for the British economy than a no-deal outcome, and will help it recover from the coronavirus recession, which is expected to have reduced economic output by around 12 per cent in 2020. The impact is much smaller for the EU and other countries around the world, which would have mainly experienced some volatility in financial markets in case of no deal.The EU accounts for around half of the U.K.’s exports, so avoiding tariffs will help many companies. Executives can start to implement investment decisions that they’d kept on hold over the past few years of Brexit uncertainty. Still, the deal with the EU does not incorporate the full scope of the services sector. Since it accounts for around 80 per cent of the British economy, those businesses that rely heavily on business with the EU, such as banking and finance, face a murkier future. That’s particularly ominous for the UK’s huge banking sector.  WHAT ABOUT LONGER TERM? In the longer-term, most forecasters think the British economy will end up being a few percentage points smaller over the coming few years than it otherwise would have been if it had stayed in the EU. That may not sound much in the context of this year’s recession, but it does mean that living standards would be lower than otherwise have been the case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/what-now-for-british-economy-with-uk-eu-trade-deal-reached/story-rfp59ncEQtDF6rtKp0BsYL.html
