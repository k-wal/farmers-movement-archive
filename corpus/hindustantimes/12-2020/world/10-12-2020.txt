If confirmed, she will take over ongoing trade talks with Indian counterpart Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal, from Robert Lighthizer, a Trump administration hardliner. The Taiwanese-American, who will be the first Asian-origin person to head this federal agency, currently serves as the chief lawyer on trade for the powerful Ways and Means Committee of the Democratic-controlled House of Representatives and was previously chief counsel on China trade enforcement in the Office of the United States Trade Representative. The Biden-Harris transition team said Tai’s experience will allow the incoming administration to “hit the ground running on trade, and harness the power of our trading relationships to help the US dig out of the Covid-induced economic crisis and pursue the President-elect’s vision of a pro-American worker trade strategy”.India and the United States have been negotiating an interim trade deal that will eventually pave the way for an ambitious Free Trade Agreement. Talks started in the summer of 2019 after the Trump administration ended special benefits for India under US trade promotion programme that had allowed more than $6 billion worth of Indian goods to enter America free of import duty. The US wants greater access to India markets in dairy and medical devices sectors and the removal of what it has called discriminatory rules.Officials on both sides have been optimistic of signing the initial pact— which was said to be a “a few phones calls away” at one stage. There were expectations they could sign it after the November 3 elections. Lighthizer’s tough negotiating positions have been seen by Indians as the key reason for the prolonged talks.Biden also announced former US National Security Adviser Susan Rice to head his domestic policy council; former Obama chief of staff Dennis McDonough at secretary of veteran affairs; Tom Vilsack as agriculture secretary for third term; and Congresswoman Marcia Fudge as secretary of housing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-names-asian-american-tai-as-top-trade-negotiator/story-ThZaJ8FpWs9zKhb0XWzgBI.html
10-12-2020||World||UK slaps sanctions on Pak ex-cop for human rights violations||Anwar Ahmad Khan, the former senior superintendent of police in Malir District, Karachi, is among 10 people and one entity sanctioned by the Boris Johnson government for human rights violations on Thursday, including travel bans and freeze of their assets in the UK.Those sanctioned include Russian, Venezuelan and Gambian human rights violators, the Foreign Office said, adding that the sanctions have been imposed alongside the United States on International Human Rights Day.On the Pakistani former policeman, it said: “Rao Anwar Khan is the former Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) in Malir District, Pakistan. In his role as SSP Malir, Khan was reportedly responsible for numerous staged police encounters in which individuals were killed by police, and was directly involved in over 190 police encounters that resulted in the deaths of over 400 people, including the murder of Naqeebullah Mehsud in 2018. Khan is therefore responsible for or complicit in, the serious violations of the right to life”.This is the third time the UK has sanctioned people or entities for human rights violations and abuses under a UK-only regime, with the first in July and the second in September 2020. In total, the US and the UK designated 31 actors today for their involvement in serious human rights abuses, the Foreign Office said in a statement. In Russia, the UK imposed sanctions, including travel bans and asset freezes, against three individuals and the Terek Special Rapid Response Unit the statement said is responsible for torture and other human rights violations against LGBT people in Chechnya.Others include senior security figures In Venezuela and the former president of The Gambia, Yahya Jammeh.Foreign secretary Dominic Raab said: “Today’s sanctions send a clear message to human rights violators that the UK will hold them to account. The UK and our allies are shining a light on the severe and systematic human rights violations perpetrated by those sanctioned today”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-slaps-sanctions-on-pak-ex-cop-for-human-rights-violations/story-F2HcGMrH7HY9OVC81jtVIO.html
10-12-2020||World||Canada says 2 citizens held in China have not been tried||Canada said Thursday that it has confirmed with China that two Canadians held for two years in China in a case linked to a Huawei executive have not been put on trial, contrary to remarks by a Foreign Ministry spokesperson.Former Canadian diplomat Michael Kovrig and businessman Michael Spavor have been confined by China since December 10, 2018, just days after Canada detained Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou, who is also the daughter of the founder of the Chinese telecommunications equipment giant.Asked about the Canadians at a daily briefing on Thursday, Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesperson Hua Chunying said the two had been “arrested, indicted and tried,” in what appeared to be the first public assertion that they had been brought to court.Hua gave no details, and Canada’s Global Affairs Department issued a statement later Thursday saying that Canadian Embassy officials in Beijing had spoken with the ministry, which confirmed that the men had not gone on trial.Chinese officials “confirmed that the confusion was caused by an inaccurate characterization of the process made by the Chinese MFA spokesperson,” the statement said.Chinese prosecutors announced earlier this year that Kovrig had been charged on suspicion of spying for state secrets and intelligence, and Spavor on suspicion of spying for a foreign entity and illegally providing state secrets.Neither China nor Canada has released specifics about their cases.Canada detained Meng at the request of the United States, which is seeking her extradition to face fraud charges.Hua said her case and those of the Canadians were ”different in nature,” with Meng’s being a “purely political incident.” Despite that, China has consistently linked the fate of the two Canadians to its demands that Meng be released immediately.Canadian Foreign Minister Francois-Philippe Champagne issued a statement Wednesday marking their two years of captivity, saying: “These two Canadians are an absolute priority for our government, and we will continue to work tirelessly to secure their immediate release and to stand up for them as a government and as Canadians.”“I am struck by the integrity and strength of character the two have shown as they endure immense hardship that would shake anyone’s faith in humanity,” Champagne said.Meng’s arrest severely damaged relations between Canada and China, which has sentenced two other Canadians to death and suspended imports of canola from Canada.Meng, the chief financial officer of Huawei Technologies, is living in a luxury Vancouver home while her extradition case continues in a British Columbia court. The U.S. accuses Huawei of using a Hong Kong shell company to deceive banks and do business with Iran in violation of U.S. sanctions.It’s not publicly known where Kovrig and Spavor are being held or under what conditions, although Canada’s ambassador to China testified to a House of Commons committee this week that they were “robust.”Canadian diplomats had been denied all access to the two men from January to October because of coronavirus precautions cited by the Chinese side. On-site visits were banned and not even virtual visits were permitted.Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who has described China’s approach as coercive diplomacy, spoke last month with U.S. President-elect Joe Biden about the case of the two men and said he expects Biden to be a good partner in persuading Beijing to release them.The United States marked the second year of the men’s imprisonment on Thursday by calling for their immediate release.The acting American ambassador to Canada, Katherine Brucker, said in a statement that they are being arbitrarily and unjustly detained.“We echo the calls from the Canadian government, the international community, and the families of Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor for these two men to be released immediately and returned home,” Brucker said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canada-says-2-citizens-held-in-china-have-not-been-tried/story-jDcZPWdfZl6pMRU3uevnHL.html
10-12-2020||World||Trump announces Israel, Morocco to normalise relations||Israel and Morocco have agreed to normalize relations, President Donald Trump said Thursday, marking the fourth Arab-Israeli agreement in four months. As part of the deal announced near the end of Trump’s term, the United States will recognize Morocco’s claim over the disputed Western Sahara region.Trump said Israel and Morocco would restore diplomatic and other relations, including the immediate reopening of liaison offices in Tel Aviv and Rabat and the eventual opening of embassies. US officials said there would be joint overflight rights for airlines.The White House said Trump and Morocco’s King Mohammed VI had agreed that Morocco would “resume diplomatic relations between Morocco and Israel and expand economic and cultural cooperation to advance regional stability.”“Another HISTORIC breakthrough today! Our two GREAT friends Israel and the Kingdom of Morocco have agreed to full diplomatic relations – a massive breakthrough for peace in the Middle East!” Trump tweeted.The US will recognize Morocco’s claim over Western Sahara, the former Spanish territory in North Africa where a long-running dispute has confounded international negotiators for decades. Trump noted that Morocco had been the first country to recognize the United States as an independent nation just a year after the US declared its independence from Britain in 1776.“It is thus fitting we recognize their sovereignty over the Western Sahara,” Trump said.The deal is the result of talks conducted by the president’s senior adviser, son-in-law Jared Kushner, and his chief international negotiator, Avi Berkowitz. “This is a significant step forward for the people of Israel and Morocco. It further enhances Israel’s security, while creating opportunities for Morocco and Israel to deepen their economic ties and improve the lives of their people,” Kushner said.Morocco is the fourth Arab nation to recognize Israel as the Trump administration seeks to expand a diplomatic framework that began over the summer with an agreement between the Jewish state and the United Arab Emirates.Bahrain and Sudan have followed suit and administration officials have also been trying to bring Saudi Arabia into the grouping.“The president reaffirmed his support for Morocco’s serious, credible, and realistic autonomy proposal as the only basis for a just and lasting solution to the dispute over the Western Sahara territory and as such the president recognized Moroccan sovereignty over the entire Western Sahara territory,” the White House said.All these countries are geographically far removed from the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, making it easier to strike deals with Israel and the U.S. for their own particular interests. Morocco also has close ties with Saudi Arabia, which has given its tacit support to the normalization process with Israel, even at a time when peacemaking with the Palestinians is at a standstill.Morocco, a country with centuries of Jewish history, has long been rumored to be ready to establish ties with Israel.Before Israel’s establishment in 1948, Morocco was home to a large Jewish population, many of whose ancestors migrated to North Africa from Spain and Portugal during the Spanish Inquisition. Today, hundreds of thousands of Israeli Jews trace their lineage to Morocco, making it one of the country’s largest sectors of Israeli society. A small community of Jews, estimated at several thousand people, continues to live in Morocco.Morocco has for years had informal ties with Israel. They established low-level diplomatic relations during the 1990s following Israel’s interim peace accords with the Palestinians, but those ties were suspended after the outbreak of the second Palestinian uprising in 2000.Since then, the informal ties have continued, and an estimated 50,000 Israelis travel to Morocco each year on trips to learn about the Jewish community and retrace their family histories.US backing for Morocco’s Western Sahara claim has long been a rumored, but unconfirmed, bargaining chip in talk about diplomatic ties. Morocco had claimed the vast desert area as its “southern provinces” since 1975 as the Polisario Front, based in southern Algeria, wants its independence. A recent dust-up with the Polisario brought the issue back into headlines.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-announces-israel-morocco-to-normalise-relations-in-latest-us-brokered-deal/story-B05bpqwRNLWoU7UUBdTBvO.html
10-12-2020||World||Brexit: Duty-free shopping, and other things that will change for UK, EU citizens from January 1||The European Union on Thursday published contingency plans to prepare for a possible “no deal” scenario as several issues remain unresolved after several rounds of Brexit trade talks. The UK left the EU on January 31, 2020, after agreeing on an 11-month transition period, ending December 31, 2020. Both parties have been using this period to negotiate the terms of their future partnership. Due to significant uncertainty over a deal before January 1, the European Commission has put forward a set of contingency measures to ensure smooth road and air travel between the UK and the member countries of the EU. European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen said that the negotiations are still going on but there is no guarantee that the two parties will be able to secure a deal before the end of the transition period. “Our responsibility is to be prepared for all eventualities, including not having a deal in place with the UK on 1 January 2021. That is why we are coming forward with these measures today,” von der Leyen said in a statement.Also Read | EU trade talks to face ‘moment of finality’ on weekend: UK foreign ministerHere are a few things that will change for UK and EU citizens from January 1:New Immigration system: EU citizens will be treated on par with non-EU citizens and they will have to apply and pay for a visa to move to the UK to work, live or study. Under the new visa system, points will be assigned for specific skills, qualifications, salaries or professions. A minimum of 70 points is required to be eligible to apply, of which some are tradeable. Separate queue at borders: British nationals will have to use separate lanes at border control from those of EU, the European Economic Area (EEA) and Swiss citizens. They will be required to show a return ticket as well as prove that they have enough money to stay in the visiting countries.More paperwork: Free movement of people between the UK and the 27-member bloc will cease to exist from January 1, but British nationals already living in any EU country will have certain protections under the Withdrawal Agreement. However, they may have to apply for residency or meet specific requirements, as per the rules of the specific country. UK citizens moving to the EU in 2021 should check the rules for each country.Return of duty-free shopping: When the UK was an EU member, British nationals were allowed to bring an unlimited amount of duty-free alcohol and tobacco from EU countries for personal use as long as the duty had been paid in the country where they made the purchase. British passengers will now be able to buy duty-free alcohol and tobacco products, wherever available. The amount that passengers can bring back with them, although limited, will also significantly increase.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/brexit-duty-free-shopping-and-other-things-that-will-change-for-uk-eu-citizens-from-january-1/story-94OuCygiBzayhBbXRSb3cM.html

10-12-2020||World||US inflation measure rose by more than forecast in November||A measure of prices paid by US consumers rose in November by more than forecast as costs of hotel stays, airfares and apparel jumped, though inflationary pressures elsewhere remained subdued as the pandemic continues to curb activity.The consumer price index rose 0.2% from the prior month after no change in October, Labor Department data showed Thursday. Compared with a year earlier, the gauge rose 1.2%. The core index, which excludes volatile food and energy costs, also advanced 0.2% from the prior month and increased 1.6% from a year earlier.The median forecast in a Bloomberg survey of economists called for a 0.1% gain in both the CPI and core measure.While services costs picked up last month by the most since July, a broadening of inflation will likely take time as the nation awaits the distribution of Covid-19 vaccines. Currently, merchants have limited leeway to charge customers more as unemployment remains elevated and a surge in infections prompts some states and cities to reimpose restrictions on business.The report showed the cost of transportation services jumped 1.8%, the most in four months. Airfares rose 3.5% after a 6.3% increase a month earlier, and motor vehicle insurance advanced 1.1% in November. Lodging away from home was 3.9% more expensive than in October, the largest gain since 2005.But many economists caution against expectations of a longer-lasting acceleration in inflation, in large part because unemployment is expected to remain elevated throughout the year. Shelter costs, which include rents and make up about a third of the CPI, are also expected to remain subdued. Measures of rents and owners equivalent rent were unchanged for the first time since 2010.Goods prices, meantime, were also unchanged in November from a month earlier. Clothing costs climbed 0.9%, while prices of used cars and new vehicles declined.Tame inflation has been a hallmark of the pandemic, as the coronavirus has curbed demand for services, which make up about 60% of the overall CPI and 75% of the core measure. Market participants are increasingly projecting prices to pick up next year as demand increases for those industries most impacted by the coronavirus.Inflation has been consistently running below the Federal Reserve’s 2% goal, which is measured by the Commerce Department’s personal consumption expenditures price index. The softness helps explain ultra-easy monetary policy from the Fed, which has signalled it plans to keep interest rates near zero through 2023.Forecasters surveyed by Bloomberg generally expect inflation to temporarily rise above 2% in the second quarter of 2021 on an annual basis before settling back at or slightly below that level.A separate Labor Department report on Thursday showed applications for state unemployment benefits increased in the week ended December 5. While the figure may reflect volatility around the Thanksgiving holiday, it also indicates that more business shutdowns amid a spike in infections are playing a role.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-inflation-measure-rose-by-more-than-forecast-in-november/story-4lQJ3KrVsZv6Z2h8lbpGTJ.html
10-12-2020||World||US jobless claims climb over 850,000 as coronavirus situation worsens||The number of people applying for unemployment aid jumped last week to 853,000, the most since September, evidence that companies are cutting more jobs as new virus cases spiral higher.The Labor Department said Thursday that the number of applications increased from 716,000 the previous week. Before the coronavirus paralyzed the economy in March, weekly jobless claims typically numbered only about 225,000.The latest figures coincide with a surging viral outbreak that appears to be weakening the job market and the economy and threatening to derail any recovery. Consumers thus far haven’t spent as much this holiday shopping season as they have in previous years, according to credit and debit card data. And in November, employers added jobs at the slowest pace since April. Restaurants, bars and retailers all cut jobs last month.The increase reflected sharp increases across the country, with new applications for jobless aid jumping more than 47,000 in California, 31,000 in Illinois, 17,000 in New York and 13,000 in Georgia. Many states, particularly California, have adopted sweeping new restrictions on business activity. But even some states that generally haven’t imposed stricter rules on businesses reported sharp increases in jobless claims last week. In Texas, for example, they jumped by nearly 20,000 to 45,000.The worsening figures may partly reflect a rebound after applications for unemployment benefits had fallen during the Thanksgiving holiday week. Still, the increase was much larger than most economists had expected.“It’s evident the labor market is still in crisis,” said AnnElizabeth Konkel, an economist at the Indeed job search website. “The gap between now and when a vaccine is widely distributed looms large. There’s a lot of uncertainty ahead for the labor market going into the new year.”The total number of people who are receiving state-provided unemployment aid rose for the first time in three months to 5.8 million, the government said, from 5.5 million. That suggests that some companies have sharply pulled back on hiring.All told, more than 19 million people are still dependent on some type of unemployment benefit. And unless Congress acts soon, nearly half of them will lose that aid in just over two weeks. That’s when two jobless aid programs that the federal government created in the spring are set to expire.The first program provides unemployment benefits to the self-employed and contract workers, who weren’t eligible in the past. The second program is the one that extends jobless aid for 13 weeks.Members of Congress and the Trump administration are fighting over a roughly $900 billion relief package that could extend the two programs into the spring, sparing about 9 million unemployed Americans from what would otherwise be deeper financial distress.A bipartisan group of senators has proposed to extend the supplemental aid for four months and add $300-a-week in federal jobless aid. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin on Tuesday proposed a one-time round of $600 relief checks — half the $1,200 that was provided in the spring. But Mnuchin’s proposal includes no funding for supplemental unemployment aid payments, drawing sharp objections from Democrats in Congress.With a coronavirus vaccine nearing approval, many economists are optimistic that the economy will rebound strongly next year. But most favor another federal financial relief package to support unemployed workers, small businesses, and state and local governments until then.New confirmed virus cases are now topping 200,000 a day, up from only about 30,000 in the spring. And the average number of deaths each day in the past seven days has surpassed 2,000, roughly matching its peak in April.The virus’ acceleration has led many governors to impose stricter curbs on restaurants, gyms and other business activity in states from North Carolina to California and Washington state.The pandemic appears to have also sharply restricted holiday spending, in part because of stay-at-home orders and other restrictions and in part because many consumers are reluctant to go out shopping. A jump in online spending hasn’t fully offset a steep decline, compared with last year, in spending at physical stores.According to data from Opportunity Insights, a research center affiliated with Harvard and Brown universities, spending on debit and credit cards sank nearly 12% in the week that ended November 29 compared with a year earlier. That marked a sharp drop from the previous week, when such spending was down just 2.3% from 12 months earlier.The steady stream of layoffs across the country has intensified the financial hardships for many Americans.One of the jobless, Montrell McGraw, says he just had to cancel his car insurance and now can’t drive because his unemployment benefit of just $225 a week isn’t enough to keep up with the payments. He was able to cover all his bills when the federal government provided an extra $600 in jobless aid. But that ended in July.McGraw, 26, lost his job as a cook at a Hilton Hotel in New Orleans, where he lives, back in March just after the virus erupted in the United States. He says he’s applied for 35 jobs without any luck. His primary work experience is in restaurants, few of which are hiring.Most of the available jobs he sees involve trucking or work on offshore oil rigs, which require certifications he can’t afford to obtain. McGraw has also worked with an advocacy group, Stand Up Louisiana, in support of extending jobless benefits.“I didn’t ask for this — no one asked for this pandemic,” he said. “I am trying to play the cards I am dealt with, and I have a really bad hand.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-jobless-claims-climb-over-850-000-as-coronavirus-situation-worsens/story-WWPwN364NPuyauma8MTe3H.html
10-12-2020||World||EU on brink of landmark budget, virus recovery fund deal, says Hungary PM||Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban said Thursday that the European Union is on the brink of sealing an agreement on a massive budget and a coronavirus recovery package, signaling that it has almost overcome objections from his country and Poland about tying EU funds to upholding the rule of law.“We are just one inch from reaching a consensus,” Orban told reporters as he arrived at EU headquarters in Brussels for a two-day summit, adding that all sides are fighting for “a victory for common sense.”“It is obvious that when our nations and so many millions of people are in real need because of (the) pandemic and the economic consequences of that, we have to behave reasonably,” said Orban, whose nationalist governments has been accused of undermining judicial independence and media freedoms.The 1.82 trillion euro ($2.21 trillion) long-term budget and recovery package is considered vital for many European countries whose economies have been devastated by the virus. Poland and Hungary had agreed to the deal in July but later vetoed it over a new mechanism that would allow Brussels to cut off EU funds to countries that violate Europe’s democratic standards.Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki warned that it’s a case of us now, you tomorrow.“We have to avoid any arbitrary and politically motivated decisions,” he said. “Today, we fear that we might be attacked in unjustified way, but of course in the future (it can be) any country.”The apparent breakthrough comes just days after it appeared that their 25 EU partners might go it alone and create a new coronavirus recovery package without them.Ahead of the two-day summit, EU diplomats and officials said the solution would take the form of a declaration clarifying that the rule of law mechanism would not be used against any country without a ruling from the EU’s top court, the European Court of Justice, first. That process could take a year.“A compromise is currently being found. I hope it can be finalized in the coming hours,” French President Emmanuel Macron said Thursday.But Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte still has questions. He plans to seek legal advice, particularly as to whether the compromise would violate the agreement previously reached between EU member countries and the European Parliament.Rutte said he also wants to be sure that any court ruling “can retroactively establish that violations have occurred.”If the leaders fail to adopt the budget for 2021-2027 before the end of the year, the bloc will have to function on limited resources, with a maximum of one-twelfth of the budget for the previous financial year to be spent each month.Many projects for Poland and Hungary — which are already being formally investigated by the EU for their potential violations of the rule of law — could be held up.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/eu-on-brink-of-landmark-budget-virus-recovery-fund-deal-says-hungary-pm/story-C4rvNAc88yDz7n4hnb5aPI.html

It says that its users are not locked in and that competition is just one click away on the internet. “Android provides people with unprecedented choice in deciding which applications they install, use and set as default on their devices, and enables millions of app developers around the world to build successful businesses,” Google said.Seznam said the claim, based on the period between 2011 and 2018, was sent to Google in the past few days with a 30-day deadline and it was prepared to take civil legal action.With a 25% share of the Czech search market, Seznam said it earned revenue of 4.69 billion crowns in 2019 and cumulative revenue of 32 billion crowns since 2011.Reuters reported in November that a group of 165 companies and industry bodies have called on European Union antitrust enforcers to take a tougher line against Google.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/business-news/google-faces-417-million-claim-from-czech-search-engine-seznam/story-BAbngYj3xzVAUr1J8xPjNM.html

The Foreign Office are following the issue of protests in India closely.”Dhesi had asked if Johnson could convey to Prime Minister Narendra Modi the anxieties in the UK about images of police action against the protesting farmers in and around Delhi.Dhesi said: “Many constituents, especially those emanating from the Punjab and other parts of India, and I were horrified to see footage of water cannons, tear gas and brute force being used against peacefully protesting farmers.”“However, it was heart-warming to see those very farmers feeding those forces who had been ordered to beat or suppress them…what indomitable spirit…it takes a special kind of people to do that”.“So will the prime minister convey to the Indian prime minister our heart-felt anxieties, our hopes for a speedy resolution to the current deadlock, and does he agree that everyone has the fundamental right to peaceful protest”, he asked.To this, Johnson had responded: “Of course, Mr Speaker, and our views as the honourable gentleman knows well, of course, we have serious concerns about what is happening between India and Pakistan but these are pre-eminently matters for those two governments to settle and I know that he appreciates that point”.The exchange came days after the Foreign Office had refused to comment on the farmers’ agitation, when its spokesperson said: “The police handling of protests are a matter for the Government of India.”Dhesi last week coordinated a letter signed by 36 MPs from various parties to foreign secretary Dominic Raab, asking him to raise the farmers’ issue with the Indian government. A protest demonstration was held outside the Indiann high commission on Sunday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/boris-misheard-question-says-office-on-his-terming-farmer-protest-an-india-pak-issue/story-XbBOyRvzuYmV96eY6S8ElL.html

He headed the public works and transport ministry in 2014, shortly after the arrival of the Rhosus ship carrying a huge stockpile of ammonium nitrate which detonated at the port.Officials have said the cargo of ammonium nitrate, a highly explosive chemical, was stored unsafely for years at the port, which lies in heart of the city.Diab’s office, Finianos and Khalil, who is a senior aide to Lebanon’s influential Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri, could not immediately be reached for comment.Four months after one of the largest non-nuclear explosions on record, which injured thousands of people, victims are still waiting for the results of an investigation their leaders had promised would come within days of the Aug. 4 port blast.The judge leading the official inquiry, Fadi Sawan, sent a letter last month asking parliament to probe 10 former ministers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/lebanese-judge-charges-pm-ex-ministers-over-beirut-port-blast/story-pqGf8Gs0UcPYbcWeas3OsN.html
10-12-2020||World||Fight climate change like we battle Covid-19, says Paris Accord chief negotiator||Laurent Fabius, the Frenchman who brought down the gavel to seal the Paris Accord on climate change five years ago, said he wished world powers had fought global warming as resolutely as they have confronted the coronavirus pandemic.The agreement between almost 200 states on Dec. 12, 2015 was hailed as a potential turning point in efforts to contain global warming. It called for holding the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels.While the long-term trend in global temperatures is now downwards, progress is insufficient, Fabius said, blaming a lack of political will among many governments, not least the United States under President Donald Trump.However, in an interview with Reuters, he highlighted some positive developments, including President-elect Joe Biden’s pledge to bring the United States back into the accord.Governments have taken courageous financial and social decisions to halt the virus, but climate change poses an even graver threat, Fabius said.“Unfortunately, we are not doing as much to fight climate change as we are to tackle the fallout from Covid,” said Fabius, who was chief negotiator at the Paris talks and is now president of France’s Constitutional Council.He said it was critical that in the global recovery from the pandemic, the rebound is “green” and money is not ploughed into old, polluting industries.The accord has brought some success, Fabius said. Scientific models had projected temperatures would increase 5 or 6 degrees and now estimated rises of 3 to 4 degrees by 2100. But this was still too high, he said.The thresholds set by the Paris Accord reflect scientists’ beliefs that a rise in temperatures of more than 2 degrees would doom the planet to a future of rising sea levels, catastrophic floods, droughts and storms, and food and water shortages.BIDEN: A GAME-CHANGER?Fabius, a former prime minister who was France’s foreign minister at the time of the accord, recalled sleepless nights during two weeks of intense negotiations. The accord almost fell apart at the last moment.He has a cherished replica of the green wooden hammer: cheers erupted and diplomats hugged as his gavel came down.“Since then, it’s not been the same. In particular there was the backtracking by US President Donald Trump, which was bad for America but more so the rest of the world,” he said.The United States, the world’s second-largest greenhouse gas emitter after China, formally exited the accord on Nov. 4, a day after Election Day, fulfilling a Trump promise to withdraw.“A certain number of countries said to themselves: if the world’s biggest power doesn’t respect its commitments, why should we?” Fabius continued.But he said there had been a geopolitical shift in recent months. Biden has promised to rejoin the accord, China has pledged to be carbon neutral by 2060 and Japan by 2050.Fabius predicted that Biden’s task will not be easy, with control of the US Senate still up for grabs and energy lobby groups wielding huge influence in Washington.“(But) to move things we need every country in the world to act, not just one county.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/fight-climate-change-like-we-battle-covid-19-says-paris-accord-chief-negotiator/story-RK8TgBFNiNv2zOIwvuKQgK.html
10-12-2020||World||China again blames India for border friction, talks of challenges in ties||India and China are facing challenges in bilateral ties, the Chinese foreign ministry said on Thursday, blaming New Delhi for the ongoing border friction along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in eastern Ladakh.Common efforts were needed to maintain good relations between China and India, ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying said.Beijing was responding to Indian external affairs minister, S Jaishankar’s statement during an international think-tank interaction on Wednesday, saying bilateral ties are at the “most difficult phase” in the last three to four decades in the backdrop of the months-long impasse at the border.Referring to the ongoing standoff and Beijing’s role in violating existing bilateral agreements to keep the border peaceful, Jaishankar said: “Now for some reason, for which the Chinese have given us five different explanations, the Chinese have violated it.”What began as a military faceoff along the disputed LAC early May has triggered economic and cultural discord between the two neighbours with New Delhi and Beijing grappling for ways to resolve the deadlock.Asked to comment on Jaishankar’s statement, the Chinese foreign ministry – as it has done before – blamed New Delhi for the troubles.“The merits of the situation at the border area is very clear and the responsibility totally lies with the Indian side. China has been strictly observing the agreements signed between the two sides and committed to resolving the border issue through dialogue and we are committed to safeguarding regional peace and tranquillity at border areas,” Hua said.New Delhi has repeatedly dismissed Beijing’s claims, saying it was the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) troops who had illegally trespassed the LAC. External affairs ministry spokesperson Anurag Srivastava had earlier spelt out the Indian government’s position on the disengagement process, saying the LAC “must be strictly respected and observed as this is the basis for peace and tranquillity in the border areas”Spokesperson Hua instead tried to portray China as a victim of aggression from India and said it will protect its territory.“In the meantime, we are determined in safeguarding our territorial sovereignty. We hope India can work with us and contribute to solidarity, cooperation and common development,” she said.“But like all sovereign states we are determined in safeguarding our territorial integrity. So, on the Indian side, I think this is a serious question on what it should reflect upon. There are challenges in bilateral relations but China’s position and policy on India hasn’t changed,” Hua said.Referring to the boundary issue with India, she said: “On the historical issues, China believes that we should find fair, reasonable and mutually acceptable solutions based on equal footed consultation and put it on the proper position in our bilateral relations.”“We hope we can reach consensus, properly manage differences, enhance practical cooperation and bring our bilateral relations back on the right track,” Hua said.On Tuesday, Hua gave no definitive answer when asked when the next rounds of talks between the two countries would be held or what was causing the delay.“China and India have been in communication through diplomatic and military channels on the border issue and we are working for further de-escalation of the border situation,” Hua added.“Based on the implementation of the current consensus, we will have consultations to determine specific arrangements for further talks,” Hua said without giving any indications when future talks will be held.Though the standoff began in May, diplomatic relations have been particularly tense since June, when at least 20 Indian soldiers were killed in Galwan Valley after being attacked by Chinese troops using rocks and clubs.Beijing hasn’t revealed the PLA’s casualty figures.Several rounds of talks including eight military-level dialogues – the last one held on November 8 – have yielded no result as the standoff continues in eastern Ladakh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-again-blames-india-for-border-friction-talks-of-challenges-in-ties/story-V4IuwP0cQNBgM0bk1DiWIP.html

10-12-2020||World||EU trade talks to face ‘moment of finality’ on weekend: UK foreign minister||Britain’s foreign minister said Thursday that negotiations on a trade deal with the European Union will reach a “moment of finality” this weekend, with both sides assessing chances of an agreement as slim.To prepare for a possible no-deal exit on January 1, the EU on Thursday proposed four contingency measures to make sure air and road traffic can continue as smoothly as possible for the next six months.It also proposes that fishermen will still have access to each others waters for up to a year, to limit the commercial damage of a no-deal split. The plans depend on the UK offering similar initiatives.“Our responsibility is to be prepared for all eventualities,” European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said.Von der Leyen and UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson held a three-hour dinner meeting Wednesday in hope of unblocking stalled talks, but came away without making substantial progress.“We understand each other’s positions. They remain far apart,” von der Leyen said.They told their negotiators to keep talking, but set Sunday as decision day.UK Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said the Sunday deadline set by Britain and the EU for a decision was final — though he added “you can never say never entirely.”Without a deal, the bloc and Britain face a tumultuous no-deal split at the end of the month, threatening hundreds of thousands of jobs and billions in losses.Britain left the EU on January 31, but remains in its economic structures until the end of the year. That means a serious economic rupture on January 1 that could be chaotic if there is no trade agreement. A no-deal split would bring tariffs and other barriers that would hurt both sides, although most economists think the British economy would take a greater hit because the UK does almost half of its trade with the bloc.Months of trade talks have failed to bridge the gaps on three issues — fishing rights, fair-competition rules and the governance of future disputes.While both sides want a deal, they have fundamentally different views of what it entails. The EU fears Britain will slash social and environmental standards and pump state money into UK industries, becoming a low-regulation economic rival on the bloc’s doorstep — hence the demand for strict “level playing field” guarantees in exchange for access to its markets.The UK government sees Brexit as about sovereignty and “taking back control” of the country’s laws, borders and waters. It claims the EU is trying to bind Britain to the bloc’s rules indefinitely.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/eu-trade-talks-to-face-moment-of-finality-on-weekend-uk-foreign-minister/story-KqmfeFwZ5Rs41RZpoha9lN.html

The Taliban also operate in the area.In addition to working as a TV and radio presenter, Maiwand was also an activist who advocated for the rights of Afghan women and children.Two Afghan journalists were killed in separate bombings in Afghanistan last month.

Trump had reiterated his claim of electoral fraud and asked why the election results weren’t immediately overturned. While the tweet was promptly flagged by the micro-blogging platform as “disputed”, users noticed a retweet from the official Twitter handle of the Chinese embassy.Interesting retweet pic.twitter.com/5pdxSdPQyuA similar claim was made in September by Chinese embassy in the UK after its ambassador’s official handle liked a pornographic clip. The embassy had then called for an investigation and said that the account was attacked to “deceive the public.”Also Read | China: Trump administration ‘digging hole’ for future relationsThe Trump administration has been at loggerheads with Beijing over Covid-19, treatment of minorities in Xinjiang, Hong Kong crisis, aggression in the South China Sea, and data security. It sanctioned several Chinese officials over the treatment of Uyghur Muslims and ordered the shutdown of China’s Houston Consulate.While foreign interference in US presidential elections remained a major concern for the country’s security agencies, the intelligence assessment had suggested that China doesn’t want Trump to get re-elected. Trump also tried to create a narrative the Democrats are soft on China, but Joe Biden promised to remain “firm” on human rights and other issues. “China has been expanding its influence efforts ahead of November 2020 to shape the policy environment in the United States, pressure political figures it views as opposed to China’s interests, and deflect and counter-criticism of China,” William Evanina, Director of National Counterintelligence and Security Center, told a press conference before the elections.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-s-us-embassy-denies-retweeting-trump-says-twitter-account-hacked/story-3FGmMtQcLyXegUfzf4cYfO.html
10-12-2020||World||African health official slams vaccine inequality, calls it ‘moral inequality’||“It will be extremely terrible to see” rich countries receiving Covid-19 vaccines while African countries go without, especially as a new surge in cases begins on the continent of 1.3 billion people, Africa’s top public health official said Thursday.As the world watches mass vaccinations begin in Britain, Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention director John Nkengasong has warned that Africa might not see vaccines until after the second quarter of 2021.Nkengasong called it a “moral issue” and urged the United Nations to summon a special session to discuss the ethical, fair distribution of vaccines to avoid “this North-South distrust in respect to vaccines, which is a common good.”Covid-19 will not be defeated in the West alone, he said, and he took aim at “today’s dialogue of suspicion” as rich countries buy vaccines “in excess of their needs while we in Africa are still struggling with the COVAX facility,” the multinational initiative designed to deliver at least some vaccines to less developed countries.Africa won’t receive nearly enough vaccines from COVAX to reach the goal of vaccinating 60% of the population to achieve herd immunity, Nkengasong said, and he appealed to countries with excess doses to give them to COVAX or countries in need.“We need to show global cooperation, global solidarity,” he said, “The time to translate those powerful words into action is now.” He has warned that the coronavirus could become endemic in Africa if vaccinations take too long.Africa’s 54 countries now have a total of more than 2.3 million confirmed infections, including 100,000 in the past week.“Clearly the second wave is here, no doubt,” Nkengasong said. He called this“a pivotal moment in the history of our continent” with Africa’s development in the balance.As he spoke, the World Trade Organization was meeting in Geneva on a request by South Africa and India to waive some intellectual property rules to allow for faster, easier access to Covid-19 vaccines around the world.“But a small group of high-income countries and their trading partners have opposed it including Brazil, the European Union, Canada, the United States, Japan and the United Kingdom,” Human Rights Watch said in a statement with Amnesty International supporting the waiver.Rohit Malpani, a Paris-based public health consultant, said opposition to the waiver would further delay the production of vaccines.“We have a situation where donor countries say they’re willing to provide funds to COVAX to buy vaccines but there are none available because of the (intellectual property) issue,” he said.“It’s like inviting someone to dinner and giving them a plate but then keeping all the food.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/african-health-official-slams-vaccine-inequality-calls-it-moral-inequality/story-s93BzVT9W4gtkj62U67qLK.html
10-12-2020||World||EU looking to reinforce climate credentials during summit||Five years after the Paris agreement, the European Union’s climate credentials will be put to the test as the bloc’s leaders meet Thursday to try and seal an agreement to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by at least 55% by the end of the decade compared to 1990 levels.The EU wants to be a leader in the fight against global warming. But the bloc’s heads of states and governments were unable to agree on the new target the last time they met in October, mainly because of financial concerns among eastern countries about how to fund the green transition.But now that the bloc’s leaders are ready to sign off on the EU’s next long-term budget and coronavirus recovery package, the record-high 1.82 trillion-euro package should help secure all 27 member states’ commitment to the improved target proposed by the commission, the EU’s executive arm.Large swaths of the budget and recovery aid are set to pour into programs and investments designed to help the member states, regions and sectors particularly affected by the green transition, which are in need of a deep economic and social transformation.European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen has said she wants 37% of the 750 billion euros in the coronavirus recovery fund to be given to EU countries to spend on environmental objectives, while 30% of the bloc’s regular budget should be used for tackling climate change.Poland, which last year didn’t commit to the EU’s 2050 climate neutrality goal, and other eastern countries, including the Czech Republic and Hungary, largely depend on coal for much of their energy needs. They consider it unfair that all member states should be submitted to the same ambition without taking into consideration their respective energy mixes.László Palkovics, the Hungarian minister for innovation, told local media before the summit that his country was planning to propose a target of a 40% cut in emissions for all member states by 2030, with the remaining 15% to be assumed by the EU as a whole.According to draft conclusions of the summit, member states should agree that the new target “will be delivered collectively by the EU in the most cost-effective manner possible. All Member States will participate in this effort, taking into account considerations of fairness and solidarity, while leaving no one behind.”World leaders agreed five years ago in Paris to keep the global warming increase to below 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit), and ideally no more than 1.5 degrees C (2.7 degrees F) by the end of the century. Under the Paris accord, countries are required to submit updated climate targets by the end of this year.Another delay in revising the EU’s current 40% emission cuts objective for 2030 would also be particularly embarrassing before the virtual Climate Ambition Summit marking five years since the Paris deal. The event on Saturday will be co-hosted by the UK with the United Nations and France. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced last week he wants the UK to cut greenhouse gas emissions by at least 68% from 1990 levels by 2030 — a more ambitious goal than the EU’s.“It’s time for European leaders to deliver,” said ecological activist Adelaïde Charlier, a co-founder of Youth for Climate Belgium. “It’s crucial for the EU if they want to stay leaders, they really have to step up their game.”Greenpeace and other environmental groups have said the improved EU target is insufficient to properly tackle climate change.“To increase the chances of limiting global heating to 1.5°C and avoid the worst effects of climate breakdown, Greenpeace is calling for at least a 65% cut in EU emissions from polluting sectors by 2030,” the NGO said in a statement Thursday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/eu-looking-to-reinforce-climate-credentials-during-summit/story-e2dwZX9DnJKoOquvdnBQDJ.html
10-12-2020||World||Biden to pick Katherine Tai as top trade envoy: Report||President-elect Joe Biden is set to nominate Katherine Tai to be the top US trade envoy, according to two people familiar with his plans.Tai, who is chief trade counsel for the House Ways and Means Committee, will be tapped as the US Trade Representative, according to the two people, who spoke Wednesday on the condition of anonymity because they weren’t authorized to speak publicly about it.The role is a Cabinet position, and the Senate will vote on whether to confirm Tai for the position. Biden’s selection of Tai, who is Asian American, reflects his promise to choose a diverse Cabinet that reflects the makeup of the country.Fluent in Mandarin Chinese, Tai earlier oversaw China trade enforcement for the Office of the US Trade Representative, setting US strategy in trade disputes with China. Biden’s trade representative will inherit a trade war with China, put on pause by an interim trade pact in January that left many of the hardest issues unresolved and US taxes remaining on $360 billion in Chinese imports.As the top trade staffer at Ways and Means, Tai handled negotiations last year with the Trump administration over a revamped North American trade deal. Under pressure from congressional Democrats, Trump’s trade team agreed to strengthen the pact to make it easier for Mexican workers to form independent unions and demand better pay and benefits -- decreasing the incentives for US firms to move south of the border to take advantage of cheap and compliant labor.The administration also dropped from the new US-Mexico-Canada Agreement what Democrats considered a giveaway to pharmaceutical companies that could have kept drug prices high.Tai is considered a problem-solving pragmatist on trade policy, which often breaks down into an ideological divide between free traders and protectionists. In a letter to Biden on Nov. 24, California Democratic Rep. Judy Chu, chair of the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus, and nine other female House members praised Tai’s “experience and diplomatic abilities’’ and said she is “uniquely qualified’’ to deal with Canada and Mexico on the USMCA and with US-China trade tensions.“Katherine would be the first Asian American and the first woman of color to serve in this role, breaking barriers and clearing the way for others to follow,” Chu added in a statement Wednesday.Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., ranking member on the finance committee, called Tai “an inspired choice” for the position.“Ms. Tai has the experience she needs to succeed as USTR, and her record of getting wins for American workers demonstrates she knows how to champion the values that matter to US families,” Wyden said. “She worked closely with me and my staff to craft the strongest ever protections for American workers in a trade agreement, and pass them into law with bipartisan support.”He urged Senate Republicans to quickly confirm her.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-to-pick-katherine-tai-as-top-trade-envoy-report/story-795SWmcrmUVq7rBo9InDeP.html
10-12-2020||World||Trudeau govt didn’t want to cancel military drill with China, reveal secret papers||An aide of Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau had opposed a move by the Canadian military last year to cancel training with China’s People’s Liberation Army (PLA) due to security concerns, according to a media report. Citing secret government documents, The Globe and Mail newspaper reported on Wednesday that Canada’s global affairs department pushed back against a decision by Gen Jonathan Vance, Chief of Defence Staff, to cut interactions with the PLA.Officials at the global affairs department, including then deputy minister of foreign affairs Ian Shugart, were alarmed that Vance had cancelled winter military exercises with the PLA in 2019. Shugart is now clerk of the Privy Council, Canada’s top bureaucrat, who reports directly to Trudeau.The newspaper’s report came against the backdrop of growing global concern over China’s increasingly assertive and aggressive actions, including the standoff with India along the Line of Actual Control (LAC). Canada is also locked in a diplomatic spat with India over Trudeau’s comments supporting the farmers’ protest in India, which the external affairs ministry has described as interference in the country’s internal affairs.The secret Canadian documents suggested that the cutting back of interactions with the PLA could be seen by Beijing as reprisal for the arbitrary arrest of two Canadians.“Should Canada make any significant reductions in its military engagement with China, China will likely read this as a retaliatory move related to the Meng Wanzhou case,” the daily cited a February 2019 memo as saying. The memo was sent to Shugart, outlining the case for a letter he would be sending to Jody Thomas, then deputy minister of national defence.The memo described the move as a decision taken “unilaterally” by the Canadian military, apparently meaning the armed forces did not consult global affairs.“Unilateral decisions to postpone and/or cancel previously agreed DND/CAF cooperation with the PLA risk being interpreted by China or others in an unintended (and unhelpful) way. [This] could also damage Canada’s long-term defence and security relationship with China,” the memo said.Shugart subsequently asked the defence department to check with global affairs before cancelling or postponing any future engagements with the PLA. The US too had raised concerns about joint military exercises that could benefit the PLA, according to the secret documents. An unnamed senior Canadian official was quoted by The Globe as saying that Vance, on the urging of the US, cancelled winter exercises with the PLA and later all military interactions. The February 2019 memo was written months after Canada-China ties went into a tailspin after Beijing locked up two Canadians, former diplomat Michael Kovrig and entrepreneur Michael Spavor, in apparent retribution for Ottawa’s arrest of Meng Wanzhou, chief financial officer of the Chinese tech firm Huawei. Canada had arrested her following a US extradition request.The documents were released through access-to-information law, though the global affairs department said they hadn’t been adequately censored before release owing to human error. Michael Chong, the foreign affairs critic of the opposition Conservative Party, and James Bezan, the defence critic, said the documents showed a “stunning lack of leadership” from Trudeau and the Liberal government. “Clearly, the Prime Minister and Liberal ministers are more concerned about how Beijing might react than in defending Canadian interests. The Liberal government has become so timid that it can’t even say no to Chinese soldiers arriving on our territory,” they said in a statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trudeau-aide-opposed-cancelling-military-drill-with-pla-worried-what-china-will-think/story-DTEh1sadIyUeSsPsY0oHVL.html
10-12-2020||World||Over 80 million people forcibly displaced globally as of mid-2020, Covid further worsened crisis: UN||More than 80 million people were forcibly displaced worldwide as of mid-2020, with existing and new conflicts as well as the Covid -19 pandemic dramatically affecting their lives this year, a UN report has said.According to its report on trends in global forced displacement released on Wednesday in Geneva, The UN Refugee Agency UNHCR estimates that global forced displacement surpassed 80 million at mid-year.At the beginning of this year it said that about 79.5 million people had been forced from their homes due to persecution, conflict, and human rights violations. This total included 45.7 million internally displaced people (IDPs), 29.6 million refugees and others forcibly displaced outside their country, and 4.2 million asylum seekers. “Existing and new conflicts and the novel coronavirus have dramatically affected their lives in 2020,” the UN agency said.An estimated 30–34 million (38-43 per cent) of the 79.5 million forcibly displaced persons are children below 18 years of age (end-2019).More than two thirds of all refugees under UNHCR’s mandate and Venezuelans displaced abroad came from just five countries - as of mid-2020- Syria (6.6 million), Venezuela (3.7 million), Afghanistan (2.7 million), South Sudan (2.3 million) and Myanmar (1 million). Turkey hosts the largest number of refugees, with 3.6 million people. Colombia is second with 1.8 million, including Venezuelans displaced abroad. The agency noted that for people forced to flee, Covid-19 became an additional protection and livelihoods crisis on top of the global public health emergency.“The virus has disrupted every aspect of human life and severely worsened existing challenges for the forcibly displaced and stateless,” UNHCR said, adding that some of the measures to curb the spread of Covid-19 made it harder for refugees to reach safety.At the peak of the first wave of the pandemic in April, 168 countries fully or partially closed their borders, with 90 countries making no exception for people seeking asylum. Since then, and with UNHCR’s support, 111 countries have found solutions to ensure their asylum system is fully or partially operational while ensuring necessary measures are taken to curb the spread of the virus.The agency said despite UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres’ appeal in March for a global ceasefire while the world fights the pandemic, conflicts and persecution continued. “Violence in Syria, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Mozambique, Somalia, and Yemen drove new displacements in the first half of 2020,” it said, adding that significant new displacement has also been registered across Africa’s Central Sahel region as civilians are subjected to brutal violence, including rape and executions.“With forced displacement doubling in the last decade, the international community is failing to safeguard peace,” UN High Commissioner for Refugees Filippo Grandi said. “We are now surpassing another bleak milestone that will continue to grow unless world leaders stop wars,” Grandi said.New asylum applications dropped by a third compared to the same period in 2019. Meanwhile, the underlying factors leading to conflicts globally remain unaddressed, the agency said.“Fewer durable solutions were found for the displaced in 2020 compared to the same period in previous years,” it added.Just 822,600 displaced people returned home, most – 635,000 – were IDPs. With 102,600 voluntary repatriations in the first half of the year, refugee returns dropped by 22 per cent compared to 2019.Resettlement travel for refugees was also on temporary hold due to the Covid-19 restrictions from March to June. Consequently, only 17,400 refugees were resettled in the first six months of 2020, according to government statistics, half the figure of 2019.Although the actual number of stateless people remains unknown, 79 countries in the world have reported 4.2 million stateless people on their territory, UNHCR said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/over-80-million-people-forcibly-displaced-globally-as-of-mid-2020-covid-further-worsened-crisis-un/story-XRwsYxOgewTMB2e1P5gCBI.html

He said Iran had succeeded in building the line despite sanctions imposed by the Trump administration after the US withdrew from Iran’s 2015 nuclear agreement with world powers.Afghan President Ashraf Ghani called the railroad a “precious gift from Iran” that would help restore the Silk Road, an ancient trade route that spread prosperity across Asia.

10-12-2020||World||Tensions rise over masks as virus grips smaller US cities||Arguments over mask requirements and other restrictions have turned ugly in recent days as the deadly coronavirus surge across the US engulfs small and medium-size cities that once seemed safely removed from the outbreak.In Boise, Idaho, public health officials about to vote on a four-county mask mandate abruptly ended a meeting Tuesday evening because of fears for their safety amid anti-mask protests outside the building and at some of their homes.One health board member tearfully announced she had to rush home to be with her child because of the protesters, who were seen on video banging on buckets, blaring air horns and sirens, and blasting a sound clip of gunfire from the violence-drenched movie “Scarface” outside her front door.“I am sad. I am tired. I fear that, in my choosing to hold public office, my family has too often paid the price,” said the board member, Ada County Commissioner Diana Lachiondo. “I increasingly don’t recognize this place. There is an ugliness and cruelty in our national rhetoric that is reaching a fevered pitch here at home, and that should worry us all.”Boise police said three arrest warrants were issued in connection with the demonstrations at board members’ homes.In South Dakota, the mayor of Rapid City said City Council members were harassed and threatened over a proposed citywide mask mandate that failed this week even as intensive care units across the state filled with Covid-19 patients.The tensions are flaring amid an epic surge in US deaths, hospitalizations and infections over the past several weeks.Deaths are running at more than 2,200 a day on average, all but matching the level seen during the last spring’s peak in and around New York City. New cases per day have rocketed to more than 200,000 on average, and the number of patients in the hospital with Covid-19 stood at almost 105,000 on Tuesday, another all-time high.The grim figures led the usually stoic health director of the nation’s most populated county to become emotional. Barbara Ferrer described “a devastating increase in deaths” in Los Angeles County, with the total hitting 8,075 on Wednesday.“Over 8,000 people who were beloved members of their families are not coming back,” Ferrer said, fighting back tears.Meanwhile, protesters in Montana’s Gallatin County have gathered for two consecutive weeks outside the Bozeman home of county health officer Matt Kelley to decry regulations, including a statewide mask mandate. They have carried signs reading, “We refuse to be your experiment” and “Oxygen is essential.”Last week, around 80 people lined Bozeman’s Main Street to support Kelley and other health officials.In Montana’s Flathead County, where officials recorded 17 coronavirus-related deaths over 18 days and resistance to masks runs strong, the interim public health officer is resigning when her contract is up at year’s end, citing a lack of support from local authorities for measures to control the scourge.In Helena, Republicans who control both chambers of the Montana Legislature denied a request by Democratic lawmakers to require masks be worn inside the Capitol during the legislative session next month.In Missouri, Greene County officials recorded 51 Covid-19 deaths in the first eight days of December as hospitals overflow and hundreds of health care workers are quarantined. The area’s two major hospitals asked the city of Springfield, the county seat, to renew the city’s mask mandate before it expires in January. The county itself does not have a mask mandate, nor does the state.As the deaths pile up, Springfield Mortuary Services owner Brian Simmons is overseeing the embalming and cremation of Covid-19 victims as his own 48-year-old daughter battles the virus. She spent the past week hospitalized on a ventilator in one of the city’s overwhelmed hospitals.“You are just helpless,” he said. “There is nothing you can do about it. We haven’t seen her since she’s gone in.”South Dakota has suffered through the country’s worst rate of Covid-19 deaths per capita over the last week, but Gov. Kristi Noem has been ardent in her opposition to mask mandates or other aggressive efforts to slow infections.That hands-off approach drew vocal support at Rapid City Council meetings, even as doctors warned that the only large hospital in the western half of the state is facing a crisis and patients are being flown out of the state. The meetings drew hours of testimony from people who said the dangers of the virus are overblown and that mask requirements violate their liberties.Dr. Stephen Neabore, who works in the biggest hospital system in the region, said he has been frustrated as he tries to persuade people to wear masks. After working in New York City and studying medicine in England, he said, he sees a distinct skepticism toward government around him.“I still see people out here that will tell me that they don’t believe it’s any worse than a common cold,” he said.The City Council in Palmer, Alaska, rejected a mask mandate Friday for the community of 7,300 residents about 45 miles (72 kilometers) north of Anchorage.Opponents questioned the effectiveness of masks, wondered why a mandate more common in larger communities was even being considered, and threatened to take their business online or to the neighboring city of Wasilla, which doesn’t have a mask order.Many implored the City Council not to follow the steps of “liberal” Anchorage in forcing residents to require face coverings.“We are not Anchorage and should not be treated as if we are,” Rhonda Hayhurst said in an email to the council. “I moved out here to get away from tyranny as being imposed by the Anchorage administration.”Coronavirus deaths also have been rising rapidly in rural parts of Iowa, where many people disdain masks. Among the hardest hit is O’Brien County, population 13,800, where 42 deaths have been blamed on the virus.Ty Rushing, who covers the region as managing editor of the Northwest Iowa Review, said obituaries in his newspaper have been piling up.“It’s sad to say, but I think people are just numb to it or they are sticking their head in the sand about it,” Rushing said.In Iowa’s Harrison County, 47 deaths have been attributed to the virus out of population of about 14,000. Most of the deaths have resulted from outbreaks at nursing homes in small towns like Dunlap.Dunlap City Clerk Meredith Van Houten said almost everyone in the town of about 950 people has a connection to those who have died. She said one was her old neighbor.“It’s a horrible time right now,” Van Houten said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/tensions-rise-over-masks-as-virus-grips-smaller-us-cities/story-tIsVfDVzQXH6cgyqD5iysO.html

Duty scheduling for international flights shall be made after giving full consideration to crew members’ psychological conditions, personality, current family life pressures, social support system and other circumstances,” the CAAC recommended.Among the necessary psychological measures to be taken are creating the environment “achieve psycho-social security”.Effective mental health support and assistance shall be provided for aviation staff through cooperation among aeromedical professionals, other medical professionals, psychological professionals and aviation staff, and “a peer-to-peer supportive group shall be promoted among aviation staff to facilitate mutual support and encouragement.”Other advice for the flights includes dividing the cabin into “clean area, buffer zone, passenger sitting area and quarantine area,” separated by disposable curtains.The last three rows should be designated as an emergency quarantine area, said CAAC.While most international flights remain suspended, China’s domestic civil aviation market has shown signs of rapid recovery.A total of 371,000 domestic passenger flights took off in September, up 3.5% from a year ago, Qiao Yibin, an official with the Civil Aviation Administration of China, told a news conference in October.Domestic passenger numbers reached 47.75 million, or 98% of 2019’s levels, Qiao said.Airlines have rolled out promotional deals featuring all-you-can fly packages to fuel a recovery in Chinese passenger numbers, though based on lower fares than the prior year, a Reuters report said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/use-diapers-to-cut-down-toilet-visit-china-tells-flight-cabin-crew/story-l1Uaw3hV7O3ir8K5TduyjN.html

The Australia-India Strategic Research Fund (AISRF) has funded six new projects, including one to develop Covid-19 diagnostic technologies and a study of the longer-term effects on the hearts and lungs of patients who have recovered, the Australian science and industry ministry said on Thursday. The other projects will develop risk management systems to protect farmers from disasters associated with climate change and demonstrate how food-drying technology using renewable energy can reduce pollution in the food processing sector. Australia’s industry, science and technology minister Karen Andrews said work in these important areas will continue after significant delays caused by the pandemic.

Also Read | Drone movement spotted at international border in J-K’s RS Pura sectorKhattak’s case is emblematic of a series of documented enforced disappearances in Pakistan, where many human rights defenders are similarly silenced for their legitimate work of monitoring, documenting and advocating against a range of human rights violations and attacks against minorities.“We welcome the fact that proof of life was demonstrated recently when Mr. Khattak was granted his first contact with the outside world in a short, supervised visit from a family member,” the experts said.“However, additional steps must be taken without delay in order for Mr Khattak’s most fundamental rights to be restored, including his right to an independent medical assessment, his right to unrestricted access to a lawyer, his right to a trial in full compliance with due process and his right not to be detained arbitrarily.”“Unacknowledged detention exposes both the victims and their loved ones to severe and prolonged suffering that may well amount to torture or to other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, in clear violation of Pakistan’s obligations under international law,” the experts said.“All victims and their families have the right to justice, truth and reparations,” said a press release issued by the United Nations. Pakistani authorities have committed to actively engage with Special Procedures. In the case of Mr Khattak, experts have repeatedly raised their concerns directly with the Government and will continue to closely monitor the situation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/un-human-rights-experts-raise-concerns-over-scourge-of-enforced-disappearances-torture-in-pakistan/story-rBpRhrp8nzpvI2LnyGyb1H.html
10-12-2020||World||Canada govt objected to military decision to cancel training with Chinese Army: Reports||The Trudeau government invited the Chinese army for training in Canada last year just months after the arbitrary arrests of two Canadians, including a former diplomat, and was miffed when the military cancelled the drill, media reports have said citing documents.The Peoples Liberation Army (PLA) had been invited for joint training at the Canadian Forces Base (CFB) at Petawawa in the province of Ontario. The exercise was cancelled by Canadian Armed Forces to the chagrin of the government, according to the documents cited by the Globe and Mail, Rebel News and other media outlets.A department of defence official stated in a document, “The winter training will not take place this winter. Future options have not been considered.”Instructions from a general were that the department “tailor a message” that the training could not be conducted “at this time.”However, a note from the Trudeau government to the Armed Forces indicated its displeasure over the cancellation. “Given the heightened scrutiny, any decision by Canada to reduce-cut ties should be carefully considered to avoid sending any unhelpful or unintended messages,” it said.In a Memorandum for Action, Global Affairs Canada, the country’s foreign ministry, noted that the Canadian Armed Forces’ Chief of Defence Staff had “unilaterally elected not to proceed” with the 2019 programme.The cancellation came in the wake of the detention of Meng Wanzhou, a senior executive of the Chinese telecomm giant Huawei in Vancouver on December 1, 2018 in a case related to bank fraud to sidestep sanctions on Iran. Days later, two Canadians, Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor were arrested by China, where they just completed two years in captivity on December 10. Commenting on that, the Memorandum added, “While resolving the consular cases is the Government of Canada’s top priority, ensuring a certain amount of continuity in other parts of the Canada-China relationship remains important.”In another email, Ian Shugart, deputy minister at Global Affairs Canada said it be “consulted before any activities are cancelled/postponed, particularly initiatives previously agreed to between DND/CAF and the People’s Liberation Army.”He added that Canada did not want to be a “partner that is reducing normal bilateral interactions” and there was “still a desire to maintain an ongoing relationship with China, while recognising and managing the risks.” Shugart is currently Clerk to the Privy Council, Canada’s senior-most bureaucrat.A defence official pointed to the concern within the Five Eyes (the intelligence and security alliance including the US, Canada, Australia, United Kingdom and New Zealand) over the “winter survival” exercise with the PLA, while a Global Affairs official questioned, in an email, whether this was connected to the Donald Trump administration’s changed stance towards Beijing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canada-govt-objected-to-military-decision-to-cancel-training-with-chinese-army-reports/story-Ls6WZNOE7q2bp9yqtjbB9L.html
10-12-2020||World||‘Under the rug’: Sexual misconduct shakes FBI’s senior ranks||An assistant FBI director retired after he was accused of drunkenly groping a female subordinate in a stairwell. Another senior FBI official left after he was found to have sexually harassed eight employees. Yet another high-ranking FBI agent retired after he was accused of blackmailing a young employee into sexual encounters.An Associated Press investigation has identified at least six sexual misconduct allegations involving senior FBI officials over the past five years, including two new claims brought this week by women who say they were sexually assaulted by ranking agents.Each of the accused FBI officials appears to have avoided discipline, the AP found, and several were quietly transferred or retired, keeping their full pensions and benefits even when probes substantiated the sexual misconduct claims against them.Beyond that, federal law enforcement officials are afforded anonymity even after the disciplinary process runs its course, allowing them to land on their feet in the private sector or even remain in law enforcement.“They’re sweeping it under the rug,” said a former FBI analyst who alleges in a new federal lawsuit that a supervisory special agent licked her face and groped her at a colleague’s farewell party in 2017. She ended up leaving the FBI and has been diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder.“As the premier law enforcement organization that the FBI holds itself out to be, it’s very disheartening when they allow people they know are criminals to retire and pursue careers in law enforcement-related fields,” said the woman, who asked to be identified in this story only by her first name, Becky.The AP’s count does not include the growing number of high-level FBI supervisors who have failed to report romantic relationships with subordinates in recent years — a pattern that has alarmed investigators with the Office of Inspector General and raised questions about bureau policy.The recurring sexual misconduct has drawn the attention of Congress and advocacy groups, which have called for whistleblower protections for rank-and-file FBI employees and for an outside entity to review the bureau’s disciplinary cases.“They need a #MeToo moment,” said U.S. Rep. Jackie Speier, a California Democrat who has been critical of the treatment of women in the male-dominated FBI.“It’s repugnant, and it underscores the fact that the FBI and many of our institutions are still good ol’-boy networks,” Speier said. “It doesn’t surprise me that, in terms of sexual assault and sexual harassment, they are still in the Dark Ages.”In a statement, the FBI said it “maintains a zero-tolerance policy toward sexual harassment” and that claims against supervisors have resulted in them being removed from their positions while cases are investigated and adjudicated.It added that severe cases can result in criminal charges and that the FBI’s internal disciplinary process assesses, among other factors, “the credibility of the allegations, the severity of the conduct, and the rank and position of the individuals involved.”The AP review of court records, Office of Inspector General reports and interviews with federal law enforcement officials identified at least six allegations against senior officials, including an assistant director and special agents in charge of entire field offices, that ranged from unwanted touching and sexual advances to coercion.None appears to have been disciplined, but another sexual misconduct allegation identified in the AP review of a rank-and-file agent resulted in him losing his security clearance.The FBI, with more than 35,000 employees, keeps a notoriously tight lid on such allegations. The last time the Office of Inspector General did an extensive probe of sexual misconduct within the FBI, it tallied 343 “offenses” from fiscal years 2009 to 2012, including three instances of “videotaping undressed women without consent.”The latest claims come months after a 17th woman joined a federal lawsuit alleging systemic sexual harassment at the FBI’s training academy in Quantico, Virginia. That class-action case claims male FBI instructors made “sexually charged” comments about women needing to “take their birth control to control their moods,” inviting women trainees over to their homes and openly disparaging them.In one of the new lawsuits filed Wednesday, a former FBI employee identified only as “Jane Doe” alleged a special agent in charge in 2016 retired without discipline and opened a law firm even after he “imprisoned, tortured, harassed, blackmailed, stalked and manipulated” her into having several “non-consensual sexual encounters,” including one in which he forced himself on her in a car. The AP is withholding the name and location of the accused special agent to protect the woman’s identity.“It is the policy and practice of the FBI and its OIG to allow senior executives accused of sexual assault to quietly retire with full benefits without prosecution,” the woman’s attorney, David J. Shaffer, alleges in the lawsuit.One such case involved Roger C. Stanton, who before his abrupt retirement served as assistant director of the Insider Threat Office, a division at Washington headquarters tasked with rooting out leakers and safeguarding national security information.According to an Inspector General’s report concluded this year and obtained by AP through a public records request, Stanton was accused of drunkenly driving a female subordinate home following an after-work happy hour. The woman told investigators that once inside a stairwell of her apartment building, Stanton wrapped his arm around her waist and “moved his hand down onto her bottom” before she was able to get away and hustle up the stairs.After Stanton left, he called the woman 15 times on her FBI phone and sent her what investigators described as “garbled text” complaining that he could not find his vehicle. The heavily redacted report does not say when the incident happened.Stanton disputed the woman’s account and told investigators he “did not intend to do anything” and only placed his arm around her because of the “narrowness” of the stairs. But Stanton acknowledged he was “very embarrassed by this event” and “assistant directors should not be putting themselves in these situations.”Stanton retired in late 2018 after the investigation determined he sexually harassed the woman and sought an improper relationship. He did not respond to requests for comment from AP.Earlier this year, the Inspector General found that the special agent in charge of the Albany, New York, office, James N. Hendricks, sexually harassed eight subordinates at the FBI.Hendricks also was not named in the OIG report despite its findings. He was first identified in September by the Albany Times Union. One current and one former colleague of Hendricks confirmed his role in the case to AP.Hendricks now writes a law enforcement blog in which he touts his FBI accolades but makes no mention of the misconduct allegations. He did not respond to requests for comment.Becky, the former analyst, told AP she once believed FBI’s “organizational values and mission aligned with how I was raised.” But she was disabused of that notion after reporting to management that Charles Dick, a supervisory special agent at the FBI Training Academy at the time, sexually assaulted her at a farewell party.Becky told AP her assailant had threatened her at least two times before. “Once while we were waiting for the director he said, ‘I’m going to touch your ass. You know it’s going to happen.’”“His boorish behavior was well known,” she added. “He was getting away with everything.”In a federal lawsuit filed Wednesday, Becky accused the former agent of wrapping his arm around her chest while posing for a photograph and “reaching under her and simulating” penetration of her “with his fingers through her jeans.”Dick denied the charges and was acquitted in state court in Virginia by a judge who ruled it “wholly incredible” that Becky would “stand there and take it and not say anything,” according to a transcript of the proceeding. Dick retired from the FBI months before the Inspector General followed up on Becky’s internal complaint, Becky alleged in her lawsuit, adding she faced retaliation for coming forward.“It’s much easier to suffer in isolation than it is to go public,” she told AP. “But if I don’t report it, I’m complicit in the cultural and institutionalized cover-up of this sort of behavior.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/under-the-rug-sexual-misconduct-shakes-fbi-s-senior-ranks/story-fVyfHKdexG8dEpUGIIbdAI.html

He was deeply committed to his faith, his family, and to serving others with compassion,” Cruz said in his remarks on the Senate floor on Tuesday. “Moved by his Sikh faith, Deputy Dhaliwal was a trailblazer. When he was first recruited by the sheriff’s office, Deputy Dhaliwal petitioned the office to allow him to wear his turban and beard while in uniform, becoming the first to be allowed to do so,” he said. “Dhaliwal’s commitment to his faith will inspire generations of Sikhs and other religious minorities to serve in law enforcement and protect our communities,” he said.On September 27, 2019, Deputy Dhaliwal, 42, was killed in the line of duty in service of his community. In his remarks, Cruz also remembered Dhaliwal’s commitment to love and peace. “When Hurricane Harvey decimated the Texas Gulf Coast, Deputy Dhaliwal served meals to Houstonians who were left homeless. In the wake of Hurricane Maria, he travelled to Puerto Rico to assist in the relief efforts there. He also worked to deliver water and supplies to Punjab, India, while the area was suffering from a severe drought,” he said.“Dhaliwal leaves behind an unmistakably beautiful legacy of a life marked with faith, devotion, and service to others. I am grateful my colleagues have moved to rename the US Postal Office in Houston the ‘Deputy Sandeep Singh Dhaliwal Post Office Building,’ to ensure Deputy Dhaliwal’s selfless service and heroism is remembered,” Cruz said.The US House of Representatives and Senate have passed the bipartisan legislation to rename the post office at 315 Addicks Howell Road in Houston as ‘Deputy Sandeep Singh Dhaliwal Post Office Building.’ The bill is now headed to the White House for it to sign into law by outgoing President Donald Trump.The post office named after Dhaliwal in Houston is only the second US post office to be named after an Indian American. The first one was named after the first Indian American Congressman Dalip Singh Saund in Southern California in 2006.Born in India, Dhaliwal moved to Houston along with his parents. In 2015, Dhaliwal of the Harris County Sheriff’s office became the first Sikh American in Texas to receive a policy accommodation to serve while wearing his articles of faith, including his turban and beard.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/senator-ted-cruz-praises-slain-sikh-police-officer-dhaliwal/story-jPiNho2GSTEmYyYAqYXKfP.html

It took about an hour to put out the fire.South Korea’s forensic agency would investigate the car to identify the cause of the accident, police said.Tesla was not immediately available for comment.In January, the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) said it will review a petition asking the agency to formally investigate and recall 500,000 Tesla vehicles over sudden unintended acceleration reports.The petition covers 2012 through 2019 model year Tesla Model S, 2016 through 2019 Tesla Model X, and 2018 through 2019 Tesla Model 3 vehicles, the agency said.Tesla sold 11,601 cars in South Korea from January to November, sharply up from last year’s 2,430 sales, according to CarIsYou Data Research Institute.The US electric car maker is also under investigation by South Korea’s transport ministry over its autopilot functions, the ministry said earlier this year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/south-korea-investigates-fatal-crash-of-tesla-model-x/story-bLA0V4C7MPBsexkHA9cNXI.html

10-12-2020||World||UK GDP growth slows to six-month low as Covid-19 hit hospitality||Britain’s economic recovery almost ground to a halt in October as a surge in coronavirus cases dealt a blow to the hospitality sector, official figures showed on Thursday.Gross domestic product rose 0.4% on the month after expanding 1.1% in September, the Office for National Statistics said, the weakest growth since output collapsed in April during the first lockdown.Britain has Europe’s highest death toll from Covid-19, with more than 62,000 fatalities, and also suffered the biggest economic hit of any major economy after GDP shrank by an unprecedented 19.8% in the second quarter of this year.Output in October was 7.9% lower than it was in February, before the pandemic struck Britain’s economy, the ONS said, and 8.2% weaker than in October 2019.Government forecasters do not expect the economy to regain its pre-Covid size until the end of 2022 and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development predicted that Britain’s recovery would be weaker than anywhere bar Argentina.“The economy continued to grow in October, but at a snail’s pace. And with the Covid-19 restrictions likely to remain in place for some time, the economy is in for a difficult few months yet,” Ruth Gregory, economist at Capital Economics said.Although the economy picked up rapidly after the initial shock of the lockdown, it lost momentum as Covid cases started to rise again in September and accelerated in October.Government restrictions on socialising in much of the United Kingdom, as well as greater caution from some of the public, led to a 14.4% fall in output across the accommodation and restaurant sector.Business surveys in October had already shown a slowdown in growth, and most economists think output fell outright in November, when the government imposed a four-week partial lockdown in England, which closed non-essential shops and most hospitality venues.However, the decline is expected to be much more limited than in the first lockdown, when restrictions were tighter and businesses had less time to adapt.The end of a post-Brexit transition period will also pose a challenge for many businesses from Jan. 1, when exporters will face new border checks for goods they want to sell in the EU, and potentially tariffs as well.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-gdp-growth-slows-to-six-month-low-as-covid-19-hit-hospitality/story-XBocorblZfUg19J2syLwEP.html

Rolling back Trump-era measures could be difficult however, while giving Republicans the chance to renew accusations that Biden is softening Washington’s stance toward Beijing.“By relentlessly challenging the bottom line of China-US relations on issues concerning China’s core interests, anti-China politicians are not only digging a hole for the next administration’s relationship with China, but also eying their own personal political gains,” Xinhua said.US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has castigated China on almost a daily basis over its policies toward Taiwan, Tibet, Hong Kong, the northwestern region of Xinjiang and the South China Sea.Dozens of officials from mainland China and Hong Kong have been hit with visa bans and other sanctions and new restrictions have been imposed on Chinese diplomats, journalists and academics. Chinese tech giant Huawei has been shut out of the US market and the US has lobbied other countries to follow suit, often successfully.On Wednesday, Pompeo accused US universities of caving to Chinese pressure to blunt or bar criticism of the the Chinese communist party, which he said was “poisoning the well of our higher education for its own ends.” Chinese responded by vowing to impose countervailing measures against American officials, saying US accusations and punitive measures only solidified the Chinese people behind their leaders.Perhaps with an eye toward Biden, who takes office January 20, Xinhua held open the possibility of better relations if Washington changed its approach.“Today, China and the United States should also uphold the spirit of non-conflict, non-confrontation, mutual respect and win-win cooperation,” Xinhua said. “The two must focus on managing their differences, with the top priority being a smooth transition toward stronger China-US relations.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-trump-administration-digging-hole-for-future-relations/story-f9EgWjugI5gyINGWc7HKCM.html

Israel is ready to make 60,000 vaccinations per day, and this is a huge figure, “Netanyahu said in a speech, broadcast by Israeli TV channels.The country’s health authorities will grant the so-called green passport for those inoculated to allow them to move freely, the prime minister added, noting that he plans to get vaccinated first.Earlier in the day, a plane carrying the first doses of the Pfizer / BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine aboard landed at the Ben Gurion airport. In mid-November, Netanyahu announced the signing of a contract with Pfizer to secure two-dose jabs for 4 million of its citizens.Apart from the contract with Pfizer, Israel also has deals with US biotechnology company Moderna and other vaccine manufacturers. In addition, the country launched clinical trials of its own vaccine in November. Phase 3 is scheduled for April-May.Earlier, Jerusalem’s Hadassah Medical Center, one of Israel’s most authoritative medical facilities, said it had ordered 1.5 million doses of Russian-made coronavirus vaccine Sputnik V, with the deliveries pending the ministry’s approval. If the ministry refuses authorization, Hadassah plans to use the vaccine in its foreign branches.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/israel-to-start-mass-vaccination-against-covid-19-in-late-december/story-XdUDgzwLcn9Rvnlq4hqmEM.html

You only have to listen to what he says. He says he wants total control at home, and to make China the number one power abroad. And he’s well on his way to working on that project,” Pompeo said.“He’s building up the People’s Liberation Army. He’s manipulating international organisations for Beijing’s benefit. And he’s engaging – as we have seen in TV only just these last two days, he’s engaging in a vast influence campaign all across the world,” the top US diplomat said.Xi, 67, has amassed power the likes of which has not been since Chairman Mao Zedong. He is now President, General Secretary of the CPC and Chairman of the Central Military Commission. In 2018, China’s Parliament removed the two-term limit on presidency, allowing Xi to remain in power for life.“The Chinese communists used the wealth that was created by this to tighten their grip on power, their grip on power over the Chinese people, and to build a high-tech repressive state like the world has never seen,” he said.The US last week imposed visa restrictions on Chinese officials and individuals engaged in overseas influence operations, the latest punitive measures against China by the outgoing Trump administration.The restrictions are the latest measure taken against China’s leadership and economy in response to sharpening disputes over human rights, the coronavirus pandemic, trade, technology, Taiwan and a host of other issues.Pompeo said that over the past year, he has talked to America’s governors in Washington about this, state legislators in Wisconsin, tech leaders in Silicon Valley, and many other groups.“And that may for some of you sitting at home today seem like a long way away and a very ambitious touch for Xi Jinping to make, but I must say he has his eye on each and every one of us,” he told the students of Georgia Tech in his virtual address.“Just think about it. Chinese Communist Party scientists aren’t pioneering cancer cures. We are. And it’s not North Korean biochemists that are producing safe Covid vaccines. We are. And Iranians aren’t ahead in supercomputing. No. In fact, we are. It is the free world and free peoples that produce these superior results. And we should be very proud of that fact,” he said.“But we have an obligation to protect it, to preserve it, to make sure that that’s the case 10 and 50 and 100 years from now,” he said.Pompeo said that the Chinese Communist Party knows it can never match American innovation.“It has state-owned enterprises; it’s an authoritarian regime; it is a government-centric focus. That’s why it sends 400,000 students a year to the United States of America to study – 400,000 students a year studying in our universities come from one country. It is no accident,” he said.“Much of the high-end industrial base inside of China is based on stolen technology, or technology purchased from other nations. It’s not home-grown. Beijing doesn’t want Chinese researchers to stay here in the United States. Indeed, after they’re trained, they want them to come back. They want to induce their return for the singular purpose of serving the Socialist Motherland,” he added.“Look, the Party’s propaganda apparatus cannot tolerate pesky Americans or Chinese nationals exposing its bankrupt system, or the fact that the Chinese people can actually flourish when they are in free societies. It doesn’t want you to know what I’m about to tell you,” he said.The Communist Party of China, he said, doesn’t just target Chinese nationals, they want to influence American students as well, professors and administrators too.“Look, they know that left-leaning college campuses are rife with anti-Americanism, and present easy targets for their anti-American messaging,” he said.“That’s why they planted Confucius Institutes on our campuses. And under President Trump, our State Department has made very clear these Confucius Institutes are literally up to no good. Many have gone away. Many campuses have seen that and they’ve chosen to close down these institutes. But right here in Georgia, Wesleyan College still has one in Macon,” he asserted.“Look, it’s why there are groups on campuses called Chinese Students and Scholars Associations here too. They’re directed and almost always funded by the Chinese Embassy or a local Chinese consulate. Its purpose: to keep tabs on students and to press pro-Beijing causes,” he said. Beijing has previously criticised Pompeo for his anti-China and anti-CPC remarks. “Pompeo’s continuous fabrication of political lies to smear and attack China exposed his deep-rooted ideological prejudices and his nature of a politician to seek personal gains, a Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson said in November.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/xi-jinping-wants-to-make-china-the-number-one-power-abroad-mike-pompeo/story-xgBUe0lrpfE3lZ5MttEsyK.html
10-12-2020||World||Gates Foundation pledges additional $250 million to deliver coronavirus vaccines; total Covid funding at $1.75 billion||The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation announced it will commit an additional $250 million to strengthen global efforts to end the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic. This brings the foundation’s total funding to the Covid-19 response to $1.75 billion, with today’s $250 million representing the largest single pledge. This funding will support continued innovation to develop tests, treatments, and vaccines that are easier to scale up in different, including low-resource-settings. The commitment will also support the delivery of new Covid-19 tests, treatments, and vaccines, particularly in low- and middle-income countries. The foundation also called for global commitments to making these innovations available in 2021 to everyone who needs them. “Everyone, everywhere deserves to benefit from the science developed in 2020,”said Melinda Gates, co-chair of the Gates Foundation. “We are confident that the world will get better in 2021, but whether it gets better for everyone depends on the actions of the world’s leaders and their commitment to deliver tests, treatments, and vaccines to the people who need them, no matter where they live r how much money they have,” she said. It will enable countries to use cutting- edge technology and delivery systems to plan and implement the rollout of vaccines. It will also support efforts to engage communities in the process to increase trust and improve communication about new Covid-19 interventions. “Thanks to the ingenuity of the global scientific community, we are achieving the exciting medical breakthroughs needed to end the pandemic,” said Bill Gates, co-chair of the Gates Foundation. “We have new drugs and more potential vaccines than we could have expected at the start of the year. But these innovations will only save lives if they get out into the world.” To address the logistical challenge previously unmatched in scale and complexity, the world can draw on the expertise of global organisations like Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance and the Global Fund, which have collaborated with governments to deliver vaccines, tests, and treatments against infectious diseases to people in lower-income countries for 20 years. “The next phase of fighting this pandemic will be much costlier than the initial development of safe and effective vaccines. Our commitment today is only a fraction of what is needed and will be focused on the areas where philanthropy can best add value,” said Gates.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/gates-foundation-pledges-additional-250-million-to-deliver-coronavirus-vaccines-total-covid-funding-at-1-75-billion/story-j5XnA3nRP6w5aRexx21JnK.html

10-12-2020||World||Trump virus coordinator Deborah Birx seeks role in Biden government||When Dr. Deborah Birx was brought into President Donald Trump’s orbit to help fight the coronavirus pandemic, she had a sterling reputation as a former US Army physician, a globally recognized AIDS researcher and a rare Obama administration holdover.Less than 10 months later, as Trump’s time in office nears its end, the White House coronavirus task force coordinator’s reputation is frayed. And after serving every president since Ronald Reagan, her future in the incoming Joe Biden administration is uncertain.Over the course of the pandemic, Birx drew criticism from public health experts and Democratic lawmakers for not speaking out forcefully against the president when he contradicted advice from medical advisers and scientists about how to fight the virus.On everything from Trump’s aversion to masks to his dangerous suggestion that ingesting bleach might ward off the virus, critics and backers say Birx stepped carefully to try to maintain her influence in hopes of pushing the president to listen to the scientists.“The president’s departure from reality become so extreme that it put her and others on the task force in an untenable position,” said Michael Weinstein, who heads the AIDS Healthcare Foundation and got to know Birx professionally after she was named the global AIDS coordinator in 2014.“History will have to judge whether they enabled the president by giving him credibility based on their expertise or whether she and the others did more in helping prevent more people from being hurt by the craziness,” he said.Birx has made clear that she wants to stick around to help the Biden administration roll out vaccines and persuade the American people to be inoculated.She has reached out to Biden advisers in recent days as she tries to make the case for a role in the incoming president’s virus response effort, according to a person familiar with the Biden team’s personnel deliberations and a Trump administration coronavirus task force official. Both spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss internal discussions.Birx has conveyed that, at best, she envisions herself in a scaled-back role as Biden shapes his own team. Biden has already appointed transition co-chair and Obama administration alumnus Jeffrey Zients to serve as White House coronavirus coordinator. But Birx’s reluctance to publicly challenge Trump when he downplayed the virus has left some in Biden’s transition skeptical that she retains credibility with the public, according to the person familiar with Biden transition deliberations.Speaking at a Wall Street Journal CEO conference on Tuesday, Birx, a public servant for 40 years, said she planned to remain in government but has yet to hear from the Biden transition team about how or if she’ll be used on the pandemic.Birx was pulled away from her ambassadorial post as the US global AIDS coordinator to assist the task force. She worked alongside her mentor, Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation’s top infectious-disease expert, who was less hesitant to directly contradict questionable statements by Trump. She was appointed to the AIDS post in 2014 by President Barack Obama, and it is up to Biden whether to return her to that position.“I think the one thing I bring to this is really understanding epidemics around the globe,” she said.The Biden transition team declined to comment. A White House task force spokesman said Birx was unavailable for comment.Birx certainly had fans in Biden’s orbit before and immediately after she was tapped to serve as coronavirus coordinator in the Trump White House.Biden’s chief of staff, Ron Klain, called Birx “great.” Former Secretary of State John Kerry, who will serve as a special envoy on climate for Biden, described Birx at her 2014 swearing-in ceremony to serve as the US global AIDS coordinator as someone who “embodies the best of what it means to be a pioneer, to be a practitioner, and a public servant all rolled into one.”In her coronavirus task force role, Birx faced criticism for defending Trump after he suggested during an April briefing that ultraviolet light and ingesting disinfectants could serve as treatment for the virus. Birx explained that Trump “likes to talk that through out loud and really have that dialogue.”Birx urged Trump to follow the data as he pushed to relax social distancing restrictions. She wasn’t above flattering the president. She faced criticism after she said in a television interview early in the crisis that Trump’s “ability to analyze and integrate data that comes out of his long history in business has really been a real benefit during these discussions about medical issues.”Jeremy Konyndyk, now a member of the Biden transition’s Health and Human Services team, applauded Birx’s appointment early in the crisis. But Konyndyk, who led USAID’s Office of US Foreign Disaster Assistance in the Obama administration, soon became a critic.“My confidence in Dr. Birx has been eroding in recent weeks,” Konyndyk tweeted after Birx defended Trump’s decision in April to suspend funding for the World Health Organization. “But with this, it is lost. This statement is not credible as public health analysis, and is clearly not intended to be.”Weeks later, Konyndyk tweeted that Birx “has repeatedly undermined her scientific credibility, publicly, in order to shield the President.”By late summer, Birx’s stock in Trump’s eyes also diminished.Trump was irate with Birx for what he called a “pathetic” response to criticism from House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. The Democratic speaker said in early August that she had “no confidence” in Birx for not pushing back harder on the president as he repeatedly diminished the impact of the virus.Days later, Trump brought on as a pandemic adviser Dr. Scott Atlas, a neuroradiologist and fellow at Stanford University’s conservative Hoover Institution and a critic of virus-related restrictions on the economy. Birx’s public role at the White House was sharply reduced after that, and she spent recent months traveling the country urging states to be more aggressive in fighting the virus.In recent days, Birx has herself become more pointed in her criticism of Trump.Asked during an appearance on NBC’s “Meet the Press” on Sunday about officials in the Trump administration repeatedly flouting public health experts’ pleas for Americans to avoid large gatherings and commit to wearing face masks, Birx voiced concern about leaders “parroting myths.”“And I think our job is to constantly say those are myths, they are wrong and you can see the evidence base,” Birx said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-virus-coordinator-deborah-birx-seeks-role-in-biden-government/story-f1KFYuHIV6a16NIDsBU5uJ.html
10-12-2020||World||US sets new grim record with over 3,000 Covid deaths in single day||The US has set a new grim record of more than 3,000 Covid -19 related deaths in a single day, reflecting a bleak reminder of the pandemic’s devastating toll, even as two coronavirus vaccine candidates appear to be on the verge of clearing the country’s final regulatory hurdles. According to The Covid Tracking Project, the US on Wednesday reported as many 3,054 reported deaths -- the highest single-day total to date. The previous single-day record was on May 7 at 2,769 deaths, it said.Overall, there were 1.8 million tests reported on Wednesday, 210,000 cases, and a record 106,688 Covid -19 patients in US hospitals, it said. The 7-day average for Covid -19 deaths are at an all-time high as deaths are rising throughout the country, it said.So far more than 15 million Americans have been infected with Covid -19 and 286,249 people have lost their lives, according to Johns Hopkins University. The US, the worst-affected country by the coronavirus pandemic, is in the final stages of approving at least two Covid -19 vaccines -- one by Pfizer and BioNTech and another by Moderna.The US Food and Drug Administration’s Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee is scheduled to meet on Thursday to give emergency use authorisation to the Pfizer vaccine.“Based on current production schedules, we expect to have enough doses to vaccinate 20 million Americans by the end of this year, 50 million total by the end of January, and at least 100 million total by the end of the first quarter,” Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar told reporters at a news conference.Within 24 hours of an emergency use authorisation (EUA) by the FDA, the vaccine could be shipped out to distribution sites across the United States to make it available to the Americans who need it the most, said Army Gen Gustave Perna, chief operating officer of Operation Warp Speed.“Our goal is to make sure that we can ensure the vaccine is delivered in a timely manner, is to be delivered safely, securely, and it’s ready to be utilized to start administering the vaccine as soon as possible,” Perna said.On Tuesday, the FDA released an internal assessment of the Pfizer vaccine’s trial data. The FDA assessment showed that the vaccine was around 95 per cent effective, was efficacious across different groups, including the elderly and people with comorbidities, and did not show any significant safety concerns. Perna said that he had given permission to distribute syringes and needles, alcohol wipes and dilutant, which is required in support of the Pfizer vaccine. “We’ll begin that today. The distribution will be completed by Friday, again only to set conditions. And if it sits there for another week or 10 days or whatever, then it does. But planning for success, we wanted to make sure that the states had all that they needed to have,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-sets-new-grim-record-with-over-3-000-covid-deaths-in-single-day/story-7xTcFVdgpNye7Vu6aiy9nO.html

From the global pandemic to the US elections, the Year in Search continues to recapitulate the top search trends.The list of top searches on Google included coronavirus, US election results and Indian Premier League (IPL) among others.Globally, ‘coronavirus’ was the top search, while IPL surpassed all other queries in 2020 and became the top trending query on Google in India. Searches on Kobe Bryant and Zoom also made to the list of top trending queries on Google.Meanwhile, coronavirus, election results, Iran, Beirut and Hantavirus were top trending news searches on Google.Other important news events that triggered heavy search activity included the unprecedented lockdown, Nirbhaya case, Beirut explosion, bushfires in Australia, and locust swarm attack.The most interesting search terms were centred around ‘How to’ and ‘What is’ lists. ‘How to make paneer?’ and ‘How to increase immunity?’ topped the list, followed by the distinctive ‘How to make dalgona coffee.’ ‘What is’ queries included the baffling ‘What is Binod?’, followed by many virus-related queries such as ‘What is plasma therapy?’ and ‘What is hantavirus?’.Google also created a recap video to highlight the ‘Year in Search 2020’ in audio-visual format. The three-minute video shows the uncertainty we had this year and how it made us curious about different things.It is important to note that Google provided its ‘Year in Search’ results on the basis of spikes it received in traffic for particular queries between January 1 and November 10. This means that the queries pointed out by the search giant aren’t the most searched or top search topics on the Google site.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/google-year-in-search-2020-coronavirus-ipl-among-top-global-trends/story-5asAaH688UQTTln5n5Y3TP.html

Biegun expressed continued belief in the need for a “complete recasting of relations” between the two longtime enemies, while acknowledging it “has yet to deliver the success we hoped for.”“You might wonder if I am disappointed that we did not accomplish more over the past two years. I am,” Biegun told the Asan Institute research center. “Regrettably, much opportunity has been squandered by our North Korean counterparts over the past two years, who too often have devoted themselves to the search for obstacles to negotiations instead of seizing opportunities for engagement.”North Korea’s nuclear arsenal remains among the biggest foreign policy challenges awaiting US President-elect Joe Biden despite Trump’s decision to hold face-to-face summits with the North Korean leader. Despite Kim’s vague commitment in 2018 to “work toward complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula,” he has continued to advance his nuclear weapons program.The two sides have made little progress since Trump walked out of his last summit with Kim in Hanoi in early 2019. Kim has since resumed launches of short-range ballistic missiles and in October paraded the world’s largest road-mobile intercontinental ballistic missile through the streets of Pyongyang.North Korea has long demanded a step-by-step and synchronized denuclearization process where it gets compensated during the process of denuclearization. Washington had wanted a commitment to complete denuclearization before economic sweeteners.Biegun, who was making a four-day trip to Seoul before leaving office next month, urged Kim to return to talks.“We do not expect North Korea to do everything before we do anything, nor should North Korea expect such an outcome from us,” he said. “But, we must agree to lay out a road map for action, and we must agree on where that road map ultimately leads.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-s-top-north-korea-envoy-urges-kim-to-return-to-talks/story-rvi4uKeoTOihiS8x3S728N.html
10-12-2020||World||Indian-American Pramila Jayapal elected as chair of powerful Congressional Progressive Caucus||Indian-American Congresswoman Pramila Jayapal has been elected as the chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus (CPC), making her one of the most powerful US lawmakers for the 117th Congress.Jayapal, 55, who was elected on Wednesday, said that the caucus is going to advance racial justice, tackle poverty and inequality and help transform the country.  “As a lifelong organiser, I am honoured that my colleagues have elected me to lead the Congressional Progressive Caucus at this pivotal moment,” Jayapal said soon after her election to this most powerful Congressional Caucus, which is slated to play an influential role during the next Biden Administration.Joe Biden, 78, is due to take over as the 46th president of the US on January 20. “We have massive crises knocking at our nation’s door, and the work of the Progressive Caucus has never been more important. The American people need Congress to lead with vision, conviction, empathy, and dedication to people and families in every community who are struggling right now,” said Jayapal.The incoming Executive Board of CPC is made up of 26 members – one Chair, one Deputy Chair, one Whip, two Chair Emeriti, two Special Order Hour Conveners, ten Vice Chairs, one Executive Board Member At-Large and eight Deputy Whips.The CPC Executive Board is representative of the diversity within the caucus – more than half of Executive Board members are people of colour and more than half are women.Incoming CPC Deputy Chair Congresswoman Katie Porter said that in 2018, many of her Democratic colleagues and she successfully ran campaigns rooted in progressive values.“Rather than shying away from our core principles, we embraced them— making it clear that a progressive agenda is not only the right policy for America, but also a winning political message,” she said.CPC Whip Congresswoman Ilhan Omar said, “we have a unique opportunity to fight for transformative change in the 117th Congress— whether that is addressing the coronavirus pandemic, passing universal healthcare, tackling the climate crisis or reorienting our foreign policy.” “I look forward to continuing to represent my colleagues in building an effect progressive voting bloc in Congress alongside fearless leaders like Reps. Pramila Jayapal and Katie,” she said.Among others, Indian-American Congressman Ro Khanna has been elected as Deputy Whip, while Congresswoman Rashida Talib as vice chair for member services.“We have massive crises knocking at our nation’s door and our work has never been more important. It’s time for Congress to act boldly and restore power to where it belongs: with the people,” Jayapal said in a tweet.“Together, our caucus is going to deliver real relief to families, advance racial justice, tackle poverty and inequality, champion climate justice, and help transform this country so working people can finally get ahead. Let’s get to work,” Jayapal said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/indian-american-pramila-jayapal-elected-as-chair-of-powerful-congressional-progressive-caucus/story-HnjS8K2gmd7LYzMqLhdMxL.html
10-12-2020||World||Biden’s son under investigation; Trump goes to Supreme Court on election||US president-elect’s son Hunter Biden, who had been a target of intense Republican attacks during the presidential election, said on Wednesday he was under federal investigation over his taxes.“I learned yesterday for the first time that the US attorney’s office in Delaware advised my legal counsel, also yesterday, that they are investigating my tax affairs,” Hunter Biden said in a statement released by the Biden-Harris transition team.“I take this matter very seriously but I am confident that a professional and objective review of these matters will demonstrate that I handled my affairs legally and appropriately, including with the benefit of professional tax advisors,” he added.The Biden-Harris transition team said in an accompanying statement that President-elect Joe Biden “is deeply proud of his son, who has fought through difficult challenges, including the vicious personal attacks of recent months, only to emerge stronger”.No further details were made available by the transition team but news reports suggested the investigation had been underway for some time now but it had not been made public because of the elections, which were completed on November 3, under justice department rules.President Donald Trump and his Republican allies had used Hunter Biden’s foreign business dealings to smear his father. They had alleged, without presenting verifiable evidence, he had landed lucrative deals in Ukraine in 2015, where he sat on the board of an energy company with a fancy compensation package, because of his father who was then vice-president. They had also accused the only surviving son of Biden (Beau Biden, the elder son died of brain cancer in 2015) of influence peddling in China. The evidence they had produced, as published by a New York tabloid, was dodgy and failed to make any headway outside of the Trump echo chamber.Hunter Biden’s admission to being investigated came amidst continuing efforts by President Donald Trump to overturn his election defeat, undeterred by a dismal run of court losses.Trump on Wednesday requested the US Supreme Court to allow him to intervene as a party in his capacity as a candidate for re-election in a lawsuit filed by Texas’s Republican attorney general seeking the rejection of the election outcomes in Georgia, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and Michigan, the four battleground states that were instrumental in consigning Trump to history as a one-term president.Texas AG Ken Paxton argued in his partisan lawsuit that election rules that were changed by these four states to make it easier for people to vote in view of the Covid-19 pandemic were unconstitutional. The suit, which makes a post-facto argument that is doomed to fail, has been joined by 17 other states; all of them were filed by Republicans officials.Trump has made a flurry of fraudulent and baseless claims of election irregularities to challenge his defeat, which was not even close. He lost the popular vote by more than 7 million and the Electoral College by 232-306, the same tally that he had won in 2016 and had called a landslide. All 50 states and DC had certified their results by Tuesday deadline, and their 538 electors will vote on Monday — separately in their states — to elect Biden.Trump’s intervention in the Texas case was announced by his campaign in a statement from his new attorney, John Eastman, who had earlier suggested falsely, reprising a racist conspiracy theory, that Indian-descent Kamala Harris was not qualified for the vice-presidency and the presidency because she was born to immigrants who had not become naturalised citizens at the time of her birth. “I think his intervention in this case strengthens an already very strong original action by the state of Texas,” Eastman said.The Supreme Court summarily and unanimously dismissed a lawsuit by a Republican ally of Tromp to block the certification of election results in in the battleground state earlier in the week. Legal experts contended the Texas lawsuit with Trump and 17 other states on its coattails was headed for the same dustbin.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-s-son-under-investigation-trump-goes-to-supreme-court-on-election/story-fw70xmuVWNwEXMh6w4j7CM.html

The announcement was made at Florida’s Kennedy Space Centre, beneath one of only three remaining Saturn V moon rockets from the 1960s and 1970s Apollo programme.My fellow Americans, I give you the heroes of the future who will carry us back to the moon and beyond, the Artemis generation, Pence told the small crowd, seated several feet apart from one another.Five of the astronauts the only ones in attendance walked onto the stage, waving and wearing masks.NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine stressed there would be more astronauts joining the group. NASA has 47 active astronauts.The space agency is aiming for a moon landing by 2024, although the chances of that happening are growing increasingly dim. The upcoming change in administration also adds uncertainty.Half of the NASA astronauts have spaceflight experience. Two are at the International Space Station right now: Kate Rubins and Victor Glover.The two astronauts who performed the world’s first all-female spacewalk last year made the cut: Christina Koch and Jessica Meir.It’s a fairly young group, with most in their 30s or 40s. The oldest is 55, the youngest 32. Only two Joe Acaba and Stephanie Wilson flew on NASA’s old space shuttles.The other experienced members on the list include Kjell Lindgren, Anne McClain and Scott Tingle, both former space station residents.Among those yet to rocket into space: Kayla Barron, Raja Chari, Matthew Dominick, Woody Hoburg, Jonny Kim, Nicole Mann, Jasmin Moghbeli, Frank Rubio and Jessica Watkins.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nasa-picks-18-astronauts-including-the-first-ever-woman-to-set-foot-on-moon/story-nhWpwyCi2lK0yjMVswBsgM.html

The ministry said importers will be required to pay a deposit of 6.3% to 6.4%, effective Friday, pending a final ruling.Also Read |  Australia scrambles to find customers outside Chinese for its cottonThat is on top of taxes of more than 200% imposed earlier on Australian wine, which the country’s trade minister said would make it unsellable in China.China’s foreign ministry has demanded Australia take unspecified steps to repair relations.Beijing increasingly uses access to its populous market as leverage to extract concessions from its neighbors and increase its strategic influence.Chinese leaders were irked by Australia’s decision to pursue a mutual defense treaty with Japan, which Beijing sees as a strategic rival, and to join Asian governments and the United States in objecting to China’s claims to most of the South China Sea, one of the world’s busiest trade routes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-slaps-more-taxes-on-australian-wine-amid-tension/story-fXJOv3AICezOBq64vTkPUJ.html
10-12-2020||World||Australia scrambles to find customers outside Chinese for its cotton||Australia is seeking to boost demand for its cotton from countries such as Vietnam as tensions with China threaten to leave Canberra with large stockpiles, sources familiar with the plan said on Thursday.In October, Chinese cotton mills were ordered to stop buying Australian cotton, threatening a trade worth about A$900 million ($672.30 million) amid escalating tensions between the two countries.Australian producers didn’t immediately feel the impact, however, as their country had little stocks to sell after a sustained drought led to record low production.But since then, rains soaked Australia’s east coast, and the country’s growers are on course to produce 506,000 tones of cotton - the highest since 2018 - leaving exporters scrambling to find alternative markets.“China typically takes 60% of Australian exports. We are working to boost buying from Vietnam, Thailand and other Asian countries,” said a source familiar with the plan, speaking anonymously because he is not authorised to speak to the media.Australia will begin harvesting its 2020/21 crop in April, giving exporters several months to line up new customers.Australia’s relationship with China soured in 2018 when it became the first country to ban China’s Huawei from its 5G network, and worsened this year when Australia called for an enquiry into the origins of the coronavirus.As ties deteriorated, China imposed tariffs on Australian barley and slowed its imports of Australian beef and coal.China will also temporarily impose anti-subsidy fees on some Australian wine imports starting Dec. 11, ramping up pressure on the industry.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/australia-scrambles-to-find-customers-outside-chinese-for-its-cotton/story-3hWF5UsO8JRr5dRQewZFcL.html

The illustration was done by Manchester-based artist Camilla Ru.On this today 41 years ago, Lewis was jointly awarded the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economics for his work to model the economic forces that impact developing countries.Although Lewis faced racial discrimination, in 1932, he won a government scholarship and set out to study at the London School of Economics, where he eventually earned a doctorate in industrial economics.He was the first Black faculty member at the London School of Economics, first Black person to hold a chair in a British university, and the first Black instructor to receive full professorship at Princeton University.He was born on January 23, 1915, in the Caribbean island of St Lucia. His parents, both school teachers, were immigrants from Antigua. He complete his school curriculum at the age of 14 and went to work as a clerk in the civil service. In 1932, he won a government scholarship and went on to study at the London School of Economics. Despite facing racial discrimination, at the age of 33, he became a full professor - one of the highest distinctions of a tenured professor.Lewis contributed immensely to the United Nations and shared his expertise as an adviser to governments in Africa, Asia, and the Caribbean. He also helped establish and served as the first president of the Caribbean Development Bank.In honour of his lifelong achievements, the British government knighted Lewis in 1963.Besides commemorating important events and festivals, Google also celebrates renowned personalities every now and then whose contribution to the field of science, history and various other fields are significant.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/google-celebrates-nobel-prize-winning-economist-sir-w-arthur-lewis-with-a-doodle/story-vdm5vEA0dQni2gTwNKqeOP.html
10-12-2020||World||Trump administration set to execute 1st of 5 inmates before Biden inauguration||The Trump administration is planning an unprecedented five more federal executions before President-elect Joe Biden’s inauguration, starting with a Texas street-gang member set to be put to death Thursday for his role in the 1999 slayings of an Iowa religious couple whose bodies he burned in the trunk of their car.Brandon Bernard was 18 when he and four other teenagers abducted and robbed Todd and Stacie Bagley on their way from a Sunday service in Killeen, Texas. He would be the ninth federal inmate put to death since July, when President Donald Trump ended a 17-year hiatus in federal executions.If Bernard, now 40, receives a lethal injection as planned at the federal prison in Terre Haute, Indiana, it would be a rare execution of a person who was in his teens when the crime occurred.Federal executions during a presidential transfer of power also are rare, especially during a transition from a death-penalty proponent to a president-elect like Biden opposed to capital punishment. The last time executions occurred in a lame-duck period was during the presidency of Grover Cleveland in the 1890s.Defense attorneys have argued in court and in a petition for clemency from Trump that Bernard was a low-ranking, subservient member of the group. They say both Bagleys were likely dead before Bernard doused their car with lighter fluid and set it on fire, a claim that conflicts with government testimony at trial. Bernard, they say, has repeatedly expressed remorse.“I can’t imagine how they feel about losing their family,” Bernard said about surviving Bagley relatives in a 2016 video statement from death row. “I wish that we could all go back and change it.” He also described taking part in youth outreach programs and embracing religion, saying, “I have tried to be a better person since that day.”The case has prompted calls for Trump to intervene, including from one prosecutor at his 2000 trial who now says racial bias may have influenced the nearly all-white jury’s imposition of a death sentence against Bernard, who is Black. Several jurors have also since said publicly that they regret not opting for life in prison instead.Reality TV star Kim Kardashian is among those who have asked Trump to stop the execution, saying in a series of recent tweets that Bernard’s “role was minor compared to that of the other teens involved.”The Justice Department refused to delay Thursday’s execution of Bernard, another inmate on Friday and three more in January, even after eight officials who participated in an execution last month tested positive for the coronavirus. The eight federal executions in 2020 already is more than in the previous 56 years combined.One of Bernard’s co-defendants, Christopher Vialva, was executed in September. Todd Bagley’s mother, Georgia, released a statement after that execution, saying, “I believe when someone deliberately takes the life of another, they suffer the consequences for their actions.”Prosecutors said Vialva, the oldest of the teens at 19, was the ringleader who shot the Bagleys, as they lay in the trunk before Bernard set the car on fire.The teenagers, three of whom were under 18, approached the Bagleys in the afternoon on June 21, 1999, and asked them for a lift after they stopped at a convenience store — planning all along to rob the couple. After the Bagleys agreed, Vialva pulled a gun and forced them into the trunk.The Bagleys, both of whom were in their 20s, spoke through an opening in the back seat and urged their kidnappers to accept Jesus as they drove around for hours trying to use the Bagleys’ ATM cards. After the teens pulled to the side of the road, Vialva walked to the back and shot the Bagleys in the head.The central question in the decision to sentence Bernard to death was whether Vialva’s gunshots or the fire set by Bernard killed the Bagleys.Trial evidence showed Todd Bagley likely died instantly. But a government expert said Stacie Bagley had soot in her airway, indicating smoke inhalation and not the gunshot killed her. Defense attorneys have said that assertion wasn’t proven. They’ve also said Bernard believed both Bagleys were dead and that he feared the consequences of refusing the order of the higher ranking Vialva to burn the car to destroy evidence.The first series of federal executions over the summer were of white men, which critics said seemed calculated to make them less controversial amid summer protests over racial discrimination. Four of the five inmates set to die before Biden’s Jan. 20 inauguration are Black men. The fifth is a white woman who would be the first female inmate executed by the federal government in nearly six decades.The federal prosecutor who now wants a life term for Bernard, Angel Moore, says recent research shows people tend to view Blacks as more to blame than their white counterparts when the facts surrounding a crime are the same, and that young Black men are less likely to be given benefits of the doubt by jurors because of their immaturity.“I always took pride in representing the United States as a federal prosecutor, and I think executing Brandon would be a terrible stain on the nation’s honor,” Moore, who is now in private practice in San Antonio, wrote in a recent op-ed in The Indianapolis Star.One juror whose 2016 written statement was included in the White House petition said he still believes Bernard is responsible for “horrible decisions that had horrendous outcomes.”“However, his young age at the time does weigh on me,” he wrote. “I do not believe that Brandon should be executed for bad choices he made when he was 18.”A statement from Bernard’s 16-year-old daughter is also included in which she describes her father as constantly warning her to stay away from the wrong crowds and how a single bad decision can ruin your life.She added: “I am hoping and asking the President to spare my dad’s life.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-administration-set-to-execute-1st-of-5-inmates-before-biden-inauguration/story-lQwiKZTTCySDxGn8vYkE9O.html
10-12-2020||World||UN chief says will take Covid-19 vaccine publicly, calls it his ‘moral obligation’||UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has said that he intends to take the Covid-19 vaccine when it becomes available and he will do so publicly, asserting that vaccination for him is a “moral obligation” towards the whole community.“Of course, I intend to receive the vaccine when it becomes available for me in whatever the situation that will be justified for that. And, obviously, I will have no doubt in doing it publicly,” Guterres said on Wednesday.The 71-year-old UN chief was responding to a question during a press briefing at the UN Headquarters on whether he would publicly take the Covid-19 vaccine when it’s available to him.“I encourage everybody that has access to the vaccine to be vaccinated, because it is a service, not only that we provide to ourselves. Each one of us being vaccinated provides a service to the whole community because we are no longer spreading... there is no risk of spreading the disease. So, vaccination is for me a moral obligation in relation to all of us,” he said.His remarks came during the hybrid press conference with Chairperson of the African Union Commission Moussa Faki Mahamat following the Fourth UN-AU Annual Conference.Guterres reiterated his call for a Covid-19 vaccine to be a global public good available to everywhere and particularly, available in Africa.“Most African countries lack the financing to adequately respond to the crisis, due in part to declining demand and prices of their commodity exports,” he said.In response to a question that while floodgates to Covid-19 vaccines are opening in rich countries, Africa might not begin to see vaccines until the second quarter of 2021, he said: “It’s true we are seeing vaccine nationalism moving with full speed.” He added that if Africa is not properly supported, “we will not be able to fight the pandemic anywhere effectively.He said the only way to ensure that the vaccines reach Africa timely is to make sure that the COVAX initiative is financed and gets the USD 4.2 [billion] it needs in the next two months “to make sure that vaccines approved by the World Health Organization can be distributed in Africa sooner rather than later.” COVAX is a global initiative aimed at working with vaccine manufacturers to provide countries worldwide equitable access to safe and effective vaccines, once they are licensed and approved.Guterres said there is an “enormous effort” by several countries to ensure vaccines for their own populations.“But COVAX is working hard. There are several vaccines in the pipeline for COVAX, and it is perfectly possible to deliver if the financing is guaranteed,” he said.The UK, Bahrain and Canada have approved the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine within the past week.The US Food and Drug Administration is expected to authorise the use of the vaccine as early as this weekend after its own study concluded the two-dose vaccine provided benefits even after just the first injection—cutting the risk of getting Covid-19 by about half.The Pfizer-BioNTech was found to be 95 per cent effective after the second dose. The European Medicines Agency has said a decision on either the Pfizer-BioNTech shot or Moderna Inc.’s vaccine could come by the end of this month.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/un-chief-says-will-take-covid-19-vaccine-publicly-calls-it-his-moral-obligation/story-7pLoQFAGn1gmgC6CwqBRQO.html

He has since gathered 10,000 used masks, and has received more than a tonne of defective ones from a factory as well. To lessen the risk of coronavirus transmission, Kim keeps them in storage for at least four days. Then, removing elastic bands and wires, he wields a heat gun over the masks in a mould, melting them down at temperatures over 300 degrees Celsius (570 degrees Fahrenheit).The result? Three-legged stools 45cm (18 inches) recycled from white, pink, blue and black masks, which Kim displayed in his graduation exhibition. Next, Kim hopes to make other furniture pieces from the recycled masks such as a chair, table or some lights. He is also urging the government and private companies to recycle face masks by setting up a separate box for their collection.In September alone, South Korea produced more than a billion face masks for domestic use, government data showed.Though the stools are not yet for sale, fellow students were impressed by the idea and rough-surfaced design.“It has such a strong message,” said art student Park Sung-chan, 20. “This will remind us what we’ve been through in 2020 with the coronavirus and is also environmentally friendly.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/stack-and-stack-a-south-korean-student-s-attempt-to-recycle-in-covid-times/story-V635oyUYgz5fKuUOTwcE1K.html

The virus also claimed 135 lives in the last 24 hours.Daily cases peaked at around 15,000 in July.The current positivity rate is 18 per cent, Mkhize said.The second wave is being driven by Western Cape, Eastern Cape, KwaZulu-Natal and Gauteng provinces, he said.A seven-day moving average graph shows that the increases in KwaZulu-Natal and Gauteng are exponential, the minister said.“This means that we should expect faster rising numbers with a higher peak than in the first wave,” he said.Mkhize expressed concern that in the last two days the peak of infections was among young people aged between 15 and 19.“This is believed to be due to large number of parties involving young people drinking alcohol with no adherence to non-pharmaceutical interventions, such as wearing of masks, social distancing and hand and surface sanitising. This inevitably leads to super spreader events which spill over into the rest of the country as this age group is highly mobile and the majority of the carriers are asymptomatic,” he said.(This story has been published from a wire agency feed without modifications to the text.

The sixth edition echoes similar instructions in previous, less lengthy versions.The Civil Aviation Administration of China said the recommendation applies for charter flights to and from countries and regions where infections exceed 500 in every one million people.The diaper advice is in a section on personal protective equipment, which also recommends the following for cabin crew:Flight crew should wear masks and goggles, but they don’t need diapers.Other advice for the flights includes dividing the cabin into “clean area, buffer zone, passenger sitting area and quarantine area,” separated by disposable curtains. The last three rows should be designated as an emergency quarantine area, CAAC said.China’s aviation market was hit hard at the onset of the outbreak in Wuhan and subsequent spread around the country. But it has recovered -- on the domestic front at least -- to close to pre-pandemic levels, while other regions such as Europe and the U.S. struggle to bring Covid-19 under control.Airlines have insisted that it is safe to fly during the pandemic, partly thanks to the hospital-grade air filters on planes, but some researchers say it isn’t yet clear to conclude there’s minimal risk. Some cases have documented transmission on flights when passengers wore masks and sat far apart.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-tells-cabin-crew-to-wear-disposable-diapers-on-high-risk-covid-19-destinations/story-PDtbhegBiWjvlW69CK5q6I.html
10-12-2020||World||Win, lose or settle: Facebook lawsuits will take years to resolve||Facebook, faced with two major antitrust lawsuits, could be forced to breakup, settle with changes to its business, or it could prove its government challengers wrong and win in court, antitrust experts said.The Federal Trade Commission and a major coalition of states are asking that Facebook be forced to sell WhatsApp and Instagram, saying it used a “buy or bury” strategy to snap up rivals and keep smaller competitors at bay.If the government wins, the judge could rule Facebook must divest its photo sharing app Instagram and messaging app WhatsApp.“At first blush, it’s a very strong case on the merits. The remedy is tough, because breakup is an unusual remedy, but it certainly may be merited here,” said Sam Weinstein, who teaches at Cardozo Law.While a “breakup remedy” is rare, Weinstein said, “this is a case where it’s possible, I’d say, and maybe even likely.” He noted the Facebook case contained damning evidence from the company’s own documents, unlike the Justice Department’s lawsuit against Google.Although breakup is not common, even on a small scale, in 2014 the Justice Department sued BazaarVoice after it bought PowerReviews and forced the deal between the consumer review sites to be undone. Most famously it forced the breakup of the telephone company ATT in 1982.President-elect Joe Biden’s incoming administration, which did not respond to a request for comment, would also likely support the lawsuit. FTC commissioners voted 3-2 to file its lawsuit with two of the three votes in favor coming from Democrats.One difficulty the FTC will face is that it cleared Facebook’s purchase of Instagram in 2012 and WhatsApp in 2014 -- a point Facebook made in its response to the lawsuits. “It’s very difficult to unwind a consummated merger that’s been in place for years,” said Seth Bloom of Bloom Strategic Counsel. “A court would be very reluctant to unwind the merger.”Further, Bloom said the argument in the complaint that Facebook required software developers on its platform to refrain from competing with Facebook was potentially outdated and certainly easy to resolve. The complaint said: “Specifically, between 2011 and 2018, Facebook made Facebook Platform, including certain commercially significant APIs, available to developers only on the condition that their apps neither competed with Facebook ... nor promoted competitors.”In a blog post, Facebook argued that the restrictions were standard in the industry.“Companies are allowed to choose their business partners, and it gives platforms comfort that they can open access to other developers without that access being exploited unfairly,” wrote Facebook General Counsel Jennifer Newstead.Facebook also believes it can prevail in court. Newstead said the company continues “to operate in a highly competitive space.“We look forward to our day in court, when we’re confident the evidence will show that Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp belong together, competing on the merits with great products,” she said. With no criminal charges in the lawsuit there is no incentive for Facebook to cut a deal, argues George Hay, who teaches antitrust at Cornell University law school. He also predicted the case would take years of litigation.“It’s not an obvious winner,” he said of the government’s arguments. “Everything that Facebook does is out in the open and it’s been out in the open for 15 years. They’ve never done anything without consulting with teams of antitrust lawyers.”Still, Facebook agreed last year to pay $5 billion to resolve an FTC investigation into its privacy practices.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/win-lose-or-settle-facebook-lawsuits-will-take-years-to-resolve/story-xgHbOFGz1PSh5TzVOFGr6L.html

10-12-2020||World||Senate falls short of halting Trump’s 23 billion dollar arms sales to UAE||The Senate fell short in trying to halt the Trump administration’s proposed $23 billion arms sales to the United Arab Emirates, despite bipartisan objections to the package of F-35 fighter jets and drones stemming from a broader Middle East peace agreement. Senators on Wednesday argued the sale of the defence equipment, which Secretary of State Mike Pompeo formally authorised last month after the Abraham Accords normalising relations with Israel, was unfolding too quickly and with too many questions. The administration has billed it as a way to deter Iran, but UAE would become the first Arab nation — and only the second country in the Middle East, after Israel — to possess the stealth warplanes. “Can a lasting peace be purchased with more weapons?” said Sen. Rand Paul in a speech ahead of the vote. Congress has shown a willingness to confront Trump in one main area — on defence policy. But on Wednesday the effort to turn back the arms sales failed to reach the 51-vote majority needed for passage. Trump was expected to veto the two resolutions anyway. The showdown over the sale, alongside sweeping bipartisan support for the annual defence bill despite Trump’s threats to veto it, is potentially a final power play between the executive and legislative branch in the final weeks of Trump’s presidency. The Senate will take up the broader defence bill soon. On Wednesday, senators narrowly rejected one resolution to disapprove of the F-35 sales, 47-49, and the other over the sale of armed drones, 46-50, in procedural votes largely along party lines. That’s far short of the two-thirds majority that would have been needed to overcome a potential presidential veto. Action is halted for now, though the House, where Democrats have control, would likely be able to pass them easily. Sen. Chris Murphy said the UAE’s track record in war-torn Yemen and Libya and its “complicated” relationships with China and Russia raise more questions than answers. “I’m not here to say that we shouldn’t be in the security business with UAE,” said Murphy, a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. But, he said, “without resolving those issues, is this the moment to be selling for the first time ever F-35s, armed drones into the heart of the Middle East?” The arms sale emerged after the US brokered the Abraham Accords to normalise relations between the UAE, Bahrain and Israel. In notifying Congress last month, Pompeo said the authorisation of the sale was in recognition of the “deepening relationship” with the UAE and its need to deter threats from Iran. Pompeo said the “historic agreement” reached with the Abraham Accords offered a “once-in-a-generation opportunity” to transform the region’s “strategic landscape.” The sale, worth up to $23.37 billion, includes dozens of F-35s, advanced armed drone systems and a package of air-to-air and air-to-ground munitions. Sen. Bob Menendez of New Jersey, the top Democrat on the Foreign Relations Committee, said a list of questions senators sent to Pompeo and then-Defence Secretary Mark Esper about the arrangement remains unanswered. A classified briefing for senators did not appear to adequately answer their questions. “We must assert our congressional prerogative,” Menendez said. Voting “sends a message to the executive branch.” Israeli officials have previously expressed some concern about an F-35 sale. But in October, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu appeared to confirm Israel’s consent. Even after Wednesday’s setback, Congress is poised to approve the sweeping annual defence bill despite Trump’s objections. Trump has warned he would veto the bill over a provision to study stripping the names of Confederate leaders from US military bases. He also wants lawmakers to include an unrelated provision to clamp down on the big technology companies over what Republicans, and some Democrats, say is unfair treatment on social media platforms like Twitter and Facebook. But lawmakers say the tech provision doesn’t belong in the defence policy bill.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/senate-falls-short-of-halting-trump-s-23-billion-dollar-arms-sales-to-uae/story-du54dkLS0gWeuiY4V6IlqN.html
10-12-2020||World||Hunter Biden says US prosecutor investigating his taxes||President-elect Joe Biden’s son Hunter Biden, a focus of attacks from President Donald Trump and his Republican allies during the campaign for the White House, said on Wednesday the US Attorney’s Office in Delaware is investigating his tax affairs.“I take this matter very seriously but I am confident that a professional and objective review of these matters will demonstrate that I handled my affairs legally and appropriately, including with the benefit of professional tax advisors,” Hunter Biden said in a statement.He said he learned of the investigation on Tuesday when prosecutors informed his lawyer of the probe.The transition team for President-elect Joe Biden on Wednesday released a statement saying Biden “is deeply proud of his son, who has fought through difficult challenges, including the vicious personal attacks of recent months, only to emerge stronger.”CNN reported that investigators have been examining multiple financial issues, including whether Hunter Biden and his associates violated tax and money laundering laws in business dealings in foreign countries, principally China, according to two people briefed on the probe.The investigation began as early as 2018, predating the arrival of William Barr as attorney general, two people briefed on the investigation told CNN.Reuters could not confirm the report. The US Attorney’s Office declined to comment, and Hunter Biden’s attorney could not immediately be reached for comment.During the campaign, Trump and Republicans questioned potential conflicts of interest from Hunter Biden’s position on the board of the Ukrainian energy company Burisma at the time his father was vice president to Democratic President Barack Obama.Trump was impeached by the Democratic majority US House of Representatives but acquitted by the Senate in February on charges of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress stemming from his efforts to pressure Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden.Trump called during the campaign for China to investigate involvement of Biden’s son in a fund that sought to raise Chinese capital. Trump accused Hunter Biden of using his position of influence to secure China’s financial backing for his investments.Trump never provided evidence to support this claim, and Hunter Biden has repeatedly denied wrongdoing. Joe Biden won the November 3 election. Trump has filed numerous lawsuits to overturn the results; none have succeeded.A source familiar with the newly revealed investigation, who asked not to be identified, told Reuters “this is not related to the attacks the Trump team and their allies made against Hunter during the campaign.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hunter-biden-says-us-prosecutor-investigating-his-taxes/story-nH5ffwJdNhBVW5ROrjtu9J.html
10-12-2020||World||Mike Pompeo accuses US universities of ‘China ties’||Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Wednesday accused US universities of caving to Chinese pressure to blunt or bar criticism of the Chinese Communist Party. The attack, which included identifying two university administrators by name, comes as the Trump administration seeks to cement its anti-China policies before leaving office in January.Pompeo took aim at universities across the US, claiming they refused to address the Trump administration’s concerns about China’s attempts to influence students and academics. He specifically called out the president of MIT, alleging he refused to host Pompeo’s speech, and a senior official at the University of Washington over a case involving a Chinese student.Both universities swiftly and emphatically denied the charges.Pompeo defended the Trump administration’s tough stance on China in remarks at the Georgia Institute of Technology. The speech came less than a month before Georgia’s two critical run-off races that will determine control of the Senate.“Americans must know how the CCP is poisoning the well of our higher education for its own ends, and how those actions degrade our freedoms and our national security. If we don’t educate ourselves, we’ll get schooled by Beijing,” he said. “They know that left-leaning college campuses are rife with anti-Americanism, and present easy target audiences for their anti-American messaging.”Pompeo has been a champion of the administration’s hardline stance on Chinese policies in Taiwan, Tibet, Hong Kong, the western region of Xinjiang and the South China Sea, and he has made similar pronouncements before. He has imposed multiple layers of sanctions on Chinese officials; restricted visas for Chinese diplomats, journalists and academics; and lobbied other countries to reject Chinese high-tech communications.But his comments on Wednesday were striking in that he named the two American university officials as complicit in alleged Chinese malfeasance.Pompeo said he had initially wanted to give his Georgia Tech speech at MIT, but the president of the renowned scientific institution, Rafael Reif, had turned him down for fear of offending Beijing.“MIT wasn’t interested in having me give this speech on their campus,” Pompeo said. “President Rafael Reif implied that my arguments might insult their ethnic Chinese students and professors.”MIT spokeswoman Kimberly Allen rejected Pompeo’s assertion, saying the university declined to host the speech because of coronavirus restrictions. She said several other prospective high-level events had also been rejected.Reif “had real concerns that a high-level visit might not only draw crowds but suggest to students that MIT was not taking its own rules seriously,” she said. “President Reif verbally conveyed MIT’s decision — based on a commitment to the health of our students and our surrounding community — with his deep regrets.”Pompeo also criticized Sarah Castro, the University of Washington’s director of federal relations, for allegedly refusing to help Vera Zhou, a student of Chinese origin who had been detained in China in 2017, so as not to jeopardize a “multimillion-dollar deal” between the university and Beijing.“Now, thank God, Vera was eventually released, and returned to the US,” Pompeo said of the student. “But no thanks to the University of Washington, and no thanks to its deal with China.”A statement from university spokesman Victor Balta called Pompeo’s remarks a “shameful” and “outrageous” deflection by an administration that took “no effective action” on behalf of Zhou.“That the Secretary of State would think a university has more power in this situation than the United States government is bizarre,” he said. “That he would single out a staff member by name is unbecoming of the office and his statement is flatly wrong.”The university has no record of contact from the State Department regarding any negotiation with China, Balta said, and officials don’t know what “multimillion-dollar deal” Pompeo was referencing. He added that, as of this quarter, Zhou is again enrolled at the university.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/mike-pompeo-accuses-us-universities-of-china-ties/story-dIIzkv0HTLVS2C7svol9FM.html
10-12-2020||World||UN chief warns `vaccine nationalism’ is moving at full speed||Secretary-General Antonio Guterres warned Wednesday that “vaccine nationalism” is moving “at full speed,” leaving poor people around the globe watching preparations for inoculations against the coronavirus in some rich nations and wondering if and when they will be vaccinated.The UN chief reiterated his call for vaccines to be treated as “a global public good,” available to everyone, everywhere on the planet, especially in Africa. And he appealed for $4.2 billion in the next two months for the World Health Organization’s COVAX program, an ambitious project to buy and deliver coronavirus vaccines for the world’s poorest people.After a virtual UN meeting with the African Union, Guterres said at news conference that financing COVAX is the only way to guarantee vaccines will be available in Africa and other developing areas.WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told a high-level UN General Assembly meeting last week on Covid-19 that “the light at the end of the tunnel is growing steadily brighter” to end the pandemic. But, he added, vaccines “must be shared equally as global public goods, not as private commodities that widen inequalities and become yet another reason some people are left behind.”Tedros said WHO’s cash-strapped ACT-Accelerator program to quickly develop and distribute vaccines fairly, which includes the COVAX project, “is in danger of becoming no more than a noble gesture” without major new funding. COVAX will require an additional $23.9 billion for 2021, he said, stressing that the $28 billion total is less than one-half of 1 percent of the $11 trillion in stimulus packages announced so far by the Group of 20, the world’s richest countries..The United Kingdom and Russia have already started vaccinating people against the coronavirus. In the United States, the Pfizer vaccine could get a green light for emergency use in the coming days and the Moderna vaccine in the coming weeks. Canada announced approval of the Pfizer vaccine Wednesday,Guterres said Africa’s 54 nations have registered more than 2.2 million cases of coronavirus infections and over 53,000 deaths from Covid-19.“There is real hope that vaccines — in combination with other public health measures — will help to overcome the pandemic,” he said.But to end it, he added, vaccines must be available to all and “most African countries lack the financing to adequately respond to the crisis, due in part to declining demand and prices of their commodity exports.”The director of the Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, John Nkengasong, said in late November that vaccinations against the coronavirus on the continent might not start until the second quarter of next year. “I have seen how Africa is neglected when drugs are available” in the past, he told reporters.Guterres said Wednesday when asked about Nkengasong’s assessment: “It is my hope that we’ll be able to do it before the second quarter, but it is true that what we’re seeing today is an enormous effort by several countries in order to ensure vaccines for their own populations.”“It’s true we are seeing vaccination nationalism moving at full speed,” the UN chief said.“If Africa is not properly supported, we will not be able to fight the pandemic,” he said. “There are several vaccines in the pipeline for COVAX, and it is perfectly possible to deliver if the financing is guaranteed.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/un-chief-warns-vaccine-nationalism-is-moving-at-full-speed/story-ZSsoH99xNuycfvsiLTwoQK.html
10-12-2020||World||Japan’s bird flu outbreak worsens, government orders disinfection of poultry farms||Japan’s bird flu outbreak worsened with two more prefectures reporting poultry deaths and exclusion orders in place on Thursday as the government ordered the disinfection of all poultry farms in the country.Highly pathogenic bird flu, most likely brought by migrating birds from the Asian/European continent, has spread to 8 of Japan’s 47 prefectures.While officials say that it is not possible to catch avian influenza from the eggs or meat of infected chickens, they are concerned about the virus making the “species jump” to humans and causing a pandemic like the coronavirus one raging now.The virus was confirmed at an egg-laying farm in Kinokawa city in Wakayama prefecture near Kyoto, Japan’s agriculture ministry said on its website.Three broiler farms in Oita prefecture on Kyushu island also reported outbreaks, the ministry said.Japan’s worst outbreak since at least 2016 started last month in Kagawa prefecture on Shikoku island, which is close to Kyushu.The government on Wednesday called for the disinfection of poultry farms across Japan to contain the outbreak, national broadcaster NHK said.“The need for vigilance is stronger than in usual years,” chief government spokesman Katsunobu Kato was quoted by NHK as saying after meeting with other government officials.More than 130,000 chickens at the farms in Oita and Wakayama will be slaughtered and buried, while exports in a 3km (1.8 mile) radius around the farm will be restricted.The latest cullings mean more than 2 million chickens will have been slaughtered since the latest outbreak began. Japan had a broiler chicken population amounting to 138 million head last year, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/japan-s-bird-flu-outbreak-worsens-government-orders-disinfection-of-poultry-farms/story-fPp6Y7j2J25ncsMSeMRgWJ.html
10-12-2020||World||Britain considers toughening tax rules on ‘sharing economy’||The United Kingdom is considering tougher tax rules for the so-called sharing economy to lift revenue and ensure a “level playing field” for all businesses, a government paper showed.In a consultation document published on Wednesday, the UK Treasury said the growth of the sharing economy “could potentially create certain challenges to the VAT (value-added tax) base,” and raised concerns that the current state of affairs might hand unfair advantages to the sharing economy over traditional businesses.“The government considers that the Sharing Economy not only creates challenges for VAT but impacts upon a range of different taxes,” the consultation said.When self-employed contractors carry out services booked on platforms like Uber and Airbnb, they often individually fall below the 85,000 pounds ($113,755.50) VAT registration threshold.The Treasury’s consultation document highlighted examples of the business practices it wanted to look into for action where no VAT was being charged “where it might have been (charged) in the traditional economy.”The Treasury said its review was designed to “test the government’s view of the VAT challenges the sharing economy creates.”The International Monetary Fund told Britain late in October to keep up its Covid-19 spending and plan for tax hikes.Carbon taxes, VAT and property taxes were all areas where Britain could boost revenue without hurting growth. IMF staff had said tax increases would be almost inevitable.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/britain-considers-toughening-tax-rules-on-sharing-economy/story-LZHWrGsiCrXk26P6g9SyWJ.html
10-12-2020||World||US awaits vaccine approval as daily national deaths top 3,000||The United States on Wednesday crossed an ominous new threshold of 3,000 lives lost to Covid-19 in a single day while public health officials stepped up preparations for a vaccine campaign of historic scope ahead of imminent regulatory approval.Steady movement toward a vaccine rollout on the eve of a critical review by leading U.S. medical experts comes as Covid-19 infections and hospitalizations surged alarmingly higher, straining healthcare systems in some pandemic hot spots to the breaking point.Ten mostly rural counties scattered across California reported having no intensive care unit beds available on Wednesday, according to state health data analyzed by Reuters.In the agricultural heartland of the California’s Central Valley, Covid-19 admissions have overwhelmed some individual hospitals altogether. In Fresno County, home to 1 million people, only seven ICU beds remained unfilled on Wednesday.The number of Covid patients hospitalized nationwide grew to a new all-time high of 105,805 by late Wednesday, up 18% over the previous two weeks.The United States also has documented an average of 2,259 deaths and 205,661 new infections each day over the past week, a toll that U.S. health officials warn is likely to accelerate in the coming months before a vaccine becomes widely available to the public.At least 3,112 U.S. patients perished on Wednesday alone, according to a Reuters tally of state-by-state data, surpassing the previous Dec. 3 record of 2,861 deaths and marking the first time the virus has claimed 3,000 American lives or more in a single day.To date, the highly contagious respiratory illness has killed more than 289,000 Americans, out some 15 million known to have been infected since January.Medical experts have said the crisis will only worsen in the weeks ahead amid colder weather, especially if Americans continue to disregard warnings to avoid unnecessary travel and large gatherings over the holidays. Besides the monumental human cost, the pandemic has wreaked havoc on the economy, forcing millions out of work as public health authorities imposed sweeping restrictions on social and economic life in an effort to tamp down the contagion.Congress, meanwhile, struggled to end a months-long political stalemate over an economic assistance.The Democratic-controlled U.S. House of Representatives was set to vote on a one-week stopgap funding bill to buy more time to reach a deal on a larger relief package, as a bipartisan group released details of their proposal.U.S. Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell told reporters that lawmakers were still “looking for a way forward” on Covid-19 aid, then took to the Senate floor to blast Democratic leaders for rebuffing two Republican offers earlier this week.VACCINES ON THE WAYOffering a new glimmer of hope, some officials said vaccinations could begin as soon as this weekend, and states have escalated plans for what is likely to be distribution effort of unprecedented dimensions.“I can’t think of a government operation that has been commenced that is more difficult and intricate than what governments will be asked to do here,” New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said at a briefing on Wednesday.A panel of independent medical experts was due meet on Thursday to decide whether to recommend that a vaccine from Pfizer Inc and German partner BioNTech SE. should receive emergency use authorization of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.In a sign that approval could come swiftly, documents released by the FDA on Tuesday in preparation for the advisory review raised no new red flags over the safety or efficacy of the Pfizer vaccine.FDA approval could come as early as Friday or Saturday, followed by the first U.S. injections on Sunday or Monday, Moncef Slaoui, chief adviser to the Trump administration’s Operation Warp Speed vaccine development program, told Fox News on Tuesday.Britain became the first Western nation to begin mass inoculations with the Pfizer vaccine on Tuesday. Canada on Wednesday approved the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine after an accelerated review process.The United States is in dire need of a new mechanism for fighting the pandemic, given that so many Americans have refused to follow guidance for wearing face coverings and keeping their distance for people beyond their own households.Experts and officials expect yet another surge of infections and hospitalizations following year-end holiday gatherings.The World Health Organization director for the Americas, Carissa Etienne, said on Wednesday that jumps in weekly Covid-19 cases in the United States and Canada were particularly worrisome as winter approaches. The expected post-holiday surge would be in full force by the time President-elect Joe Biden succeeds President Donald Trump on Jan. 20.Even though Trump has refused to concede defeat in his bid for a second term, and is attempting to overturn the Nov. 3 election, Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar vowed on CNN to ensure a “full, cooperative, professional transition” on pandemic matters. Azar also told “CBS This Morning” he expected inoculations to be reaching the general public in February, March and April, with enough vaccine supply “for all Americans” during the second quarter of next year. Still, a sizable percentage of the U.S. population has expressed skepticism about getting a COVID-19 vaccine, creating an additional challenge.Biden set a goal of vaccinating 100 million people - nearly a third of the U.S. population, within the first 100 days of his administration, or by April 29.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-awaits-vaccine-approval-as-daily-national-deaths-top-3-000/story-3Xd94jMkozK4LvSUR0y4SP.html
10-12-2020||World||UK medicine regulator says people with anaphylaxis risk should not take Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine||Britain’s medicine regulator said anyone with a history of anaphylaxis to a medicine or food should not get the Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine, giving fuller guidance on an earlier allergy warning about the shot.Starting with the elderly and frontline workers, Britain began mass vaccinating its population on Tuesday, part of a global drive that poses one of the biggest logistical challenges in peacetime history.The Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) said there had been two reports of anaphylaxis and one report of a possible allergic reaction since rollout began. “Any person with a history of anaphylaxis to a vaccine, medicine or food should not receive the Pfizer BioNTech vaccine,” MHRA Chief Executive June Raine said in a statement.“Most people will not get anaphylaxis and the benefits in protecting people against Covid-19 outweigh the risks... You can be completely confident that this vaccine has met the MHRA’s robust standards of safety, quality and effectiveness.”Anaphylaxis is an overreaction of the body’s immune system, which the National Health Service describes as severe and sometimes life-threatening.The fuller guidance, clarifying that the main risk was from anaphylaxis specifically, was issued after consulting experts on allergies. The MHRA had initially advised anyone with a history of a “significant allergic reaction” not to take the shot.Pfizer and BioNTech said they were supporting the MHRA’s investigation.Last week, Britain’s MHRA became the first in the world to approve the vaccine, developed by Germany’s BioNTech and Pfizer, while the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and European Medicines Agency (EMA) continue to assess the data. A top U.S. official said on Wednesday that Americans with known severe allergic reactions may not be candidates for Pfizer’s Covid-19 vaccine until more was understood about what had happened. Canada’s health ministry said it would look at the reported adverse reactions in Britain, but said adverse events were to be expected and would not necessarily change the risk/benefit of the shot, after the country approved the vaccine. ALLERGIC REACTIONMHRA chief Raine told lawmakers such allergic reactions had not been a feature of the Pfizer’s clinical trials.Pfizer has said people with a history of severe adverse allergic reactions to vaccines or the candidate’s ingredients were excluded from their late stage trials, which is reflected in the MHRA’s emergency approval protocol.However, the allergic reactions may have been caused by a component of Pfizer’s vaccine called polyethylene glycol, or PEG, which helps stabilise the shot and is not in other types of vaccines.Imperial College London’s Paul Turner, an expert in allergy and immunology, who has been advising the MHRA on their revised guidance, told Reuters: “As we’ve had more information through, the initial concern that maybe it affects everyone with allergies is not true.”“The ingredients like PEG which we think might be responsible for the reactions are not related to things which can cause food allergy. Likewise, people with a known allergy to just one medicine should not be at risk,” Turner told Reuters.The EMA said in an email that all quality, safety and efficacy data would be taken into account in assessing the vaccine, including data generated outside the EU.In the United States, the FDA released documents on Tuesday in preparation for an advisory committee meeting on Thursday, saying the Pfizer vaccine’s efficacy and safety data met its expectations for authorization.The briefing documents said 0.63% of people in the vaccine group and 0.51% in the placebo group reported possible allergic reactions in trials, which Peter Openshaw, professor of experimental medicine at Imperial College London, said was a very small number.“The fact that we know so soon about these two allergic reactions and that the regulator has acted on this to issue precautionary advice shows that this monitoring system is working well,” he said. However, Gregory Poland, a virologist and vaccine researcher with the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, said that the MHRA and NHS had overreacted initially.“I would not have broadened to the degree they did,” he said.“It’s reasonable to let the world know about this, and to be aware of it in terms of people who have had reactions like this to vaccines. I think to say medicines, foods or any other allergies is past the boundary of science.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-medicine-regulator-says-people-with-anaphylaxis-risk-should-not-take-pfizer-biontech-vaccine/story-RCWg3joZWG4Yf2hD9jX8AO.html
10-12-2020||World||Mike Pence announces pool of US astronauts for planned moon mission||Vice President Mike Pence on Wednesday announced 18 astronauts chosen for possible participation in planned NASA missions to return to the moon’s surface during the final U.S. space policy meeting before he and President Donald Trump leave office next month.At a meeting of the White House’s National Space Council at NASA’s Kennedy Space Center in Florida, Pence unveiled the pool of nine women and nine men who could go to the moon under NASA’s Artemis program, intended to put people back on the lunar surface for the first time since the 1970s. All of the astronauts to reach the moon thus far have been men. The mission’s target date is 2024, though that is expected to slip.Pence said the chosen astronauts “will carry us back to the moon and beyond.” The Artemis is planned as a steppingstone to the more-ambitious goal of placing astronauts on Mars.“This is the first cadre of our Artemis astronauts,” NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine said.“I want to be clear, there’s gonna be more,” Bridenstine added.The 2024 goal, viewed by some in the U.S. space agency and American space industry as unrealistic, is expected to be pushed back after President-elect Joe Biden takes office on Jan. 20.Before the meeting of the space council, Pence toured Patrick Air Force Base and formally renamed it Patrick Space Force Base. It is named after the space service branch of the U.S. military created under Trump.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/mike-pence-announces-pool-of-us-astronauts-for-planned-moon-mission/story-pE1WlBaBEfdzl1ufwuDnOK.html
10-12-2020||World||Pfizer says some vaccine documents accessed in EMA hack||Pfizer Inc. said some documents it had submitted to Europe’s top drug regulator regarding its Covid-19 vaccine had been accessed in a cyber-attack on the agency.The US drugmaker and German partner BioNTech SE said in a statement they had been told by the European Medicines Agency that some documents relating to the regulatory submission for their experimental vaccine that had been stored on the EMA server had been unlawfully accessed.The companies said that none of their systems had been breached in connection with the incident and that they are “unaware that any study participants have been identified through the data being accessed.”Pfizer and BioNTech said the EMA informed them that the attack would have no effect on the timing of the vaccine review. Regulators are already evaluating clinical trial data on a rolling basis, and a clearance is expected toward the end of the year.Pfizer shares closed on Wednesday down 1.7% to $41.85 in New York.The EMA issued a brief statement Wednesday saying that it had been attacked and had “swiftly launched a full investigation, in close cooperation with law enforcement and other relevant entities.” It declined further comment.Moderna Inc., another U.S.-based pharmaceutical company with a comparable Covid-19 vaccine in development, said it hadn’t received any notification from the European regulator about a data breach.“We are engaged with them and monitoring the situation,” a company spokesperson said. “Moderna remains highly vigilant to potential cybersecurity threats.”Both the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna two-dose vaccine regimens rely on a new technology known as messenger RNA. Moderna is slightly behind Pfizer in the race to bring forth an authorized Covid-19 vaccine. The biotechnology company has approached the EMA for a conditional marketing authorization and is also under a rolling review. A clearance could be issued within weeks, according to the EMA.The U.S. Food and Drug Administration, the American drug regulator, declined to say whether it had been targeted recently by hackers. “Information security and the protection of industry and public health information are among FDA’s highest priorities,” according to Stephanie Caccomo, media relations director. “The agency is always enhancing its cybersecurity strategies to ensure FDA information security systems provide adequate protection of industry data and public health information on a continual, long-term basis.”Since the pandemic began, hackers aligned with governments including Russia and China have been accused of targeting companies and research institutions working on Covid-19 research. Cybersecurity researchers at International Business Machines Corp., for instance, recently disclosed that unknown hackers, probably tied to a nation-state, were targeting companies and government agencies involved in vaccine distribution.The hackers pretended they were from one of the world’s largest cold-chain providers, who offer the type of refrigeration necessary for certain vaccines. It wasn’t clear if the victims fell for the scam. But if they did, the credentials they stole could help an attacker “gain insight into internal communications, as well as the process, methods and plans to distribute a Covid-19 vaccine,” IBM Security said in a statement.In addition, in November, Microsoft Corp. said hackers in Russia and North Korea had targeted seven “prominent” companies working on vaccines and treatment research. Microsoft, which didn’t identify the companies, said the majority of the attacks were blocked.In July, the UK, US and Canadian governments accused Russian intelligence of attempting to steal private information from researchers racing to develop a vaccine. And in May, the U.S. government warned that hackers working for the Chinese government were trying to steal research on vaccines and treatments from U.S. health care, pharmaceutical and research organizations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pfizer-says-some-vaccine-documents-accessed-in-ema-hack/story-1aXZCg1KIVW0vq0zUwRVtJ.html
10-12-2020||World||Fauci, Kamala among famous names on mispronounced words list||FOW-chee, CAW-ma-la….dah-VIN-chee? America’s preeminent infectious disease expert, Anthony Fauci, and its incoming vice president, Kamala Harris, join the Renaissance master himself, Leonardo da Vinci, atop this year’s list of most mispronounced words, as complied by the US Captioning Company, which captions and subtitles real-time events on TV and in courtrooms. The list released on Wednesday identifies the words that proved most challenging for newsreaders and people on television to pronounce this year. The caption company said it surveyed its members to generate the list, which is now in its fifth year and was commissioned by Babbel, a language-learning app company with headquarters in Berlin and New York. Todd Ehresmann, a senior linguist at Babbel, said the list, unsurprisingly, reflects a year dominated by presidential politics and the coronavirus pandemic. “All of these have added some new phrases to our national vocabulary, which may take some practice,” he said. Here’s how Ehresmann broke down the proper pronunciations for the commonly misspoken words: Anthony Fauci (AN-thon-nee FOW-chee): Director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. Bangtan Sonyeondan (PUNG-tahn SOH-nyun-dahn): The full name of South Korean K-Pop band ‘BTS’, which translates as “a group of bulletproof boys” or “bulletproof boy scouts.” Giannis Antetokounmpo (YON-nis AHN-de-doh-KOON-boh): Greek basketball player who plays for the Milwaukee Bucks and was named the NBA’s ‘Most Valuable Player’ this year. Isias ( ees-ah-EE-ahs ): The name given to a powerful hurricane that caused significant damage to the East Coast and Caribbean this summer. Kamala Harris (CAW-ma-la HAIR-iss): The Vice President-Elect. Leonardo da Vinci (lee-oh-NAR-doe dah-VIN-chee): The Italian painter, architect, and engineer who created the ‘Mona Lisa.’ A mispronunciation of his name was the subject of a viral meme on social media this year. Mahamayavi Bhagavan Antle (mu-HAH-muh-yaw-vee bag-AH-wahn ANT-uhl): The full name of wildlife park operator ‘Doc’ Antle, who shot to fame in the Netflix documentary series ‘Tiger King.’ Nevada ( nev-ADD-ah ): Homestate of Las Vegas that played a central role in the presidential election. X Æ A-Xii (EX-aye-eye): The name given by business magnate Elon Musk and musician Grimes to their first child born in May. The pronunciation is according to Grimes.

10-12-2020||World||90% in poor nations may not get a vaccine in 2021||Nine out of 10 people in dozens of poor nations could miss out on getting vaccinated against COVID-19 next year because rich countries have hoarded far more doses than they need, campaigners said on Wednesday.Rich nations home to 14% of the global population had bought 53% of the total stock of the most-promising vaccines as of last month, said the People’s Vaccine Alliance, a coalition including Oxfam, Amnesty International and Global Justice Now.They said pharmaceutical companies working on COVID-19 vaccines should openly share their technology and intellectual property through the World Health Organisation (WHO) so more doses can be manufactured.“This shouldn’t be a battle between countries to secure enough doses,” Mohga Kamal-Yanni, an advisor for People’s Vaccine Alliance, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.“During these unprecedented times of a global pandemic, people’s lives and livelihoods should be put before pharmaceutical company profit,” she added.While high-risk groups in Britain received on Tuesday the first shot of the vaccine developed by Pfizer and BioNTech, most people in 67 low- and lower middle-income countries including Bhutan, Ethiopia and Haiti, risk being left behind, they said.Among the three COVID-19 vaccines for which efficacy results have been announced, almost all the available doses of two of them - Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech - have been acquired by rich countries, the Alliance report said.While AstraZeneca and the University of Oxford have pledged to provide 64% of their doses to people in developing nations, that would only reach 18% of the world’s population by next year “at most”, it added.The campaigners used data from science information and analytics company Airfinity to analyse the deals done between countries and eight leading vaccine candidates, including China’s Sinovac and Russia’s Sputnik V.The EU, United States, Britain, Canada, Japan, Switzerland, Australia, Hong Kong, Macau, New Zealand, Israel and Kuwait have acquired 53% of these potential doses - with Canada buying enough to vaccinate its population five times over, Oxfam said.“By buying up the vast majority of the world’s vaccine supply, rich countries are in breach of their human rights obligations,” Steve Cockburn, Amnesty International’s Head of Economic and Social Justice, said in a statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/90-in-poor-nations-may-not-get-a-vaccine-in-2021/story-fIlfvyOXleS16w3JnKYYvN.html
10-12-2020||World||Facebook faces lawsuit for ‘predatory’ conduct from US govt, 48 states||The US government and 48 states and districts sued Facebook Wednesday, accusing it of abusing its market power in social networking to crush smaller competitors and seeking remedies that could include a forced spinoff of the social network’s Instagram and WhatsApp messaging services.The landmark antitrust lawsuits, announced by the Federal Trade Commission and New York Attorney General Letitia James, mark the second major government offensive this year against seemingly untouchable tech behemoths. The Justice Department sued Google in October for abusing its dominance in online search and advertising — the government’s most significant attempt to buttress competition since its historic case against Microsoft two decades ago. Amazon and Apple also have been under investigation in Congress and by federal authorities for alleged anticompetitive conduct.James noted at a press conference that “it’s really critically important that we block this predatory acquisition of companies and that we restore confidence to the market.”The FTC said Facebook has engaged in a “a systematic strategy” to eliminate its competition, including by purchasing smaller up-and-coming rivals like Instagram in 2012 and WhatsApp in 2014. James echoed that in her press conference, saying Facebook “used its monopoly power to crush smaller rivals and snuff out competition, all at the expense of everyday users.”The FTC fined Facebook $5 billion in 2019 for privacy violations and instituted new oversight and restrictions on its business. The fine was the largest the agency has ever levied on a tech company, although it had no visible impact on Facebook’s business.Facebook called the government actions “revisionist history” that punishes successful businesses and noted that the FTC cleared the Instagram and WhatsApp acquisitions years ago. “The government now wants a do-over, sending a chilling warning to American business that no sale is ever final,” Facebook general counsel Jennifer Newstead said in a statement that echoed the company’s response to a recent congressional antitrust probe.Facebook is the world’s biggest social network with 2.7 billion users and a company with a market value of nearly $800 billion whose CEO Mark Zuckerberg is the world’s fifth-richest individual and the most public face of Big Tech swagger.James alleged Facebook had a practice of opening its site to third-party app developers, then abruptly cutting off developers that it saw as a threat. The lawsuit — which includes 46 states, Guam and the District of Columbia — accuses Facebook of anti-competitive conduct and using its market dominance to harvest consumer data and reap a fortune in advertising revenues.North Carolina Attorney General Josh Stein, who was on the executive committee of attorneys general conducting the investigation, said the litigation has the potential to alter the communications landscape the way the breakup of AT&T’s local phone service monopoly in the early 1980s did.“Our hope is to restructure the social networking marketplace in the United States, and right now there’s one player,” Stein said in a news release. James said the coalition worked collaboratively with the FTC but noted the attorneys general conducted their investigation separately.Antitrust expert Rebecca Allensworth, a law professor at Vanderbilt University, said it is “hard to win any antitrust lawsuit and this one is not any different.” But as far as antitrust cases go, she added, the government has a strong one.The Justice Department’s suit against Google, announced just two weeks before Election Day, brought accusations of political motivation from some quarters. It was filed by a cabinet agency headed by an attorney general seen as a close ally of President Donald Trump, who has often publicly criticized Google.The FTC, by contrast, is an independent regulatory agency whose five commissioners currently include three Republicans and two Democrats.President-elect Joe Biden has said the breakup of Big Tech giants should be seriously considered. He has singled out Facebook’s Zuckerberg for scorn, calling him “a real problem.”Instagram and WhatsApp are among some 70 companies that Facebook has acquired over the past 15 years. But they are the ones most frequently held up by Facebook critics as properties that should be split off.Facebook paid $1 billion for Instagram, bolstering the social network’s business a month before its stock went public. At the time, the photo-sharing app had about 30 million users and wasn’t producing any revenue. A few years later, Facebook acquired WhatsApp, an encrypted messaging service, for $19 billion.Zuckerberg vowed both companies would be run independently, but over the years the services have become increasingly integrated. Users are now able to link accounts and share content across the platforms. Instagram now has more than 1 billion users worldwide. Such integration could make it more difficult to break off the companies.NetChoice, a Washington trade association that includes Facebook as a member, quickly panned the lawsuits. The case for antitrust enforcement against Facebook “has never been weaker,” NetChoice vice president Carl Szabo said in a statement, pointing to newer social services such as TikTok and Snapchat as rivals that could “overtake” older platforms.“These lawsuits mark an important turning point in the battle to rein in Big Tech monopolies and to reinvigorate antitrust enforcement,” said Alex Harman, competition policy advocate for Public Citizen, a nonprofit consumer advocacy group.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/facebook-faces-lawsuit-for-predatory-conduct-from-us-govt-48-states/story-rAcKZuHdQxWYcchvadUv8N.html
10-12-2020||World||EU medicine regulator assessing Covid-19 vaccines affected by cyberattack||Two pharmaceutical companies in line for first conditional approval for their Covid-19 vaccine by the EU’s medicine regulator said Wednesday their documents were “unlawfully accessed” during a cyberattack on a European Medicines Agency server.Pfizer and BioNTech said documents relating to its vaccine candidate had been accessed but that “no systems have been breached in connection with this incident.”“We are unaware of any personal data being accessed,” Pfizer said in a statement, while BioNTech added “we are unaware that any study participants have been identified through the data being accessed.”“The EMA has assured us that the cyberattack will have no impact on the timeline for its review,” they added.Swift investigationEU’s medicines regulator earlier Wednesday said it had been the victim of a cyberattack, just weeks before it is due to decide on special approval for two coronavirus vaccines.The Amsterdam-based EMA said the incident was being investigated, but did not specify when it took place or whether its work on Covid-19 was targeted.“EMA has been the subject of a cyberattack. The agency has swiftly launched a full investigation, in close cooperation with law enforcement and other relevant entities,” the EMA said in a brief statement.An EMA spokeswoman later told AFP “the EMA is fully functional and all work continues”.The Dutch national police high-tech crime team was involved in the probe into the cyberattack, but police gave no more information, the Dutch news agency ANP reported.The EMA’s role as the drugs regulator for the 27-nation EU means it has access to data on the safety and quality of medicines from clinical trials and lab tests from companies that apply for authorisation.The agency has said it will give a decision on conditional approval for Pfizer-BioNTech’s Covid-19 vaccine at a meeting that will be held by December 29 at the latest, while a ruling on Moderna’s version should follow by January 12.It is also carrying out reviews of vaccines developed by Oxford University-AstraZeneca and Johnson & Johnson.News of the cyberattack came the day before the EMA’s chief Emer Cooke was due to brief the European Parliament about the process for approving coronavirus vaccines.The EMA -- which moved to Amsterdam from London after Britain left the European Union in January 2019 -- is also due to hold a special online public meeting to discuss Covid-19.Series of warningsThere have been a series of warnings about hacking related to the coronavirus pandemic.In July Britain accused Russian-based, Kremlin-linked hackers of targeting labs conducting coronavirus vaccine research. Cybercriminals have tried to attack several pharmaceutical companies developing vaccines including Johnson & Johnson, Novavax, AstraZeneca and South Korean laboratories, according to the Wall Street Journal.Spanish laboratories have reportedly been attacked by Chinese cybercriminals, the El Pais newspaper reported in September. Microsoft urged a crackdown in November on cyberattacks perpetrated by states and “malign actors” after a spate of hacks disrupted healthcare organisations fighting the virus.IBM said last week that it too had uncovered a string of attacks, again potentially carried out by state actors, against companies involved in the effort to distribute the vaccine.The European Commission’s Directorate-General for Taxation and Customs Union was one target of the attacks, as well as European and Asian companies involved in the supply chain, IBM said. It is also not the first time a Netherlands-based international body has been targeted by hackers.Dutch authorities expelled four alleged Russian intelligence agents in 2018 after an alleged bid to hack the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons in The Hague, using equipment in the back of a car parked in a neighbouring hotel.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/eu-medicine-regulator-assessing-covid-19-vaccines-affected-by-cyberattack/story-zcinfLIFaY6BF11jM23zzJ.html
