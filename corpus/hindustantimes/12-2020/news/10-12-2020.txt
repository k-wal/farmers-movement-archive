10-12-2020||News||Agriculture as a shock-absorber||The slew of agricultural reforms initiated by the government has led to a vigorous discussion in the media about the pros and cons of these policy changes. Most of these discussions have focused on agriculture as an activity that provides farmers with a regular source of income. The arguments have engaged mainly with the question of whether these reforms would increase these incomes, if agriculture became more commercialised.In all these discussions however, there is one important aspect that has got largely overlooked — the role of agriculture as an informal social safety net, specifically in times of crisis. To be clear, there are two types of safety nets that are needed in developing countries. The first is a protection against chronic poverty and unemployment in normal times. This is the objective behind Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme, the largest State-sponsored formal programme of this type. The second provides protection against a sudden crisis, such as the Covid-19 pandemic. As we found out when the pandemic broke out, we do not have a formal State-financed social safety net infrastructure that is adequate for such a situation.Safety nets for crisis situations are critical for developing economies that have adopted a market-led growth strategy. Markets are useful in driving higher rates of growth over time, but they are also much more vulnerable to many types of shocks. Since poor and vulnerable citizens do not have adequate savings for these hard times, these shocks expose them to health and even life risks during these periods. In the absence of formal safety nets, they turn to informal community-based support systems. In India, a significant section of wage earners who work in small towns or large cities still have their links with their villages intact. For these people, agriculture and allied sectors in their villages remain the informal safety net — a source of income if a crisis shuts down their principal livelihood in urban areas. For those who have lost these rural family links, the only alternative during these crises remains the informal retail sector — the fruit and vegetable carts.The importance of agriculture as an informal social safety net became clear during the reverse migration that India experienced after the imposition of the first lockdown. The long and arduous journeys that hundreds of thousands of people undertook were obviously extremely risky. The only reason so many migrants took such a decision was based on their trust that the agricultural sector would save their lives. In his book, How Asia Works, Joe Studwell describes a similar phenomenon in Taiwan during the first oil crisis in the mid-1970s, where close to 200,000 factory workers returned to farming. Such temporary reverse migrations in slack periods are also common in China. In contrast to these experiences, Studwell suggests that countries ranging from 18th-century Britain to the Philippines in recent times, which are characterised by larger-scale farming, have ended up with “legions of indigent poor or acres of squatter camps”. Another example of this phenomenon is contemporary South Africa, which has a significantly large group of poor and vulnerable people. But agriculture in South Africa is in the hand of a few large farms and plantation owners and, as a result, it fails as an informal social safety net. One of the effects of this is high crime rates in South African cities.So what does all of this mean for India and, more specifically, for our agricultural policies? The reforms initiated by the government are an attempt to move the agricultural sector away from the current institutional arrangements controlled by the arhtiyas towards more corporatised agricultural marketing. This is a change that is inevitable, given the market-led growth strategy that we have adopted since the 1990s. As agriculture becomes more corporatised — with the participation of large retail companies as their clients — farms will also be forced to consolidate. The logic of such consolidation is in the interest of both the corporate buyers and the farms. Large retail companies will prefer to deal with larger farms in order to cut their procurement costs. Farmers, on the other hand, will be under pressure to consolidate in order to bargain more effectively with these companies. There are various ways through which this change in average farm size can and will happen. Over time, this will lead to more families moving out of agriculture and agriculture becoming more capital and technology-intensive. One important fallout of this change is that the sector will lose its ability to provide a social safety net to the poor and vulnerable, in times of a crisis.This possibility, however, does not justify turning our backs to market-led reforms in agriculture. We just need to recognise that commercialised agricultural development will become a risky social project unless it is accompanied with the development of formal State-sponsored social safety net mechanisms on a comparable scale. This is an enormous administrative exercise that will need to identify the vulnerable and implement mechanisms to reach them in time. If we commercialise agriculture but fail to build these alternative safety nets, the next economic shock will lead to a costly urban crisis in India.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/agriculture-as-a-shock-absorber/story-hrMUyJPhazs666xOJ0NHyH.html
10-12-2020||News||Confronting everyday sources of pollution across the country||The annual November smog in the National Capital Region (NCR) frames the air pollution crisis — its scale, sources and solutions — in ways that undermine the long-term efforts needed. Instead of letting this episodic manifestation guide policy action, we must focus on tackling the less visible, everyday air pollution across the country.Delhi-NCR’s pollution levels witness two pronounced spikes every year — between late-October to mid-November, and again from late-December to mid-January. The first spike is attributable to stubble burning adding to the “baseload” of emissions from year-round sources that are unable to disperse due to stable meteorological conditions. The second spike is almost entirely due to the baseload and conditions being conducive to the formation of “secondary particles” from gaseous pollutants emitted by power plants, industries and vehicles in the region. Increased burning of wood and other solid fuels for heating is also an important factor during this time.Alarming as these spikes are, we should not make them the threshold for what is deemed unacceptable, and normalise objectively high levels of pollution otherwise. Consider the first week of December this year. The air quality index (AQI) remained either “very poor” or “severe” (in other words, more than twice the national standards) in Kanpur and Lucknow all seven days, and in Patna for six days. In NCR, Ghaziabad witnessed “severe” AQI on six days, while levels in Delhi and Gurugram were “very poor” throughout. Howrah in West Bengal and Singrauli in Madhya Pradesh also experienced either “poor” or “very poor” air quality throughout the week. Indeed, air quality in much of the Indo-Gangetic Plain is “poor” or worse for half the year.Our fixation with the November smog, therefore, misleads the way we approach this national public health crisis in three fundamental ways. First, although over three-fourths of India’s population breathes air that does not meet the national standards, apocalyptic levels for a few weeks in the capital become the defining feature of the crisis. Instead, the defining feature ought to be the sheer everyday nature of it, across the country. Research shows that the average exposure to air pollution is similar in rural and urban India. Given that two-thirds of our population is rural, a whopping 75% of the 1.1 million deaths attributable to air pollution in India occur in villages, as per a Health Effects Institute assessment in 2018. Yet, in terms of monitoring air quality, rural areas remain a blindspot. In the absence of official data, the rural air pollution crisis does not get due acknowledgment, let alone proportionate attention.Second, episodic sources get disproportionate blame, and year-round sources insufficient scrutiny. To be clear, stubble burning is certainly an important contributor in NCR for the few weeks during late October-mid November. But seen over the course of the year, this is only one of the major sources in the region, alongside vehicles, industries, and power plants, waste burning, and dust re-suspended due to vehicular movement and from construction activities. At a national level, household burning of solid fuels for cooking and other purposes forms the single largest source of outdoor pollution exposure, in addition to causing pollution indoors. All these sources need to be tackled in parallel to see meaningful improvements in air quality, in Delhi and elsewhere in India.Third, it results in an excessive emphasis on emergency responses, and on entirely misguided and unscientific tech-fixes such as smog towers. The only way to reduce air pollution is to cut emissions at the source, throughout the year. Since the sources are so different from each other, the agencies responsible and the types of interventions needed also vary substantially. Developing effective sectoral policies and ensuring that these are implemented well require resources, systematic planning, and political will.The onset of the November smog should be thought of as a symptom, not the disease. It is, however, an annual reminder that we have a long way to go.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/confronting-everyday-sources-of-pollution-across-the-country/story-tXXS7tRxrNRzKfjB4WF1aJ.html
