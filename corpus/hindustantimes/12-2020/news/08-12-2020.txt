08-12-2020||News||Tackling pollution, beyond stubble burning | Opinion||In what is an annual fixture, the onset of cooler weather signals the beginning of a prolonged ordeal for residents of the National Capital Region (NCR) as they grapple with severe air pollution. This year too, the infamous Delhi smog has made its presence felt with air quality levels falling to “very poor” and “severe” levels, posing a major health hazard, especially for senior citizens and children.While several factors contribute to the NCR pollution, the one that grabs maximum headlines is stubble burning by farmers in neighbouring states. However, the truth is that stubble burning is a temporary phenomenon that peaks during the months of October-November and cannot explain the long spell of bad air that Delhi endures, extending into December. Several studies have attributed this pollution to a mix of internal factors such as vehicular emissions, carbon-spewing power plants, industrial pollution including brick kilns and stone crushers, dust on roads and at construction/demolition sites, and burning of solid waste and biomass.While stubble burning continues to be a sensitive inter-state issue, the local administration should focus on these “internal” factors and mitigate them through proper planning, strict governance and the active participation of common citizens. There are no quick fixes, but by following what I call the 4C approach, we can make a positive start towards improving the air quality in NCR.The first C is choice. And here, the first step is accelerating the transition away from fossil fuel-driven thermal power plants towards renewable energy (RE). RE is carbon emission-free and harnesses sunlight and wind, both of which we are abundantly blessed with. Steady advances in technology have led to a steep fall in the price of power generated from renewables — it is, thus, the more economical choice, besides its obvious environmental benefits. Further, a sharp reduction in the prices of batteries has brightened the prospects of optimal storage solutions which will help nullify the intermittency barrier associated with renewables. Any new power purchased in the future must be renewables-driven and the central and state governments must push through additional reforms on a war-footing to further expand our renewables capacity. Similarly, industries must complement this by switching to low carbon and energy efficient technologies.The second choice is to hasten the shift to low carbon mobility. The Delhi government would do well to fast-track its plans of introducing electric buses, two and three-wheelers and cabs. It should offer the right mix of tax breaks for producers and subsidies for consumers to encourage adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) alongside innovative schemes such as buying back old petrol/diesel cars for cheaper EVs. It is equally important to have a wide network of charging stations which use RE for recharging. The government must expand the mass rapid transport system and establish it as a safe and affordable mode. Another key step should be to strengthen infrastructure for non–motorised transport by building dedicated pavements and lanes for cyclists and pedestrians.A third key choice is to increase the green cover amid the concrete jungle that Delhi-NCR has become. Trees, plants and shrubs act as a carbon sink and trap atmospheric dust. The creation of an urban forest land bank will pave the way for prompt compensatory afforestation.The second C is compliance. Despite having multiple regulations, there is weak on-ground implementation. Many agencies either lack the human resources to monitor and detect violation of pollution norms or lack the legal teeth to enforce punitive action. It is important that industries violating emission standards are strictly penalised. We should have zero tolerance for construction companies failing to comply with guidelines to mitigate dust, landfill fires and waste-burning.The third C is campaign, by involving “volunteer citizens”. Delhi government must undertake drives to educate and influence citizens to make lifestyle changes that can improve the environment. This includes simple ideas such as using public transport or carpooling, switching off the car at traffic stops (as Delhi has encouraged this year), using inverters instead of diesel generators and proper segregation and disposal of household waste. A well-conceived campaign can also boost rooftop solar adoption. For this, the Delhi government must share information about vendors, connect them to potential buyers and also ensure access to affordable finance.And finally, the fourth C is coordination. Bad air knows no boundaries and a multiplicity of agencies working in silos doesn’t help the situation. A regional approach and integrated planning are the need of the hour. Instead of working at cross purposes, we must have a clear delineation of responsibilities between various bodies so we can fix accountability. There must be information-sharing so that various programmes are aligned with each other.No doubt, the situation is dire but we hope that the central and state governments work in unison to clear the air in NCR. Citizens must not be denied their most basic right — that of breathing clean air. The 4C approach can be a guiding framework for an effective agenda to end the NCR’s pollution woes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/tackling-pollution-beyond-stubble-burning-opinion/story-haE7OG4nBF4VFX38355TLP.html
08-12-2020||News||Treating agriculture as a business||Entrepreneurs around the world will be delighted to run a business where raw material and inputs to the business are subsidised and the output price for specific quantities of purchases is guaranteed by the government of the land. To make the deal sweeter, there is no tax to be paid on the value added between the input and output.Indian agriculture has had all this and more — but there is a problem. It has not been seen as a business at all. As successive governments after Independence constantly battled food security challenges, the humble farmer got elevated to the hallowed ranks of the soldier guarding the border. But when food security was achieved and stocks of wheat and rice started rotting in the warehouses of the Food Corporation of India, there was no political will to nudge farmers towards rethinking their occupation as a business.This June, the Narendra Modi government finally acted to free Indian agriculture from a regime of State-endorsed monopolised value chain intermediation. The government was not taking away intermediation — that’s an essential part of any value chain in all businesses. It was only breaking the monopoly of the Agriculture Produce Marketing Committees (APMC) and their traders.The government finally treating the largest occupational group in the country with the respect it deserves, by providing it choice and freedom, should have led to a cry of joy. Indeed, when these ordinances were brought in June, there was no widespread opposition. Ashok Gulati, eminent agriculture economist, called it a “1991 moment” for Indian agriculture. But winter is fast becoming the trimester for protesters to learn a new grammar of anarchy, and this year has turned out to be no different.Farmers mainly from Punjab, with sporadic support from other states, learnt well from the winter of ‘19. To be sure, the protesters still constitute a fraction of the total population dependent on agrarian economy. Yet, they marched to Delhi and blocked several borders of the national capital restricting flow of goods and services. Their demand? Repeal the agriculture reforms in totality.Punjab and Haryana were the earliest beneficiaries of the Green Revolution. Farmers in these states worked hard, and used the region’s natural abundance and the influx of new technology to soon become the grain bowl of India. The government would guarantee a Minimum Support Price (MSP) for their produce year after year; the APMC system worked well; and up to 70% of the central food grain procurement continued to happen from these two states.But this monopoly on government procurement also eventually became their undoing. First, other states such as Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh caught up on food grain production. Second, as Punjab and Haryana got guaranteed prices year after year, there was no local innovation. Instead, more chemicals made their way to the fields, leading to the rise of cancer. The story of the Bhatinda-Bikaner daily cancer train is well-documented. Third, young people from rich rural families migrated overseas or were happy to do odd jobs on farms, with labour coming in from far-off Bihar and other states, leading to the erosion and exodus of local talent.The problem of plenty has hit Punjab hard since the turn of the century. Since then, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Karnataka, Kerala, Gujarat, Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu have gone past Punjab on per capita net state domestic product calculated at constant prices with 2011-12 reference. This data point, brought out by economist Shamika Ravi on her Twitter feed, explains the decay the state has suffered in the last two decades.Addicted to the allure of MSP, Punjab’s agriculture has become relatively uncompetitive. And its farmers are now up in arms, worried that the option of free market trade will expose that weakness. The MSP demand is simply a smokescreen — the government, to adhere to India’s food security act and to run a host of welfare programmes, will continue to procure on the basis of MSP.The Punjab farmer protest has had little resonance in most parts of India. This is because other states are hardly a beneficiary of MSP, except where state governments procure directly from farmers. Also, the adoption of collective negotiation through Farmer Producer Organisations and involvement of private buyers has been growing faster in other states, even if this remains low in absolute terms. These structural differences mean that farmers elsewhere are happier to experiment with a single national market, which is a new option available to them.As negotiations between Punjab farmers and the central government continue, the “1991 moment” of Indian agriculture hangs in balance. Any backtracking on part of the government will create a template for narrow interest groups to oppose future reforms. Staying put in its position exposes the government to a battle of attrition involving the siege of Delhi.Ronald Reagan once remarked that the government’s first duty is to protect the people, not run their lives. The farmers of Punjab clearly disagree.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/treating-agriculture-as-a-business/story-FWtVIL9RKIG3w8iaUuxSTM.html
08-12-2020||News||The illegality of Uttar Pradesh’s crackdown on interfaith marriages||With Uttar Pradesh leading the way, a set of states now plan to pass laws to end what they call “love jihad”, a term which lacks any real definition and is beyond comprehension. This will make it a non-bailable, cognisable offence. Apart from the fact that it has no basis in law, the practical implication of this is that the constable on the street will have the power to arrest someone considered guilty of this “crime” without seeking the court’s permission. This proposed law is wrong on many counts.First, the Constitution enshrines secularism. This means India is not anti-religion, pro-religion or irreligious. Despite this, several states have had anti-conversion laws for a long time, including Odisha, Arunachal Pradesh, Gujarat, Himachal Pradesh and Jharkhand. However, these laws made it illegal to use force to convert a person. The so-called love jihad law plans to outlaw religious conversion which may take place for marriage purposes. This interferes with personal liberty.Second, based on Articles 25 to 28, an Indian citizen is guaranteed the freedom to practise any religion of his or her choice. The “love jihad” law curtails this freedom. The State wants to intervene not only in the citizens’ private relationship with God, but also in the choice of their spouse. In addition, the proposed law does not account for agnostics.Third, the Supreme Court in Shafin Jahan v Ashok KM (2018), after setting aside the annulment of the marriage of a Muslim convert from Kerala, Hadiya (Akhila Ashokan) and Shafin Jahan, a Muslim man, upheld the right to marry a person of one’s choice as a part of Article 21.The Court said, “Matters of dress and of food, of ideas and ideologies, of love and partnership, are within the central aspects of identity. The law may regulate (subject to constitutional compliance) the conditions of a valid marriage, as it may regulate the situations in which a marital tie can be ended or annulled…Matters of belief and faith, including whether to believe, are at the core of constitutional liberty. The Constitution exists for believers as well as for agnostics. The Constitution protects the ability of each individual to pursue a way of life or faith to which she or he seeks to adhere…The right to marry a person of one’s choice is integral to Article 21 of the Constitution.The Constitution also guarantees the right to life. This right cannot be taken away, except through a law which is substantively and procedurally fair, just and reasonable. Intrinsic to the liberty which the Constitution guarantees as a fundamental right is the ability of each individual to make decisions on matters central to the pursuit of happiness.” Therefore, the proposed law violates the right to life under Article 21.Fourth, in SC’s K.S. Puttaswamy v UOI (2017) judgment, it read the “right of choice of a family life” as a fundamental right. The regressive law limits the choice of a prospective spouse such that this spouse would only be one approved by the State.Fifth, the Allahabad High Court, on November 11, in the case of Salamat Ansari v Uttar Pradesh (2020), held that the choice of a partner is the exclusive domain of the individual. It also distinguished itself from the Noor Jahan Begum case (2014) by suggesting that this earlier case did not deal with the “liberty of two matured individuals in choosing a partner or their right to freedom of choice as to with whom they would like to live”.There is a robust legal framework which guarantees an individual the freedom to worship a God of his or her own choice and marry based on love. UP’s move is illegal for it will deny a citizen his or her choice in a deeply personal domain which is protected by the Constitution.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/the-illegality-of-uttar-pradesh-s-crackdown-on-interfaith-marriages/story-B68tOEYFWxTjDYM75LWhVM.html
