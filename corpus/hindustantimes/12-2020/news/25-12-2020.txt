25-12-2020||News||In the farm debate, focus on access to food||As the farmers’ protest continues, there is a case for convening the National Development Council, a forum of state chief ministers and the central government. A lapse in the passing of the farm laws was that the views of the states were not sought directly. Given that agriculture is a State subject under the Constitution, and there exists considerable variation between the states in the cropping and the land-holding pattern, this lapse ended up deepening the political divide. However, consulting the states on the question of the recently-enacted farm laws cannot be a substitute for a thorough review of agricultural policies in India.In a way, the government and the protesting farmers have one thing in common. They are both concerned with achieving higher farm prices. The government claims that the new laws will lead to farmers realising a higher price for their produce. Indeed, they are part of the government’s stated objective of doubling farm income. The farmers, on the other hand, are concerned that the new farm laws will have exactly the opposite effect — of lowering the prices they will receive as the entry of corporates will lead to a buyer’s market. However, for at least a third of India’s population, the price of food is already too high. We can see this in the share of food in the expenditure budget of households. In the National Sample Survey (NSS) report for 2011-12, this share ranged from close to 60% for the poorest 5% of households to a little less than 30% for the richest 5%. Actually, even 30% is high in an international comparison. For instance, the share of household expenditure on food in China is substantially lower than this figure. The “food problem” needs to be understood in terms of a population’s access to food, not merely its availability. Before considering the relevance of this, it is important to note three things. First, the expenditure on food referred to includes processed food, or food that has gone through a manufacturing process. Second, farmers do not receive the entire price paid for food by consumers. There is a margin due to intermediation and the movement from farm to home. Finally, cereals are only a part of household expenditure on food, so high minimum support prices for wheat and rice are only part of the food problem in India.The price of food has implications for both well-being and economic growth, and thus livelihoods. It is one factor determining access to food. The stubborn prevalence of malnutrition is revealed in the most recent report of the National Family Health Survey. The high price of food contributes to it. Of course, a rise in non-farm incomes can overcome this failure, but the price of food is also a determinant of non-farm income. The greater the share of household income spent on food, the less there is of it to spend on other goods and services. In this way, a high price of food stymies the expansion of the non-agricultural sector, notably manufacturing. This impacts the future of agriculture in a way that is not readily recognised. When opportunities outside agriculture are limited, there is a pressure of population on land, which leads to the fragmentation of land-holding through partitioning of the farm. This leads to unviable farm size, reflected in the response of a significant section of rural households in the NSS that they would leave agriculture if they had an option. The agrarian constraint can be overcome through exports, but to compete in the world market, a country must first grow a dynamic domestic manufacturing sector.Globally, the path to economic prosperity has been via a prosperous agricultural sector, but it has been accompanied by improving yields and a declining relative price of food — ie, of food becoming cheaper in relation to other goods. As food becomes cheaper, the non-agricultural sector expands as household expenditure is released, providing employment to some rural households. Farms do not fragment and their profits rise, for yield would have increased. Raising the yield of land would require public intervention and funding. Some of this funding will come from re-configuring the agricultural policy of the government of India.A group of economists have shown that, contrary to claims, the procurement of foodgrains in India is not confined to either the farmers of Punjab and Haryana nor large farmers. Actually, from the point of view of provisioning the public distribution system, for which purpose alone procurement exists, geography and the size of farm-holding should not matter. We are one country after all, and if the providers are from Punjab and Haryana, or even large farmers, so be it; we should be grateful to them. However, public intervention must be justified in the public interest. We are procuring far too much wheat and paddy in relation to what is needed. Public stocks have at times been more than twice the official norm, with some of it rotting while in “storage”. This ties up funds which can be used for the public expenditure needed for increasing yields, which ranges from extension services to the marketing infrastructure. The debate on the farm laws must be used as a moment to have a larger debate on the inter-linkages between farm holdings, farm incomes, access to food, enhancing the productivity of agriculture, and creating enough room for the growth of other sectors.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/in-the-farm-debate-focus-on-access-to-food/story-Cc4Z3dNW2edGTtsgYP1tFL.html
25-12-2020||News||In Nepal, an attack on democracy||When Nepal’s Prime Minister (PM) KP Oli dissolved Parliament and announced elections on December 20, he clearly overstepped his executive authority. Nepal’s entire political class, barring Oli, and Nepali civil society, including constitutional experts, overwhelmingly believe that the move was unconstitutional and illegitimate.Oli’s decision needs to be seen in a larger global context of democratically-elected leaders undermining democracy. Democracies now face a new challenge — where elected leaders can unleash democratic backsliding and carry out executive takeovers by taking a series of what appear to be “democratic” decisions.PM Oli has had a history of trying to use parliamentary acts and executive decisions to limit people’s freedoms. He has hollowed out independent institutions and sought to use them as mechanisms of political control, in order to reduce executive accountability and undermine opponents. Oli has packed in institutions such as the Election Commission, Department of Money Laundering Investigation, and most recently, the Commission for the Investigation of Abuse of Authority, with loyalists, often bypassing bipartisan constitutional methods of appointment, to maintain control. The dissolution of Parliament needs to be understood in this backdrop. Oli has expanded his control over the State, while bypassing the institutions that have tried to keep him accountable — Parliament, political party, and civil society.Oli has also, opportunistically, used political principles only when it has suited him, driven by a psychology that puts individual needs above that of democracy and constructs political ideologies to suit that need. For example, he is driven by a need for social affirmation of his personality and the desire to be seen as a statesman. To achieve this end, he replaced political ideology with a populist ideology that could camouflage his authoritarian streaks. He used the agenda of “nationalism” and development in theory while abandoning the democratic processes that could in fact strengthen the nation and unleash economic development.Given its history of political instability — Nepal has had over two dozen PMs in the last three decades — Nepal adopted a revised multi-party system that was different from the Westminster model. The new Constitution deliberately cut off possibilities for dissolution of Parliament at the whims of the executive or political parties. During the elections, the unified Nepal Communist Party (NCP) — a product of the merger of the Maoists and the Communist Party of Nepal (Unified Marxist Leninist) — promised political stability and development and claimed that only a political party with a clear majority can deliver political stability.Oli points to the opposition within the NCP — he has faced a severe challenge from former PMs Madhav Kumar Nepal and Pushpa Kamal Dahal “Prachanda” — as the reason for his non-performance and his decision to go for fresh people’s mandate. But this is disingenuous. In a multi-party democracy, political parties are the central means through which accountability is ensured. In any case, how the party ensures accountability is a matter internal to the party and the country cannot be held hostage to resolve petty internal differences. Oli did not want this accountability — and the more he got squeezed within his party, the more he unleashed his authoritarian impulses.Oli’s move shows that there is a clear disconnect between his personal needs and the nation’s challenges, especially in the face of Covid-19. At a time when the government should be focused on implementing the new Constitution, tackling the pandemic and protecting people’s livelihoods, the country will be — on paper — heading to uncertain and costly elections.Although the idea of obtaining a fresh electoral mandate sounds tempting, Nepal‘s political history is replete with instances where elections have been not held after being announced; the unconstitutional nature of Oli’s announcement will make it even more unlikely this time around. All of this will further undermine Nepal’s democracy and people’s trust in the process. There are extreme Right and extreme Left forces waiting for precisely this to overthrow the entire structure of a federal, democratic, secular, republican Nepal.The PM’s move also comes at a time when Nepalis are tired of the geopolitical rivalry between China, India and the United States in the domestic theatre. Many people perceive these great and emerging powers as interfering in Nepal’s internal politics and shaping policies to favour their strategic interests. Political instability in Nepal allows amoral political actors, especially non-democratic States, the opportunity to intervene.Nepalis want good governance, democratic stability and economic development. Supporting PM Oli’s move undermines all these principles. All external powers — particularly democracies — must recognise the true nature of what has happened in Nepal, the corrosion of democracy and the emergence of authoritarianism, and the possibility that this will invite a period of prolonged instability which will make it even more vulnerable to geopolitical actors.Vijay Kant Karna is a political scientist, former ambassador, and executive chairperson of the Centre for Social Inclusion and FederalismAjaya Bhadra Khanal is a former editor and research director at CESIFThe views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/in-nepal-an-attack-on-democracy/story-YpxtBe1sp8sFEVZSB0peqK.html
25-12-2020||News||The world of Atal Bihari Vajpayee||One of the troubles of understanding even a well-known public personality such as Atal Bihari Vajpayee — whose birth anniversary is on December 25 — is that unlike Mahatma Gandhi or Jawaharlal Nehru, who left behind troves of written work, Vajpayee rarely maintained dairies and journals. While researching for my recent book — Vajpayee: The Years That Changed India — I read many of his speeches and poems to try and understand his philosophical outlook, which he never articulated specifically but which can be gleaned from his words and actions.I was aware of a detailed essay that Vajpayee wrote for his friend NM (Appa) Ghatate, who was then editing a book of Vajpayee’s speeches, titled Decisive Days. I was also lucky to have with me a very detailed biographical note that Vajpayee wrote for Chandrika Prasad Sharma who was editing a book of his speeches. My understanding of Vajpayee’s worldview, particularly how he internalised his conception of history and how he saw contemporary circumstances, has benefitted hugely from reading these essays.There were five key tenets of what can be broadly considered as Vajpayee’s worldview. First, Vajpayee was convinced, as most associated with the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) are, that social divisions in Indian society had led to the nation becoming an easy victim of foreign aggression. He argued that the caste system fragmented Indian society, leaving only the Kshatriyas with the right to bear arms. Similarly, it denied almost everybody access to the Vedas and the Upanishads. He was sarcastic that the number of defenders at the Battle of Plassey was outnumbered by the audience, which wanted to know the outcome but would not participate in the battle. When the former sarsanghchalak of the RSS, Balasaheb Deoras, passed away, Vajpayee recalled that the former had said that if untouchability was not a sin, then nothing could be a sin. These divisions had to go.The second key driver in his mental make-up was a strong belief in Hindu traditions, but more in the cultural and philosophical sense rather than a religious or ritualistic sense. Vajpayee, like others from the RSS, held that the concept of “religion” was alien to India. What India had was different methods of worship, or upasana padhati, none of which had a monopoly on truth. The obverse side to this worldview was that loyalty to the motherland should trump any belief system. That is how they defined the term “Hindu”. This did mean that the followers of the Abrahamic faiths, which believe that they alone possess a monopoly on truth, and generally in the dominance of religious beliefs over civic nationalism, would have difficulty in accepting this hierarchy of systems. Vajpayee was also clear that the State should not discriminate on the basis of beliefs, rather it should respect all belief systems since they were a part of society.The third strong pillar of Vajpayee’s worldview was his obvious discomfort with conversions. He recalled, during a longish speech in Pune in 1988 felicitating the writer Pu La Deshpande, that even though Indonesia and Afghanistan had become Muslim, they had not given up their pre-Islamic heritage. He specifically mentioned that the Ramayana was part of Indonesia’s living traditions, and wondered why religious conversion meant discarding of cultural and historical heritage. Without specifically saying it, one can impute his meaning, which was that Muslims particularly should own up to Indian traditions, a sentiment that Jawaharlal Nehru conveyed to the students of Aligarh Muslim University on January 24, 1948. Nehru had said then that he was proud of India’s heritage and of “our ancestors who gave us an intellectual and cultural pre-eminence”. He then went on to question the Aligarh students and asked whether they felt the same or did they feel that this heritage was alien to them?Fourth, Vajpayee’s worldview was deeply rooted in the soil of India, and its literary traditions helped forge his mental make-up. The writers and works that he admired included Tulsidas’ Ramacharitmanas, Jaishankar Prasad’s Kamayani, Nirala’s Ram ki Shakti Puja and the poems of Mahadevi Verma. Premchand’s realism impacted him deeply. Other favourites included Jainendra (Patni aur Preyasi), Ageya (Shekhar: Ek Jeevani) and the many works of Vrindavan Verma, which included historical tales and folklore of his and Vajpayee’s Brajbhumi. These writers reminded him of past glories but also forced him to think about the challenges that needed to be overcome.And finally, Vajpayee seemed convinced that India was destined for greatness and, that, in fact, greatness was denied to it. The past was important to ground us but not to imprison us. Politically, the Cold War had ended and the emerging world seemed hostile to India. Vajpayee was able to fashion an approach to the United States (US) even as he defied it and went ahead with the nuclear tests. But he wanted India and the US to be on the same side since he foresaw that the rise of China would be deeply unsettling. He was open to improving relations with China but ultimately, believed India and the US were “natural allies”. Economically, he wanted to unshackle India’s entrepreneurial spirits. He was a natural reformer and made known his distaste for the licence permit raj, which held India back.Atal Bihari Vajpayee was a complex political figure — but there is little doubt that his complex worldview, which defies easy categorisations, helped shape the India of today.

25-12-2020||News||Girls and boys need equal tech access for online school classes||Among the many consequences of the Covid-19 pandemic, perhaps the most visible and immediate impact has been in the field of education. Schools were ordered to shut overnight for an indeterminate period to prevent children from getting infected as social distancing emerged as, and still is, the most-effective solution to contain the virus’ spread. Educational institutions quickly turned digital, embracing e-learning and online tools to impart education remotely. Virtual classrooms were promptly created where students from kindergarten to higher grades connected through a choice of online conferencing platforms, attending classes from homes. No one knew, and still do not know, when the physical classrooms will again be filled with the curiosity of eager students. The next best alternative, therefore, was to adapt to the virtual world.Over the last several months, students, teachers, parents, and schools swiftly settled into the new world of screen-based learning from homes. The pedagogical quality of such a system is a matter of debate, but simulated teaching spaces persist as the best substitute when schools continue to remain shut.The dominant argument favouring such an approach is that, at the very least, it establishes continuity in education, even if it is imparted remotely. There is no gainsaying the fact that a wider digital footprint can serve as a powerful force to spread literacy and building a knowledge-based society. For the disadvantaged and the marginalised, education opens a whole new array of opportunities.While, on the face of it, there can be no dispute over imparting education digitally given the current conditions, there is a more essential question that needs deeper scrutiny. Is online, remote teaching widening the gender-bias against girl students?A few data points can be helpful to examine this. According to The Mobile Gender Gap Report 2020 of Groupe Speciale Mobile Association (GSMA) that represents the interests of mobile operators worldwide, only half of the women in India use mobile internet compared to men—21% among of women compared to 42% of men.This disparity appears to have manifested even more adversely during the Covid-19 pandemic. A September 2020 study by Centre For Catalysing Change, a not-for-profit organisation, shows how adolescent boys had more access to digital infrastructures such as mobile phones, internet services, radio, and media. This evidence is particularly troubling, demonstrating how lack of access to gadgets and technology may have forced many girls to stay away from any form of digital schooling over last few months.A study by Young Lives, on childhood poverty worldwide, mirrors that same disturbing gender dimension to digital access in India. According to the study, “Boys in India are much more likely than their female peers to use a computer and the internet (as well as other forms of technology, such as a smartphone) regularly”.As much as 80% or four in five girls in the sample that Young Lives collected in Andhra Pradesh and Telangana have never accessed the internet, while nearly two among three (62%) have never used a computer. What does this data tell us? These numbers expose the vulnerability of girl students many of whom are also likely to be subjected to a deep gender bias. This hushed segregation at home can force many girls to drop out of the school system forever. This also raises the worrying possibility of their being forced into early marriage and child labour. The government’s official statistics also broadly corroborate the hypothesis. In a survey Key Indicators of Household Social Consumption on Education in India, nearly a third (30.2%) of the women cited household tasks as their reason for discontinuing education.While these biases have dealt a severe blow to girl education, there is now growing fear that the continued absence from physical schools can also push many girls towards under-nourishment. India’s Mid-Day Meal (MDM) scheme, launched 1995, is among the world’s largest state-funded school feeding programme. The MDM provides free and nutritious lunch to approximately 100 million children, aged 6-14 years, across 1.3 million government primary and upper primary schools, for at least 200 days a year.The scheme has been particularly effective for key target groups such as children of migrant workers, many of whom were rendered jobless overnight as the pandemic swept through the country. Children of domestic help, carpenters, electricians, mechanics and other self-employed service providers have been beneficiaries of the MDM scheme in urban areas.This incentive has collapsed because of the Covid-19-forced school shutdowns that may have compelled many families to withdraw their daughters from school. A time-series school enrolment data that may be available a few years from now could throw up some worrying trend lines on dropouts.This has struck a double blow for poor girl students. Staying away from school has denied them the necessary mid-day meals and nourishment for months on end, while lack of access to gadgets and basic digital devices has deprived them of school education. These prevailing digital gaps may well mirror the biases that currently exist in India, manifesting in inequalities in many places, including between boys and girls.The ed-tech sector, rightly so, has been toasted for quickly and efficiently making education accessible through technology in a highly disruptive pandemic-created environment. But the gender-specific digital divide even among the poor and disadvantaged is reason for disquiet. A strong political will and sharp policies are the need of the hour to bridge this gap swiftly before it becomes an issue of grave social prejudice.Sourav Banerjee is country director, India, Room to Read The views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/girls-and-boys-need-equal-tech-access-for-online-school-classes/story-yB0qwTMIYT9yTf8gpRqLbM.html

These writers reminded him of past glories but also forced him to think about the challenges that needed to be overcome.And finally, Vajpayee seemed convinced that India was destined for greatness and, that, in fact, greatness was denied to it. The past was important to ground us but not to imprison us. Politically, the Cold War had ended and the emerging world seemed hostile to India. Vajpayee was able to fashion an approach to the United States (US) even as he defied it and went ahead with the nuclear tests. But he wanted India and the US to be on the same side since he foresaw that the rise of China would be deeply unsettling. He was open to improving relations with China but ultimately, believed India and the US were “natural allies”. Economically, he wanted to unshackle India’s entrepreneurial spirits. He was a natural reformer and made known his distaste for the licence permit raj, which held India back.Atal Bihari Vajpayee was a complex political figure — but there is little doubt that his complex worldview, which defies easy categorisations, helped shape the India of today.
