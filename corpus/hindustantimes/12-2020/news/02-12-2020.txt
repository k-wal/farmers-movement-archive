02-12-2020||News||Corporate-owned banks pose a risk||The Reserve Bank of India (RBI), the sentinel of our banking system having occasionally faltered as the supreme banking regulator, is often seen to be working in tandem with the government. Perhaps that is the reason why some suspect that its recent recommendation that pave the way for industrial houses to own and control banks may well have originated from a government which realises that public sector banks lack the capacity to provide credit to meet the growing needs of industry; that the supply of credit is unlikely to match its demand.Public sector banks with the baggage of non-performing assets (NPAs) have limited space to lend. Consequently, more banking and financial institutions are needed to serve the demands of industrial enterprises.Ever since demonetisation in 2016, the economy’s steep downturn has been a cause for concern. With the onslaught of the Covid-19 pandemic, its crippling effect is being felt in almost every sector of the economy other than those that use technology and digital platforms for providing goods and services. Several sectors of the economy are in dire need of credit. Public sector banks are reluctant to advance them credit for obvious reasons. Apart from the norms of RBI, the Kamath Committee’s parameters for restructuring of loans will lead to large sections of business enterprises being deprived of credit. Given these parameters, the State Bank of India, the largest lender among public sector banks, may restructure barely 5% of distressed borrowers. Public sector banks are averse to risk-lending. Bank officers, being easy targets, are concerned about becoming victims in future at the hands of the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI). No bank is likely to extend credit unless the loan is fully secured by collateral, the value of which gives absolute comfort to the bank. There is hardly any sector of the economy which has assets, in the midst of the pandemic, to provide enough security for advancing credit. The most badly-hit sectors are road construction, real estate, housing and hospitality, manufacturing and tourism, among others. These sectors provide maximum employment opportunities for the less privileged. Ironically, these are also the sectors that are starved of credit.A few large corporate houses control a substantial part of our national assets. We are seeing the rise of economic oligarchs in key sectors of the economy. The perception gaining ground is that a few close to this government are patronised by public sector banks which provide them the much-needed capital in the form of credit to acquire assets critical for our future needs. If industrial houses are licensed to set up banks, they will ensure that a large part of the credit goes to their “relative subsidiaries and other connected enterprises”. RBI does not have the wherewithal to oversee every such banking transaction. Experiments in other countries allowing industrial houses to set up banks have failed miserably. The United States (US) does not allow corporate houses to set up banks. It violates the principle of conflict of interest and can, on no account, be justified.Given the fact that industrial houses already control critical assets in our economy, to allow them to set up banks will make them even more powerful. A democratic country cannot afford to have its economy being controlled by a few powerful industrial houses which also have a huge stake in the banking system.Of deeper concern is the public perception that these industrial houses are close to the ruling establishment. The electoral bonds which have been issued are seen to be contributions by such corporate houses to the political party in power. This gives rise to the suspicion that in the event they are allowed to set up banks, lending too will be targeted to benefit businesses and individual borrowers associated with or close to the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). Inherent in such a situation is rampant discrimination in the flow of credit which, in turn, will build compliant businesses and destroy non-compliant enterprises.We have seen in the past how scams have occurred within the banking system. The scandals emerging from suspect banking practices in Yes Bank, ICICI Bank, Infrastructure Leasing & Financial Services Limited (IL&FS), Dewan Housing Financial Corporation Limited (DHFL) and many others, including individuals being investigated, have discredited both the banking system and the manner in which it is regulated. RBI’s oversight mechanisms are clearly not effective enough. The practices within the Non-Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs) have also left much to be desired. It is imperative for RBI to consider other mechanisms to expand lending to businesses. The expansion of NBFCs under strict regulatory mechanisms is one option, but the heart of the problems lies in the direct and indirect influences that operate within our banking structure which need course correction. Unless the banking system adheres to strict parameters guided by best practices, the possibility of the banking system turning around and providing for much-needed credit to the industry is bleak. That RBI has made such a recommendation despite the contrary opinion of the expert committee, is disturbing. RBI must justify its decision with unequivocal logic before it embarks upon this enterprise. Otherwise, it will not only compromise its own dignity and independence, but will also be charged with being a dependent, rather than an independent, banking regulator.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/corporate-owned-banks-pose-a-risk/story-irwwGFQfy57MXVWbeIxYKL.html

Teaching and learning have largely been in a foreign language. But a change is in the offing, with the advent of the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020. Prime Minister (PM) Narendra Modi recently tweeted: “Taking inspiration from the National Education Policy, it will now be tried to teach all technical courses including medical, engineering in mother tongue.”It is time we focused on the use of the mother tongue or regional language as a medium of instruction in higher education. The discussion on the use of the mother tongue in education goes back to the time of Lord Macaulay. This debate continued in post-independent India with the release of the Radhakrishnan Committee report of 1948-49, known as the Report of the University Education Commission. It recommended that English be replaced by an Indian language as the medium of instruction for higher education as early as practicable. This was followed by the Official Language Commission, Emotional Integration Committee, NEP (1968), NEP (1986/1992) and NEP 2020.Each report also pronounced that Indian languages are a sine qua non for educational and cultural development since they strengthened equity in education.The current NEP recommends that higher education institutions should use the mother tongue/local language as a medium of instruction, and/or offer bilingual programmes. This will help provide quality teaching to more students and thus increase Gross Enrolment Ratio (GER) in higher education. It will also promote the strength, usage, and vibrancy of all Indian languages. This way, private institutions too will be motivated to use Indian languages as a medium of instruction and/or offer bilingual programmes. This will ensure that there is no difference between government and private institutions.The teachers’ training programme, the four-year Bachelor of Education dual degree, will also be bilingual. This will facilitate the training of cadres of teachers across subjects. Science and math teachers will also adopt the bilingual approach to teaching.To translate recommendations into action, high-quality learning and print material in Indian languages, including textbooks, workbooks, videos, plays, poems, novels and magazines, will be developed. This will be done by creating quality programmes in translation and interpretation. To this end, an Indian Institute of Translation and Interpretation (IITI) will be established. This will employ numerous scholars in Indian languages, subject experts as well as experts in translation and interpretation. Technology will be used to aid in these translation and interpretation efforts.Teaching in the mother tongue/ regional language will help in building an equitable education system. The ministry of education will work to develop an equitable system based on the principles of fairness and inclusion. For the system to be fair, we should ensure that the personal and social circumstances of students should in no way be obstacles to realising their full academic potential. At the same time, to ensure inclusion through the use of the mother tongue/ regional language, we should set up a basic minimum standard of education which eliminates all disparity.While it is necessary to strengthen Indian languages as medium of instruction while enhancing the principle of equity in education to improve educational standards, it is equally imperative for students to have a good command over the English language since they are global natives in the 21st century. But this cannot be at the cost of Indian languages as a medium of instruction. Indian languages must be supplemented by English. It is heartening to note that institutions such as the Indian Institutes of Technology, Kharagpur and Roorkee, and Banaras Hindu University, among others, have come forward to promote the use of Indian languages. These initiatives will prepare students to live in a local, national and global society utilising a harmonious blend of Indian languages and English as recommended by NEP.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/in-higher-education-it-is-time-to-prioritise-indian-languages/story-G9qRgxvZHqrJsRcI2b1kWN.html
02-12-2020||News||Strive for a sustainable ocean economy||Global warming, along with the impact of other negative human activities, is devastating our oceans. This has led to an alarming rise in sea levels that could displace millions of people. The ocean is turning warmer, less predictable, and more acidic, causing a decline in fish stocks and the death of coral reefs.The millions of tonnes of plastics dumped into the oceans every year contaminate at least 700 species of marine life. Unregulated overfishing has already driven many marine species to extinction and this could eventually threaten global food security. Oceans produce half the planet’s oxygen and absorb more than 90% of the anthropogenic heat. The ocean-led economy is estimated to be contributing more than $1.5 trillion a year to the global economy, with millions employed in related sectors.We must understand that if the resources of the ocean are sustainably harnessed, it could multiply economic benefits while protecting the natural ecosystem. The solution lies in collaboration among stakeholders, governments, businesses and coastal communities.The High Level Panel for A Sustainable Ocean Economy (Ocean Panel), launched in 2018 by 14 world leaders, is leading the initiative for a sustainable ocean economy. It comprises leaders from Australia, Canada, Chile, Fiji, Ghana, Indonesia, Jamaica, Japan, Kenya, Mexico, Namibia, Norway, Palau and Portugal. It has proposed the ocean as a solution to a more resilient world and has committed to sustainably manage 100% of their national waters.The Covid-19 pandemic and the economic loss caused by it have increased the need for governments to find opportunities for sustainable growth. The Ocean Panel lays emphasis on the fact that the ocean economy will be more important than ever for a post-Covid-19 recovery. A report commissioned by the panel — Ocean Solutions That Benefit People, Nature and the Economy — spells out the new contours of the relationship between the ocean and humanity.Investing $2.8 trillion today in four ocean-based solutions — offshore wind production, sustainable ocean-based food production, decarbonisation of international shipping, and conservation and restoration of mangroves — will yield a net benefit of $15.5 trillion by 2050, the report says. It also delineates the path for policymakers to achieve a sustainable ocean economy by focusing on five building blocks: Using science and data to drive decision-making; engaging in goal-oriented ocean planning; de-risking finance and using innovation to mobilise investment; stopping land-based pollution; and changing ocean accounting so that it reflects the true value of the ocean.All this will be key in achieving what the report calls the three Ps of effective protection, sustainable production and equitable prosperity. The incentives for governments to undertake this are powerful in terms of net benefits in the long-run.India, with its coastline of 7,500 km, has a lot to gain if it aligns itself with the objective of a sustainable ocean economy. We have coast harbours, rich ecosystems with extensive mangroves, seaweed beds, salt marshes and coral reefs. About 250 million people live within 50km of the coast, many of whom depend on the sea for their livelihood.India has to do a lot in the management of maritime litter, especially plastics. Around 80% of all marine pollution originates on land. The most effective way of stopping ocean pollution is to tackle pollution on land. Shifting to a circular economy will yield enormous benefits.The responsibility for tackling plastic pollution lies not just with the government, but also corporates. Corporates must play a major part in reducing plastic pollution. Hindustan Unilever Limited, as the biggest consumer products company in India, aims to keep plastics within the circular economy. Unilever has committed to ensuring that 100% of plastic packaging is fully reusable, recyclable, or compostable by 2025. Over the last two years in India, we have facilitated the safe disposal of more than 1,00,000 tonnes of post-consumer use plastic waste. We have partnered with United Nations Development Programme and Xynteo’s India 2022 coalition to establish holistic solutions for managing end-to-end dry waste management and achieve circular economy for plastics including through behavioural change.The development of a sustainable ocean economy is essential for India in its quest to become a $10-trillion economy in the next decade-and-a-half. With wide-scale collaboration, the help of data-driven decision-making, goal-oriented ocean planning, mobilising of investment under innovative models and reducing the land pollution, we can achieve economic goals sustainably.The ocean holds answers to several challenges that humanity is facing. We must protect what we are left with. As the report says, “The ocean is not too big to fail, and it is not too big to fix. But it is too big to ignore.” We owe a sustainable ocean economy to our next generation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/strive-for-a-sustainable-ocean-economy/story-XKesEve1bFdzYYlAhGRHSM.html
02-12-2020||News||On farm laws, how the Centre faltered||The farmers’ agitation at Delhi’s doorstep exposes deep fault lines and new possibilities in the politics of representation, the politics of reforms and the politics of Centre-state relations. These have significant consequences not only for the future of agriculture, but also for the future of negotiating economic reforms and federal relations in India.First, on the politics of representation. Yogendra Yadav’s repeated reference to the Mahendra Singh Tikait-led farmers’ protest of 1988 to emphasise the “historic” nature of the current protests is a reminder of the deep vacuum of agrarian interests in contemporary party politics. This was the result of an economic consensus that sought to push agriculture to the margins — the best way to improve agricultural productivity is to get people out of agriculture was the well-accepted policy mantra. Agrarian interests were depoliticised and farmers treated as a constituency to be managed. However, in recent years, growing agricultural distress has led to a resurgence of farmer agitations — for instance, the long march in Mumbai in 2018 — which pushed agriculture into the mainstream discourse of the 2019 election and highlighted the return of farmers as a political constituency. The post-Green Revolution mobilisation coalesced around the interests of landed farmers. However, deepening agrarian distress led to a broadening of solidarities, as documented by the scholar Shreya Sinha in the specific instance of Punjab, that cut across traditional class, caste and gender lines. In the long march of 2018, Adivasi and landless farmers walked alongside the landed, demanding political recognition. The current protests, although dominated by landed farmers, also include small farmers and farm labourers. Regardless of their economic rationale, the new farm laws have amplified uncertainties for all those whose livelihoods are intertwined with agriculture, and it is these collective anxieties that are finding political expression today. The Centre’s refusal to address these anxieties, and instead clamp down hard and discredit protests as voices of vested interests or worse, is a great disservice to the genuine fears that are seeking expression. But, in its hubris, the government is also opening up new sites of mobilisation that have the potential to shift the current status quo in agrarian politics.Second, the entire chain of events from the promulgation of the ordinances to their passage as Acts exposes the deep failures of our politics of reforms. India’s reform narrative has repeatedly pitted politics against “good economics”, demonstrating impatience with the often endless negotiations and compromises that politics necessitates. It is this impatience that has legitimised bypassing political and institutional processes in the name of reforms. The three farm laws are a textbook example of this approach. Choosing to introduce central legislation on state subjects without any debate, refusing to consult farmers or even to give their anxieties a hearing, and pushing the bills through Parliament without debate are, at one level, typical of the modus operandi of this government. But, at another level, they also have deep legitimacy in a policy discourse that is impatient with the pulls and pressures of realpolitik. By riding roughshod over processes and bypassing politics, reforms, especially those that seek to bring about far-reaching changes in the existing status quo as the current farm laws seek to do, fail to overcome resistance and push poor policy design. There is no question that India’s agriculture markets are in urgent need of reform, but to assume this can be done without responding to the anxieties of those impacted — farmers, middlemen and labourers — and without assurances of protection and finding a middle ground, is a recipe for failure. Worse, we are now locked in a politics of distrust where arriving at a consensus for reforming the subsidy regime, price support system and procurement will be near-impossible. Reforming agriculture needs a politics and institutional process where farmers have a stake in reforms and an assurance that their concerns will be responded to. Finally, the federal question looms large in the entire reform approach. On the one hand, it risks weak implementation. By centralising agriculture reforms, the laws leave unaddressed the question of ownership of state-specific functions — from taxation to dispute resolution and building physical markets, vital to effective implementation. States can easily pass the buck to the Centre, leaving in its wake a vicious cycle of reform failure, not unfamiliar to India. Successful reforms need Centre-state coordination, and not centralisation. But the greater challenge is political. By introducing legislation on state subjects, the farm laws set a dangerous precedent that risks reopening the federal consensus. Moreover, Haryana’s response to protesters from Punjab also points to new emergent tensions in inter-state dynamics.Now that the process of negotiations has begun, will the current impasse break? The laws are unlikely to be repealed and the farm leaders probably know this. But it is for the Centre to show political statesmanship and use this opportunity to rebuild trust with farmers and bring the states to the negotiation table. A renewed politics of trust is the only way India can set about the task of reforming agriculture.Yamini Aiyar is president and chief executive, Centre for Policy Research.

02-12-2020||News||Don’t create a world of immunity haves and have-nots||On November 23, Qantas CEO Alan Joyce said his airline is considering a rule requiring passengers to get a coronavirus vaccine before they can board its planes. Joyce added the idea was being discussed in a broader conversation among his peers, although the International Air Transport Association called the idea “a bit premature”. Premature as it may be, similar ideas — such as what has been referred to as immunity passport — have been spoken of in the context of the pandemic, and as vaccines begin shipping, it is likely to take centre-stage soon.There are legal and practical precedents for what Joyce suggested, known as vaccination certificates recognised by the World Health Organization’s International Health Regulations (IHR). At present, the sole universal disease recognised is the Yellow Fever — passengers arriving from affected regions (mostly African and South America nations) or travelling to them may be required to produce them. Covid-19 vaccination certificates could be included in WHO recommendations under its “public health emergency of international concern” guidelines or any of 196 member-states could ask for an inclusion of it under IHR. But mandating these certificates at any level, international or domestic, comes with ethical and economic implications till vaccines become affordable, accessible and are in adequate supply for all. Assessments of vaccine supply deals suggest high-income countries have secured the bulk of the supply available till the end of the next year — some have enough commitments to cover their populations twice over. Once they do receive a vaccine, low and middle-income countries (LMICs) are likely to take longer to inoculate their large populations.The lack of adequate supply chain infrastructure and electricity can compound these challenges, as can typically endemic issues of corruption and domestic inequity that often afflict the Global South. WHO’s state of inequality report in 2019 found that full childhood immunisation — possibly the closest example of vaccines that are a must — coverage varies wildly in LMICs. In the 67 LMICs surveyed (excluding India and China), the median coverage varied from 51% to 83% for children under the age of one. In 16 countries, less than one in four children got full immunisation. In 11 of these countries, children in the richest quintile were twice as likely to be immunised as children in the poorest.Pharmaceutical powerhouses such as India and China are likely to be able to minimise their disadvantage, but — at least in the case of India — estimates by experts suggest only about 30-40% of the country is likely to be vaccinated till the end of 2021. For populations that do not have widespread coverage, this could translate into lopsided restrictions on even essential travel. The difference between the immunity haves and have-nots will not just impact lives but also livelihoods. Covid-19 has exacerbated inequities. People who have had the most capital have had access to better health care at a time when most public utilities have been overwhelmed. People in white collar jobs have been able to quarantine, isolate and earn while working from home, while others have lost pay and employment as their workplaces shut. Children who have the means continued studying online, while millions of others without phones or internet face a lost academic year.Governments and businesses must chart a path out of this pandemic that minimises inequities. These conversations have begun in some of the richest countries, such as the United States where President Donald Trump had access to potentially life-saving coronavirus treatment that is out of reach for ordinary Americans. It is a conversation that has been reignited by the high prices of the most effective vaccine candidates, which cost up to 10 times as much as the cheapest. Bioethicists and philanthropists had indeed flagged the issue as poorer countries struggled with lack of political or economic leverage. India must evaluate any decision that could lead us to prioritise those with immunocapital because the ones without it will likely be the victims of choices they did not make.The views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/don-t-create-a-world-of-immunity-haves-and-have-nots/story-qNMgeIpS44rffy4sTV5jcL.html
02-12-2020||News||Stewards, not bystanders: Civil society creates new opportunity to co-design cities||This year, I have been from Bengaluru to Kabini and back several times. Every time I return from the forest and the rural countryside, my eyes and senses hit refresh, and I see my home city with a new perspective.The overwhelming impression is of a metro undergoing a painful renewal. Masses of threatening concrete overhead, piles of rubble underneath. And through this grey canvas, dots of colour as hapless citizens weave through the traffic, without proper visibility or signposts, navigating past trucks and haulers, moody traffic signals and perplexing roundabouts.It feels as if Bengaluru, like so many other cities in India, is testing its residents. The unfinished infrastructure is a poster promise of a better future. The city demands patience, demands faith, demands hope. The residents experience resignation, weariness, and a lasting numbness.When I finally get home, I enter an urban version of the forest I left behind – my neighbourhood has a dense canopy of trees. Yet Bengaluru is not homogenous, and my sylvan surroundings are an anomaly now in the erstwhile garden city. It has a criss-cross of diverse identities and designs. It has layers and layers of privilege on top and tiers of disenfranchisement below. Yet, the dysfunctionality of the city creates a perverse equaliser. It brings an end to the secession of the elite. Our bubble breaks with the chaos of the traffic, the pervasive pollution and limitations on personal spaces.But there are now new opportunities to engage with the city’s future.All over India, there are efforts inviting citizens to re-imagine belonging. To make the city their own. The discourse has firmly shifted from whether the city should grow to how it should grow and change, and who should participate in the change-making.Today’s technologies enable mass participation in civic design. In metropolitan areas and beyond, digital age civil society organisations (CSOs), often helmed by creative young leaders, use tech-enabled design to challenge the supremacy of the State in urban futures. Thriving Residents’ Welfare Associations (RWAs) and dynamic CSOs seem determined to take back their city.For example, during the lockdown, Yugantar filed a Right to Information (RTI) petition to find the total number of slums and their population in the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation. This data was then shared with local NGOs to better target relief work. Haiyya, through a local campaign called Health over Stigma, helped hold service providers accountable for providing safe, non-judgmental sexual and reproductive health services, especially for unmarried women. Reap Benefit in Bengaluru has developed an open civic platform that comprises a WhatsApp chatbot, a web app and a civic forum. The chatbot guides users with simplified steps through a variety of civic challenges that are engaging and fun. If you see a pothole on the road, you can send photos, but go beyond reporting to next steps. A friendly technology helps convert agitation into action and turn bystanders into stewards.Civis understands that technical environmental legislation can sometimes bypass civil society, even though we are all heavily impacted by environmental degradation. In March 2020, a draft notification with radical new rules was put up by the environment ministry for public consultation. Civis put up a simplified version and more people were able to directly participate in the consultation.We must encourage these and many other samaaj-based efforts. More importantly, we must each find our own way to participate in these ventures. Democracy cannot be a spectator sport. Good governance must be co-created, not just consumed. No matter who you are, you are first a citizen. Even if you head a government department or a successful business — you remain a citizen first, a part of your community. And I believe it is only the samaaj and institutions of the samaaj that can hold the State accountable to the larger public interest of making our cities more livable for all.Luckily, today’s new technologies allow us to participate more effectively with relative ease. I am not talking about simple clicktivism, but how a tech-enabled, societal ecosystem can distribute the ability to solve; can democratise civic engagement; and can help people co-create their city’s future.However, there is an important caution here. We need civil society itself to get more digital in the digital age. Especially because only an engaged digital samaaj can keep tech corporations more accountable and prevent them from unleashing tools that distort the political and democratic process or reduce individual and collective agency. Urban movements are critical for this cause.The pandemic has forced us to speed up our thinking on what cities should look like in the future. Citizens now have more opportunities to take active part in building urban resilience. Young leaders are creating more options for empowered citizens to co-create more humane environments. When we return to the city from the forest, we should feel a buzz, not a burn.Rohini Nilekani is chairperson, Arghyam.

The ministry of education will work to develop an equitable system based on the principles of fairness and inclusion. For the system to be fair, we should ensure that the personal and social circumstances of students should in no way be obstacles to realising their full academic potential. At the same time, to ensure inclusion through the use of the mother tongue/ regional language, we should set up a basic minimum standard of education which eliminates all disparity.While it is necessary to strengthen Indian languages as medium of instruction while enhancing the principle of equity in education to improve educational standards, it is equally imperative for students to have a good command over the English language since they are global natives in the 21st century. But this cannot be at the cost of Indian languages as a medium of instruction. Indian languages must be supplemented by English. It is heartening to note that institutions such as the Indian Institutes of Technology, Kharagpur and Roorkee, and Banaras Hindu University, among others, have come forward to promote the use of Indian languages. These initiatives will prepare students to live in a local, national and global society utilising a harmonious blend of Indian languages and English as recommended by NEP.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/in-higher-education-it-is-time-to-prioritise-indian-languages/story-G9qRgxvZHqrJsRcI2b1kWN.html
02-12-2020||News||Strive for a sustainable ocean economy||Global warming, along with the impact of other negative human activities, is devastating our oceans. This has led to an alarming rise in sea levels that could displace millions of people. The ocean is turning warmer, less predictable, and more acidic, causing a decline in fish stocks and the death of coral reefs.The millions of tonnes of plastics dumped into the oceans every year contaminate at least 700 species of marine life. Unregulated overfishing has already driven many marine species to extinction and this could eventually threaten global food security. Oceans produce half the planet’s oxygen and absorb more than 90% of the anthropogenic heat. The ocean-led economy is estimated to be contributing more than $1.5 trillion a year to the global economy, with millions employed in related sectors.We must understand that if the resources of the ocean are sustainably harnessed, it could multiply economic benefits while protecting the natural ecosystem. The solution lies in collaboration among stakeholders, governments, businesses and coastal communities.The High Level Panel for A Sustainable Ocean Economy (Ocean Panel), launched in 2018 by 14 world leaders, is leading the initiative for a sustainable ocean economy. It comprises leaders from Australia, Canada, Chile, Fiji, Ghana, Indonesia, Jamaica, Japan, Kenya, Mexico, Namibia, Norway, Palau and Portugal. It has proposed the ocean as a solution to a more resilient world and has committed to sustainably manage 100% of their national waters.The Covid-19 pandemic and the economic loss caused by it have increased the need for governments to find opportunities for sustainable growth. The Ocean Panel lays emphasis on the fact that the ocean economy will be more important than ever for a post-Covid-19 recovery. A report commissioned by the panel — Ocean Solutions That Benefit People, Nature and the Economy — spells out the new contours of the relationship between the ocean and humanity.Investing $2.8 trillion today in four ocean-based solutions — offshore wind production, sustainable ocean-based food production, decarbonisation of international shipping, and conservation and restoration of mangroves — will yield a net benefit of $15.5 trillion by 2050, the report says. It also delineates the path for policymakers to achieve a sustainable ocean economy by focusing on five building blocks: Using science and data to drive decision-making; engaging in goal-oriented ocean planning; de-risking finance and using innovation to mobilise investment; stopping land-based pollution; and changing ocean accounting so that it reflects the true value of the ocean.All this will be key in achieving what the report calls the three Ps of effective protection, sustainable production and equitable prosperity. The incentives for governments to undertake this are powerful in terms of net benefits in the long-run.India, with its coastline of 7,500 km, has a lot to gain if it aligns itself with the objective of a sustainable ocean economy. We have coast harbours, rich ecosystems with extensive mangroves, seaweed beds, salt marshes and coral reefs. About 250 million people live within 50km of the coast, many of whom depend on the sea for their livelihood.India has to do a lot in the management of maritime litter, especially plastics. Around 80% of all marine pollution originates on land. The most effective way of stopping ocean pollution is to tackle pollution on land. Shifting to a circular economy will yield enormous benefits.The responsibility for tackling plastic pollution lies not just with the government, but also corporates. Corporates must play a major part in reducing plastic pollution. Hindustan Unilever Limited, as the biggest consumer products company in India, aims to keep plastics within the circular economy. Unilever has committed to ensuring that 100% of plastic packaging is fully reusable, recyclable, or compostable by 2025. Over the last two years in India, we have facilitated the safe disposal of more than 1,00,000 tonnes of post-consumer use plastic waste. We have partnered with United Nations Development Programme and Xynteo’s India 2022 coalition to establish holistic solutions for managing end-to-end dry waste management and achieve circular economy for plastics including through behavioural change.The development of a sustainable ocean economy is essential for India in its quest to become a $10-trillion economy in the next decade-and-a-half. With wide-scale collaboration, the help of data-driven decision-making, goal-oriented ocean planning, mobilising of investment under innovative models and reducing the land pollution, we can achieve economic goals sustainably.The ocean holds answers to several challenges that humanity is facing. We must protect what we are left with. As the report says, “The ocean is not too big to fail, and it is not too big to fix. But it is too big to ignore.” We owe a sustainable ocean economy to our next generation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/strive-for-a-sustainable-ocean-economy/story-XKesEve1bFdzYYlAhGRHSM.html
02-12-2020||News||On farm laws, how the Centre faltered||The farmers’ agitation at Delhi’s doorstep exposes deep fault lines and new possibilities in the politics of representation, the politics of reforms and the politics of Centre-state relations. These have significant consequences not only for the future of agriculture, but also for the future of negotiating economic reforms and federal relations in India.First, on the politics of representation. Yogendra Yadav’s repeated reference to the Mahendra Singh Tikait-led farmers’ protest of 1988 to emphasise the “historic” nature of the current protests is a reminder of the deep vacuum of agrarian interests in contemporary party politics. This was the result of an economic consensus that sought to push agriculture to the margins — the best way to improve agricultural productivity is to get people out of agriculture was the well-accepted policy mantra. Agrarian interests were depoliticised and farmers treated as a constituency to be managed. However, in recent years, growing agricultural distress has led to a resurgence of farmer agitations — for instance, the long march in Mumbai in 2018 — which pushed agriculture into the mainstream discourse of the 2019 election and highlighted the return of farmers as a political constituency. The post-Green Revolution mobilisation coalesced around the interests of landed farmers. However, deepening agrarian distress led to a broadening of solidarities, as documented by the scholar Shreya Sinha in the specific instance of Punjab, that cut across traditional class, caste and gender lines. In the long march of 2018, Adivasi and landless farmers walked alongside the landed, demanding political recognition. The current protests, although dominated by landed farmers, also include small farmers and farm labourers. Regardless of their economic rationale, the new farm laws have amplified uncertainties for all those whose livelihoods are intertwined with agriculture, and it is these collective anxieties that are finding political expression today. The Centre’s refusal to address these anxieties, and instead clamp down hard and discredit protests as voices of vested interests or worse, is a great disservice to the genuine fears that are seeking expression. But, in its hubris, the government is also opening up new sites of mobilisation that have the potential to shift the current status quo in agrarian politics.Second, the entire chain of events from the promulgation of the ordinances to their passage as Acts exposes the deep failures of our politics of reforms. India’s reform narrative has repeatedly pitted politics against “good economics”, demonstrating impatience with the often endless negotiations and compromises that politics necessitates. It is this impatience that has legitimised bypassing political and institutional processes in the name of reforms. The three farm laws are a textbook example of this approach. Choosing to introduce central legislation on state subjects without any debate, refusing to consult farmers or even to give their anxieties a hearing, and pushing the bills through Parliament without debate are, at one level, typical of the modus operandi of this government. But, at another level, they also have deep legitimacy in a policy discourse that is impatient with the pulls and pressures of realpolitik. By riding roughshod over processes and bypassing politics, reforms, especially those that seek to bring about far-reaching changes in the existing status quo as the current farm laws seek to do, fail to overcome resistance and push poor policy design. There is no question that India’s agriculture markets are in urgent need of reform, but to assume this can be done without responding to the anxieties of those impacted — farmers, middlemen and labourers — and without assurances of protection and finding a middle ground, is a recipe for failure. Worse, we are now locked in a politics of distrust where arriving at a consensus for reforming the subsidy regime, price support system and procurement will be near-impossible. Reforming agriculture needs a politics and institutional process where farmers have a stake in reforms and an assurance that their concerns will be responded to. Finally, the federal question looms large in the entire reform approach. On the one hand, it risks weak implementation. By centralising agriculture reforms, the laws leave unaddressed the question of ownership of state-specific functions — from taxation to dispute resolution and building physical markets, vital to effective implementation. States can easily pass the buck to the Centre, leaving in its wake a vicious cycle of reform failure, not unfamiliar to India. Successful reforms need Centre-state coordination, and not centralisation. But the greater challenge is political. By introducing legislation on state subjects, the farm laws set a dangerous precedent that risks reopening the federal consensus. Moreover, Haryana’s response to protesters from Punjab also points to new emergent tensions in inter-state dynamics.Now that the process of negotiations has begun, will the current impasse break? The laws are unlikely to be repealed and the farm leaders probably know this. But it is for the Centre to show political statesmanship and use this opportunity to rebuild trust with farmers and bring the states to the negotiation table. A renewed politics of trust is the only way India can set about the task of reforming agriculture.Yamini Aiyar is president and chief executive, Centre for Policy Research.

02-12-2020||News||Don’t create a world of immunity haves and have-nots||On November 23, Qantas CEO Alan Joyce said his airline is considering a rule requiring passengers to get a coronavirus vaccine before they can board its planes. Joyce added the idea was being discussed in a broader conversation among his peers, although the International Air Transport Association called the idea “a bit premature”. Premature as it may be, similar ideas — such as what has been referred to as immunity passport — have been spoken of in the context of the pandemic, and as vaccines begin shipping, it is likely to take centre-stage soon.There are legal and practical precedents for what Joyce suggested, known as vaccination certificates recognised by the World Health Organization’s International Health Regulations (IHR). At present, the sole universal disease recognised is the Yellow Fever — passengers arriving from affected regions (mostly African and South America nations) or travelling to them may be required to produce them. Covid-19 vaccination certificates could be included in WHO recommendations under its “public health emergency of international concern” guidelines or any of 196 member-states could ask for an inclusion of it under IHR. But mandating these certificates at any level, international or domestic, comes with ethical and economic implications till vaccines become affordable, accessible and are in adequate supply for all. Assessments of vaccine supply deals suggest high-income countries have secured the bulk of the supply available till the end of the next year — some have enough commitments to cover their populations twice over. Once they do receive a vaccine, low and middle-income countries (LMICs) are likely to take longer to inoculate their large populations.The lack of adequate supply chain infrastructure and electricity can compound these challenges, as can typically endemic issues of corruption and domestic inequity that often afflict the Global South. WHO’s state of inequality report in 2019 found that full childhood immunisation — possibly the closest example of vaccines that are a must — coverage varies wildly in LMICs. In the 67 LMICs surveyed (excluding India and China), the median coverage varied from 51% to 83% for children under the age of one. In 16 countries, less than one in four children got full immunisation. In 11 of these countries, children in the richest quintile were twice as likely to be immunised as children in the poorest.Pharmaceutical powerhouses such as India and China are likely to be able to minimise their disadvantage, but — at least in the case of India — estimates by experts suggest only about 30-40% of the country is likely to be vaccinated till the end of 2021. For populations that do not have widespread coverage, this could translate into lopsided restrictions on even essential travel. The difference between the immunity haves and have-nots will not just impact lives but also livelihoods. Covid-19 has exacerbated inequities. People who have had the most capital have had access to better health care at a time when most public utilities have been overwhelmed. People in white collar jobs have been able to quarantine, isolate and earn while working from home, while others have lost pay and employment as their workplaces shut. Children who have the means continued studying online, while millions of others without phones or internet face a lost academic year.Governments and businesses must chart a path out of this pandemic that minimises inequities. These conversations have begun in some of the richest countries, such as the United States where President Donald Trump had access to potentially life-saving coronavirus treatment that is out of reach for ordinary Americans. It is a conversation that has been reignited by the high prices of the most effective vaccine candidates, which cost up to 10 times as much as the cheapest. Bioethicists and philanthropists had indeed flagged the issue as poorer countries struggled with lack of political or economic leverage. India must evaluate any decision that could lead us to prioritise those with immunocapital because the ones without it will likely be the victims of choices they did not make.The views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/don-t-create-a-world-of-immunity-haves-and-have-nots/story-qNMgeIpS44rffy4sTV5jcL.html
02-12-2020||News||Stewards, not bystanders: Civil society creates new opportunity to co-design cities||This year, I have been from Bengaluru to Kabini and back several times. Every time I return from the forest and the rural countryside, my eyes and senses hit refresh, and I see my home city with a new perspective.The overwhelming impression is of a metro undergoing a painful renewal. Masses of threatening concrete overhead, piles of rubble underneath. And through this grey canvas, dots of colour as hapless citizens weave through the traffic, without proper visibility or signposts, navigating past trucks and haulers, moody traffic signals and perplexing roundabouts.It feels as if Bengaluru, like so many other cities in India, is testing its residents. The unfinished infrastructure is a poster promise of a better future. The city demands patience, demands faith, demands hope. The residents experience resignation, weariness, and a lasting numbness.When I finally get home, I enter an urban version of the forest I left behind – my neighbourhood has a dense canopy of trees. Yet Bengaluru is not homogenous, and my sylvan surroundings are an anomaly now in the erstwhile garden city. It has a criss-cross of diverse identities and designs. It has layers and layers of privilege on top and tiers of disenfranchisement below. Yet, the dysfunctionality of the city creates a perverse equaliser. It brings an end to the secession of the elite. Our bubble breaks with the chaos of the traffic, the pervasive pollution and limitations on personal spaces.But there are now new opportunities to engage with the city’s future.All over India, there are efforts inviting citizens to re-imagine belonging. To make the city their own. The discourse has firmly shifted from whether the city should grow to how it should grow and change, and who should participate in the change-making.Today’s technologies enable mass participation in civic design. In metropolitan areas and beyond, digital age civil society organisations (CSOs), often helmed by creative young leaders, use tech-enabled design to challenge the supremacy of the State in urban futures. Thriving Residents’ Welfare Associations (RWAs) and dynamic CSOs seem determined to take back their city.For example, during the lockdown, Yugantar filed a Right to Information (RTI) petition to find the total number of slums and their population in the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation. This data was then shared with local NGOs to better target relief work. Haiyya, through a local campaign called Health over Stigma, helped hold service providers accountable for providing safe, non-judgmental sexual and reproductive health services, especially for unmarried women. Reap Benefit in Bengaluru has developed an open civic platform that comprises a WhatsApp chatbot, a web app and a civic forum. The chatbot guides users with simplified steps through a variety of civic challenges that are engaging and fun. If you see a pothole on the road, you can send photos, but go beyond reporting to next steps. A friendly technology helps convert agitation into action and turn bystanders into stewards.Civis understands that technical environmental legislation can sometimes bypass civil society, even though we are all heavily impacted by environmental degradation. In March 2020, a draft notification with radical new rules was put up by the environment ministry for public consultation. Civis put up a simplified version and more people were able to directly participate in the consultation.We must encourage these and many other samaaj-based efforts. More importantly, we must each find our own way to participate in these ventures. Democracy cannot be a spectator sport. Good governance must be co-created, not just consumed. No matter who you are, you are first a citizen. Even if you head a government department or a successful business — you remain a citizen first, a part of your community. And I believe it is only the samaaj and institutions of the samaaj that can hold the State accountable to the larger public interest of making our cities more livable for all.Luckily, today’s new technologies allow us to participate more effectively with relative ease. I am not talking about simple clicktivism, but how a tech-enabled, societal ecosystem can distribute the ability to solve; can democratise civic engagement; and can help people co-create their city’s future.However, there is an important caution here. We need civil society itself to get more digital in the digital age. Especially because only an engaged digital samaaj can keep tech corporations more accountable and prevent them from unleashing tools that distort the political and democratic process or reduce individual and collective agency. Urban movements are critical for this cause.The pandemic has forced us to speed up our thinking on what cities should look like in the future. Citizens now have more opportunities to take active part in building urban resilience. Young leaders are creating more options for empowered citizens to co-create more humane environments. When we return to the city from the forest, we should feel a buzz, not a burn.Rohini Nilekani is chairperson, Arghyam.
