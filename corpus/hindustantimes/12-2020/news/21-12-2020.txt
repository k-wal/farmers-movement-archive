21-12-2020||News||In gratitude to the scientific community||The year 2020 has been the “Year of Science”, when the best of humanity has shone through the gloom that descended upon us due to the Covid-19 pandemic. It is a matter of record that as the spread of the disease accelerated, so did research efforts to mitigate this. Major global collaborations were set up so that scientists could share their expertise, and plans were implemented to speed up clinical trials so that treatments, vaccines, and diagnostics could take place quickly, without compromising safety. For all this work, governments, businesses, and philanthropic organisations got together and started committing resources. Both science, and the deepening of international collaboration, has been remarkable features of the year.  In fact, the dedication of scientists across the globe has been laudable, not just for producing a string of life-saving breakthroughs but for doing so at an unprecedented pace. I applaud each organisation that has supported the research response to Covid-19 and made us proud.The biggest success of this pandemic has been teamwork and science community putting the right outcome ahead of individual rewards. Scientists and organisations actually focused on delivering on meaningful goals, whether it was across nations, across continents, or indeed, the world. During the pandemic, scientists exhibited that we can deliver at any pace, retain the quality of our diagnostics and care, and build confidence and trust that speed doesn’t mean lack of quality.I have always personally believed that the fruits of our collaboration on science and health care need equitable distribution. We must deliver those to everybody in the world, and create a more equal world. As chairman of the executive board of the World Health Organization, I have been talking about this to countries, funding agencies, scientists and philanthropists. There is commitment from everyone and I consider that among the most important outcomes of 2020.The pandemic has only reinforced the science community’s consistent and indefatigable efforts in addressing societal problems stands. It would not be an exaggeration to say that a great deal of the developmental work that has been achieved by our government in the last six and a half years bears the hallmark of efforts made by our scientists, technology experts and innovators. The effort to organise the India International Science Festival (IISF) since 2015 is to celebrate exactly this fact. IISF’s aim is to engage the public with science and showcase how science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) provide us with solutions to improve the quality of our lives. The ministry of science and technology and the ministry of earth sciences, in association with Vijnana Bharati (VIBHA), have created this unique platform called IISF which intends to inspire curiosity and make science learning more rewarding.The festival aims to reach out to the student community so as to ignite their scientific spirit. What started as a small event, has now matured into a much-awaited annual scientific gathering involving students, scientists, academia, media, and the general public. IISF is a platform open for people from all sections of society and from diverse backgrounds to experience and enjoy science activities, achievements and innovations in all spheres of life. Every edition of IISF has grown bigger and better, and emerged as an eagerly awaited celebration of science. Scientific events at the IISF have broken global records and have entered the prestigious Guinness Book of World Records. IISF is being celebrated virtually this year, from December 22 to 25. The Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR), through its National Institute of Science, Technology and Development Studies (CSIR-NISTADS) is organising this mega virtual event. The theme of IISF2020 is “Science for Self-Reliant India and Global Welfare”, which is based on the clarion call given by Prime Minister Narendra Modi for building a self-reliant India that can contribute to global good. This four-day science festival aims towards strengthening and expanding the soft power of our nation globally. As many as 41 different events covering STEM disciplines have also been included in the IISF 2020 to attract young and innovative minds.If 2020 has been the year of discovery for Covid-19 vaccines, 2021 will be the year we face the challenge of getting it across to people across the world who most need it. This IISF-2020, let’s take the pledge to redouble our commitments to put an end to the current pandemic and to further enhance cooperation that makes lifesaving science possible.With all its devastation, 2020 has been a great scientific success story. For me, the recognition of scientists as first responders to grave humanitarian threats is really important. At the same time, ensuring all low and middle-income countries have access to safe and effective Covid-19 tests, treatments and vaccines is the outstanding challenge. To the scientists who gave everything to vaccines, tests and treatments this year, a big shout out and a bigger thank you.Harsh Vardhan is the Union minister for science & technology, earth sciences, health, & family welfareThe views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/in-gratitude-to-the-scientific-community/story-tP20wK3UqxhfCIJrVxZg2N.html
21-12-2020||News||The equitable and efficient deployment of vaccines||As we together continue to strengthen all aspects of COVID-19 response, we must not only reinforce and build the capacity of immunisation systems, but also ready them to meet our next challenge — to equitably and efficiently deploy vaccines against Covid-19.Almost all countries in the World Health Organization (WHO) South-East Asia Region plan to procure a first tranche of vaccines from the WHO-supported COVAX Facility, the vaccine pillar of the Access to Covid-19 Tools Accelerator. For the allocation framework to be effective, and for at least 2 billion doses to be delivered to all participating countries globally by the end of next year, immediate and sustained increases in international and global funding are required. Rapid advances in research and development on vaccines against Covid-19 have seen more than a handful of vaccines reach phase 3 trials, and some have already gone for emergency use authorisation, or are likely to do so very soon. Anticipation is building.As and when vaccines are found to be safe and effective, countries will need to activate detailed plans to efficiently deploy the initial tranches of Covid-19 vaccines to cover up to 20% of the most vulnerable of their population, and to carry out coordinated and equitable deployments thereafter. WHO will continue to provide member-States its full support to help finalise such plans, with a focus on several key areas.First, defining priority groups for vaccination. The WHO Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on immunisation has, in recent months, published critical guidance that considers priority groups for vaccination based on different epidemiologic settings and vaccine supply scenarios. Informed by the guidance, countries must make evidence-based, context-specific decisions, accounting for the risk-profile of different groups based on age, underlying health and comorbidities, and socio-demographic risks, among other factors. Across all settings, and whatever the supply scenario, it is imperative that frontline health personnel are provided first access.Second, enhancing service delivery, communication and vaccine demand. Across the region, countries must identify platforms to deliver vaccines to target populations, while also strengthening infection prevention and control protocols. But of increasingly urgent need is the development and roll-out of comprehensive plans to identify and train an adequate number of health workers and volunteers to administer the vaccine. Crucially, communities must continue to be engaged, listened to and provided high-quality, scientifically sound information, which will in turn drive vaccine demand.Third, strengthening vaccine cold chain and logistics. Even to reach an initial 20% coverage, countries may have to increase cold chain capacity, which will require additional resources. Logistics working groups will need clear terms of reference and standard operating procedures, not only to coordinate the deployment of vaccines, but also to source and deliver ancillary products. To address these and other challenges, WHO will continue to work with international and global partners to mobilise the financial, material and technical resources required.Complacency must not set in. Although vaccine manufacturing has already started, reaching sufficient availability will take time. In a crisis such as this, there are no silver bullets. Today, tomorrow, and for many more months to come, we must continue to implement the basic public health measures that we know work, and which have defined our “new normal”. Wash your hands. Wear a mask. Maintain physical distance and avoid the three Cs — crowded places, close-contact settings, and confined and enclosed spaces.Almost a year since Covid-19 emerged, we have cause for optimism. Countries in the region are to be commended for beginning immunisation planning as early as July, for carrying out vaccine readiness assessments, and for continuing to act in solidarity and with recognition that vaccines are a global public good. Now is the time to firm up and finalise such plans, for the equitable and efficient protection of vulnerable populations, and for the health and well-being of all.Poonam Khetrapal Singh is regional director, WHO South-East Asia RegionThe views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/the-equitable-and-efficient-deployment-of-vaccines/story-XCVyhR9GUvpxzve4QRrYSJ.html
21-12-2020||News||How much India should invest in the Indo-Pacific||Recently, the office of the United States (US) Secretary of State issued a policy brief that was termed simply, “The Elements of the China Challenge”. The first page starkly spelled out the US goal — “in the face of the China challenge, the United States must secure freedom”. The urgent need to counter China, that President Donald Trump made central to his foreign policy positions, was outlined by his administration in different issue areas. But it was particularly outlined with respect to the “Free and Open Indo-Pacific” or FOIP — a region widely considered to be the locus of great power competition in the 21st century. The concept of the “Indo-Pacific” has now been adopted as a fundamental part of US national security strategy. Subsequently, cooperation between America and its partners in the Indo-Pacific, and the development of the Quad (the US, Japan, Australia, and India) has been likened to everything, from a system as organised as a structured alliance (a possible Asian NATO) to a diplomatic treaty (“nascent pact”) to a vague international outlook (“shared vision”). In all of these imaginings, the US sees India’s participation as important for the success of an Indo-Pacific architecture. But what are the advantages and disadvantages for India in being a full participant in a re-imagined security, diplomatic, and economic architecture?In some ways, the advantages are obvious. The stability of the Indo-Pacific region is not just key to the security of the US but to the security of all countries that reside within the region. But, at the same time, there is a persistent threat of instability given the competing ambitions of two rising powers, China and India, and the hostile relationships of Asian nuclear powers. This makes the region a vital area of strategic interest for India. The countries that are considered to be the crucial pillars of the regional order — the Quad — are also all democracies. The incoming Joe Biden administration has made it clear that it sees an emerging partnership of democracies as crucial for establishing an alternative value system to that of China. And although Australia, Japan, and even India have downplayed the idea of any Indo-Pacific system as being exclusive, in other words, anti-China, the fact remains that containing China is an important glue holding together participating countries. Given the border clashes over the past few years, India needs the idea of an international rules-based order to ensure a FOIP, stymieing China’s activities, particularly in the maritime domain.But FOIP also brings thorny issues that India must navigate. The concept of the Indo-Pacific itself remains elusive. The Quad countries themselves are divided on it. Other than the Quad, ASEAN nations, who are crucial to the Indo-Pacific but have a back not front seat, are wary of the concept. Each country or bloc, thus, offers not only contradictory but sometimes even competing ideas about how they imagine the region. The US often talks of an Indo-Pacific strategy; Japan refers to FOIP; India talks about an Indo-Pacific framework; Australia simply uses the generic Indo-Pacific as a region descriptor; and ASEAN talks of an Indo-Pacific outlook. These differences are not simply about the nomenclature but go deeper. Geographically, Japan thinks of the Indo-Pacific as composed of two continents (Asia and Africa) and two oceans (Pacific and Indian). India talks about it as extending from the East Coast of Africa across the Indian Ocean, including parts of West Asia, to the Western and Southern Pacific. The US does not think of either Africa or West Asia as part of the Indo-Pacific. These differences are not simply about the nomenclature but go deeper. While the US is explicit about the Indo-Pacific containing China and particularly the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), Japan and India have thus far eschewed declaring that it is centred on any open confrontation with China. Australia largely avoids direct discussions of how to deal with Chinese encroachment. And ASEAN, for its part, is more focused on obtaining better infrastructure, and is less concerned about China and the broader implications of BRI in the region while being constantly worried about creating an overt anti-China stance.These differences mean that there is currently no clear normative foundation on which a pan-regional architecture can be built. If FOIP is to be more than a security alliance, containing China cannot be the only raison d’etre. India’s position has itself has evolved on the Indo-Pacific. On one hand, in 2018, Prime Minister Narendra Modi explicitly noted, in a clear nod to China, that, “India does not see the Indo-Pacific as a strategy or as a club of limited members”. On the other, this year, India finally invited Australia to join the Malabar naval exercises, boosting Quad security cooperation, and exacerbating Chinese worries. At some point, India will have to jump off the fence and land on a side — and there are indications that this may be happening but hard choices lie ahead. This is particularly so because the idea of the Indo-Pacific is still evolving, and because President-elect Biden has already made it a clear priority. India will need to decide whether it will be a founding architect as the US hopes, or a more passive bystander in what could be one of the key framings of international order for decades to come.Manjari Chatterjee Miller is associate professor of international relations, Frederick S Pardee School of Global Studies, Boston University, and a research associate at the Oxford School of Global and Area Studies, University of OxfordThe views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/how-much-india-should-invest-in-the-indo-pacific/story-RTpV0XMBjBIO2p0oVW3D8O.html
