In spite of that, a very low percentage of security personnel tested positive," Gunjyal said.During the noitified period of Kumbh from April 1-April 30, swab samples of 55,55,893 people were tested for Covid out of which 17,333 tested positive, he said.The Kumbh Mela, which is attended by people from different parts of the country in large numbers, drew flak from various quarters as the number of Covid-19 cases rose at a rapid pace during the days coinciding with the event.Prime Minister Narendra Modi had on April 17 appealed that the event in Haridwar be kept symbolic then on due to the Covid-19 crisis.Mela IG Sanjay Gunjyal said Saturday that devotees had begun to arrive for the event from March itself, and Mahashivratri also witnessed a big turnout of devotees.However, by April 1 Haridwar district had reported only 144 positive cases of Covid-19, he said.Gunjyal also denied making a downward revision of the number of people attending Kumbh Mela on the three major bathing days or Shahi Snan.The three Shahi Snan days fell during the notified period of the one-month Kumbh this year during which over 34.76 lakh people took a holy dip in the river, he said.As many as 21 lakh people bathed in the river on April 12 on Somwati Amavasya, 13.51 lakh on Mesh Sankranti on April 14 and 25,104 people on Chaitra Purnima on April 27, he said.These figures have never been revised or changed, the IG said.When told that an official release quoting Chief Minister Tirath Singh Rawat had put the number of people bathing in the river on April 12 at 35 lakh, the officer said he may have given the total number of devotees gathering at the ghats from April 1 to April 12.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/dehradun-news/data-proves-calling-haridwar-kumbh-covid-super-spreader-unfair-mela-security-incharge-101622343248460.html
