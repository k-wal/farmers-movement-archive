District police officials said they have started with four mounted squads, comprising two personnel each, who have been deployed at sensitive and congested clusters of Har-Ki-Pauri city Mela zone, Kankhal and suburban Jwalapur. “The directions came from the state director general of police. These squads will also appeal to people and educate them about adhering to Covid curfew guidelines as well as social distancing, and wearing face masks. They will also penalise the violators,” said Superintendent of police (city) Kamlesh Upadhyay. On Tuesday, 1,390 people were penalised, and 17 were seized over violation of Covid curfew which is in place till June 1.

Meanwhile, a section of traders has started opposing the move of police to penalise the violators. Staging a protest at Bada Bazar, close to Har-Ki-Pauri, under the aegis of Bada Bazar Vyapar Mandal, traders alleged that police are harassing traders, vendors, locals, and pilgrims in name of Covid curfew. “For the past 14 months, we have suffered heavily because of the pandemic. Shops were closed again a month ago. Traders who just want to keep a watch on their shops or are just standing there are being penalised, which is not fair,” said trader division spokesperson Tej Prakash Sahu.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/dehradun-news/haridwar-gets-mounted-cavalry-squad-to-rein-in-curfew-violators-101622028913552.html
26-05-2021||Dehradun||Uttarakhand slammed for Van Gujjar community living ‘below animal existence’||Uttarakhand high court has slammed the state government for “callousness” and for forcing families of Van Gujjars—a nomadic tribe of pastoralists who dwell in the Himalayan region-- to survive in conditions “below animal existence”. The court also ordered the government to provide them accommodation, food, water, medicines and get them tested for Covid-19 before letting them enter Govind Pashu Vihar National Park in Uttarkashi district.The state government reasoned before the court that letting the tribe enter the national park, may endanger the wildlife as the Sars-Cov-2 virus may spread from humans to animals.The directions were issued by the division bench of chief justice RS Chauhan and justice Alok Kumar Verma during the hearing on a public interest litigation (PIL) on Tuesday. HT has a copy of the order.The PIL was filed by a Delhi based NGO, Think Act Rise Foundation in 2019 to highlight the plight of Van Gujjars, who continue to occupy certain areas of the forests in the state. The PIL pleads for the community to be made a beneficiary under the Forest Right Act, giving them land rights and quashing petty cases against them.The HC noted that some migrating Van Gujjars were forced to live under open skies in tough conditions after they were denied entry to Govind Pashu Vihar National Park in Uttarkashi by the deputy director of the park, Komal Singh, despite holding permits.The HC order also cited the petition to note that since these families cannot sell the milk produced by their cattle due to the Covid-induced lockdown, their life was reduced to “below animal existence” for they have neither shelter, nor economic means to survive.Uttarakhand advocate general, SN Babulkar, said unless the families are declared to be Covid negative they cannot be allowed to enter the park as their migration may endanger the wildlife, the court order noted.The HC order cited photographs submitted by the petitioner to note that families are forced to live in open tents and fields under the open sky. “The photographs also show small children, and new born babies, being wrapped in blankets, and sleeping on the ground…It is, indeed, trite to state that Article 21 of the Constitution of India forbids the State from reducing the lives of its people below the animal existence,” the court order said.The court further underlined the right of every citizen to live with dignity and said, “However, it seems that the callous attitude of the deputy director of the park, and of the civil administration has forced these families to survive in conditions, which are below animal existence. Therefore, prima facie, the fundamental right to life under Article 21 of the Constitution of India is being violated by the respondents.”The HC then directed Uttarkashi district magistrate and the deputy director of the park to submit their compliance reports by June 15. The next hearing in the case will be on June 16.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/dehradun-news/uttarakhand-slammed-for-van-gujjar-community-living-below-the-animal-existence-101622028313488.html
26-05-2021||Dehradun||Centre finally lets Uttarakhand use locally made oxygen to meet state quota||The Centre has finally allowed Uttarakhand to use medical oxygen generated in the state for treatment of Covid-19 patients and also raised its oxygen quota following the high court’s intervention after several requests by the state government remained unanswered, a senior state official announced on Tuesday evening. Uttarakhand’s oxygen quota has been raised from 183 metric tonnes to 200 MT and the hill state is now under no obligation to procure oxygen from Jharkhand and West Bengal as was mandated by the Centre, said Amit Negi, secretary state health department.Uttarakhand was earlier granted a quota of 183 metric tonnes (MT) of oxygen, including 60 MT to be imported daily from Jamshedpur and Durgapur in Jharkhand and West Bengal, respectively. Uttarakhand had been requesting the Centre to let it meet its oxygen requirement from its own generation capacity, which easily exceeds the state’s quota. Negi said the state had set up 11 oxygen generation plants so far and more were being set up at district and sub-district levels. Earlier this month, the state government told high court that it had written to the Centre requesting an increase in oxygen quota, medical equipment such as oxygen concentrators, cylinders, and pressure swing adsorption plants, apart from permission to use medical oxygen generated locally, since its procurement from Jharkhand and Bengal, as per the existing quota arrangement, posed logistical challenges in maintaining its constant supply to far flung areas. The court asked the Centre to decide on the matter within a week, while expressing surprise at the Centre’s alleged “studied silence” over the issues and added that it was the Centre’s constitutional duty to come to the aid of state governments.Uttarakhand reported 2,756 fresh Covid cases on Tuesday, taking the state’s infection tally to 318,346. It also reported deaths of 80 Covid patients, taking the death toll in the state to 6,020.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/dehradun-news/centre-finally-lets-uttarakhand-use-locally-made-oxygen-to-meet-state-quota-101622008093061.html
