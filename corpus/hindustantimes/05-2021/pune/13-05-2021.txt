The civic administration has issued notices to some hospitals in the neighbourhood for the illegal activity. According to Vishal Shinde, city unit president of Janadhikar Sena, he had intercepted a PMC truck dumping medical waste around 3 am. The driver and mukadam incharge gave him evasive answers about the waste being thrown in the open in violation of Covid protocols. Shinde later lodged a complaint with the Bharati Vidyapeeth police station seeking an FIR against the civic staff. According to the complaint, dogs and pigs are seen scavenging the medical waste and later seen frequenting nearby residential areas. Following the complaint made to PMC deputy commissioner Ajit Deshmukh, the civic administration claimed to have issued notices to some nearby hospitals. Shinde claimed that medical and other waste are dumped by PMC trucks in the areas during night time. Shinde said, “While PMC is spending money on Covid treatment, it is unable to check illegal dumping of medical waste.” PMC senior health inspector Mangaldas Mane said, “Why the PMC vehicle of Kondhwa-Yeolewadi regional ward office went to Taljai Pathar is being probed. A show cause notice has been issued in this regard.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/medical-waste-dumped-at-taljai-pathar-in-pune-101620922371201.html

The newly added four villages are also major villages, like Sade Satra Nali, Fursungi, Uruli Devachi and Keshavnagar which add the population of the ward alone at 10 lakhs and which covers a total area of about 54 square kilometres.”“Secondly, it is located at the border and there is a highway touching the boundary so we have a constant floating population from the rural to urban and vice-versa. We have taken multiple strict actions to bring down the numbers,” he said.Meanwhile, Bhawani peth which had reported maximum cases during the beginning of the first wave has reported only 782 new cases between April 22 and May 5 making it the ward reporting the least number of new cases.

This first train carrying oxygen tankers, four, had arrived in Pune from Angul, Orissa. Total liquid oxygen of 55.04 metric tonnes arrived in these tankers and was escorted by police and RTO officials to an oxygen plant in Chakan. “It took us around 1.5 hours to unload the tankers from the train, as initially air was filled into tyres of each tanker. The weight of each tanker is huge. Each tanker came onto the ramp and was safely unloaded,” said Vijaykumar Chobe, upper tehsildar, Chobe added, “We are still in very much need of oxygen supply, not only Pune, but for other districts in the Pune division. As of now all four tankers will go to Chakan where the liquid oxygen will be unloaded and stored.”Currently, daily, 325 metric tonnes of oxygen is needed for Pune district. This is supplied through oxygen coming from Gujarat and Karnataka, and oxygen manufactures within Pune district. Also, 30 tonnes of oxygen supplied by France of 40 tonnes was given to Pune district by the state government. Renu Sharma, Pune divisional railway manager said, “The railways role in this oxygen tankers movement is only as a transporter. These tankers on the train came from Angul, Odisha, and were given a green corridor with a preference on the route to reach Pune. As the tankers were fully loaded, the speed of the train was kept to around 60 kmph. To unload the four tankers at Loni railway station, a special ramp was built within two days. After this first experience of unloading oxygen tankers, Pune division is fully prepared for further any such operations, either at Loni or Khadaki railway station.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/pune-railway-division-s-smooth-handling-of-oxygen-express-allows-city-to-breathe-easier-for-the-future-101620835003500.html

On May 12 at 7.30 am, Gaware and Sherpa, Pasang Zarok, reached the top of Mt Everest, a height of 8,848.86 metres. Gaware, a member of the Giripremi mountaineers club in Pune, summited his second 8,000-metre peak in less than a month. He climbed Mt Annapurna 1, the 10th tallest mountain in the world, on April 16. “I am tired, drained out, but extremely happy,” said Gaware, a resident of Wadgaonsheri, over the phone from base camp in Nepal. He calls his wife, son and his parents his strongest supports, that led him to achieve this feat. According to Umesh Zirpe, veteran mountaineer and leader of Giripremi expeditions, “Jitendra has been training for two years and has an exercise regime of six to seven hours, which is not easy. He has a good physique and was very focused on his training and goal of achieving his dream of summiting Everest. Although, Mount Annapurna is known for its extremely risky peak, it is every mountaineer’s dream to summit Everest.” Gaware has also climbed Mt Kanchenjunga, the third- tallest mountain in the world, in May 2019, and Mt Ama Dablam (Nepal), in October 2019. Gaware says he focused on endurance and trained rigorously by trekking 86km nonstop, from Sinhagad fort to Raigad, to Torna and back to Raigad. Bhushan Harshe and Dr Sumeet Mandale mentored Gaware.
