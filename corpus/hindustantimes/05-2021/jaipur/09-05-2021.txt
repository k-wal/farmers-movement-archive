The cub is suspected to have been killed by another adult tigress T-124, also known as Riddhi, in a territorial fight.A month back on April 1, a five-month-old tiger cub was found dead in Gandhra Deh area of RTR in mutilated condition. In the post-mortem, canine marks were found on its neck and the forest officials then said they suspected it was killed by another tiger.Additional conservator of forest Sanjiv Sharma on Sunday said this cub’s neck was broken and there were many injuries on the body, which was sent for a post-mortem.Sharma said the cub was one of the four born to tigress T-102 in August 2020. He suspected this cub might have separated from her mother last night and entered another tigress’ territory. They suspect that other tigress to be Ridhi, who was spotted moving in the area.“We were on routine patrolling today and spotted two tigers running, little ahead we spotted the cub’s body with a broken neck and injuries and [realised that it had been] dragged,” he said.Another forest official said the area where the cub’s body was found is the juncture of territories of tigress T-102 and T-124. He said four tigresses: T-84 (arrowhead), her two daughters Ridhi (T-124) and Sidhi (T-125), and T-102 (the mother of the dead cub) move in zone 3, 4 and 5 of the RTR. “In RTR, the issue is of territory. The Reserve has crossed its carrying capacity, now either there will be fights related to territory or migration of tigers, which then will be difficult to track outside the protected area,” he said.The official claimed that since November 2020 to January 2021, the daughters of tigress Arrowhead – Ridhi and Sidhi have fought for territory at least five times.Retired IFS Sunanyan Sharma said RTR was overpopulated and the tigers will either move out to other forests; get into territorial fights, which could lead to even deaths; or move towards villages, where they could be poisoned.He said the only solution for effective tiger conservation is relocation, after developing the habitat.RTR’s 76 tigers including 21 cubs and sub-adults live in an area of 1,334 square kms, making it the third most congested habitat for the big cats in India after Corbett National Park in Uttarakhand and Kaziranga National Park in Assam.The ‘Status of Tigers in India-2018’ report said that Rajasthan has witnessed an increase in tiger population by 115% in the last 12 years.In a major setback to tiger conservation in Rajasthan, four tigers including two sub-adults were reported missing from RTR in March 2021. The administration had conducted intensive search for these missing tigers, which were not sighted for the past year, without success.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/jaipur-news/tiger-cub-killed-in-rajasthan-s-ranthambore-tiger-reserve-in-territorial-fight-101620563593903.html

The arrest has underlined the sad reality of black marketing of hospital beds, oxygen cylinders and life saving medicines at a time when an unprecedented rise in Covid infections has created a shortage of these essential medical supplies causing several deaths across the country.The case in Jaipur came to light after a man lodged a complaint with the ACB naming Ashok Gurjar, a nurse at a private hospital, as the man who sold him an ICU bed at the government-operated Rajasthan University of Health Sciences hospital for ₹1.30 Lakh. He said he was made to pay the first instalment amounting to ₹95,000 before his Covid infected wife was admitted to the ICU on Wednesday. She died within 48 hours of her admission on Friday; however, Gurjar kept calling him through the day demanding payment of the remaining ₹35,000 as part of the deal, said an ACB officer.The ACB set up a trap on Sunday evening and Gurjar was caught red-handed while accepting ₹23,000 from the complainant. The bureau said it was investigating the nature of his links with another male nursing staff at the RUHS, who introduced the complainant to Gurjar in the first place. It was also probing the role of a doctor posted in the ICU of the government hospital, who too has been accused of taking his cut of ₹50,000 from the total bribe amount, said the ACB officer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/jaipur-news/rajasthan-covid-patient-was-sold-icu-bed-for-rs-1-3l-in-jaipur-nurse-arrested-101620561433700.html

In such a situation, a door-to-door survey and distribution of medicine kits should be carried out, he said.This will enable timely examination of symptomatic patients and it will be easier to save lives by providing medicines at the initial stage of the infection, he added.Gehlot said experts are also anticipating a third wave of Covid-19 that could be more deadly. It is feared that it will affect children more.In view of this, infrastructure should be strengthened in children's hospitals. Intensive care facilities like NICU and PICU, etc., should be strengthened in these hospitals, he said.Health Minister Raghu Sharma suggested setting up oxygen plants at children's hospitals, too, to prepare the state for the potential third wave of the pandemic.Rajasthan recorded 160 Covid-19 fatalities and 17,987 fresh cases on Saturday that pushed the death toll to 5,506 and the infection tally to 7,38,786, according to an official report.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/jaipur-news/rajasthan-govt-will-consider-importing-covid-19-vaccines-cm-ashok-gehlot-101620506601788.html
