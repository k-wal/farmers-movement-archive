He, however, climbed up the stairs and is suspected to have jumped from the fourth floor of the apartment building.Police said neighbours heard a loud noise and found him in a pool of blood. An ambulance took him to the hospital where he later died of the injuries.“We spoke to his family and friends and they said he was extremely apprehensive about his father who showed no signs of recovery. He was also worried about transferring him to a different hospital. All this took a major toll on his mental health,” a second police officer said.Police have retrieved a video of Jain falling from the terrace of the building.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/jaipur-news/jaipur-engineer-worried-about-critically-ill-covid-ve-father-dies-by-suicide-101621249391805.html

Nearly five months later on May 13, the mother was traced to Udawala village in Jaipur district, where she was living with her 45-years old partner Prahlad Sahay.Kota rural circle officer, Vijay Shankar Sharma said Teena initially tried to throw the police off the track by claiming Nandini was with her grandparents but later confessed to have killed her with Sahay’s help.Sharma said Teena told police that she had fled from her village in Kota district on November 11 last year, and since then, she was living with Prahlad at his house in Udawala village, where Nandini was injured a month later on December 9, while playing with Prahlad.Teena said they took her to a doctor in Shahpura but he referred her to Jaipur for treatment. Since Prahlad was not interested in spending money on Nandini’s treatment, they choked her to death using a shawl, the police officer said. Later, the duo dumped her body in Sariska forests in Alwar.After arresting Teena and Prahlad for murder, a Kota police team has left for Alwar to recover Nandini’s body.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/jaipur-news/rajasthan-woman-kills-daughter-with-lover-s-help-both-arrested-101621242970152.html
