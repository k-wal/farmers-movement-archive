It would have been better if the central government had taken out the global tender and bought the vaccine and distributed it in the states and later would have taken payment from the state governments,” he tweeted.Ashok Gehlot, however, underlined that people did want that the Covid vaccine, like other vaccines, should be provided free of cost by the central government. “This will lead to a system of one-stop procurement that would be better for all states”, he said.For now, the states can only try to import the three vaccines approved by the drug controller: Covaxin, Covishield and Sputnik.A senior health department official said the Rajasthan government was aiming to issue the expression of interest on Thursday. The firms will be asked when at what rate, and how many vaccines they can provide. “Only those vaccines will be procured which are approved by the Drug Controller General of India, he said.He said the state has also procured oxygen concentrators through global tender. Around 62 companies in 13 countries were contacted before the government decided to source them from Russia, China, and Dubai.Recently, Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot had stated that there is a need to speed up vaccination to curb the spread of the virus and reduce fatality. All options should be considered for the availability of vaccines in the state. “The state will consider importing Covid-19 vaccine to ensure that the residents of Rajasthan are vaccinated at the earliest,” he said.Rajasthan officials said the shortage of vaccine has already slowed down the inoculation drive for the people in the 60-plus category. Over 52.20 lakh people in the 60-plus age group have received their first dose, of whichOnly 29% (15.07 lakh) of the 53.2 lakh people in the 60-plus age group who received their first dose have received the second dose. The remaining are running pillar to post to get vaccinated.In the 45-59 age group also, over 47.78 lakh people have been given the first dose. Of them, only 12% (5.66 lakh) have received the second dose.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/jaipur-news/raj-to-float-global-tender-for-covid-vaccine-says-centre-should-have-done-this-101620831120593.html
12-05-2021||Jaipur||Rajasthan mulling to float global tenders to procure vaccines: Health minister||The Rajasthan government is exploring the possibility of purchasing Covid-19 vaccines from other countries through global tenders, Health minister Raghu Sharma said on Wednesday.Chief minister Ashok Gehlot, however, said it would have been better if the central government had procured the vaccines by floating global tenders and distributing them to states.“On directions from the chief minister, the officers are exploring the possibilities of global tenders to purchase Covid vaccines,” Sharma said.He said there are 2.09 crore beneficiaries above the age of 45 years in the state and 4.5 crore doses were required to vaccinate them but the state has only 1.5 crore doses. For people in the 18-44 age group, 7 crore doses are needed, he said.“We placed orders for 3.75 crore doses but the supply is just in lakhs. There is a situation of uncertainty about the vaccines, therefore our officers are now exploring the possibility of global tenders for the vaccine purchase,” Sharma said.Meanwhile, Gehlot said several states were floating global tenders to procure vaccines due to lack of doses in the country.He said that the system of "one-stop procurement" would be in the interest of all the states.“It would have been better if the central government had procured the vaccines through global tenders, distributed them in the states and asked the state governments to pay,” Gehlot said in a tweet in Hindi.“However, the demand of the people is that the vaccine should be provided absolutely free by the central government. The system of one-stop procurement would be better for all states,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/jaipur-news/rajasthan-mulling-to-float-global-tenders-to-procure-vaccines-health-minister-101620820367142.html
