The health department issued a notification on Wednesday.The notification states a continuous increase in the number of patients with black fungus due to the effect of Covid-19 infection, black fungus has emerged as a side effect of Covid-19. This step has been taken in view of integrated and coordinated treatment.Mucormycosis (black fungus) is notified as an epidemic and notifiable disease in the entire state under the sections of Rajasthan Epidemic Act 2020.On the other hand, the availability of oxygen beds in several parts of Rajasthan has increased for the first time during the second Covid-19 wave in the state, albeit ICU (intensive care unit) beds with ventilators remain scarce at hospitals, officials said.The improvement comes as a result of the steep decline in daily Covid-19 cases in the state, the officials said.According to the health department data, daily Covid-19 cases, which were hovering around 18,000 about a week ago, came down to 8,398 on Tuesday.Health secretary Siddharth Mahajan said that in the past few days, the doubling time of Covid-19 cases in the state has increased from 21 days to 40 days. The recovery rate is at 80 per cent, which has eased the load on many hospitals, he said.In Jaipur, which has been persistently logging the highest number of cases in the state, 627 oxygen beds were vacant as of Wednesday, as per the government portal that tracks the real-time availability of the beds. A week ago, the city had only 95 beds available to cater to fresh Covid-19 patients.This has come as a major respite to the doctors who struggled to accommodate the increasing number of patients in already overwhelmed health infrastructure. There is, however, a dearth of ICU beds with ventilators in Jaipur. There are 849 such beds in Jaipur of which 831 were occupied by Wednesday, leaving only 18 available for fresh patients.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/jaipur-news/black-fungus-notified-as-epidemic-in-rajasthan-101621441294656.html

19-05-2021||Jaipur||People in Kota hiring ‘caretakers’ for hospitalised Covid-19 family members||Family members of Covid-19 patients in Rajasthan’s Kota are hiring ‘caretakers’ for attending to their hospitalised patients in Kota owing to the fear of catching Covid-19 or lack of enough family members who can look after the patients, HT has learnt. Sharda (40) brought her Covid-19 positive husband from native district Sawai Madhopur to neighbouring district Kota for treatment of Covid-19 a week ago. She hired a man on daily wages in Kota to help her take care of her husband at the Covid-19 dedicated hospital in Kota a few days ago. Sharda has no one else in her family other than her husband and kids. She is now looking to hire another caretaker as the one hired earlier left for better-paying work in the city.“I need a male caretaker to help me as there is no one to massage my ailing husband’s hands and legs which pain due to Covid-19 infection,” Sharda said. “Earlier, I hired a male caretaker for ₹700 per day but now I am again in search of an attendant,” she said. “I demand from the hospital administration to provide us with caretakers for looking after my Covid positive husband,” she added.Family members of Covid-19 patients keep these ‘hired’ caretakers in the wards of the dedicated Covid-19 hospitals by making them pose as family members and attendants of the patients.Since there has been a lockdown in the state from the last three weeks, many daily wagers lost their jobs and are forced to work as caretakers at hospitals for Covid-19 patients while putting their own lives at risk.These caretakers are reported to be taking per day wages of ₹700 to ₹1,000 for attending to the Covid-19 patients. One such hired caretaker is fifty-five-year-old Ved Prakash. “Due to the lockdown, I had no work as markets and shops were closed and when somebody asked me to work as a caretaker at the Covid hospital on daily wages I came here and started serving Covid patients,” Prakash said.“We are attending to Covid-19 patients in just face masks and gloves as neither the family members of the patients nor the hospital administration has provided PPE kits,” he alleged.Another caretaker told HT that family members of a Covid-19 patient gave him ₹700 per day for staying overnight in the Covid-19 ward with their hospitalised patient as the family was getting tired of looking after their patient the entire day.As per the people privy to the developments, there are over half a dozen or more people who are working as hired caretakers in the hospital. The reason for hiring such caretakers is either fear among family members of contracting the virus or lack of enough attendants to look after the patient. Superintendent of the Covid-19 dedicated government hospital in Kota, Dr Chandrashekhar Sushil, admitted the presence of hired caretakers in the hospital. “Nearly 10 days ago, hospital authorities caught a couple of people who were hired as caretakers for Covid-19 patients. They said that there were 4-5 women caretakers as well,” he said.“We are checking such hired caretakers but if the family members give us an undertaking that they have authorised some caretaker to look after their covid patient, we will allow them”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/jaipur-news/people-in-kota-hiring-caretakers-for-hospitalised-covid-19-family-members-101621429893252.html

19-05-2021||Jaipur||Rajasthan sounds alert for possible desert locust attack in Jaisalmer||Following an advisory by the UN’s Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO), Rajasthan’s Jaisalmer district has sounded an alert for a possible locust attack and directed authorities including the locust control department to plan, coordinate and execute a strategy to repulse it.On May 17, FAO said a few locust bands are likely to form in May in southwest Iran from where they may move east towards Pakistan. “Small adult groups to form in southwest Iran that may be supplemented by groups and small swarms arriving from Arabia, which will move east along the southern coast towards Pakistan,” the advisory said.The desert locust (Schistocerca gregaria) is the most destructive migratory pest in the world. In response to environmental stimuli, dense and highly mobile desert locust swarms can form. They are ravenous eaters who consume their own weight per day by targeting food crops. Just a single square kilometre of swarm can contain up to 80 million adults, with the capacity to consume the same amount of food in one day as 35,000 people.Large swarms pose a major threat to food security and rural livelihoods. FAO has long-standing expertise in monitoring Desert Locust populations and helping countries cope with this devastating crop pest.Following the advisory, Jaisalmer district collector Ashish Modi directed all officials engaged in the locust control operation to ensure highest priority to containment operations. “If any official [is] found negligent or violating order, he will be personally [held] responsible,” he said while asking them to continue following the Covid-19 guidelines during the exercise.Modi said as per FAO advisory, a locust attack in Pakistan at the end of May or in the first week of June was likely. “There are chances that after entering Pakistan, locust groups may further move towards India,’’ he said.In the past two years, more than 10 states, including national capital Delhi have faced locust attacks. Rajasthan too reported the first locust attack in Jaisalmer district on May 21, 2019, after a gap of 26 years. Many other districts of western Rajasthan including Barmer, Jalore, Jodhpur, Bikaner and Ganganagar too bore its brunt. Locusts caused a huge damage to Rabi crops in around 10 lakhs hectares of land in Rajasthan and Gujarat. However, it was contained by the second week of February.On April 11, 2020, the country faced the second locust attack spreading to more than 10 states including Rajasthan, UP, MP, Haryana, Bihar, Gujarat, Uttrakhand, Maharashtra and Chhattisgarh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/jaipur-news/rajasthan-sounds-alert-for-possible-desert-locust-attack-in-jaisalmer-101621422391830.html

They have also made some really hilarious memes,” he said, adding that some of the prominent names on YouTube also regularly make shows on covid-19.According to Ola, the social media campaign has now reached far away areas.District collector, Banswara, Ankit Kumar Singh said his social media group now reaches out to 2 Lakh people. “We decided that the best way to remove hesitancy was to speak to local leaders and Sarpanches and get them vaccinated. When their photos receiving vaccination went viral, a lot of people came forward,” he said, adding that new social media messaging is now being also used to spread the latest information on Covid-19.A senior police official posted in Dungarpur said there was a growing fear amongst tribal villages that vaccination may lead to impotency, but many of those rumours have largely subsided.“Tribal areas rely heavily on Bhopas (quacks) and chieftains, they don’t like outsiders, therefore, these social media campaigns in their own language felt like they were personally and respectfully addressed,” the official said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/jaipur-news/social-media-songs-videos-memes-woo-rajasthan-tribals-for-covid-vaccination-101621416437749.html
