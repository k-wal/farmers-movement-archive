He pointed out that the present petition is only concerned with Central Vista and not about other constructions.Mehta argued that here, the public interest is "very selective" in particular regarding the Central Vista project matter. He said the petitioner is not concerned about other workmen and other construction works that are going on maybe 2-3 km away from there."There is something unusual, and beyond what is portrayed as public interest. This is a facade of PIL to disguise something they always wanted to stop under one pretext or the other," Mehta submitted.In its reply, the Centre had called the plea "sheer abuse of the process of law and is one more attempt to stall the project" and urged the High Court to dismiss the petition with exemplary costs on the ground that it is an abuse of the process of law."Such attempts are going on since the inception of the project under one pretext or the other and in one name or the other. The following facts will satisfy this court that the petitioner has, while taking refuge under the present situation, made an attempt to stall the project under the garb of 'public interest'," the Centre said in its affidavit.After Mehta concluded his submission, Advocate Maninder Singh appearing for the Shapoorji Pallonji Group also opposed the PIL seeking suspension of construction activity for the Central Vista project.Advocate Singh said the petition is not bonafide. He submitted that the petitioner's lawyer had cited some media reports during his arguments, which are not admissible under law.Meanwhile, senior advocate Siddharth Luthra appearing for petitioner submitted that Central Vista shall now be called "Central Fortress of Death". He questioned if the deadline of November 30 is so sacrosanct that all of Article 19 and 21 should be thrown away.On May 7, the Supreme Court urged the Delhi High Court to consider the Public Interest Litigation (PIL) filed by petitioner Anya Malhotra seeking a stay on construction work of the Central Vista project in New Delhi amid the prevailing condition of coronavirus cases across the country and asked High Court to issue orders related to the matter.In December 2020, the Central Vista Development project was inaugurated by the Prime Minister. The Project intends to revamp 86 acres of land in Delhi, which includes Rajpath, Parliament House, Rashtrapati Bhavan, India Gate, North Block and South Block, Shastri Bhavan and Udyog Bhavan.The project envisages the construction of a new Parliament building, a common secretariat for central government offices, the Prime Minister's office and residence, the Special Protection Group building and the Vice-President Enclave. The construction work for the project is being carried out since January 5, 2021, after the top court dismissed petitions challenging the project.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhi-hc-reserves-judgement-on-plea-seeking-to-halt-central-vista-project-101621257831459.html

Several challenges of oxygen production and supply are being overcome. The steps taken by the country to augment human resources, like including MBBS students in Covid treatment, and ASHAs and Anganwadi workers in rural areas, provided extra support to the health system," the statement added.Stating that India's staggered vaccination policy has aided the country's fight, the PMO statement said, "Prime Minister underlined that the strategy of starting vaccination programmes with front line warriors has paid rich dividends in the second wave."About 90% of the health professionals in the country have already taken the first dose and the vaccines have ensured the safety of most of the doctors, the statement read.The meeting between PM Modi and a group of doctors comes as the trajectory of new infections for the entire country appeared to show signs of receding from a peak over the past week, according to data.For the first time since the second wave of the coronavirus pandemic hit the country, the number of active cases in the country began inching down – a crucial development as the onslaught of the second wave was marked by a soaring number of active cases, which resulted in shortages of vital supplies such as medical oxygen, life-saving drugs, hospital beds and ambulance services.A total of 281,911 new cases were reported on Sunday, the lowest in 27 days, taking the total number of infections in the country since the start of the outbreak to 24,964,718, according to Hindustan Times’ Covid-19 dashboard.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-lauds-exemplary-fight-by-doctors-in-second-covid-19-wave-discusses-vaccine-plan-and-mucormycosis-black-fungus-101621260562923.html
17-05-2021||India||CoWIN portal in Hindi, other languages from next week: Govt||The CoWIN portal will be made available in Hindi and 14 regional languages by next week, while 17 more laboratories will be added to the INSACOG network to monitor the variants of Covid-19, the health ministry said on Monday.According to a statement by the ministry, these decisions were announced at the 26th meeting of the high-level Group of Ministers (GoM) on Covid-19, chaired by Health Minister Harsh Vardhan, on Monday.Vardhan informed his colleagues that 17 new laboratories are going to be added to the INSACOG network to increase the number of samples screened and allow for more spatial analysis, the ministry said.The network is presently served by 10 laboratories located at different corners of the country.Speaking on their contribution to the country's achievements today, Vardhan said, "India's new Covid-19 cases have dropped to less than three lakh for the first time after 26 days. Also, a net decline of 1,01,461 cases has been recorded in the active caseload in the last 24 hours."He lauded the efforts of defence scientists and the leadership of Defence Minister Rajnath Singh and Prime Minister Narendra Modi for launching the country's first indigenous anti-COVID drug, 2-deoxy-D-glucose or 2-DG (developed by the DRDO in collaboration with the INMAS and the Hyderabad-based Dr Reddy's Laboratories), the ministry said.The research efforts for the drug started in April last year and ended recently, when the DCGI gave it the emergency-use approval (EUA). The minister informed the members that the drug can become a gamechanger in the country's response to the pandemic as it reduces the dependence of patients on oxygen administration and has the potential of getting absorbed differentially and in a selected manner. In the COVID-infected cells, it inhibits virus synthesis and energy production for the process.He noted that the Centre continues to help the states under a "whole of government" approach to tide over the pandemic. Over 4.22 crore N95 masks, 1.76 crore PPE kits, 52.64 lakh Remdesivir injections and 45,066 ventilators were distributed among the states and Union territories, according to the statement.The Union health secretary apprised the meeting that the CoWIN platform is being made available in Hindi and 14 regional languages by next week.Dr Sujeet K Singh, Director, NCDC, presented a detailed report on the mutations of SARS-CoV-2 and the Variants of Concern (VoCs) being reported in India. He showed figures related to the state-wise prevalence of VoCs like the B.1.1.7 and B.1.617. The B.1.1.7 lineage (UK variant) was found predominant in the samples collected in Punjab and Chandigarh between February and March, the statement said.Dr Balaram Bhargava, Secretary, Health Research and DG, ICMR, made a presentation on the innovative changes in testing policy that would widen its scope of application and help in mass screening for COVID, particularly in peri-urban and rural settings, where the health infrastructure is relatively weak.Deployment of mobile RT-PCR testing vans and amplification of RAT tests were presented as the way forward. While the present capacity is around 25 lakh (RTPCR 13 lakh, RAT 12 lakh), this is projected to exponentially increase to 45 lakh (RTPCR 18 lakh, RAT 27 lakh) under the new testing regimen.The DG, ICMR also informed regarding the home-isolation guidelines, which have been converted into Hindi and other regional languages for a wider reach. Warning signs for hospitalisation, admission to ICU and for potential administration of Remdesivir and Tocilizumab were also highlighted.S Aparna, Secretary (Pharma) informed that a dedicated cell has been created to coordinate production and allocation of the drugs in demand to treat COVID-19.Stress was laid on the procurement and allocation of Remdesivir, Tocilizumab and Amphotericin-B. She notified that the demand for Favipiravir too has increased, although the drug is not recommended in COVID medical guidelines. She suggested IEC campaigns for a judicious use of these drugs.The secretary (pharma) also highlighted that Remdesivir production has more than tripled in the country with government intervention from around 39 lakh to 1.18 crore vials per month.The demand for Amphotericin-B, which is used in the treatment of mucormycosis, has also increased. Five suppliers have been identified and efforts are being made for an optimal allocation of the drug. The states were given one lakh vials from May 1-14, while avenues for import are being actively explored, the statement said.The secretary (pharma) further emphasised that the states must make an equitable distribution among the government and the private hospitals and keep the public informed on availability and shop details, help prevent unnecessary stockpiling and ensure timely payments to the manufacturers.Vardhan expressed his appreciation to all COVID warriors who have remained steadfast in their duty during the pandemic, "without showing any signs of deprivation and fatigue".He was joined by Minister of External Affairs S Jaishankar, Minister of Civil Aviation Hardeep S Puri, Minister of State for Ports, Shipping and Waterways (I/C) and Chemical and Fertilisers Mansukh Mandaviya and Minister of State, Ministry of Home Affairs Nityanand Rai. Ashwini Kumar Choubey, Minister of State for Health, joined the meet digitally.Dr Vinod K Paul, Member (Health), NITI Aayog was also present virtually.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cowin-portal-in-hindi-other-languages-from-next-week-govt-101621257873752.html
17-05-2021||India||3 Trinamool MLAs, former leader arrested by CBI in Narada scam case get bail||A special court on Monday granted interim bail to two sitting ministers of Mamata Banerjee-led West Bengal government, another senior MLA and a former Kolkata mayor who were arrested by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) sleuths earlier in the day.On Monday, CBI detained the three Trinamool Congress leaders -- Firhad Hakim, Subrata Mukherjee, Madan Mitra -- and former Kolkata mayor Sovan Chatterjee in connection with the 2014 Narada sting operation case and took them to Nizam Palace, the regional headquarters of the central probe agency in Kolkata.ALSO READ: ‘Arrest me’: Mamata Banerjee tells CBI after 4 held in Narada sting operation caseThey were virtually produced before the special court of Justice Anupam Mukherjee, who granted them bail on grounds that the CBI had not sought custody of the four accused for interrogation but prayer was for judicial custody which cannot be aground for detention of the arrested persons. The CBI had sought 14-day judicial custody for the accused ministers.While granting interim bail the court relied upon the recent judgment of the Supreme Court which urged decongestion of prisons to avoid the spread of coronavirus disease (Covid-19) cases. The court, however, asked the four accused to furnish personal bail bonds of ₹50,000 each.The CBI said they move the Calcutta high court against the decision of the lower court.While Firhad Hakim and Subrata Mukherjee are sitting ministers in the state cabinet Madan Mitra is an elected MLA. Hakim is also the chairman of the board of administrators of Kolkata municipal corporation.Following the arrest, chief minister Mamata Banerjee rushed to the CBI’s office at Nizam Palace in south Kolkata. “Mamata told the CBI officials that she should also be arrested,” said a TMC leader, aware of the development.WATCH: CBI arrests Firhad Hakim, two other TMC MLAs in Narada case, protests break outLast week, Bengal governor Jagdeep Dhankhar had accorded prosecution sanction to the CBI against the three ministers and the former TMC leader.The case pertains to a sting operation by journalist Mathew Samuel in 2014, where he posed as a businessman and offered between ₹4 and 5 lakh to the then TMC Rajya Sabha MP Mukul Roy, the then Lok Sabha MPs Saugata Roy, Aparupa Poddar, Sultan Ahmed, Prasun Banerjee and Kakoli Ghosh Dastidar; the then ministers Firhad Hakim, Suvendu Adhikari, Sovan Chatterjee (who was also the Kolkata mayor) Subrata Mukherjee and Madan Mitra.In the video, that surfaced two years later in March 2016, shortly before the assembly elections in the state, the leaders were purportedly seen accepting cash from the representative of a fictitious company in exchange for doling out favours to them.The then MLA Iqbal Ahmed and IPS officer Saiyaad Mustafa Hussain Mirza were also caught on camera. Among these people, Mukul Roy could not been seen in the videos accepting the cash directly but the money was purportedly taken by Mirza, according to Mathew.Mukul Roy and Suvendu Adhikari has joined the Bharatiya Janata Party, meanwhile. Sovan Chatterjee also joined the BJP prior to the assembly polls but left the party following differences with the leadership.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/3-trinamool-mlas-former-leader-arrested-by-cbi-in-narada-scam-case-get-bail-101621260967159.html

Tropical cyclones always have an eye, a central region of clear skies and warm temperatures.Also Watch | Cyclone Tauktae weakens after landfall in Gujarat; leaves trail of destructionHow did 2021’s first storm in India get its name?The cyclone has been given the name ‘Tauktae’ (pronounced Tau’Te) by Myanmar.

So many are yet to come. pic.twitter.com/WactuXyNQeHow are cyclones across the globe named?The World Meteorological Organisation and UN Economic and Social Commission for Asia and Pacific (UN ESCAP) led Panel on Tropical Cyclones – a global body which also includes regional specialised meteorological centres (RSMC) as well as tropical cyclone warning centres -- prepares the names of the cyclones.Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) is among six RSMCs in the world, is mandated to issue advisories and name tropical cyclones in the north Indian Ocean region.Which countries name the cyclones?The panel comprising 13 countries, including India, Bangladesh, Myanmar, Pakistan, the Maldives, Oman, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Iran, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Yemen, name cyclones in the region. In 2020, a new list of names was released that had 169 names of cyclones, having 13 suggested names each from 13 countries.Why are the cyclones named?The cyclones are named to identify the storms to send out warning notifications about their development. As the technical names could be difficult for the common people to remember and spread awareness on, naming them gives an unique idenitfier to these cyclones and makes it easier for the media and various authorities to disseminate information on them.What will be the next cyclone called?The list of 13 names prepared by each of the 13 nations are out in public domain. The next cyclone in the region will be called 'Yaas', a name given by Oman, while the one after that will be called 'Gulab' as recommended by Pakistan. At present the first list is in use. Once the names in the first list are exhausted, the second list of the names in the table will be used, and so on.Till Monday evening, the gusty winds and heavy showers from the impact of the cyclonic storm lashed Mumbai and its neighbouring areas, leading to disruption of train services in the city.The cyclone has left a trail of death and destruction in parts of Kerala and Goa, too, as it passed along the western coast of the country over the Arabian Sea.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/how-did-cyclone-tauktae-get-its-name-what-does-it-mean-101621260333642.html
17-05-2021||India||Ahead of FATF review, Pakistan announces new measures on terror financing||With a little more than a month to go for a review of Pakistan’s counter-terror financing regime by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), Islamabad has put measures in place to ensure such offences are investigated by specialised agencies.However, experts believe the steps taken by Pakistan may still not be adequate for the country to get off the multilateral watchdog’s “grey list”, given the lingering suspicions about its commitment to crack down on terror groups. In this regard, the experts pointed to the UK’s recent decision to include Pakistan in a list of “high-risk countries” for terror financing and money laundering. At its last plenary meeting in February, FATF retained Pakistan in its “grey list” and urged the country to complete an action plan to counter terror financing before June. It said the country had “largely addressed” 24 of the 27 items in the action plan, but FATF president Marcus Pleyer pointed out the remaining deficiencies were all “serious”.FATF had specifically asked Pakistan to show that terror financing investigations and prosecutions were targeting UN-designated terrorists and their proxies, that prosecutions were resulting in effective and dissuasive sanctions, and that targeted financial sanctions against UN-designated terrorists and their proxies were being effectively implemented.Ahead of FATF’s virtual plenary meeting during June 21-25, the Pakistan government has approved new rules for the forfeiture and auction of properties and assets related to anti-money laundering cases and the transfer of investigation and prosecution of such cases from police and provincial authorities to specialised agencies.The AML (Forfeited Properties Management) Rules 2021 and AML (Referral) Rules 2021 were approved by Pakistan’s federal cabinet earlier this month, the Dawn newspaper reported. The newspaper cited its sources as saying that these measures were aimed at addressing the three outstanding items of FATF’s action plan.All investigating and prosecuting agencies will exchange financial intelligence and information about properties to ensure expeditious confiscation and forfeiture under the new rules.Besides the Asia Pacific Group (APG), a key part of FATF, conducting an assessment of Pakistan’s case this month, several review meetings to be held in the coming days will also be crucial for determining whether the country has done enough to address shortcomings in its counter-terror financing regime, people familiar with developments said on condition of anonymity.FATF’s evaluations and compliance group will hold virtual meetings on June 14, 15 and 17, while the risk, trends and methods group will hold a virtual meeting on June 16. However, questions about the counter-terror financing measures put in place by Pakistan remain as the UK recently included the country in a list of 21 nations at high risk of terror financing and money laundering. Pakistan’s Foreign Office contended last month that the move by the UK wasn’t based on facts. The UK notified the list of 21 high-risk countries as part of an amendment of money laundering and terror financing regulations following its exit from the European Union.Sameer Patil, fellow for international security studies at Gateway House, said Pakistan has been putting up a “facade of a crackdown on terror groups”.“The fact of the matter is that Pakistan initiated these measures weeks before the FATF’s plenary meeting, which shows its intention of hoodwinking FATF into thinking it is acting on the remaining items in the action plan. But Pakistan is not serious about addressing the vast so-called charity networks of terror groups which act as a backbone for fund-raising and anti-India activities,” he said.“When there was global scrutiny on Lashkar-e-Taiba founder Hafiz Saeed, Pakistan promptly detained him but we have heard nothing of action against Jaish-e-Mohammed chief Masood Azhar and his operational commanders,” Patil added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ahead-of-fatf-review-pakistan-announces-new-measures-on-terror-financing-101621257850645.html

All you need to know||As the National AEFI (Adverse Event Following Immunization) Committee in a report to the Union ministry of health revealed that there are 26 potential cases of thromboembolic in the country, the ministry issued advisories to healthcare workers and vaccine beneficiaries to make them aware of the symptoms of the adverse effects of the AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccination.Thromboembolic events refer to the formation of a clot in a blood vessel that might also break loose and be carried by the bloodstream to plug another vessel."The AEFI Committee has completed an in-depth case review of 498 serious and severe events, of which 26 cases have been reported to be potential thromboembolic (formation of a clot in a blood vessel that might also break loose and carried by the blood stream to plug another vessel) events – following the administration of Covishield vaccine – with a reporting rate of 0.61 cases/ million doses," the panel said in the report.Also read: CDC chief wants unvaccinated people to be ‘honest with themselves’. Here’s whyThe AEFI panel in the report said that the reporting rate of thromboembolic events in India amounts to 0.61 cases per million. It showed the minuscule but definitive risk of thromboembolic events from the administration of the Covishield vaccine. Covishield is the Oxford/AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine produced in India by the Serum Institute of India.The report also revealed that no potential thromboembolic events were reported following administration of the Covaxin vaccine. Covaxin is India's homegrown shot against the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) produced by Bharat Biotech in Hyderabad.Following the revelations, the ministry of health issued advisories to inform people of the suspected thromboembolic symptoms occurring within 20 days after receiving any Covid-19 vaccine, particularly Covishield. The ministry aimed to encourage people to preferably report to the health facility where the shot was administered in case any symptoms of the thromboembolic events appear.The government mentioned these as the symptoms for the thromboembolic events that might occur:· Breathlessness· Pain in the chest· Pain in limbs or pain on pressing limbs or swelling in limbs (arm or calf)· Multiple, pinhead-size red spots or bruising of skin in an area beyond the injection site· Persistent abdominal pain with or without vomiting· Seizures in the absence of previous history of seizures with or without vomiting· Severe and persistent headache with or without vomiting (in the absence of previous history of migraine or chronic headache)· Weakness or paralysis of limbs or any particular side or part of the body (including face)· Persistent vomiting without any obvious reason· Blurred vision or pain in eyes or having double vision· Change in mental status or having confusion or depressed level of consciousnessAlso read: Jaipur engineer, worried about critically-ill Covid +ve father, dies by suicideThe decision to conduct the in-depth analysis came after alerts were raised in many countries on post-vaccination thrombotic events on March 11, particularly related with Oxford/AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine.Meanwhile, the ministry ascertained that the benefits from Covid-19 vaccination outweigh its risks. Covishield continues to have a positive benefit risk profile with tremendous potential to prevent infections and reduce deaths due to the virus in India and across the world. More than 13.4 crore doses of Covishield vaccine have been administered as on April 27, the ministry informed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/suspected-symptoms-of-thromboembolic-events-after-covid-19-vaccination-all-you-need-to-know-101621252017055.html

17-05-2021||India||Despite second wave, Bhagwat’s comments indicate Sangh-BJP ties on track||The Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS)’s response of not blaming the government alone for failing to prepare for the second wave of the coronavirus pandemic indicates there is neither a change in its equation with the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led Union government nor is there a rethink on how it chooses to convey criticism, according to both Sangh functionaries and party leaders.A perceptible ease in working relations has been a hallmark of the Sangh-BJP equation post 2014, and any criticism of government policies has been soft-pedalled. The BJP is the political arm of the Sangh, even though the latter asserts that it does not influence the government’s decision making.“It is in line with this synergistic approach that RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat (on Saturday) instead of blaming the government alone for failing to take pre-emptive and proactive measures that could have prevented the second wave, said it was both the government and the people who misread the situation after the first wave,” said a senior Sangh functionary.He went on to add, “Anyone who anticipated a showdown between the Sangh and the BJP has also misread the situation.”Also Read | Delhi Covid-19 cases drop below 5,000 for first time after April 5Bhagwat did refer to the situation as grim, saddening and difficult and the deaths as “untimely”, but his message was to not lose hope.Delivering the lecture online, which is part of the Sangh’s “Positivity Unlimited” initiative, Bhagwat said, “Some people have died… they should not have died this way, untimely…We have to keep ourselves and our people safe and therefore we don’t need negationism. We can’t say nothing has happened; everything is alright. We are not saying that. Situation is hard and saddening, but while accepting that we are not going to allow ourselves to feel negative.”Sangh functionaries who have been actively involved in various seva or welfare initiatives admit that they have been witness to horrors unfold, particularly in rural areas, but have opted to refrain from pointing fingers.“There is no time to play a blame-game. Political parties will accuse each other, and governments will spar, but for the Sangh it is time to contribute in whatever way we can. Besides, the situation is so critical that even we find it difficult to extend help,” said a second functionary on condition of anonymity.The second functionary said the possibility of the second wave denting the BJP’s electoral fortune, particularly in Uttar Pradesh a state where the Sangh has extensive reach, has been “of concern”.“Even as the cadre itself faces the threat of contracting the Covid-19 virus, the Sangh has set up isolations centres, begun blood and plasma donation drives, and in some instances also helped perform the last rites to lessen the anger,” the second functionary said.When asked if the Sangh could have opted for a less muted response to the situation given the perceptible public anger, the first functionary said the decision to not embarrass the union government is an instruction from the brass. “On many occasions there have been disagreements, but the top leadership has advised against making it public or using expressions that can embarrass the government. There is room for disagreement but not publicly,” the first functionary said.For instance, when the new education policy that was high on the Sangh’s agenda was delayed and eventually announced in 2020, there was only reminders and muted outbursts from the affiliates.The stress on not airing differences in public was taken to avoid the repetition of strained relations between the Sangh, then led by K Sudarshan, and the BJP-government during the premiership of Atal Bihari Vajpayee.Consequently, disapproval of the government policies and decision making has been carefully structured to avoid giving it an appearance of the Sangh and the BJP being at loggerheads.In 2017, post demonetisation and the Goods and Services Tax (GST) roll out, when the micro, medium and small-scale sectors listed the adverse impact of these policy decisions on their businesses, the Sangh again opted for relaying a message without rancour.Also Read | Covid vaccine: Swadeshi Jagran Manch starts campaign for universal accessIn his annual Dusshera address that year, Bhagwat acknowledged that the biggest contribution toward employment comes from the MSME, retail businesses, and cooperative and agriculture sectors and said called for protecting these from economic “earthquakes”.“They are our security net during ups and downs in the global trade and economic earthquakes ... Crores of people get jobs or employments through these sectors,” he said.Political commentator Shirish Kashikar said not airing differences publicly does not mean that the Sangh does not convey the message. “They do it through appropriate channels,” he said.In recent years, while the affiliates have aired their grievances against economic decisions such as disinvestment, relaxing foreign direct investment and issues related to employment, the criticism against the government was blunted by blaming “experts and bureaucracy” for policy decisions.In 2017, when the labour arm, the Bharatiya Mazdoor Sangh (BMS) expressed concern over poor jobs growth, it blamed it on “dependence on faulty advisors and misguided reforms.”In a statement, it said, “The present slowdown is the result of the wrong direction of the economy and job-displacing reforms followed as a continuation of UPA (United Progressive Alliance) policies. PM’s good intentions and efforts are neutralized by lack of proper experts, lack of communication and feedback from social sector…”Political commentator Hari Desai however, said that the protests from the affiliates are aimed at diluting public anger. “This is not the same Sangh that opposed policies during Vajpayee’s time. When Vajpeyee was about to allow FDI, Dattopant Thengadi (founder of Swadeshi Jagaran Manch) rushed back to India from South Africa to convince the government about its dangers. Now the Sangh flatters and defends the government,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/despite-second-wave-bhagwat-s-comments-indicate-sangh-bjp-ties-on-track-101621251550426.html

He returned home last month due to the pandemic and was helping his family since then by enrolling himself under Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS).“On May 4 evening, I tested positive for Covid-19 and doctors advised me to stay at home in isolation with due precautions. But there is hardly any space in my small house, where I have been staying with my parents and sister,” Shiva said.After spending the first night outside the house, Shiva stumbled upon the idea of building a makeshift accommodation on the tree in front of his house. He moved his charpoy to the tree and tied it to its branches with ropes.“It was very comfortable for me. My parents used to keep breakfast, lunch and dinner on a chair placed near the tree and I used to come down to eat. Except for attending to nature’s call, I did not leave the tree during my isolation period,” Shiva said.Kotha Nandikonda is a very small village with a population of about 1,000 residents and has no isolation centre for Covid-19 patients. Though there is a primary health centre about five kilometres away, it has no facilities to accommodate any patients.“I was told a hostel meant for Scheduled Tribe students at Adavi Devulapalli block headquarters was converted into an isolation centre on May 13. But by that time, I had already finished eight days in isolation on the tree. Moreover, no villager came to see me fearing Covid-19,” Shiva said, adding he was not aware if any other person in the village was affected by the virus.Village sarpanch Balu Naik could not be contacted for his comment.Shiva said he spent his time reading books, listening to songs on his mobile and even talking to his friends. “There is no need to panic because of Covid-19. You can conquer it with your positive thinking,” he said.On Monday, he alighted from his “isolation ward” on the tree, as he was feeling better. “I am going to the health centre to get tested. Hope it will be negative for the virus,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/18yr-old-covid-19-patient-builds-himself-an-isolation-ward-on-a-tree-101621250410512.html

The respective collectors, SPs and others have been directed to be on vigil and be prepared with a contingency plan. According to the Met department, the state would be witnessing gusty winds and heavy rainfall in Pali, Udaipur, Jalore, Dungarpur and Sirohi on May 18, and in Ajmer, Jodhpur, Kota, Jaipur and Bharatpur on May 19. Also, Rajasthan, which draws oxygen from the Hazira port and Jamnagar refinery in Gujarat, in addition to Bhiwadi in Alwar district, has made arrangements to continue safe transportation of oxygen from Gujarat amid the second wave of Covid-19. Apprehending that the cyclone might completely dismantle the oxygen corridor between Gujarat and Rajasthan, the state has deployed over 1,500 personnel from police and State Disaster Relief Force (SRDF) at as many as 100 different locations between the two states to seamlessly transport oxygen cylinders, officials said. Click here for LIVE Updates of Cyclone Tauktae“SDRF teams are stationed at 100 equidistant locations between Gujarat and Rajasthan. They are specially trained to remove fallen trees, heavy boulders, wires, and poles from the road,” said Additional DGP, Law and Order, Saurabh Shrivastava. The control room at the police headquarters in Jaipur is constantly monitoring the pace of the cyclone and emergency alternative routes to safely ferry oxygen cylinders. A senior IG rank officer is already deployed in Gujarat along with several other deputy SPs and circle inspectors. Shrivastava said the safety of oxygen trucks was important. “The trucks move at a certain speed when they are laden with gas. They cannot increase the speed as it could trigger an accident of fire,” he said, adding that for the past several days the Rajasthan police were making arrangements to facilitate the return of oxygen cylinders from Gujarat. Expecting a sudden power cut due to the cyclone, the health department has directed all district administrations to arrange generators and invertors. “In view of the cyclone, all required preparations are being done and I appeal to all to be cautious of the storm,” tweeted Ashok Gehlot, CM, Rajasthan. He added that the officials are being asked to make alternate emergency plan for oxygen supply as the cyclone may hit Jamnagar in Gujarat, which is a big source of oxygen supply for the state. Chief Secretary Niranjan Arya said district collectors, along with SPs, health officers, and civil defence officials have been directed to formulate a contingency plan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cyclone-tauktae-heavy-rains-likely-in-rajasthan-tomorrow-101621248490310.html

17-05-2021||India||Andhra Pradesh extends partial lockdown till May 31||The Andhra Pradesh government has extended the partial lockdown clamped in the state to contain Covid-19 cases till May 31. The decision was taken on Monday afternoon at a meeting held by chief minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy at his camp office in Amaravati.The partial lockdown resembling a curfew for 18 hours a day was first imposed on May 5 and was supposed to end on May 18. But this has now been extended till the month end. The curfew timings, from 12 noon to 6 am the following day, remain unchanged.Andhra Pradesh reported 24,171 Covid-19 positive cases on Sunday, the highest daily count since the outbreak of the pandemic last year. It also reported 101 deaths in the same period. The state’s daily infections are the fifth highest after Karnataka, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu and Kerala.The chief minister’s office said an extension of the curfew was inevitable to get the desired results. “It has only been 12 days since we imposed the curfew. It should be in force at least for four weeks,” CM Jagan said.He also directed officials to ensure the number of Covid-19 positive cases do not go up in rural areas of the state and asked them to use ASHA (Accredited Social Health Activist), village volunteers and village secretariat mechanism to reign-in the crisis.He also announced that children orphaned by Covid-19 will be taken care of by the state government and a financial scheme will be worked out to help them.“We shall deposit a certain amount in the name of the children and the interest accrued from the deposit could be utilised to meet their expenses every month,” the chief minister suggested.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/andhra-pradesh-extends-partial-lockdown-till-may-31-101621244890164.html
17-05-2021||India||Tauktae intensified rapidly this morning, took IMD and scientists by surprise||Tauktae intensified from a very severe to an extremely severe cyclonic storm rapidly on Monday morning, taking weather experts and scientists by surprise.“Tauktae intensified very rapidly this morning. We did not state that it would intensify to an extremely severe cyclone in our forecast. But it did because of extremely favourable oceanic and atmospheric conditions,” said M Mohapatra, director general, India Meteorological Department (IMD).In its trajectory of Tauktae, the IMD forecast that it would intensify into a very severe cyclonic storm and cross the Gujarat coast on May 18 (Tuesday) early morning. This was as per IMD’s bulletin issued at 2.20am on Monday. But by 8.15am, IMD issued another bulletin that said Tauktae had already intensified to an extremely severe cyclonic storm with a maximum wind speed of 180-190 kmph gusting to 210 kmph and that it would cross the Gujarat coast between Porbandar and Mahuva on Monday night between 8pm and 11pm.Heavy to very heavy rain was recorded in north Konkan, including Mumbai, which will continue for the next 12 hours.Click here for LIVE updates of Cyclone TauktaeGale wind speed reaching 180–190 kmph gusting to 210 kmph is likely to prevail over eastcentral Arabian Sea during the next six hours. Gale wind speed reaching 80-90 kmph gusting to 100 kmph is likely to prevail along and off the Maharashtra coast on Monday and gradually decrease thereafter.Gale wind speed reaching 90-100 kmph gusting to 110 kmph is prevailing over adjoining northeast Arabian Sea. It would gradually increase, becoming 170–180 kmph gusting to 200 kmph from Monday evening for the subsequent six hours and decrease thereafter.Independent experts had warned of rapid intensification of Tauktae.“Cyclone Tauktae, which is now skirting the Mumbai coast, has undergone rapid intensification from Category 1 (90-125 km/hr) to Category 4 ( 220-280 km/hr) status. Winds reaching 220 km/hr as per JTWC (and 185 km/hr as per IMD). Rapid intensification of cyclones is a response to climate change and ocean warming, and cyclone forecast models have a hard time in picking them up. We need to incorporate this in forecast models and also be prepared on the ground for future cyclones to come,” said Roxy Mathew Koll, a climate scientist at the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology.“Strong waves, 3-6 metres, are forecast along the coast of Mumbai and Maharashtra. One way to reduce these impacts is to work on our natural defences like mangroves. Historically, Mumbai and Goa had a lot of mangroves—we can bring them back—they can reduce the impact of cyclones and floods,” he added.Tauktae intensified very rapidly from a depression to a cyclone on Friday. There was rapid intensification of the cyclone on Saturday also.“With Cyclone Tauktae, this will be the fourth consecutive year of pre-monsoon cyclone over the Arabian Sea. This is also the third consecutive year when a cyclone has come very close to the west coast of India. Sea surface temperatures in Arabian Sea have increased rapidly during the past century and this has led to an increase in the frequency and intensity of cyclones in the Arabian Sea…global warming has presented us with new challenges such as rapid intensification of cyclones, which need to be closely monitored at higher resolution and accuracy using on-site platforms such as buoys and moorings. Improving the Indian Ocean Observing System (IndOOS) and incorporating the global warming signals in the weather models can help us tackle the challenges of intense cyclones in the future,” Koll added in a statement.“Conditions are extremely favourable for its (Tauktae’s) rapid intensification. Ocean heat potential is above normal; sea surface temperatures are 1-2°C above normal… We should be prepared,” Sunitha Devi had said on Thursday when a low pressure area had formed over Arabian Sea.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tauktae-intensified-rapidly-this-morning-took-imd-and-scientists-by-surprise-101621244231085.html
17-05-2021||India||SC orders Andhra MP arrested for sedition to be treated at army facility||The Supreme Court on Monday directed Member of Parliament from Andhra Pradesh, Kanmuri Raghurama Krishnam Raju, arrested on sedition charges, to be medically examined at the army hospital at Secunderabad and kept his bail plea for hearing on Friday.Raju had approached the top court demanding examination at a neutral hospital after the Andhra Pradesh high court on Sunday directed him to appear before a medical board of three doctors working with the state government hospitals. Raju had moved a letter before the high court claiming to have been beaten and tortured by police in custody and even complained of cardiac issues having undergone a recent bypass surgery.Although Raju is an MP representing the YSR Congress Party from Narsapuram constituency, he has been critical of the party leadership and the state government and even demanded cancellation of bail granted to CM YS Jagan Mohan Reddy in a corruption case. Last year, the Delhi high court ordered Y-category security cover for the MP in view of threats that followed his anti-party rant.A vacation bench of the Supreme Court comprising justices Vineet Saran and BR Gavai directed that Raju be forthwith taken to army hospital at Secenderabad and be kept under medical care till further orders. The court directed the head of the army hospital to constitute a medical board of three doctors to examine the MP. A judicial officer nominated by the Chief Justice of the Telangana high court shall remain present during the examination, the top court directed. The cost of the treatment shall be borne by Raju.The bench said, “Chief Secretary, Andhra Pradesh, is directed to carry out this order forthwith and ensure that the petitioner is taken to and reaches the Army Hospital, Secunderabad today itself…The proceedings of medical examination of the petitioner shall be video-graphed and be submitted to the Registrar General of the Telangana high court in a sealed cover for being transmitted to this Court.”The court directed the period of stay at the hospital to be treated as “judicial custody” of the petitioner with a specific direction asking the armed guards provided to Raju under the Y-security cover not to remain inside the hospital or during his medical examination.Senior advocate Mukul Rohatgi, who appeared for Raju, told the top court that the case of sedition has been invoked as he was critical of the state government’s handling of the Covid-19 crisis. Raju was arrested on May 14 and a day later, his bail plea was dismissed by the Andhra Pradesh high court on the ground that the same ought to be moved before the sessions court. The Crime Investigation Department (CID) has accused him of delivering hate speeches against certain communities and promoting disaffection against the government. Also Read | Maratha quota: BJP panel to review verdict; warns Maharashtra govt of stirRaju has been booked under various sections of the Indian Penal Code (IPC), namely section 124A (sedition), section 153A (promoting enmity between different groups), section 505 (inciting any class or community of persons to commit any offence) read with section 120B (criminal conspiracy).Rohatgi said his client required urgent medical attention after being beaten up in police custody. The senior counsel did not agree to get examined by the medical board comprising government doctors, one being a gynecologist whose husband heads the Legal Cell of the ruling party. He urged the court to consider shifting the accused MP to an army hospital in the state or All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), Delhi.Senior advocate Dushyant Dave, appearing for the state government, objected to the accused being shifted to army hospital. Although the medical board had examined Raju, he was open to the suggestion that the accused be examined at the army hospital or even AIIMS, Mangalagiri, situated within the state. Citing the allegations of hate speech levelled against Raju, Dave said, “The kind of hate he is generating within the state is unimaginable.”The court invited the Union government, not otherwise a party to the present proceedings, to know whether the petitioner’s medical examination could be performed at an army hospital. Solicitor General Tushar Mehta appeared for Centre and said, “We have no objection if the accused is taken to army hospital or brought to Delhi AIIMS.” However, he questioned why the army was being dragged into a political matter.The bench clarified, “There is nothing political here.” To allay apprehensions of both the accused and state, the bench allowed a judicial officer to remain present while the examination is conducted. The bench allowed the state to respond to the bail plea and medical examination plea by Wednesday and posted the matter for hearing on Friday.Meanwhile, Telangana-based media channel TV5 has also approached the Supreme Court, challenging the sedition charge against it by the Andhra Pradesh government. The channel has also been accused, along with YSR Congress MP Raghurama Krishnam Raju, of aiding him in making his hate speech in order to promote “disaffection” against the government.Shreya Broadcasting Private Limited, the company that runs the channel, along with its executive editor, moved the top court through advocate Vipin Nair, demanding that the FIR against them to be quashed. Besides, the petition has also demanded setting aside the CID enquiry report forming the basis of the FIR and stay on any coercive action against the company, news channel or its employees.The petition states, “The petitioners apprehend that the purpose of the mala fide FIR is to curb dissent in the state and cause a chilling effect on media houses.” Citing the alleged custodial torture meted out to Raju, the channel further stated, “Petitioners verily believe that if this court does not interject on an urgent basis, the petitioner shall be meted out the same treatment.”In its May 14 FIR, the CID has alleged that the petitioner’s channel TV5 allotted “pre-mediated” and “organised” slots to MP Raghurama Krishnam Raju, which evinces a meeting of minds among the accused persons. The petitioner claimed that there is no criminality in allotting slots to a public figure and such action by the state violates the channel’s fundamental right to free speech.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-orders-andhra-mp-arrested-for-sedition-to-be-treated-at-army-facility-101621243270623.html

The government’s Principal Scientific Adviser K. VijayRaghavan has warned of a third wave as the virus mutates further.More than 2 billion doses of coronavirus vaccines will be available in India between August to December this year, which will be sufficient to vaccinate the entire adult population, VK Paul, a member of the government think-tank Niti Aayog, said last week. India has administered 182.9 million jabs so far.The country is scaling up beds and critical care in hospitals, including ventilators and oxygen supply, Panda told Bloomberg TV.

17-05-2021||India||Narada case: No social distancing as TMC workers protest ministers’ arrest||Covid-19 protocols went for a toss on Monday, Day 2 of the lockdown in West Bengal, as hundreds of Trinamool Congress workers and supporters hit the streets across the state, staging protests against the arrest of two Cabinet ministers and an MLA in connection with the 2016 Narada sting case. Tension mounted as some people hurled bricks, shoes and bottles at the central forces guarding the Nizam Palace which houses the CBI’s office even as they shouted slogans against the arrest. Earlier in the day, the CBI arrested ministers Subrata Mukherjee and Firhad Hakim, MLA Madan Mitra, and former Kolkata mayor Sovan Chatterjee. Soon after, while chief minister Mamata Banerjee, who lost her brother to Covid past Saturday, rushed to the CBI’s office, a few hundred TMC workers and supporters also followed her, shouting slogans. Some of the protesters were not even wearing masks and most were wearing it incorrectly, below their nose and mouth. There was no social distancing as a scuffle broke out between party supporters and the police when the former tried to break the barricades and enter the Nizam Palace. State governor Jagdeep Dhankhar tweeted, “Invited attention @MamataOfficial, On channels and in public domain I notice arson and pelting of stones at CBI office. Pathetic that Kolkata Police @KolkataPolice and West Bengal Police @WBPolice are just onlookers. Appeal to you to act and restore law and order.” “Concerned at alarming situation. Call upon @MamataOfficial to follow constitutional norms & rule of law. Police @WBPolice @KolkataPolice @HomeBengal must take all steps to maintain law & order. Sad- situation is being allowed to drift with no tangible action by authorities,” he wrote. Also Read | ‘Arrest me’: Mamata Banerjee tells CBI after 4 held in Narada sting op caseThe CBI is scheduled to produce the accused ministers and legislators in the court later in the day. A large police contingent is deployed to prevent any law and order violation. Protests also erupted in multiple places across the state where TMC workers and supporters blocked roads, took out rallies and burned tyres. “West Bengal is fighting a battle against Covid. Under such circumstances, the CBI, prompted by the BJP, chose to arrest to ministers. This is not just revenge but would also have a negative impact on the fight against Covid. We condemn this arrest,” said Kunal Ghosh, TMC spokesperson.TMC MP Abhishek Banerjee, who is also the chief minister’s nephew, urged people not to violate the lockdown norms. “I urge everyone to abide by the law & refrain from any activity that violates lockdown norms for the sake of the larger interest of Bengal and its people. We have utmost faith in the judiciary & the battle will be fought legally,” he tweeted.The West Bengal government imposed a lockdown from Sunday, cancelling trains, buses and Kolkata Metro, shutting down government and private offices and banning all types of political and social gatherings to check the spread of Covid-19. The daily count of Covid-19 cases has shot up exponentially in the past month now, with experts blaming the rise on countless election rallies that were held in April violating all safety protocols. On Sunday, the state registered 19,117 new cases, taking the total number of active cases in the state to 131,805. As many as 147 persons have succumbed to Covid-19 in the past 24 hours, taking the death toll to 13,284 since 2020.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/narada-case-no-social-distancing-as-tmc-workers-protest-ministers-arrest-101621241350294.html

The state government has now ordered a probe into any possible lapses.25-years old Swarnalata Pal married Bishnu Charan Bhol of Indolakusiari village of Khordha district on April 28. Early this week she complained of fever followed by a rapid deterioration in her condition in the next few days.On Saturday morning she felt breathless as her oxygen level plummeted to 54%, said her family. She was then taken to the Balipatna Community Health Centre, where the doctor referred her to the Capital Hospital in Bhubaneswar.Pal’s brother-in-law, Niranjan Bhol, said when they reached Capital Hospital, the doctors there referred her to SCB Medical College and Hospital in Cuttack, 25 km away. “But we chose not to take her to Cuttack as her condition was deteriorating every minute. So we went to AIIMS Bhubaneswar instead. But the hospital refused admission without a Covid test report. We then went to another private hospital in the city which again refused us due to absence of Covid test report,” said Bhol.With time running out, the woman’s in-laws then took her to private hospitals before finally bringing her back to the community health centre, where the doctor gave her an injection in the ambulance before again referring her to Capital Hospital in Bhubaneswar.When her in-laws pressurised the doctor to treat her there, a team of policemen reached the spot and asked them to shift the woman to Capital Hospital.“When we returned to Capital Hospital in the afternoon on May 15, she was almost breathless. She was tested for Covid-19 there and her result came out positive. She died an hour later,” said Bhol.He said the ambulance driver charged them ₹25,000 for transporting the patient from one hospital to another.Director of health services, Bijay Mohapatra said an inquiry has been ordered to find out how the system failed the victim. “We have sought all details from the community health centre,” he said.AIIMS Bhubaneswar medical superintendent Sachidananda Mohanty and director of Capital Hospital Laxmidhar Sahoo refused to comment, claiming they were still ascertaining the details of the case. In another incident, a youth from Kendrapara district, who got married only five days ago, reportedly succumbed to Covid. Sanjay Kumar Nayak of Durgadebipada village under Rajkanika block in Kendrapara district had returned home from Bengaluru on May 1 for his wedding on May 9.Though the 26-year-old had tested negative for Covid-19 in Bengaluru, his health deteriorated a few days after reaching home. After marriage, he developed Covid-like symptoms and was rushed to the district headquarters hospital in Jajpur on May 13. The doctors there referred him to a hospital in Bhubaneswar. However, Nayak died on the way.Meanwhile, the Ganjam district administration on Sunday made Rapid Antigen Tests mandatory for bride, groom and their family members before any wedding. “Permission for wedding will not be granted by the district administration if any family member or bride/groom tests positive for Covid-19,” said Vijay Amruta Kulange, the district collector. As per the direction of the Odisha government, wedding ceremonies are being carried out in the state with 50 participants, including bride and groom.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/newlymarried-odisha-woman-succumbs-to-covid-after-hospitals-refuse-admission-101621240270284.html
17-05-2021||India||The inside story of why the BJP lost Bengal||It’s been a fortnight since the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) fell short of its expected performance in West Bengal, winning 77 seats in the 292 assembly instead of the 200 plus seats the party had anticipated. This gave a clear and bigger victory to Mamata Banerjee and Trinamool Congress than in 2016.While the party’s official post mortem is yet to begin, senior leaders and candidates now have a better understanding of what they suggest are five factors that led to the BJP’s defeat — the lack of a chief ministerial candidate; induction of too many turncoats leading to resentment within the ranks; rising fuel prices; consolidation of Muslim votes for the Trinamool Congress (TMC) even as a corresponding Hindu consolidation did not take place for the BJP; and the salience of the “outsider tag” and an overdose of Hindi.“I would put it down to a few factors,” said star campaigner and BJP member of parliament from Delhi, Manoj Tiwari, who spent several days campaigning across the region, “But the main thing is that we haven’t won the real Bengali hearts yet. We are on our way but not there yet.”Also Read | Mamata Banerjee inducts 43 ministers: Check full list of portfoliosThe official party line is that it is focused, at the moment, in protecting workers from a vindictive TMC’s violent attacks post elections, to do any in-depth review of the results.But HT spoke to two candidates who lost the elections, three members of Parliament (MPs), a party worker from North Bengal who has traditionally been with the party, and a senior leader of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) to understand what went wrong and lessons the BJP has drawn from these elections. They all spoke on condition that their identities wouldn’t be revealed and with the hope that their organisation would learn from their mistakes.Mamata’s welfare vs Centre’s rising fuel prices On record, the BJP blames TMC’s aggression and intimidatory tactics as having deterred voters in many parts of the state from exercising their true political choice. However, what the Bengal BJP cadres point out is that while the Mamata Banerjee government bent over backwards with smooth delivery of welfare schemes, the rising fuel prices, especially LPG, dealt a major blow to the BJP’s appeal among its middle class voters.The price of an LPG cylinder had risen to ₹845 in the state while it was less than ₹600 a few months earlier. The TMC really drove that home during the campaign, for instance protesting by cooking in wood-fired ovens. BJP leaders say that this is one factor that really turned women voters against the party as managing LPG usage is seen as the homemaker’s responsibility, and rising prices sent her budget haywire.Also Read | In Bengal, the story of BJP, TMC and the Dalit and tribal vote“On one hand, you have Mamata Banerjee putting the homemaker’s photo in her family’s health card as part of the Swasthya Saathi programme, which gives an insurance cover of ₹5 lakh. It gives the woman a sense of pride and she feels empowered. Her interface with the Centre comes from LPG prices, which voters feel the Centre controls. So the contrast becomes too stark,” said one of the leaders.They point out that the headlines about small savings schemes’ interest rates being cut on March 31 just added to the damage in the middle of election season, even though the Centre quickly clarified and rolled back the decision. However, at a time when Banerjee was handing out full meals at just ₹5 and bringing her government to people’s doorstep (with the very popular Duare Sarkar scheme), the BJP turned out to be at the receiving end of the April fool’s joke.The ‘outsider’ tag and role of G-22 In the run-up to the Bengal elections, Amit Shah created an elite group informally called the G-22 for Bengal (incidentally, three members were added to it later and it became 25 members but the G-22 name stuck).This was basically a group of Union ministers or state ministers from across the country and some handpicked members of Parliament or legislators, who were each assigned four or five assembly constituencies. Some of the members of the group included Gajendra Shekhawat, Prahlad Patel, Dharmendra Pradhan, Arvind Bhadoria, Nishikant Dubey, and Vishwas Sarang to give special focus to 120 seats, which the party assessed as challenging fights. Each of these members then spent a considerable amount of time in those seats and micromanaged the campaign with the help of their selected aides, that they had brought in from their own areas.But this detailed planning had unintentional consequences. For one, the top leadership and decision makers listened to the feedback of their own aides, instead of listening to the feedback of their ground level workers. “It is possible that many of these people didn’t get the correct picture or that they surrounded themselves with sycophants which wasn’t useful in the long run,’’ said a party worker in the North Bengal.The number of outsiders, which the TMC derisively called Bohiragoto, can be estimated by the fact that there was one chartered plane and three helicopters which brought in the visiting campaigners every morning from Kolkata to Bagdogra and then took them back every night, the BJP worker said.Another candidate from South Bengal said that he had a state legislator from Madhya Pradesh campaigning for him, but even he wasn’t sure who the campaigner was and so his voters weren’t really impressed. “People would come to see Narendra Modi or maybe even Amit Shah or JP Nadda but why would they come to see people who no one knew in Bengal?” he said.Also Read | Ex-governor Tathagata Roy slams top BJP leaders for Bengal poll debacleThe second problem with flooding BJP national stars in Bengal was a basic language problem. Whether they came from Delhi or from Uttar Pradesh, the star campaigners and most G-22 members spoke only Hindi. Some, such as party general secretary in charge of Bengal, Kailash Vijaywargiya, had managed an understanding of Bengali but none of the outsiders could speak in Bengali. And yet, this didn’t stop them from giving speeches in Hindi.One candidate told HT how other than himself, all other persons on stage were Hindi-speakers, and this didn’t help establish the necessary connect with Bengal’s voters. An MP speaking to HT joked that even the person doing the warm-up act before him was speaking in Hindi. “I knew I had to speak in Hindi but I told them that at least you should have got some local to introduce me in Bengali,” he said.In retrospect, the BJP now believes that the G-22 should have strictly played a behind the scenes role, strategising and advising the workers instead of putting themselves forward. That would have then rendered TMC’s campaign of “Banglar nijer mei ke chaye (Bengal wants its own daughter)” rather hollow. Instead, it became on point.The proliferation of turncoat candidatesIn the run-up to the election, the BJP was able to persuade many TMC leaders to join their ranks. Out of the 34 TMC and Communist Party of India (Marxist) leaders who joined the party in the last three months and were given BJP tickets, only five won. A BJP worker added that if the number of actors or other personalities who were given tickets was added to this list, it amounted to 149 out of 292 tickets going to those without roots in the party.Insiders say that neither the grassroot worker nor voters were convinced by the new entrants to the party. “There were many actors who were given tickets but they couldn’t even give you the full form of BJP,” said one of the persons quoted above. “Suvendu Adhikari (former TMC minister) was able to draw in people from his party but they weren’t necessarily the right fit for us.”Whether it was his choice or that of state president Dilip Ghosh, the distribution of tickets seems to have been far from ideal. For instance, in places where a party worker had been stabbed or attacked by TMC men, the newly inducted TMC person was given the ticket instead of going with the party loyalist. This wasn’t encouraging to those that had slowly played a role in enabling the rise of the BJP.Take, for instance, the manner in which TMC leaders Rajiv Banerjee and Baishali Dalmia were inducted in January this year, as a narrative that TMC leaders were abandoning a sinking ship gained ground. The BJP, in order to cash in on it, flew Banerjee and Dalmia in a chartered plane to meet Shah in Delhi. As one Bengal worker said, this flashy jet-setting life left neither the cadres nor the modest Bengali impressed.Incidentally, many point out that BJP vice-president Mukul Roy, who joined in 2017, was missing in action this time around, limiting himself to his constituency Krishnanagar while Adhikari became the star of this election. They say that Roy had managed BJP’s extraordinary performance in 2019 Lok Sabha elections where the party got 18 of the 42 seats, which really jolted Mamata Banerjee and forced her to hire strategists like Prashant Kishor. However, none of the persons HT spoke to were aware of why Roy was low profile this time. Roy didn’t respond to HT’s queries while an aide said that he was in isolation.The leadership question With Mukul Roy tucked away in Krishnanagar, the only local face that the BJP had was president of the state unit Dilip Ghosh. His party colleagues admit that Ghosh isn’t the most tactful.His ‘Mamata should wear bermudas’ comment wasn’t something you’d expect a bhadralok to say or support, and embarrassed his colleagues. However, it was his word that the party gave weight to, when it distributed tickets. With Adhikari and Roy both being relatively new imports, the BJP also had little clarity on who would be the state’s CM, leading to competing and colliding ambitions.Also Read | Extended election campaign pushed Covid-19 cases jump in rural BengalBut this dithering seems to have cost the party. Party insiders point out that Modi, Shah and Nadda’s high-visible campaign confused the voter and made them accept TMC’s argument that there was no one in the BJP who could counter Mamata Banerjee. “In the end, the middle class did wonder who could be an alternative to Mamata and we didn’t give them an answer to that,” said one of the MPs that HT spoke to.As the BJP now admits, the same tactics worked for the 2019 general elections, but for the assembly elections, they should have sent out a clearer signal. In the absence of that, Mamata Banerjee’s narrative of being a lone woman taking on the might of the Centre, managed to make an impression. A senior RSS functionary said that it had perhaps been an error to think that Narendra Modi’s flurry of public meetings would convert many into BJP voters. “I don’t think things work like that, growth has to be more organic.” Another Sangh functionary said that the BJP had wrongly anticipated a Modi wave in the state. He suggested that it would have been far more beneficial for the party if each person in Bengal knew their bandwidth.“We will study all the factors in some time,” said state secretary, Rahul Sinha, “Let us first deal with the attacks on our workers.”For the party, the silver liningHowever, the outlook is positive for many in the larger BJP and Sangh camp. The senior functionary in the RSS, quoted above, who played a key role in the campaign, told HT, “Political and social support don’t always have to go hand in hand. Take for instance, Kerala, where we have a solid support base but haven’t reached that level politically yet. In Bengal, we are getting there.”Others point out that reports of a loss were highly exaggerated. “From 3 to 77 is not a loss but a huge jump, where Left and the Congress could not even get a single seat,’’ said former TMC and now BJP leader Dinesh Trivedi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/the-inside-story-of-why-the-bjp-lost-bengal-101621240030193.html
17-05-2021||India||Narada sting case: CBI arrests 4, including 2 Bengal ministers||The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) on Monday arrested West Bengal ministers Subrata Mukherjee and Firhad Hakim, ruling Trinamool Congress MLA Madan Mitra, and former Kolkata mayor Sovan Chatterjee in connection with the 2016 Narada sting operation case. “The CBI has arrested two ministers, an MLA, and a politician in a case related to Narada sting operation... it was alleged that public servants were caught on camera while receiving illegal gratification from the sting operator,” CBI spokesperson RC Joshi said in Delhi.A CBI officer, who didn’t want to be named, said, “Mamata Banerjee barging into agency office amounts to interference in high court ordered investigation.”The charge sheet against five accused, including an IPS officer as well, for whom prosecution sanction has been received, is being submitted, he said. Following the arrest, chief minister Mamata Banerjee rushed to the CBI’s office at Nizam Palace in south Kolkata. “Mamata told the CBI officials that she should also be arrested,” said a TMC leader, aware of the development. The case pertains to a controversy ahead of the 2016 assembly elections after Narada News portal uploaded a series of videos purportedly showing a number of high-profile TMC leaders receiving money in exchange for favours to a fictitious company. All four leaders have been arrested under sections 120b of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and sections 7 and 13(1)(a) 13(1)(b) of the Prevention of Corruption Act. With protests going on in the city and tension mounting, the CBI decided to virtually produce the arrested leaders before the special CBI court.While the Trinamool Congress has alleged that the BJP was taking revenge over its defeat in the recent assembly elections, the latter said that it has nothing to do with the arrest and law was taking its own course. “Why isn’t Mukul Roy, vice president of BJP, being arrested? He was also seen in the Narada sting operation video saying that the money be given to a IPS officer. The BJP has become vindictive just because they can’t accept their defeat in the assembly polls,” said TMC spokesperson Kunal Ghosh. Also Read | Believe in judiciary, will get clean chit in Narada probe: Firhad Hakim“Law is taking its own course. BJP has nothing to do with this. We are not going to comment as BJP is not a CBI’s spokesperson,” countered BJP spokesperson Samik Bhattacharjee. Narada News, which had conducted the sting operation, also questioned why there has been no action against Suvendu Adhikari. Its chief executive Mathew Samuel said, “It was a long wait. Finally, I got the result. This is a fight against corruption. My question, is what happened to Suvendu Adhikari? He also received money from me. It was recorded and handed over to CBI. Justice has to go everywhere in the same manner.”Meanwhile, TMC workers and supporters staged protests at many places across the state. Roads were blocked with burning tyres, and TMC supporters scuffled with security forces outside the CBI office where the leaders were taken for questioning. “To arrest a sitting legislator, the state’s legislative assembly must be intimated. The CBI, however, did not intimate us (about the arrests). If they have been arrested, it is illegal. Prior permission of the Speaker of the legislative assembly is required for it, but it was not taken. This is undemocratic,” said West Bengal assembly Speaker Biman Banerjee. CPIM Rajya Sabha MP, former mayor and senior advocate Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharya said, “The arrests were not illegal. I would like to see where it’s written that one has to take the permission of the assembly Speaker to arrest a legislator. Thy have been booked according to the Prevention of Corruption Act. While taking cognizance, the court would see whether the crime has anything to do with the work of the assembly or the Speaker. If it has nothing to do with them, then no permission is required.” On May 9, West Bengal Governor Jagdeep Dhankhar had “accorded sanction for prosecution” of the leaders. While Hakim and Mukherjee took oath as ministers on May 10, Mitra is a sitting legislator who won from Kamarhati assembly. Chatterjee was with the ruling TMC, but joined the BJP in 2019. He quit the BJP too after being denied ticket in the assembly polls from his traditional assembly seat of Behala East.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/narada-sting-case-cbi-arrests-4-including-2-bengal-ministers-101621237869986.html
17-05-2021||India||Govt lays out procedure to rehabilitate children who lost parents to Covid||The government has laid out a procedure for rehabilitation of children who lost their parents to Covid-19.The public notice by the Women and Child Development Ministry comes amid reports that several messages offering children, who have lost their parents to Covid, for adoption are circulating on social media. Advising the public to refrain from engaging or encouraging such action, which is in contravention to legal provisions, the WCD Ministry has laid out lawful procedure of rehabilitation of children who lost their parents to Covid-19.The ministry has said that the child who has lost both parents to Covid-19 ought to be produced before the District Child Welfare Committee (CWC) within 24 hours, excluding the journey time."The CWC shall ascertain the immediate need of the child and pass appropriate orders for rehabilitation of the child, either to restore the child to caregivers or place her/him in institutional or non-institutional care, on case to case basis," the WCD Ministry said in a public notice. The ministry further said that effort will be made to sustain the children in their family and community environment as far as possible, while ensuring their safety in their surroundings and safeguarding their interest, as prescribed under the Juvenile Justice Act."If the child is restored to any kind of kinship care, the CWC will continue to check the well-being of the child on regular basis. Care must be taken to protect the identity of the child avoid undue distress," the WCD Ministry said.The ministry has also asked the state governments have been advised to use digital platform for interaction in exceptional cases where physical interaction is not possible in current circumstances due to Covid related restrictions.The ministry also said that the information about any child who has lost both the parents can be shared with childline (1098). "The local childline unit will help produce the child before the CWC within 24 hours and the local childline unit will also assist the CWC in monitoring the well-being of the child as and when required," it said. The ministry said persons wishing to adopt orphan children may approach Central Adoption Resource Authority (cara.nic.in) for lawful adoptions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-lays-out-procedure-to-rehabilitate-children-who-lost-parents-to-covid-101621237002153.html

17-05-2021||India||Both failed: Rahul Gandhi on PM Modi and ventilators bought with PM CARES Fund||Congress leader Rahul Gandhi attacked Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday morning alleging the ventilators provided under the PM CARES Fund were dysfunctional.“There’s a lot [in] common between PMCares ventilator[s] and the PM himself: too much false PR, don’t do their respective jobs and nowhere in sight when needed,” Gandhi said in a tweet.Rahul’s tweet follows allegations, mostly by Congress-ruled states, that the ventilators provided under the PM CARES Fund for treatment of Covid-19 patients didn’t work properly. India has been struggling to meet the high demand for ventilators, medical oxygen and ICU beds during the ongoing second wave of Covid-19 that has overwhelmed the health infrastructure resulting in a high rate of deaths.Last Friday, Maharashtra Pradesh Congress Committee spokesperson Sachin Sawant accused the Central government of providing faulty ventilators and called for a state-level inquiry into the matter. Several states have red-flagged the ventilators manufactured by AgVa Healthcare and supplied by PM CARES Fund. Earlier last week, Rajasthan chief minister Ashok Gehlot complained that the state had received faulty equipment and urged the Union health ministry to launch an investigation into the procurement of defective ventilators using PM CARES Fund.A similar issue was reported by Punjab’s Baba Farid University of Health Science. The varsity VC alleged that 62 out of 82 ventilators provided under PM CARES Fund were defective. The VC’s response came after an Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) MLA Kultar Singh Sandhwan tweeted pictures of unutilised ventilators lying at Guru Gobind Singh Medical College and Hospital in Faridkot. The hospital staff opined that the ventilators provided by the Centre were not reliable and functioned only for one or two hours after installation.Meanwhile, the state government also claimed that 130 of the 809 ventilators received from the Centre were not functional, as per a PTI report.In Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and Uttar Pradesh too, several ventilators were malfunctioning or sitting idle due to unavailability of ventilator connectors and skilled manpower.The centre called these reports “unfounded” and alleged lack of infrastructure at the Guru Gobind Singh Medical College and Hospital was to be blamed instead. In the case of the complaint raised by Maharashtra minister, the home ministry said the ventilators were not purchased under PM CARES Fund as alleged. Additionally, the Prime Minister has called for an immediate audit of the process of installing and operating ventilators while urging that health care workers are trained to handle them.The Wayanad MP has been relentless in his attacks on the Prime Minister and his government over the handling of the pandemic. On Sunday, he condemned the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government over reports of arrests of people allegedly putting up posters criticising Prime Minister Modi and the government’s handling of the crisis. Last week he alleged that the Prime Minister was silent in the times of crisis and accused him of “going missing”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/both-failed-rahul-gandhi-on-pm-modi-and-ventilators-bought-with-pm-cares-fund-101621236374403.html

The social media intermediary told the court through his lawyer Kapil Sibal that it is trying to get users on board but in case they don't agree, their accounts will slowly be deleted."We have asked users to agree to policy. If they don't agree we will delete them... there is no deferment of policy," Sibal told the court.Also Read: Users not accepting privacy terms to face limited functionality, says WhatsAppThe company had pushed back the deadline for its contentious new privacy policy launched in January this year. The updated policy will allow WhatsApp to share some data about users' interactions with business accounts with its parent company Facebook.The high court adjourned the matter for till June 3 even as Additional Solicitor General (ASG) Chetan Sharma and petitioners sought status quo. The ASG urged the court to record the statement of WhatsApp's counsel that the company will conform with the Indian law and maintain status quo where neither the account or the data is deleted if they revoke their permission/consent for the new privacy policy.However, WhatsApp objected to the stay and the company's lawyers said they would not make any such statement.The hearing was held on a petition filed by Seema Singh, through her advocate Meghan, and law student Chaitanya Rohilla challenging the WhatsApp's new privacy policy.The petitioners sought directions to the Centre to ask WhatsApp to either roll back their policy or provide an option to the users of their platform to opt-out of the January 4, 2021 update. The petitioners also sought to provide the users who have accepted the privacy policy another option to make a choice.The company had pushed back the roll-out of the policy, but reiterated in February that it will go ahead with its decision. This came despite the government writing a letter, asking the company to abandon its plans.In its affidavit, the Centre had told the court that the new privacy policy does not provide the opportunity to review or amend the full information submitted by a user, pointing out that the changes allowed to be made are limited to the name, picture, mobile number and “about” information.The Centre cited the 2011 IT Act rules to contend that the updated privacy policy fails to specify the types of “sensitive personal” data being collected, and with whom the information was being shared.According to the 2011 rules, there are eight categories of information that qualify as sensitive personal data, including user passwords, financial instrument and transaction information, and biometrics information.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-deferment-of-may-15-privacy-policy-deadline-whatsapp-to-delhi-hc-101621235511431.html

To deal with the situation, the country needs sufficient supply of vaccine, medicines and different types of medical equipment. Swadeshi Jagran Manch firmly believes that many Indian manufacturers have the capacity and expertise in production of essential medicines and vaccine, provided intellectual property rights hurdles are removed with technology transfer and trade secret issues resolved,” the SJM said in a statement.Also Read | How to vaccinate 10 million people a dayIt has also pointed out that although many Indian companies are already making drugs such as Remdesivir under the voluntary license, the quantity is not sufficient to meet the demand, and the price is also very high. “We understand that the government needs to use the public health safeguards in the Patents Act and permit more companies to produce these medicines in the coming days. As we may be requiring nearly 2 billion doses of vaccine in the next six months, we need to involve many more companies in manufacturing these vaccines. It’s heartening to note that licences have been issued to many companies for Covaxin and also for Remdesivir. We may have to multiply these efforts,” the statement said. The SJM has been demanding that all medical products required to respond to Covid-19 be declared global public good, and profiteering ended to serve the needy in these difficult times.The signature campaign seeks the WTO granting waiver in the provisions of TRIPS; government for taking necessary steps including using its sovereign rights to grant compulsory license to other pharma manufacturers to produce vaccine and medicines and for concerned individuals and organisations to facilitate universal access to vaccines and medicines to fight Covid-19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-vaccine-swadeshi-jagran-manch-starts-campaign-for-universal-access-101621235709902.html

Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray has convened a review meeting of State Disaster Management Authority as well in the afternoon.Tehsils such as Mandangad, Dapoli, Rajapur in Sidhudurg and Ratnagiri have been badly hit over the past two days. The district administration has received complaints of damage, falling of trees, electricity and internet disruption due to the weather. However, there is no report of any fatality due to cyclone, said the disaster management cell of the state government. Curfew has been imposed in many tehsils in Sindhudurg and Ratnagiri to avoid any fatalities and damage.Also Watch | Cyclone Tauktae ‘extremely severe’; expected to hit Gujarat coast tonightDeputy chief minister Ajit Pawar took a review of the situation in the coastal districts and spoke to the district collectors and municipal commissioners from the disaster management cell at the Mantralaya. “Pawar has been in touch with the officials from the coastal districts including Mumbai, Thane and Palghar, where orange and red alerts have been issued,” a statement issued by Pawar’s office said.In a review meeting with Union home minister Amit Shah on Sunday, chief minister Thackeray said the government has taken steps for the safety of people and has prepared a back-up plan for the supply of oxygen, and drugs to Covid-19 patients. “Around 900 metric tonnes of oxygen is produced in five production plants in the coastal part of the state. Administrations of Raigad,Palghar, Ratnagiri, and Sindhudurg have been asked to take precautionary measures to ensure that these plants are safeguarded. The double feeder power supply and strong wiring will ensure no damage is caused to oxygen production plants. Maharashtra also has around 12 hours of oxygen supply in stock as back-up,” a statement issued by the state government said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cyclone-tauktae-over-12-000-residents-shifted-from-coastal-maha-districts-101621234449935.html
17-05-2021||India||India's virus cases lower but WHO expert warns positivity rate 'worryingly' high||India on Monday reported a further decline in new coronavirus cases though daily deaths remained above 4,000 and experts warned that the count was unreliable due to a lack of testing in rural areas, where the virus is spreading fast.For months now, nowhere in the world has been hit harder than India by the pandemic, as a new strain of the virus first found there fuelled a surge in infections that has risen to more than 400,000 daily.Even with a downturn over the past few days, experts said there was no certainty that infections had peaked, with alarm growing both at home and abroad over the new more contagious B.1.617 variant taking hold."There are still many parts of the country which have not yet experienced the peak, they are still going up," World Health Organization Chief Scientist Soumya Swaminathan was quoted as saying in the Hindu newspaper.Swaminathan pointed to the worryingly high national positivity rate, at about 20% of tests conducted, as a sign that there could be worse to come."Testing is still inadequate in a large number of states. And when you see high test positivity rates, clearly we are not testing enough. And so the absolute numbers actually don't mean anything when they are taken just by themselves; they have to be taken in the context of how much testing is done, and test positivity rate."Having begun to decline last week, and new infections over the past 24 hours were put at 281,386 by the health ministry on Monday, dropping below 300,000 for the first time since April 21. The daily death count stood at 4,106.At the current rate India's total caseload since the epidemic struck a year ago should pass the 25 million mark in the next couple of days. Total deaths were put at 274,390.Hospitals have had to turn patients away while mortuaries and crematoriums have been unable to cope with bodies piling up. Photographs and television images of funeral pyres burning in parking lots and corpses washing up on the banks of the Ganges river have fuelled impatience with the government's handling of the crisis.It is widely accepted that the official figures grossly underestimate the real impact of the epidemic, with some experts saying actual infections and deaths could be five to 10 times higher.'Illusion'Whereas the first wave of the epidemic in India, which peaked in September, was largely concentrated in urban areas, where testing was introduced faster, the second wave that erupted in February is rampaging through rural towns and villages, where about two-thirds of the country's 1.35 billion people live, and testing in those places is sorely lacking."This drop in confirmed Covid cases in India is an illusion," S. Vincent Rajkumar, a professor of medicine at the Mayo Clinic in the United States, said on Twitter."First, due to limited testing, the total number of cases is a huge underestimate. Second, confirmed cases can only occur where you can confirm: the urban areas. Rural areas are not getting counted."While lockdowns have helped limit cases in parts of the country that had been hit by an initial surge of infections in February and April, such as Maharashtra and Delhi, rural areas and some states are dealing with fresh surges.The government issued detailed guidelines on Sunday for monitoring Covid-19 cases with the health ministry asking villages to look out for people with flu-like illness and get them tested for Covid-19.Prime Minister Narendra Modi has come under fire for his messaging to the public, a decision to leave key decisions on lockdowns to states, and the slow rollout of an immunisation campaign in the world's biggest vaccine producer.India has fully vaccinated just over 40.4 million people, or 2.9% of its population.A top virologist told Reuters on Sunday that he had resigned from a forum of scientific advisers set up by the government to detect variants of the coronavirus.Shahid Jameel, chair of the scientific advisory group of the forum known as INSACOG, declined to say why he had resigned but said he was concerned that authorities were not paying enough attention to the evidence as they set policy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-s-virus-cases-lower-but-who-expert-warns-positivity-rate-worryingly-high-101621233169121.html
17-05-2021||India||Reaching out to those in distress amid Covid: With food, ambulance, and more||Chandrakumar Gupta, 23, from Kargahar in Bihar was at his hostel in Delhi University last year when a photo of a migrant labourer carrying his daughter on his shoulders while on his long walk back home in Bihar flashed on his mobile screen. Gupta created a twitter handle @MigrantTravel where he would upload details of buses and trains to help migrants return home.Gupta is one of the many people in big cities who were so moved by the suffering of the common man, children, and even animals, amid the pandemic that they have stepped out to help.While Gupta started out alone, slowly, others joined him. “One evening, I got a message from one Sonam Chaturvedi who wanted to arrange a bus for some construction workers from Bihar. Since, I had already been sharing bus details for migrants, I had some numbers of bus operators and we could arrange one for whose fare was paid by Sonam,” says Gupta.However, the bus was not allowed to travel as it didn’t have the requisite permit. “I had to struggle for a few days but finally, I managed to get the permission. All this while, my neighbours, Armaan and Sourabh Roy, served the stranded migrants food and in two days, our first bus had reached Bhagalpur in Bihar with 50 migrant workers.” he says.Soon, the ones who had reached home sent out the team’s contact numbers to their friends, motivating the team to raise funds to send one more such bus. “It all grew so big that the four of us have sent over 6,100 migrant workers to their homes in Bihar while we raised an amount ₹56 lakh in just a few months,” says Gupta.Also Read | In Covid-19 second wave, how children are sufferingHeartbreaking stories of struggle have kept them going. “One evening when we were distributing food packets to workers before sending them home, a man on a cycle rickshaw with his wife and two children stopped and asked for a food packet. He said he belonged to Nalanda in Bihar and worked in Haridwar as a rickshaw-puller. So he had cycled from Haridwar with his family on his way home when he bumped into us. We sent them back on the bus; his rickshaw mounted on the bus,” says Gupta.However, the team’s support did not end with organising meals and travel home. Having identified 400 migrants whom they gave a ₹1,000 each initial support, they also organised sewing machines and carts for them which helped migrants sustain back home.Also, once the first wave subsided, Kumar connected labourers with prospective employers in Delhi. “As the situation got better and many of them found work here, we arranged for their return to Delhi too,” he said.Now as the second wave is yet to plateau, Kumar says not many workers are pleading to get back home yet but there is a crisis of proper health care. The team -- comprising Sonam, Arman and Sourabh, apart from Gupta -- has bought two ambulances.“We set up a helpline 011-6119-8168 on May 2 where people from disadvantaged sections of society can call for help. We have also hired a doctor who provides online consultation on this helpline,” he says.The number has already got around 400 calls and they have helped in the hospitalisation of over a hundred patients. “For those needing medicines or oxygen cylinders, we drop them at their doorstep,” says Kumar who is now planning to setup a 25 bed Covid care centre in Haryana’s Hathin block where the positivity rate is high and good healthcare facility not available.In Mumbai, Aditi Mundra, 25, has been baking cakes since the second wave of the pandemic began in India. A graphic designer by profession, Aditi says while everyone was raising funds for oxygen cylinders and medicines, many of the children orphaned by Covid have no one to look after them. “This is when I thought I should use my baking skills to raise funds to help these children,” she says.With her single kitchen oven, Aditi has been baking cakes daily and has made over ₹30,000 in sales. “While I am spending some money to buy protein kits and baby food for children who have lost their breadwinners to Covid, I am also sending stationery kits to holistic care centres of children who are suffering from cancer,” she says.“When I am not baking, I virtually attend to these ailing children and involve them in recreational tasks such as painting with the colour boxes that I sent them as gifts,” adds Aditi who also raised ₹124,000 which she used to buy ration for the families of migrant workers in Mumbai. In New Delhi, Urwi Goyal, 34, who is Covid positive right now, moves out in the courtyard of her house every evening along with a big basket of food to serve four dogs who have been there for two months after their owners abandoned them amid the pandemic. A former administrative officer who quit her job four years back to devote her time to helping people, has been reaching out to as many as 150 dogs each day in Delhi’s locked industrial areas with the food that she prepares at her home. “It all began last year when we saw so many helpless dogs in streets. Since, then my husband and I started moving around in our car to serve them food. Initially, it was just 10 odd dogs in our street but today, we serve all the dogs in all blocks of Naraina in Delhi,” she says.While she has also got over 120 dogs sterilised, she is also training as many 50 other women from families of migrant labourers in Delhi so they could help more of such families in crisis.Last year, these women had identified 25,000 destitute women in Delhi and helped them with ration. This year along with ration, they are reaching out to women with medicines and sanitary pads in the lockdown.“I was raised by a single mother. By helping women, I am only trying to do a bit of what my mother did for me,” she says.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/reaching-out-to-those-in-distress-amid-covid-with-food-ambulance-and-more-101621233312586.html
17-05-2021||India||DRDO's 1st batch of anti-Covid drug 2DG launched||Union defence minister Rajnath Singh and health minister Dr Harsh Vardhan on Monday released the first batch of Anti-Covid drug 2DG developed by the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO).With the support of DRDO and in the leadership of Union Defence Minister Rajnath Singh, this (Anti-COVID drug 2DG) may be our first indigenous research-based outcome to fight against Covid-19. It will reduce recovery time and oxygen dependency," Vardhan.Vardhan said that under Prime Minister Narendra Modi's leadership, the DRDO has played an important role in the fight against Covid-19. "Not just for India but I hope it serves in the fight against Covid, globally in the coming days. I thank and congratulate DRDO and its scientists." he added.Singh said under the leadership of the PM, the issue of oxygen production has been resolved with collective effort. "We will not be at ease and will not be tired but will keep fighting and will win against Covid-19. Now medicine issue is also not there much," Singh added.This comes after the Drugs Controller General of India (DGCI) approved the oral drug for emergency use as an adjunct therapy in moderate to severe coronavirus patients.Earlier on May 8, the defence ministry said the clinical trials of the drug, 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2-DG), showed that it helps in a faster recovery of hospitalised patients and reduces supplemental oxygen dependence."In the ongoing second Covid-19 wave, a large number of patients are facing severe oxygen dependency and need hospitalisation. The drug is expected to save precious lives due to the mechanism of its operation in the infected cells. This also reduces the hospital stay of Covid-19 patients," the ministry had said.The anti-Covid therapeutic application of the drug has been developed by the Institute of Nuclear Medicine and Allied Sciences (INMAS) along with Dr Reddy's Laboratories (DRL) in Hyderabad.The ministry said the drug comes in a powder form in a sachet and is taken orally by dissolving it in water.It further said that patients treated with 2-DG showed a faster symptomatic cure than the standard of care (SoC) on various endpoints.The approval of the drug has come at a time when the nation is struggling with a deadly second wave of the coronavirus disease.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/drdos-1st-batch-of-anti-covid-drug-2dg-launched-101621228944110.html
17-05-2021||India||In Covid-19 second wave, how children are suffering||“Two young children are alone. Their parents are in hospital and they have no food,” a voice said over the phone and immediately disconnected the call.The call was received by Bachpan Bachao Andolan (BBA), an NGO headed by Nobel Peace Prize laureate Kailash Satyarthi. Two children were in distress and had to be reached, but how? The “informer” just wouldn’t respond to repeated phone calls.The only clue available was that the call had originated from Chattisgarh. BBA made a call to the police in Raipur, which in turn, activated its cyber cell, and within a few hours, the number was traced to Kawardah, a town in Kabirdham district, approximately 120 km from the state capital.A police team soon reached the informer’s home who turned out to be a neighbour, too scared to approach the two children, aged six and eight, for fear of contracting Covid-19. The children had been without food but were also frightened. Would their parents return? When would they come back? The dark night held few answers.Helplines such as that of BBA have been ringing non-stop. The news at the other end of the line is always dismaying, distressing and heartbreaking. Each call is a desperate plea for help — from children themselves, from relatives, neighbours, resident welfare associations and often from friends of minor children who are minors themselves.Also Read | Deaths spike, vaccination dips — the story from India’s statesBBA posted a helpline number on Twitter in end-April. Previously a child rights helpline, the service has now been converted into a Covid child helpline. It received 416 calls in ten days. Its executive director, Dhananjay Tingal, says, “We are helping in multiple ways, from counselling children who cannot articulate their trauma to providing rations, educational fees and cremation costs.”BBA managed to keep a record of its calls but several NGOs say they have lost count. Calls are coming in the thousands.Protsahan India Foundation, which partners with Aziz Premji Philanthropic Initiatives and UNICEF, received 19 calls in a single day on May 11, each informing the organisation of the death of the father.Each statistic speaks of untold grief. The 19 families accounted for 43 children and at least four wives were pregnant. Protsahan, which helps 48 urban slums in West Delhi, has now connected them to midwives and is providing ration and scholarships for the devastated families.Sonal Kapoor, founder director of Protsahan India Foundation, finds herself working late into the nights these days. “I don’t like to refer to the children as Covid orphans. What we need is for kinship care to kick in on an urgent basis. Institutional care and shelter homes should be the last resort. The grief and trauma will damage the children and they will grow up to be broken adults. We are working on the short-term and the long-term.” She and her team are heartbroken too, but soldier on.There is no time to grieve. No time for a pause, a little breather. The problems surrounding children is a pandemic in itself.In Uttar Pradesh’s Sultanpur, an 18-year-old has become the primary caregiver after the rampaging virus ravaged her father’s lungs and he could breathe no more. Her mother is still coping with the loss and there are two younger siblings who need to be taken care of. There is another elder in the house – an Uncle (chacha) – but he is addicted to drugs and often opens the gate of the house and saunters out into locked streets.“My father was our main financial support. He was a teacher and a tutor. He insisted that I focus on taking the IAS exams that I was studying for. How do I fulfil his dream now? The day passes but the nights are long. I have problems sleeping. We are all depressed. Nobody from the neighbourhood was willing to lend a shoulder to carry my father’s body.”She is 18 and therefore, technically, not a minor, but the burden of the family has landed squarely on her young shoulders. An NGO has helped. Vijay Vidrohi, a part of Pratap Sewa Samiti got the entire family tested for Covid-19 and is helping the family with ration stocks and also took care of the last rites.The 18-year-old struggles with fear and apprehension, day on day. She is a college student but the faculty is shut. The freedom of open spaces and peer interaction at college is lost and the walls of her home are closing in on her, she says, as she tries not to cry on the phone.The struggle for millions of children and their families is not limited to the financials alone. Some can access only one meal a day; others are taking up petty jobs at tea stalls and shops and more still are taking to begging. The most startling, and disturbing, of all — some are selling their bodies.Also Read | Education Minister to virtually interact with state education secretaries todaySays Protsahan’s Sonal Kapoor, “There is an escalation of child labour and we have found girls being forced to engage in transactional sex -- offering their bodies in exchange of food for their families. When we speak to the mothers of these girls, they say ‘to feed four children, we have to sacrifice one’. We are focusing on nutrition and safe deliveries for pregnant mothers (some of whom are recent Covid widows), dry ration high in proteins for children, and emotional psychological support and even professional therapy. It’s like drowning in the sea. An NGO can’t be the system. We can only help plug the system.”Many are racing against time – amid an increasing number of children needing help – to try and be that plug. Multiple plugs are needed — to help with nutrition, with medication, with therapy, with domestic violence and sexual abuse, with child marriages and child trafficking. Fears of child trafficking networks slowly penetrating the pandemic are real and organisations are trying hard to guard against it.Social media is flooded with messages detailing the legal process to adopt children under the Juvenile Justice Act and there is a flurry of statements from child right bodies on how they are helping. Anurag Kundu, chairperson, Delhi Commission for Protection of Child Rights, in a statement said, “Children are the most vulnerable in these testing times as they remain dependent on others to provide for them. The panel is receiving numerous cases wherein a child has lost all sources of support and is in need of immediate care. The commission is committed to resolving all such cases in less than 24 hours.” He also posted a thread on how children can be legally adopted.The second wave has hit children harder. The trauma doesn’t stop with the loss of either or both parents. The emotional wound needs to be treated. Many children have not seen their parents for the last time because Covid protocols don’t allow for bodies to be brought home, and so, there is no closure.Acknowledging this, the National Commission for Protection of Child Rights NCPCR said, “While calls to counsellors over the last two-three months have been fewer and mostly about anxiety around exam schedules, the second wave of cases has brought children’s health and mental well-being back into focus. The NCPCR has written to the state authorities asking them to re-circulate information about the tele-counselling facility at Covid care centres and isolation facilities and sensitise staff, doctors and frontline workers so that children can be guided to seek help from experts on the toll free number.”Prayas, run by former Delhi Police officer Amod Kanth, is isolating children in quarantine centres, taking in children who have been orphaned and rescuing minors who have been left to beg on the streets, with help from child welfare committees.Ajay Tomar, a counsellor with Prayas, is trying to heal the children emotionally but it’s an uphill task. “What do you tell a 14-year-old who, after losing her father, is grappling with a deep sense of isolation and abandonment and the question in her mind is, Will I lose my mother too?’’ he says. Her mother is unable to look after her and she is currently at the shelter home.Similarly, Manoj Wadhwa, currently in Gurugram, is trying to fend for his 10-year-old Rajasthan-based niece who has lost both parents. The child has a medical problem and her medical expenses add up to ₹25,000 a month.Wadhwa lost his three-year-old son in an accident not long ago. “I understand the pain. My heart melts but what do I do? Only the NGOs are helping me. I am fighting for justice for my son. I have sued the contractor who left a gaping hole in the road, but who do I sue now? Who do I blame?” he asks.Who indeed? The government is still waking up to the child protection emergency. The ministry of women and child development has sought information on Covid orphans from various state governments and reiterated the need for respecting due process, but the road ahead is long and arduous.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-the-second-wave-how-children-are-suffering-101621229351119.html
17-05-2021||India||Gaza conflict: India calls for immediate de-escalation at UNSC||India has strongly condemned all acts of violence and provocation in the Gaza conflict and called for immediate de-escalation while urging Israel and Palestinian authorities to immediately resume dialogue to find a lasting solution. TS Tirumurti, India’s ambassador to the UN, outlined the country’s position during an open debate at the UN Security Council early on Monday, saying both sides should show extreme restraint and desist from actions that exacerbate tensions. India has found itself treading a cautious line as the conflict escalated in recent days, given its strong relations with both Israel and Arab states as well as its traditional support for a two-state solution, which was reiterated by Tirumurti. Palestinian officials have described Sunday as the deadliest day since the current fighting with Israel began, with 42 people killed in Israeli air strikes on Gaza. Israel’s army claimed Hamas militants fired more than 3,000 rockets over the past week. Also Read | Israel kills 42 in Gaza as Netanyahu warns war will go on“We reiterate our strong condemnation of all acts of violence, provocation, incitement and destruction. Immediate de-escalation is the need of the hour so as to arrest any further slide towards the brink,” Tirumurti said while addressing the open debate at the UN Security Council, of which India is a non-permanent member. “We urge both sides to show extreme restraint, desist from actions that exacerbate tensions and refrain from attempts to unilaterally change the existing status quo, including in east Jerusalem and its neighbourhood,” he said. Noting that recent events had resulted in a sharp deterioration of the security situation, Tirumurti said: “The indiscriminate rocket firing from Gaza targeting the civilian population in Israel, which we condemn, and the retaliatory strikes into Gaza have caused immense suffering and resulted in deaths, including women and children.” The historic status quo at the holy places of Jerusalem, including Haram al-Sharif or Temple Mount, must be respected, Tirumurti said. Both sides should “refrain from attempts to unilaterally change the existing status quo, including in east Jerusalem and its neighbourhood”. India supports the diplomatic efforts of the Quartet and other members of the international community, particularly the countries in the region, to calm the situation, end the violence and seek a durable peace, Tirumurti said. “These incidents have once again underscored the need for immediate resumption of dialogue between Israel and Palestinian authorities. The absence of direct and meaningful negotiations between the parties is widening the trust deficit between the parties,” he said. “This will only increase the chances for similar escalation in the future. We believe that every effort should be made to create conducive conditions for resumption of talks between Israel and Palestine,” Tirumurti added, while reiterating “India’s strong support to the just Palestinian cause and its unwavering commitment to the two-state solution”. Tirumurti also highlighted India’s direct connection to the situation – he pointed out that an Indian national, care-giver Soumya Santosh, had died when rockets hit the Israeli coastal city of Ashkelon, and that Jerusalem is revered by millions of Indians who visit the city every year. Referring to Santosh, he said, “We deeply mourn her demise along with all other civilians who have lost their lives in the current cycle of violence.” He added, “[Jerusalem] also houses the Al-Zawiya al-Hindiya, the Indian Hospice, which is a historic place associated with a great Indian Sufi saint, Baba Farid, and located inside the old city. India has restored this Indian Hospice.” The Indian Hospice is run by the descendants of a man from Uttar Pradesh, who still hold Indian passports. UN Secretary-General António Guterres has pleaded for an immediate end to the “utterly appalling” violence and warned that further fighting could plunge the region into “uncontainable crisis”. The overall death toll in Gaza now stands at 188, including 55 children and 33 women, while another 1,230 have been injured, according to local authorities. BBC cited local reports as suggesting that Hamas has offered some kind of ceasefire for several days but has been rebuffed by Israel, which wants to inflict as much damage as it can on the militants before the fighting is finally brought to a close.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/gaza-conflict-india-calls-for-immediate-de-escalation-at-unsc-101621227729736.html

All government hospitals across the state have been directed to undergo a thorough review of firefighting arrangements,” said a senior health department official of the state. In April this year, at least 15 patients lost their lives after a fire broke out in a Covid-hospital at Virar in Maharashtra’s Palghar district. In another incident at least 19 people, including 17 Covid patients, died after a fire at the Intensive Care Unit of a hospital in Gujarat’s Bharuch district earlier this month. “The heads of all medical colleges and hospitals have been asked to depute one assistant superintendent for this purpose. Similarly, the chief medical officers of health of all districts have also been directed to check the firefighting arrangements of all district hospitals under them,” the official said. Also Read | India’s records 281,386 new Covid-19 cases, 4,106 fatalities in 24 hoursHospitals have been asked to complete any pending civil and electrical firefighting work; district magistrates and heads of medical colleges can spend up to ₹25 lakh for the same without waiting for a nod from the state health department. While there are more than 180 government hospitals dedicated for treating Covid-19 patients, 41 private hospitals have been taken up by the state for treating such patients. This apart, there are safe homes, rural health facilities and district hospitals where patients are admitted. Daily-count of Covid-19 cases has shot up exponentially in the recent past with experts blaming the rise on election rallies that were held in April violating all safety protocols. On Sunday, the state registered 19,117 new cases, taking the total number of active cases in the state to 131,805. As many as 147 Covid deaths were reported in the past 24 hours, taking the total death toll to 13,284 since 2020.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bengal-hospitals-to-undertake-thorough-check-up-of-firefighting-equipment-101621225749634.html
17-05-2021||India||India opposes Hamas rocket action against Israel, supports Palestine||In a nuanced statement on the Middle-East situation, India has opposed “indiscriminate rocket firing” by Hamas from Gaza to target civilian population in Israel while supporting the Palestinian cause and its commitment to the two-state solution.While the UN Security Council could not issue a statement on the escalating situation after what Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi called a “block by one country”, the US is coming under pressure to reconsider its position on the Israel-Hamas conflict.Watch: Israel calls off airstrike in Gaza after spotting childrenThe Indian statement issued by UN Permanent Representative on May 16 has used the word “retaliatory strikes” by Israel to Hamas action. The words have been carefully inserted as India itself has been a victim of cross-border terrorism emanating from Pakistan. The fact is that India lost one of its nationals Soumya Santhosh from Kerala is the indiscriminate rocket firing by the Sunni militant group. "We reiterate our strong condemnation of all acts of violence, provocation, incitement and destruction," the Indian statement said.Also Read: Israel kills 42 in Gaza as Netanyahu warns war will go onWhile India has opposed Hamas action, it has stuck to its traditional line of direct dialogue between Israeli and Palestinian authorities as well as remaining committed to the two state solution. “Immediate de-escalation is the need of the hour, so as to arrest any further slide towards the brink. We urge both sides to show extreme restraint, desist from actions that exacerbate tensions, and refrain from attempts to unilaterally change the existing status quo, including in East Jerusalem and its neighbourhood,” the state said.It is understood that friends of Israel have privately told Tel Aviv to exercise full restraint or else it will further alienate itself from the global community.The Indian position is carefully articulated in the statement as New Delhi has close ties with both Israel and the Arab world and supports the Palestinian cause. The Hamas action against Israel from Gaza further complicates the issue as the Sunni group has few supporters in the PLO, whose leader Mahmoud Abbas is the president of the State of Palestine and Palestine National Authority.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-opposes-hamas-rocket-action-against-israel-supports-palestine-101621224892489.html

17-05-2021||India||Deaths spike, vaccination dips—the story from India’s states||Uttarakhand, Goa and Delhi have highest Covid deaths for one lakh population (DPL) whereas Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and Odisha have lower DPLs, shows government’s data on Covid deaths. The health ministry’s data also shows that less than two percent of the population in Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Bihar and Jharkhand, states accounting for one-third of the country’s population, have been fully vaccinated, even as several smaller population states such as Tripura, Sikkim and Arunachal Pradesh have done much better.It is in this twin story — of a higher number of deaths in many pockets (which official numbers haven’t, it appears, been able to capture), and a dip in vaccination in other pockets — that is a key feature of the management of the second wave of the pandemic in India.These inferences are based on health ministry’s Covid and vaccination data for May 15 and population projections for 2021 by the Census Commissioner of India, and come at the time when some state governments are being accused of hiding actual Covid deaths.The story of mortality According to health ministry data, Uttarakhand, where mass gathering of people was allowed for Mahakhumbh in March and April, has highest (151) deaths for one lakh people (DPL) followed by Goa, 131, and Delhi, 101. “We have been transparent in reporting Covid cases and deaths. Our death numbers also include outsiders who came for Kumbh,” said Uttarakhand chief secretary Om Prakash.Gujarat, which has been repeatedly accused of hiding Covid deaths, has much lower DPL of 12.95. Divya Bhaskar, a Gujarati daily newspaper, had on Friday reported that the state government has issued 121,000 death certificates between March 1 and May 10 this year, 61,000 more certificates than in the same period last year. Although the Gujarat government did not deny the figures, junior home minister Pratapsinh Jadeja said it was “mischievous” to compare death certificates with Covid-19 and accused the newspaper of trying to be sensational.Also Read | 5th phase of lockdown begins in Delhi as positivity rate down to 10.4%Gujarat’s neighbouring state of Maharashtra, which has reported high Covid cases since March, had DPL of almost 70, highest among big population states. Karnataka has DPL of 32, Chhattisgarh 39.30, Punjab 38.54, Andhra Pradesh 17.56 and Tamil Nadu 22.72.Uttar Pradesh has DPL of 2, second lowest to only Mizoram among states, with 4,623 total Covid deaths reported so far, even as there have been reports of over 800 dead bodies found buried on banks of river Ganga in Kanpur, Gazipur and Unnao districts. UP government has refuted charge of hiding data, saying Covid deaths were being reported as per the Indian Council for Medical Research (ICMR) guidelines that prohibits recording of Covid deaths of persons with co-morbidities. “We are strictly following ICMR guidelines,” said UP’s additional secretary, information, Navneet Sehgal.Madhya Pradesh, where burials and cremations as per Covid protocol in major cities such as Indore, Bhopal and Jabalpur were almost double the Covid deaths reported, had DPL of 8.18 with 6,913 total deaths reported. In Bhopal, close to 1,400 people were cremated with Covid protocol since April 1, even as official Covid deaths were only 425, said Bhopal-based social activist Seema Kurup, claiming the situation was similar in Indore and Jabalpur. State health minister Prabhuram Chaudhary said, “We did door-to-door survey to identify Covid positive cases and our timely action is the main reason behind low death rate.”However, a recent report by the Seattle-based Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) at the University of Washington in Seattle, estimated that actual Covid deaths in India as on May 6 may be 0.654 million (6.54 lakh), almost three times the official count of 0.221 million (2.21 lakh). The IHME, which comes out with annual Global Burden of Disease study, has been using an updated methodology to project Covid deaths in various countries in the world. With this methodology to assess “excess deaths”, the IHME estimates that nearly seven million people have died worldwide as direct victims of the virus. This is about double the number of casualties reported on the basis of official or verifiable sources.The story of vaccination Health ministry data also showed that less than two percent of the population of Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Bihar and Jharkhand population, states accounting for 35% of the country’s population, has been fully vaccinated. Several smaller states such as Tripura, Sikkim and Arunachal Pradesh have much better vaccination numbers.Several state governments have slowed down vaccinations since April 15 due to short supply of vaccines from two Indian manufacturers – Serum Institute of India and Bharat Biotech – and as many as 12 states have floated global tenders for vaccines.Also Read | Portals of Kedarnath temple open amid strict Covid-19 protocolAccording to the ministry, 2.5% of India’s people have got both doses of vaccination while 9.3% have got a single jab as on May 16, 121 days after vaccination started on January 16. Till May 16, the ministry said, 98.8 million people had got a single dose and 41.7 million both doses of Covid vaccine.The data showed that the progress of vaccination was abysmally low in Bihar, UP and Madhya Pradesh, which account for 32.2% of India’s population. These states combined have so far vaccinated only 1.51% of the population with both doses. Only 5.91% people in these states have been vaccinated with single dose.Another five states, Jharkhand, Punjab, Assam, Tamil Nadu and Telangana, which account for 16% of the national population, have given both doses to 2.32% of its population and single dose to 8.4% of their population got single dose. “If we take the above mentioned 8 states together, they represent 48.2% of India’s population and only 1.78% of their population has got both doses of covid vaccine,” James Wilson, a researcher who has extensively studied health data over the past year, said.Smaller population states such as Ladakh and Tripura have vaccinated more than 12% of their population with both doses, and 29.05% and 23.13% of population, respectively, with single dose. Sikkim & Lakshadweep vaccinated 8.8% & 9.54% of their population with both doses, data shows.(With inputs from state bureaus)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/deaths-spike-vaccination-dips-the-story-from-india-s-states-101621223889787.html

17-05-2021||India||Cyclone Tauktae now ‘extremely severe’, likely to hit Gujarat coast tonight||Very severe Cyclonic Storm Tauktae (pronounced as TauTe) has intensified into an extremely severe cyclonic storm centered about 160 km west-southwest of Mumbai, 290 km south-southeast of Veraval (Gujarat), 250 km south-southeast of Diu and 840 km south-southeast of Karachi (Pakistan). It presently has a wind speed of 180 to 190 kmph gusting to 210 kmph, according to India Meteorological Department (IMD).It is very likely to move north-northwestwards and reach Gujarat coast Monday evening between 2000 – 2300 hrs IST and cross Gujarat coast between Porbandar & Mahuva (Bhavnagar district) the same evening as a very severe cyclonic storm with a maximum sustained wind speed 155-165 kmph gusting to 185 kmph.Large-scale damage is expected over Porbandar, Amreli Junagarh, Gir Somnath, Botad, Bhavnagar and coastal areas of Ahmedabad. There is likely to be total destruction of thatched houses and extensive damage to kutcha houses; some damage to pucca houses; potential threat from flying objects; bending or uprooting of power and communication poles; major damage to roads; flooding of escape routes; minor disruption of railways; overhead power lines and signalling systems; widespread damage to salt pans and standing crops; blowing down of bushy trees; small boats, country crafts may get detached from moorings; visibility may be severely affected.Some damage is also expected over Devbhoomi Dwarka, Kutch, Jamnagar, Rajkot, Morbi, Valsad, Surat, Vadodara, Bharuch, Navsari and Anand districts.IMD has recommended evacuation of people from vulnerable areas, total suspension of fishing operations, judicious regulation of rail and road traffic, people in affected areas to remain indoors, movement in motor boats and small ships could be unsafe.Also Read | No Covid-19 vaccination drive in Mumbai on Monday due to Cyclone Tauktae“Tauktae will intensify further while on its track and cross the Gujarat coast with a speed of 155 to 165 kmph gusting to 185 kmph. We are not expecting it to become a super cyclone but it is a big and intense system,” said Sunitha Devi, in charge of cyclones at IMD.During the next 12 hours, Tauktae will continue to intensify drawing energy from the ocean. It is very likely to move north northwest wards and reach Gujarat coast by Monday evening. The system is being monitored by Doppler weather RADAR Goa.Tauktae intensified very rapidly from a depression to a cyclone on Friday. There was rapid intensification of the cyclone on Saturday also. “Tauktae intensified by 65 kmph during the past 24 hours fuelled by heat and energy from the ocean,” said Roxy Mathew Koll, a climate scientist at the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology.“With Cyclone Tauktae, this will be the fourth consecutive year of pre-monsoon cyclone over the Arabian Sea. This is also the third consecutive year when a cyclone has come very close to the west coast of India. Sea surface temperatures in Arabian Sea have increased rapidly during the past century and this has led to an increase in the frequency and intensity of cyclones in the Arabian Sea…global warming has presented us with new challenges such as rapid intensification of cyclones, which need to be closely monitored at higher resolution and accuracy using on-site platforms such as buoys and moorings. Improving the Indian Ocean Observing System (IndOOS) and incorporating the global warming signals in the weather models can help us tackle the challenges of intense cyclones in the future,” he added in a statement.Also Read | 4 dead as Cyclone Tauktae hits K’takaSea condition over northeasy Arabian Sea will be very high to phenomenal (up to 14 metres high) and wind speeds (up to 64 knots) on Monday and Tuesday.

17-05-2021||India||The economy story is unravelling just 46 days into FY22||On May 16, the Delhi government ordered the extension of the lockdown in the national capital by one more week. The lockdown, which has been in place for a month already, is bound to have an adverse impact on economic activity. Even though there is no nationwide lockdown at the moment, most parts of India are under varying degrees of mobility restrictions. What will be the economic impact of these restrictions? Here is what we know and do not know about the evolving economic story, a month and a half into the fiscal year 2021-22.March 2021: The month of exuberanceLast week, the National Statistical Office (NSO) released the Index of Industrial Production (IIP) numbers for the month of March 2021. The headline growth number of 22.4% had a large base effect. IIP had contracted by 18.7% in March 2020. However, this does not negate the fact that industrial production across categories was at its highest levels in March 2021 since the pandemic disrupted economic activity. This is borne out by a comparison of absolute values of IIP sub-indices from March 2020 to March 2021.That workplace mobility, as per data from Google mobility indices, also peaked in March 2021 -- it has fallen sharply since then -- also suggests that economic normalisation was being widely perceived as a possibility. 2021-22 was being seen as the year of restoration of normal economic activity. In hindsight, this exuberance was one of the key factors which led to lowered vigilance and allowed the second wave of the pandemic to disrupt economic activity once again.April 2021: Food price-driven moderation in inflationRetail inflation, as measured by the Consumer Price Index (CPI), went down by 123 basis points – one basis point is one hundredth of a percentage point – between March and April 2021 to grow at 4.29%. The headline number was driven by a sharp fall in food inflation, which grew at 2.02% in April compared to 4.87% in March. Vegetable prices suffered the largest fall in this category, with prices contracting by 14.2% on an annual basis.To be sure, prices of some food items such as edible oils, pulses and meat products continued to grow at a high pace. Some economists believe that fall in price of staples such as cereals, vegetables and milk, especially the latter two, could be a result of supply chain disruptions and a fall in demand due to lockdown driven headwinds to incomes. The overall trajectory of inflation could remain elevated as petrol-diesel prices have started rising once again in May after the pause due to elections and prices in the producer market, such as of metals, continue to remain high. Wholesale Price Index (WPI), which captures producer prices in India, grew at 7.4% in March 2021. The April value had not been released until May 16, 2021. Fall in food prices, while all prices rise, will put a squeeze on farm incomes.Double whammy for labour marketsEven before the second wave disrupted economic activity, the recovery was being seen as profit-led rather than wage-led. While the Indian economy re-entered expansion zone in the quarter ending October-December 2020, employment and wages were still to retain pre-pandemic levels. According to a recent report released by the Azim Premji University, the pandemic also led to a worsening in quality of employment, with a large number of erstwhile salaried workers joining the ranks of the precariously self-employed. The second wave and subsequent restrictions have given the labour market yet another blow. Data from the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy (CMIE) – there are no high-frequency official statistics on employment – show that overall unemployment rate climbed up to 7.97% in April 2021, the highest since December 2020. In urban areas, the unemployment rate was 9.78% in April 2021, the highest since August 2020. The situation is likely to get worse in May as more areas have come under lockdown or similar restrictions.What about taxes?It is still early days in 2021-22. But the second wave has already cast its shadow on the growth prospects. Private forecasters have started downward revisions of their GDP projections for the year. The government itself has acknowledged the possibility of a third wave now. Any downward revision in growth prospects of the economy will also entail a shortfall in taxes from an already low base. The central government’s Gross Tax Revenue receipts given in 2020-21 Budget Estimates were reduced by more than 20% in the Revised Estimates (RE) given in the 2021-22 Budget. The Controller General of Accounts (CGA) is yet to release provisional tax collection figures for the month of March 2021, so even the fate of RE numbers remains unknown. Any significant shortfall in taxes will force the government to cut down its spending, unless it increases its borrowing to meet the shortfall, which will only make the task of economic revival more difficult. A Reuters story quoted a government official as saying that “lockdowns will start affecting tax collections by June, potentially lowering revenues 15%-20% from what was estimated for the quarter”.Get our daily newsletter

Some members will also serve as ministers in their respective states.Trinamool Congress MP Dr Manas Bhuyan, who got elected to the Rajya Sabha on 2017, contested the assembly polls and is now the water resources investigation and development minister of the state.R Vaithilingam of the AIADMK, who was set to retire in 2022 from the Upper House, resigned from Parliament after he won from the Orathanadu constituency. He will be in the Opposition bench of the Tamil Nadu assembly.His party colleague, KP Munusamy, also resigned from Parliament to become a member of the Tamil Nadu assembly. Munusamy won the Veppanahalli constituency. Another Rajya Sabha MP, Biswajit Daimary from Assam, has also quit the Upper House. According to some state officials, the Bharatiya Janata Party MLA is tipped to be the next Speaker of the state assembly.As per the procedure, byelections will take place to fill up these vacancies. While the TMC and the BJP would be able to retain the seats vacated by their MPs, in Tamil Nadu, both seats vacated by the AIADMK MPs are likely to go to the ruling DMK.Nominated MP Swapan Dasgupta had also resigned from the Upper House before contesting the West Bengal elections, where he lost. While the four seats in Assam, Bengal and Tamil Nadu would face bypolls, the President of India will have to nominate an eminent person for Dasgupta’s seat. The rules, however, allow the renomination of Dasgupta.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/four-vacancies-in-upper-house-after-assembly-elections-101621209942855.html

The drug has been developed by DRDO's Institute of Nuclear Medicine and Allied Sciences (INMAS) in collaboration with Dr Reddy's Laboratories."The first batch of 10,000 doses of 2DG medicine would be launched early next week, informed Defence Research and Development Organisation officials to ANI on Friday.The official informed, "The first batch of 10,000 doses of 2DG medicine for the treatment of Covid-19 infected patients would be launched early next week and will be given to patients.""The drug manufacturers are working on ramping up the production of the medicine for future use. The drug has been developed by a team of DRDO scientists including Dr Anant Narayan Bhatt", informed DRDO officials."An anti-Covid-19 therapeutic application of the drug 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2-DG) has been developed by Institute of Nuclear Medicine and Allied Sciences (INMAS), a lab of Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO), in collaboration with Dr Reddy's Laboratories (DRL), Hyderabad", informed an official release by Ministry of Defence.Clinical trial results have shown that this molecule helps in faster recovery of hospitalised patients and reduces supplemental oxygen dependence. Higher proportion of patients treated with 2-DG showed RT-PCR negative conversion in COVID patients. The drug will be of immense benefit to the people suffering from Covid-19.Pursuing Prime Minister Narendra Modi's call for preparedness against the pandemic, DRDO took the initiative of developing anti-Covid therapeutic application of 2-DG. In April 2020, during the first wave of the pandemic, INMAS-DRDO scientists conducted laboratory experiments with the help of Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology (CCMB), Hyderabad and found that this molecule works effectively against SARS-CoV-2 virus and inhibits the viral growth.Based on these results, Drugs Controller General of India's (DCGI) Central Drugs Standard Control Organization (CDSCO) permitted Phase-II clinical trial of 2-DG in Covid-19 patients in May 2020.The DRDO, along with its industry partner DRL, Hyderabad, started the clinical trials to test the safety and efficacy of the drug in Covid-19 patients. In Phase-II trials (including dose ranging) conducted during May to October 2020, the drug was found to be safe in Covid-19 patients and showed significant improvement in their recovery. Phase IIa was conducted in six hospitals and Phase IIb (dose ranging) clinical trial was conducted at 11 hospitals all over the country. Phase-II trial was conducted on 110 patients.In efficacy trends, the patients treated with 2-DG showed faster symptomatic cure than Standard of Care (SoC) on various endpoints. A significantly favourable trend (2.5 days difference) was seen in terms of the median time to achieving normalisation of specific vital signs parameters when compared to SoC.Based on successful results, DCGI further permitted the Phase-III clinical trials in November 2020. The Phase-III clinical trial was conducted on 220 patients between December 2020 to March 2021 at 27 Covid hospitals in Delhi, Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal, Gujarat, Rajasthan, Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu. The detailed data of phase-III clinical trial was presented to DCGI.In 2-DG arm, significantly higher proportion of patients improved symptomatically and became free from supplemental oxygen dependence (42 per cent vs 31 per cent) by Day-3 in comparison to SoC, indicating an early relief from Oxygen therapy/dependence.The similar trend was observed in patients aged more than 65 years. On May 01, 2021, DCGI granted permission for Emergency Use of this drug as adjunct therapy in moderate to severe Covid-19 patients. Being a generic molecule and analogue of glucose, it can be easily produced and made available in plenty in the country.The drug comes in powder form in sachet, which is taken orally by dissolving it in water. It accumulates in the virus infected cells and prevents virus growth by stopping viral synthesis and energy production. Its selective accumulation in virally infected cells makes this drug unique.In the ongoing second Covid-19 wave, a large number of patients are facing severe oxygen dependency and need hospitalisation. The drug is expected to save precious lives due to the mechanism of operation of the drug in infected cells. This also reduces the hospital stay of Covid-19 patients.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rajnath-singh-to-release-1st-batch-of-drdo-s-2dg-medicine-today-101621207753038.html
17-05-2021||India||Thousands evacuated from west coast as cyclone Tauktae lashes states||India is evacuating thousands of people from low-lying areas along its western coast as a powerful cyclone that has killed at least six people is expected to make landfall on Tuesday morning in the state of Gujarat.Cyclone Tauktae, which formed in the Arabian sea, has already brought lashing rain and winds that damaged houses and uprooted trees to parts of western and southern India."It is very likely to intensify further during the 24 hours, and move north-northwestwards and reach Gujarat coast in the evening of 17th (May)," the India Meteorological Department said in a statement.The cyclone is expected to cross Gujarat with wind gusts of up to 175 kmph (109 mph).Nearly 150,000 people will be moved from villages and low-lying areas near the coast and directions have been issued to complete the evacuation process by Sunday evening, the Gujarat government said in a statement.As the cyclone has moved north at least six people have been killed in the western states of Goa and Karnataka, according to officials and statements.Further south, 31 boats registered with the state of Tamil Nadu were missing, a coastguard official told Reuters.The meteorological agency also warned that there could be flooding of escape routes. Disruption to railway services was also expected until May 21.The National Crisis Management Committee also chaired a meeting with different states on Sunday and said that nearly 80 disaster management teams have been deployed in different states.Rescue and relief teams from the army, navy and coastguard, along with ships and aircraft, have also been deployed."All measures being taken to evacuate people in the areas affected by the cyclone so as to ensure zero loss of life," the government said in a statement.VACCINATIONS SUSPENDEDIn Gujarat, the cyclone will also pose challenges for the state-administration that is dealing with a high case load of Covid-19 patients.Gujarat Chief Minister Vijay Rupani has asked officials to ensure that electricity supplies to Covid-19 hospitals and other medical facilities are not disrupted and the supply of oxygen is maintained, the state government said. Vaccinations have also been suspended for the next two days.In the neighbouring state of Maharashtra, the government has moved Covid-19 patients admitted to makeshift centres in the state capital, Mumbai, to other hospitals as the cyclone advances towards Gujarat, the chief minister's office said.Gujarat is also home to large refineries and ports that may end up in the storm's path.All necessary precautions were being taken at the Jamnagar refinery, the world's biggest oil refinery complex, owned by Reliance Industries, a company spokesperson said.Operations at Mundra port, India's largest private port, in Gujarat were continuing normally, two officials at the port told Reuters on Sunday morning."We are observing the situation, and will take action accordingly," an official said.Authorities at Kandla Port, the largest government-run port in the country, said steps had been taken to evacuate around 5,000 people from low lying areas."We have already issued an advisory, and have stopped taking any vessels inside. There will be no berthing tomorrow morning, and all vessels will be sent to the high seas," S.K. Mehta, chairman of Kandla Port, said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/thousands-evacuated-from-west-coast-as-cyclone-tauktae-lashes-states-101621206477929.html

17-05-2021||India||Clean chit to BV Srinivas, 8 others in hoarding case||The Delhi Police have prima facie found no evidence against nine people — including B V Srinivas, the president of the Indian Youth Congress (IYC) — who were probed for allegedly hoarding and black marketing Covid-19 medical supplies, according to a status report filed before the Delhi high court on Saturday.The report said the nine people were “actually helping people” and “did not defraud” anyone. To be sure, the nine are still being probed and the clean chit is only on the basis of preliminary findings. HT has seen a copy of the report.The investigating officer, who questioned Srinivas, BJP leaders Gautam Gambhir, Harish Khurana and Aam Aadmi Party(AAP) leader Dilip Pandey, among others, has sought six weeks to conduct a “detailed investigation”.The high court will hear the matter on Monday.In the status report, police have attached the statements of the nine persons who were interrogated. On May 4, the Delhi high court had asked police to conduct an investigation after a writ petition was filed by a Delhi resident accusing the politicians mentioned above of procuring crucial Covid-19 medicines and supplies, hoarding them, and distributing them while citizens did not have access to them.The police’s visit to the IYC headquarters and questioning Srinivas had kicked up a storm on social media. Many accused Delhi police of harassing those who are actually helping in delivering medicines, oxygen cylinders, or finding beds at hospitals at a time when people are struggling to get these resources.Officials aware of the police’s preliminary findings said all the alleged accused persons denied taking money from the person they helped.For instance, former Congress MLA Mukesh Sharma said in his statement that he used social media to give people information about the medical stores available in his area but denied buying a single strip of medicine.BJP MP from East Delhi, Gautam Gambhir, too denied the allegations. He said the Gautam Gambhir Foundation had organised a free medical camp between April 22 and May 7 to provide assistance to people suffering from Covid-19. In his statement, Gambhir mentioned that the camp was organised by a doctor, who had volunteered his services. HT is withholding the name of the doctor as he has not been questioned by the police or named in the complaint.Gambhir said, “A total of 2,628 strips of Fabiflu were purchased from authorised vendors against the prescription of Dr……..It is stated that while payments were made by Gautam Gambhir Foundation, however, the aforesaid medicine was delivered by respective vendors directly to Dr….”Srinivas, in his statement, said that the enquiry against him and other members of the IYC was harassment because he and some of his colleagues have been at the forefront of providing relief.He also mentioned that he was harassed because their party (Congress) had opposed the Centre’s handling of the Covid crisis. The IYC president said he, along with other volunteers, connect people in need with the appropriate resources. He also said they “receive oxygen equipment as donations and provide it free of cost to the people.”Former Rajya Sabha MP Shahid Siddiqui, who was questioned on how he got two remdesivir injection vials from Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi, told police that his SOS request on social media was considered by Priyanka, who provided two doses of the medicines, which were procured for Congress leader Rahul Gandhi but were not used.Siddiqui had criticised police for probing how people were receiving help amid the crisis instead of focusing on other important cases.On Friday, Delhi police said they were probing the case and enquiring the role of those who were helping Covid-19 patients and their families only on the orders of the high court.Last week, the HC dismissed a plea against AAP MLA Imran Hussain when the Delhi government submitted that he was not drawing it from state quota and distributing it for free..||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/clean-chit-to-bv-srinivas-8-others-in-hoarding-case-101621204731641.html
17-05-2021||India||Rapid tests for Covid-19 key in Centre’s rural SOP||The Centre is focusing on coronavirus disease (Covid-19) containment and management in non-urban areas, as “a gradual ingress is now being seen in peri-urban, rural and tribal areas as well”, said new detailed guidelines that the Union health ministry released on Sunday, adding that the disease is still predominantly an urban phenomenon.The focus will be on locally managed care centres and scaling up rapid testing where RT-PCR facilities are not accessible.“With larger spread of Covid-19 cases in peri-urban, rural and tribal areas, it is important to ensure that community-based services and primary level health infrastructure in these areas are equipped and oriented to manage Covid-19 cases,” the health ministry said in the guidelines.Gram panchayats have been assigned the prime responsibility of coordinating community action and awareness creation at village level and the block development officer (BDO) at the taluka level. The efforts on the medical care side will be coordinated by the village health, nutrition and sanitation committee (VHSNC) along with the primary health centre and sub-centre.Surveillance, screening, isolation and referralThe centre has directed states to periodically conduct surveillance for influenza-like illness or severe acute respiratory infections (ILI/SARI) using accredited social health activists (ASHA) , with the help of VHSNCs. Symptomatic cases can be triaged at village level by teleconsultation with the Community Health Officer (CHO), and cases with comorbidity or low oxygen saturation will be sent to higher centres. All subcentres will run an ILI/SARI out patient department for dedicated time slots every week.Suspected Covid-19 patients will be linked for testing to the health facilities either through rapid antigen testing or by referral of samples to the nearest Covid-19 testing laboratory.Provision of Rapid Antigen Test (RAT) kits will be made at all public health facilities including sub-centres, health and wellness centres, and primary health centres, and community health officers as well as auxiliary nurse midwives will be trained in performing these tests. The suspected cases will need to be counselled to isolate themselves till test results are available.“It is important to test symptomatic cases so that positive individuals can be isolated early, and stopped from spreading the infection within the community. ILI and SARI cases need to get tested to rule out Covid-19 as symptoms can be similar,” said Dr GC Khilnani, senior pulmonologist and former head of the pulmonology department, AIIMS, Delhi.Those asymptomatic but having history of high-risk exposure to Covid-19 patients (exposure of more than 15 minutes without a mask within six-feet distance) need to be quarantined and tested as per the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) protocol.“Depending upon the intensity of the surge and number of cases, as far as feasible, contact tracing should be done as per the integrated disease surveillance programme’s guidelines.”Home and community-based isolationAbout 80-85% of the Covid-19 positive cases are mild and do not require hospitalisation; these can largely be managed at home. However, there are still conditions laid down for home isolation by the health ministry such as having a separate room and washroom for those isolating, a caretaker available 24x7, among other things that need to be strictly adhered to.“Of all the positive cases that need hospitalisation, about 5% will develop serious illness needing intensive care. The rest can be managed with oxygen therapy,” said Dr Khilnani.Each village needs to have an adequate number of pulse oximeters and thermometers, as monitoring of oxygen saturation is important for Covid-19 patients.“A system of providing pulse oximeters and thermometers on loan to families with a confirmed case of Covid should be developed through ASHA/Anganwadi workers and village-level volunteers. The pulse oximeters and thermometers should be sanitised after each use with cotton/cloth soaked in an alcohol-based sanitiser,” the guidelines say.A home Isolation kit will be provided to all such cases which should include required medicines such as paracetamol 500mg for fever, anti-parasitic ivermectin, cough syrup, multivitamins (as prescribed by the treating doctor).The government has directed peri-urban and rural areas to plan a minimum 30-bed Covid care centre that will offer care for asymptomatic cases with comorbidities or mild cases where home isolation is not feasible. Family members of a positive case also need to quarantine, and be watchful of symptoms.Human resourcesThe community health officer, auxiliary nurse midwife, or multipurpose health worker will be the nodal person for the Covid care centres from the health sector, and accredited social health activist or anganwadi worker will support them. Qualified Ayush doctors, or final year Ayush students, or final-year BSc nurses can run the care centre, according to the prescribed guidelines.Tribal Covid careTribal areas pose additional challenges and hence require additional focus. “Tribal communities are geographically and socioeconomically relatively segregated and may have poor access to health care. Strengthening community-based management through Gram Sabhas should be taken and they should be involved at every stage of planning and executing Covid-care activities,” said the guidelines, adding that there needs to be integration of Covid care with mobile medical units under the national health mission in tribal areas.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rapid-tests-for-covid-19-key-in-centre-s-rural-sop-101621203594146.html
17-05-2021||India||Bengal tiger called India on the loose in US locality captured||A tiger that frightened residents after it was last seen briefly wandering around a Houston neighborhood has been found and appears to be unharmed, police announced Saturday evening.In a short video tweeted by Houston police, Cmdr. Ron Borza can be seen sitting next to the tiger, petting the animal.“But we got him and he’s healthy,” Borza said as the wife of the man police allege is the animal’s owner sat next to him and fed the tiger with a baby bottle. The tiger was being held at BARC, the city of Houston’s animal shelter, but was expected to be taken Sunday morning to the Cleveland Amory Black Beauty Ranch, an animal sanctuary in Murchison, Texas.Authorities were searching for the tiger, a 9-month-old male named India, since it was spotted Sunday in a west Houston neighborhood. Borza said that the wife of the tiger’s alleged owner, Victor Hugo Cuevas, turned over the tiger to police on Saturday after a friend of hers reached out to officials at BARC.Police are still trying to determine where exactly the tiger was held this week and if any charges related to having the tiger will be filed. Tigers are not allowed within Houston city limits under a city ordinance unless the handler, such as a zoo, is licensed to have exotic animals.The attorney for the alleged owners has insisted that his client doesn’t own the tiger. “I am not sure it makes any difference who owns India as he does not have a birth certificate or title.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bengal-tiger-called-india-on-the-loose-in-us-locality-captured-101621202060836.html

Like many Delhi monuments, the edifice doesn’t convey the grandness of its early days. Squirrels are frolicking irreverently about the grave.Balban was one of the sultans of Delhi Sultanate that spanned five dynasties, 32 rulers and 320 years. The Sultanate’s surviving landmarks are scattered across Delhi — in Feroz Shah Kotla, Hauz Khas, Mehrauli, Hazrat Nizamuddin, Shahjahanabad, Siri Fort and Tughlaqabad — yet it’s the later Mughal-era monuments, such as Red Fort and Jama Masjid, that seem livelier.Perhaps because the Mughals are our more recent past, and the stories of their princes and poets remain fresh. The society of the Sultanate appears hazy, the lives of its greats barely familiar. Indeed, to us Delhiites, every monument unknown to us could as well be a Lodhi tomb.One of the city’s most dreamlike — but unsung Sultanate-era — ruins lies near the IIT. Bijay Mandal (see photo) is believed to be the palace of Muhammad bin Tughlaq. It sits on a rocky slope. The Tangier-born traveller Ibn Battuta, a guest of Tughlaq, described it as a hall of a thousand wooden columns supporting a carved wooden roof. All that has survived are collapsed walls, a damp stairways and a broken roof.But of course, Qutub Minar in Mehrauli is the Sultanate’s most recognisable souvenir. The problem is that it outshines everything else within its vicinity. Including a certain marble grave that is today reduced to a setting for (pre-pandemic) tourists to pose for selfies. This though is the resting place of Iltutmish, the Sultanate’s second ruler who became medieval India’s greatest feminist. He chose as his successor none of his sons, but daughter, Razia.The meeting point of modern-day lovers and power fixers, Lodhi Garden — named after the Sultanate’s last dynasty — houses, among other historic landmarks, the tomb of Sikandar Lodhi, who shifted the capital from Delhi to Agra in 1505. Sikandar Lodhi also holds the distinction of fathering the last ruler of the Sultanate. Ibrahim Lodhi was defeated and killed in a fateful battle with Babur, who heralded a new age—and a new series of Delhi monuments, starting with the Humayun’s Tomb.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhiwale-it-s-all-lodhi-to-me-101621194703249.html
17-05-2021||India||Politics heats up over arrests in posters case||Opposition parties on Sunday stepped up their attack on the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), targeting the ruling party at the Centre over police action against at least 25 people in Delhi over posters criticising the Prime Minister over sending Covid-19 vaccines abroad.While Congress MP Rahul Gandhi attached a digital version of the poster to his Twitter handle and said “arrest me too”, Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leader Durgesh Pathak also dared the Centre to arrest him, saying that the AAP pasted the posters across the city.Nearly 1,800 digitally printed posters, reading “Modiji hamare bachchon ki vaccine videsh kyon bhej diya?” (Modiji, why did you send vaccines meant for our children abroad?) were found in east Delhi’s Kalyanpuri between Wednesday and Thursday.The Delhi Police on Sunday said their probe revealed that AAP workers in south, west and east Delhi printed and pasted the posters. The police said 25 people were arrested till Saturday evening in as many cases registered at different police stations across the city under the Delhi Disaster Management Act, the Indian Penal Code and the Prevention of Defacement of Property Act.The Congress alleged attempts by the Modi government to muzzle criticism. Party spokesperson Pawan Khera said: “On behalf of lakhs of lakhs people, who died before their time, on behalf of those living in worry, tensions and sorrow, I will ask you, where is my vaccine? Why did you sell my vaccine?”, adding that these questions will be asked on behalf of the common people.The AAP said that the police have detained over 500 party workers in connection with the posters and asserted that they will make it a national campaign.“The AAP is behind these posters. I am behind the posters. If you want to arrest people, please arrest us (senior leaders) and our MLAs, but please stop harassing poor people… We will not stop. We will make it a national campaign,” said AAP leader and municipal affairs incharge Durgesh Pathak at a press conference on Sunday.In a statement on Sunday, the police said posters in east Delhi were digitally prepared by Rahul Kumar, a 26-year-old resident of Mangolpuri who runs a graphics designing shop by the name of Mamta Graphics at his house. Rahul made a digital copy of these posters as per an image received from AAP worker Arvind Gautam, a resident of Sultanpuri Majra. Gautam paid ₹9,000 for printing and pasting these posters. Rahul placed an order via email with one Rajesh Sharma, 48, owner of Addline Printing Press and a resident of Mangopuri, to get the posters printed.Delhi’s deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia on Sunday tweeted: “Who sold vaccines meant for our children to other countries for event management?”However, on being asked if his tweet was in connection with the poster matter, he did not comment.Later, referring to the image of a billboard of Modi greeting people in Toronto, Sisodia tweeted: “The government which was patting its back over vaccine posters abroad has chickened out over bills pasted on its own turf.”Senior Congress leader Jairam Ramesh said he will put up those posters in front of his official bungalow in Lodhi Estate to show solidarity with the protesters. “Putting up critical posters against PM is now a crime? Is India run by the Modi Penal Code now? Is the Delhi Police so jobless in the middle of a raging pandemic?? I am putting up posters on my compound wall tomorrow. Come get me,” he tweeted, tagging the Delhi Police and Union home minister Amit Shah.Pathak alleged that nearly 500 workers have been detained for questioning and several others from Karawal Nagar, Gonda jailed for questioning the government. “And now when people are asking the Prime Minister why vaccines meant for our children were sent abroad, the Delhi Police – that comes under the central government -- is filing FIRs and arresting our party workers.”Youth Congress president Srinivas BV, who has been running a successful Covid-19 relief programme, tweeted a photo in which he was holding a similar poster. “If Modi ji had not ‘exported’ more than 6 crores vaccine to make his image shine, how many Indians would have been alive today? how many families would have been saved from desolation? If asking these questions is a crime, then every worker of Youth Congress is ready to arrest.”The police said their probe has shown that in South Delhi, Sanjay Chaudhary, allegedly an AAP functionary, directed his party worker to print the posters. It also claimed that in west Delhi another AAP worker told people to print and paste the posters.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/politics-heats-up-over-arrests-in-posters-case-101621193469423.html

Health Minister Harsh Vardhan also did not immediately respond to a text message seeking comment.Another INSACOG member said he was not aware of any direct disagreements between Jameel and the government.A top government scientist who is part of the forum said, on the condition of anonymity, that he did not think the departure of Jameel would hamper INSACOG's monitoring of virus variants.Reuters reported earlier this month that INSACOG, the Indian SARS-CoV-2 Genetics Consortium, warned government officials in early March of a new and more contagious variant of the coronavirus taking hold in the country. The variant, B.1.617, is one of the reasons India is currently battling the world's worst surge in Covid-19 cases.Asked why the government did not respond more forcefully to the findings, for example by restricting large gatherings, Jameel had told Reuters that he was concerned that authorities were not paying enough attention to the evidence as they set policy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/top-virologist-quits-covid-19-panel-after-airing-differences-with-govt-101621192263352.html

This is the first of the many batches of Zeolite that would be imported by the Government of India to generate oxygen,” Bengaluru International Airport Limited (BIAL) said in a statement on Sunday.The component is being imported for the use of the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO).Zeolite is used in oxygen production plants that are based on pressure swing absorption technology to help mitigate the acute shortage and growing demand for oxygen in India, according to a PTI report.The agency reported that seven chartered flights have been scheduled between May 15 to 18 from Rome to Bangalore followed by eight flights from Korea.Karnataka, one of the worst Covid-19 impacted states in the country, has also seen its oxygen supplies dip, leading to shortages in hospitals and resulting in deaths.It is depended on the Centre and other states to make up for its oxygen requirements. The state has also procured oxygen from other countries including Kuwait and Bahrain.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/34200-kg-raw-material-to-produce-oxygen-arrives-in-bengaluru-101621192627663.html
17-05-2021||India||B’luru records a sharp dip in cases with 8k fresh infections||Bengaluru: The city on Sunday witnessed a sharp decline in its daily Covid-19 infections, recording 8,344 cases in the last 24 hours.Though Bengaluru has seen a decline in daily case count for almost a week now, the numbers released on Sunday show the sharpest decline in over a month. The current positivity rate is around 36.89%, according to the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP, the city’s civic body)Bengaluru had first breached the five-figure mark on April 17 and since then has witnessed a surge in infections, making it as the most impacted region in the country.However, despite the dip, the city continues to see a high fatality rate as 143 more patients succumbed to the virus, according to the daily bulletin of the state health department.Authorities in the IT capital are not letting its guard down this time. The Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) on Sunday said that it has set up 32 triage centres in eight zones of the city.“At the Physical Triage Centres (PTC) a team of doctors will be working 24 hours to provide immediate medical attention to Covid-infected people. PTCs have oxygenated beds and are equipped with all primary health care facilities. Patients with low symptoms are also treated and stabilisation care is provided to patients. 3 doctors and 3 nurses will be working at the Triage Centre 24 hours a day. Pulse oxymeter, thermal scan, necessary drugs will be stocked to monitor the health status of the infected. The patients are also provided with medical kits on the spot,” the BBMP said in a statement on Sunday.The BBMP said that 283 Covid-19 patients were triaged until Saturday and 260 patients have been triaged in 26 centres till 6 am on Sunday.“A total of 991 people, including those admitted through Central Hospital Bed Management System and those who come directly, are receiving treatment. 1,495 beds are available for treatment,” the BBMP said.Officials and experts had earlier predicted that the curve in Bengaluru was likely to flatten by the end of May.However, despite the dip in cases, Bengaluru continues to remain the worst affected city in the country and Karnataka, the most impacted.Karnataka breached the 600,000 active caseload mark on Saturday after it recorded 31,531 new infections with a positivity rate of 27.84%. In all there were 403 fatalities while double-digit deaths were recorded in Ballari, Hassan, Haveri, Koppal, Mandya, Shivamogga, Tumakuru and Kalauburagi, according to government data.Covid cases in other districts like Tumakuru, Chitradurga, Chikmagaluru among other places have also seen a sharp spike.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bluru-records-a-sharp-dip-in-cases-with-8k-fresh-infections-101621192510058.html
17-05-2021||India||4 dead as Cyclone Tauktae hits K’taka||According to a statement by disaster management authorities, the cyclone is likely to intensify over the next 24 hours and also likely to move north-northwestwards and reach Gujarat coast in the evening hours of 17th & cross Gujarat coast between Porbandar & Mahuva (Bhavnagar district) around May 18 early morning.Of the four deaths reported so far, one each are from Uttara Kannada, Udupi, Chikkamagaluru and Shivamogga, officials said.Around three persons are missing and nine more are stuck on tug boats.According to New Mangaluru Port Trust and Mangalore Refinery and Petrochemicals Limited (MRPL) , the tug boats--Alliance and Coromandel--were supposed to return on the night of May 14. Out of the eight people on the Tug Alliance, three have reached the shore and are undergoing treatment in a hospital in Udupi, according to disaster management authorities. On Saturday and Sunday, two bodies were recovered while three are missing, the authorities said. In Tug Coromandel, nine people are stuck on the boat as the rescue operations have been hampered due to heavy winds.The authorities are trying to determine why these tug boats did not return to shore despite warnings on May 13 and have sought a report from New Mangaluru Port Trust and MRPL.A Naval chopper from Goa is likely to take part in rescue operations, according to disaster management authorities. The cyclone has caused widespread damage across Karnataka and Kerala.According to the preliminary loss, damage and relief measures, as of 5 pm on Sunday, there were at least four deaths due to the cyclone and 216 homes were damaged. Around 98 villages in 20 talukas or administrative units, have been damaged. Among the 98 villages affected, a maximum of 31 are from Uttara Kannada district. According to the state disaster management authority, around 491 electric poles, 27 transformers and around 3,000 lines have been damaged.The state disaster management said that 516 persons have so far been evacuated and 253 of them are in the 10 relief camps.“The rainfall is accompanied by gale wind speed reaching 70 to 80 km/hour, gusting at times up to 90 km/per along and off [the] Karnataka Coast,” the state government’s disaster management team said in a statement.The impact of the cyclone is being felt across at least six districts of Karnataka which include Udupi, Dakshina Kannada, Uttara Kannada, Shivamogga, Chikmagalur and Kodagu in the last 24 hours, according to official updates.The highest rainfall in the last 24 hours was recorded at Nada Station in Kundapura taluk in Udupi district, about 400 kms from Bengaluru. Around 15 stations across the state received over 200 mm of rainfall, said officials.Chief minister B S Yediyurappa on Sunday asked in-charge ministers of coastal districts and deputy commissioners (DCs) there to visit affected areas and carry out rescue and relief works.The chief minister’s office said on Sunday that he took stock of the situation after speaking with district authorities. “The CM has instructed that whatever emergency assistance is required from the government, they (district administration) can get in touch with the ministers in-charge or call him directly,” the statement from the CM’s office added.According to a tweet in the evening by the CMO, the chief minister once again spoke to three DCs and the Chief Secretary in the evening and directed the Dakshina Kannada DC to take necessary measures to rescue the crew of a tug boat that is caught in the sea.He also directed the chief secretary to stay in touch with the Centre for the rescue of crew, and make all the necessary arrangements, including chopper if required.Cyclone Tauktae will hit the coastal areas of Goa by late afternoon as it is very likely to keep moving in the north northwest direction, said the India Meteorological DepartmentIt is very likely to move north-north westwards and reach Gujarat coast in the evening hours of May 17 and cross Gujarat coast between Porbandar and Mahuva (Bhavnagar district) around May 18 early morning, the IMD said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/4-dead-as-cyclone-tauktae-hits-ktaka-101621192447576.html
17-05-2021||India||K’taka govt draws plan to tackle Covid spike in rural areas||The Karnataka government on Sunday proposed to do away with home isolation of asymptomatic Covid-19 persons and house them in Covid-19 care centres in all districts, as rural areas witness a shape spike in Covid-19 cases. The strategy helped the state government tackle the pandemic, albeit temporarily, last year.“Suppose the cases are very less here (Bengaluru), we can move our oxygen concentrators to other districts. Whatever can be moved will be moved. If the bed situation (shortage) happens, then we have to shift patients only,” the official said, requesting not to be named. However, the official clarified that this was only a theoretical suggestion as the infrastructure in these rural areas were being strengthened.There were 963 new infections in Chikmagaluru, 453 in Gadag, 617 in Koppal, 464 in Raichur, 643 in Shivamogga, according to the bulletin on Sunday.A senior government official said that any resources that can be moved will be moved to these districts from Bengaluru. The move comes as part of the state government’s preparation for the shift of the surge towards rural areas, where healthcare infrastructure is far more inadequate when compared to Bengaluru. This would mean creating additional infrastructure in a state which is centered around its capital with most of its income and expenditure on Bengaluru, leaving little for the other districts.“From 1,970 oxygenated beds, we have increased it to 24,000 oxygenated beds across the state. Half the beds in taluka hospitals are oxygenated and in three months time all these units will have oxygen generation units,” the first official mentioned above added.“Already we have established 15 Covid-19 care centres with 1200 beds. The capacity can be increased to around 1800. We are trying to shift people from home isolation including those who are not complying with the provision,” said MR Ravi, the deputy commissioner for Chamarajanagar district, about 175 kms from Bengaluru. Apart from the 24 people who died on May 2, another 62 patients died at the hospital between May 4 and May 10 – at least 36 of whom were admitted at the hospital on May 2 night, when the oxygen supply was disrupted for several hours, Hindustan Times reported on Saturday.Basavaraj Bommai, Karnataka’s minister for home, law and parliamentary affairs too has converted his home in Shiggaon, Haveri district as a 50-bed Covid-19 care centre to help increase capacities in the backward district. The district recorded 184 cases on Sunday.Karnataka continues to grapple with supplies of oxygen, life-saving medication, hospital beds and even space in crematoriums,However, the situation in Bengaluru is still grim and shifting of resources at the moment may appear bleak since it continues to record an average of around 15,000 cases per day, which may be lower than its own peak, but still far higher than all the other districts of the state put together.Bengaluru has seen a sharp decline in cases over the last week or so as it reported 8,344 new infections, giving some signs of letting up after being firmly in the grip of the pandemic since the beginning of March this year. The city’s positivity rate had nearly touched 40% between April 30 and May 6, according to data from the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP, the city’s civic body). Officials said that places like Bidar, Kalaburagi and Mysuru among others will also see a decline as they peaked earlier. Bengaluru accounted for 143 fatalities n 24 hours on Sunday, while all other districts have seen a rise in deaths, data shows, indicating how the Covid-19’s second wave was claiming more lives, largely due to inadequate healthcare and crumbling infrastructure. With 600147 active cases on Sunday, Karnataka has highest case load in the country, according to data.Karnataka recorded 31, 531 new infections in the 24 hours on Saturday with a positivity rate of 27.84%. The state recorded 403 fatalities, according to the daily bulletin of the state health department.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ktaka-govt-draws-plan-to-tackle-covid-spike-in-rural-areas-101621192327660.html
17-05-2021||India||Covid-19: What you need to know today||We are not talking enough about variants — at least not enough of the right kind of talk.Sure, the government was perturbed enough by repeated references to the B.1.617.1 and .2 mutations of the SARS-Cov-2 virus as the Indian variants (everyone, including various government departments had no problems with referring to a prior mutation as the UK variant) to put out a statement that effectively beseeched everyone not to refer to them as such. But no one knows for sure whether these variants are responsible for the surging second wave of the coronavirus disease that India saw through March and April because there hasn’t been adequate sequencing of the viral genome. More aggressive sequencing, especially in hotspots such as Delhi and Bengaluru could have shed light on this, and added to our understanding of the current trajectory of the pandemic in India — vital in managing both the present and the future.In the absence of this, what we do have are uploads from India to the GISAID database. There’s no way of knowing whether this is a representative sample, but B.1.617.2 accounted for 46% of sequences from India uploaded to the database between March 1 and April 30; and B.1.617.1 another 19%. That means two of three of the genomes uploaded on the database were of the variants. It stands to reason that they have become the dominant strains of the virus in India.It isn’t clear how this data can be compared with that mentioned by the head of India’s National Centre for Disease Control who said recently that genome sequencing data from INSACOG (the Indian SARS-CoV-2 Genomic Consortia; a grouping of 10 laboratories) showed that of the 18,053 samples sequenced since December, 3,532 were so-called variants of concern.Adding to what we know is yet-to-be-peer-reviewed research by scientists from India and the UK, including those at INSACOG, the COG-UK consortium, NCDC, Cambridge University and the CSIR Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology. The research notes that of 33 infections of vaccinated healthcare workers in a hospital, the majority were of B.1.617.2, although none of these was a severe infection. Importantly, and this aspect merits repetition and highlighting, the authors argue that the family of B.1.617 variants may have “a modest ability” to be resistant to antibodies caused by infections of the original virus Wuhan-1 D614G. Their hypothesis is that 20-50% of the Indian population (based on various sero- or antibody-surveys) was infected with that original strain and had antibodies, but that because the new variants were resistant to these antibodies, this may have “likely contributed to an epidemic wave” in the country.That the emergence of these variants coincided with the complete easing of restrictions on movement and activities across India, a collective lowering of the guard, and several super-spreader events did not help. Nor did the country’s slow pace of vaccination. To date, just around 140 million Indians have received at least one dose of the vaccine. That translates into 15% of the eligible population.The researchers also point out that while the variants were resistant to antibodies (created either naturally or through vaccination) to some extent, the “progression to severe disease and deaths” was low in the case of anyone with any prior protection. They conclude that “extensive vaccination will likely protect against moderate to severe disease and will reduce transmission.”Interestingly, although there is no data to bear this out, some experts are of the opinion that maintaining the gap between the first shot and the second (or booster) shot of the Astra/Zeneca-Oxford vaccine (sold as Covishield in India) to eight weeks could help combat the variants. The UK, which initially increased the gap to 12 weeks based on research that showed the vaccine’s efficacy increasing after that period (Spain has extended it to 16 weeks based on the same logic), has now reduced the gap to 8 weeks to manage a mini-surge in infections caused by the variants. Interestingly, the UK decision came around the same time as India’s to increase the gap to between 12 and 16 weeks (from the previous 6-8 weeks). Then, India’s challenge, given the supply-crunch in vaccines is to vaccinate as many people as possible and increasing the gap between doses of the most widely used vaccine in the country is a good way to do that.In the UK, 69% of those eligible for vaccines have received at least one shot and 38%, both.In India, 15% have received at least one dose and 4.4%, both.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid19-what-you-need-to-know-101621191539832.html

The interaction with Goyal also took place, he said.“There is hope that the Centre will soon increase the oxygen allocation to the state,” Gehlot tweeted.Baghel, on the other hand, not only asked for more vaccines but also asked the Prime Minister to allow oxygen to be used for industrial purposes after all medical needs are met.“The availability of oxygen is sufficient and accordingly after providing 80 percent oxygen to the hospitals, the remaining 20 percent oxygen can be provided to the industries, so that such units can start their activities,” he told Modi.Modi also spoke to Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath who informed the Prime Minister that the positivity rate in his state was declining and that the recovery rate was on the rise.UP government officials said Adityanath also briefed the Prime Minister on the vaccination drive in the state. The state, the chief minister told Modi, was already vaccinating people above the age of 18 in 18 districts and five more are set to be added to the list. Adityanath also spoke about how his state has been conducting an oxygen audit, a government official said.“Covid management is progressing well in UP under the guidance of Prime Minister,” Adityanath tweeted after the meeting.The Prime Minister also spoke to the newly-elected Puducherry chief minister N Rangaswamy and discussed the Covid-19 situation in the Union Territory.Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh and Uttar Pradesh are among the ten states that cumulatively account for 74.69 per cent of India’s total active cases, according to the Union Health Ministry.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/oxygen-vaccine-shortage-key-topics-in-modi-s-covid-meet-with-cms-101621191547583.html
17-05-2021||India||Tirumala temple stays open amid Covid-19 curbs||The YS Jagan Mohan Reddy government in Andhra Pradesh has imposed a partial lockdown for 18 hours a day to prevent the spread of coronavirus in the state, but the Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams which manages the famous temple of Lord Venkateshwara at Tirumala in Chittoor district, continues to remain open for pilgrims.Though TTD suspended “Sarva Darshanam” (free darshan of the deity) for pilgrims with effect from April 12 in view of the surge in Covid-19 cases, it has been allowing darshan for pilgrims who purchase “special darshan tickets” for ₹300 apiece.Last year, TTD, for the first time ever, shut down the Tirumala temple for pilgrims due to outbreak of Covid-19. The shutdown of the temple which began on March 19, 2020, continued up to June 8. The daily rituals for the presiding deity, however, continued with a limited number of priests. The temple reopened for pilgrims on June 9.From June last year, TTD restricted the number of pilgrims visiting the temple for free darshan because of stringent Covid-19 restrictions. Initially, it used to issue only 3,000-4,000 Sarva Darshanam tokens every day, as against the average footfall of 65,000-70,000 pilgrims a day before the pandemic .Gradually, it increased the number of tokens to 22,000 during weekdays and around 25,000 during the weekends in March this year, but then, the second wave struck. “In April, when the second wave of Covid-19 struck the state, the number of tokens was restricted to an average of 15,000-20,000 a day,” a TTD spokesman said on condition of anonymity.Despite the severity of the second wave of Covid-19, TTD, for its own reasons, did not close down the temple , notwithstanding the partial lockdown being implemented by the state government, which also suspended bus services to Tirumala.“Last year, there was a nationwide lockdown and the state, too, had to follow it strictly. Hence, the temple was forced to close down. This time, there are no such restrictions. The state government, too, has not issued any guidelines on the closure of temples in the state,” the TTD spokesman said.He said only those pilgrims who were coming to Tirumala in their own vehicles were being allowed for darshan. “Moreover, we have been following stringent Covid-19 rules, including the mandatory negative RT-PCR report, wearing of masks and maintenance of social distance. There have been no cases of Covid-19 in pilgrims on Tirumala,” the spokesman said.However, the fear of Covid-19 and strict enforcement of lockdown rules by the police in the last one week led to the drastic fall in the number of pilgrims many of whom had booked their special darshan tickets online well in advance.According to TTD authorities, only 71,000 pilgrims had a darshan of Lord Venkateshwara between May 1 and 12. This is just a day’s footfall from the pre-pandemic period. “On Wednesday, only 2,262 pilgrims visited the temple, the lowest footfall of in the history of Tirumala,” the TTD spokesman said.TTD announced that those who had booked special darshan tickets but could not visit Tirumala due to pandemic between April 11 and May 31, can change their darshan date to anytime within the next year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tirumala-temple-stays-open-amid-curbs-101621191487518.html

With Covid cases and deaths surging in the state, the 52-year-old, who was the health minister in the previous Sarbananda Sonowal government, has assumed office at a crucial time. Since taking oath, Sarma has been busy boosting the health sector and taking stringent measures to control the spread of the pandemic. In an interview with HT, he talks in detail about the crisis, the state’s finances, the NRC and other issues that the new government faces. Edited excerpts:Q: You have mentioned that Covid is the biggest challenge facing the new government and have initiated some measures to control the pandemic. What is your assessment of the situation in Assam now and where is the state headed?A: The second wave of Covid is more infectious and lethal. Therefore, we need to be more proactive and sincere in our efforts. We have imposed curfew from 12pm to 5am in urban areas and micro-containment zones have been started. There won’t be home isolation for those above 50 who don’t have facilities for management of the disease in their houses. There’s special emphasis on care of patients during holidays and at night, in hospitals. We have ensured oxygen supply is not compromised, started setting up new ICU units and kept adequate stock of life-saving medicines. Within the last week since our government was formed, we have noticed some slowdown in Covid cases. In Kamrup (Metropolitan), cases have come down from 1,600 daily to around 1,000. Though nothing can be said conclusively, we may witness some kind of stabilisation in the coming days. We will work harder and give our best.Q: Most states have announced a lockdown. Why has Assam decided against it till now? And why are 200 of the 1,000 ventilators given to the state under the PM Cares initiative not used till now?A: We haven’t imposed a total lockdown as we are also concerned about the livelihoods of people. We are trying to create a mid-way between economic activity and Covid control. If that process fails and Covid cases continue to rise, we might have to consider a total lockdown. Regarding the ventilators, we got them at a time when the state had very few daily Covid cases. Since now we are expanding our Covid facilities, we will be utilising all the ventilators from the PM Cares initiative in the next 10-15 days.Q: The status of Assam’s financial health is a cause of concern. You had mentioned in your budget speech that in the previous financial year, there was poor growth in the first two quarters due to Covid. We are faced with a similar situation now. How do you think it will affect Assam?A: The initial period of the last year was difficult, but in the last quarter we recorded 14% growth in revenue collection. We spent ₹82,000 crore of our budget last year, which was the highest expenditure of allocation achieved till now. This year, we are of the opinion that we will be able to contain Covid and maintain our growth story. As of now, our cash flow is stable, and we are getting support from the Centre. I am confident we will be able to tide over any situation.Q: As you had handled both health and finance portfolios in the previous government, most people in Assam assumed you would keep them with yourself this time as well. But you chose to give them to others. Why?A: I have handled many portfolios in the state since 2001. My own opinion is that chief ministers should have few ministries so that my time can be distributed in supervising and anchoring various schemes of all departments. I have consciously decided that I will devote my time and energy in all departments equally and that’s why I have decided to leave finance and health ministries. I have handed the health ministry to cabinet colleague Keshab Mahanta, but I am taking full interest on all health issues during the pandemic. The finance ministry has been given to Ajanta Neog. She was in the Tarun Gogoi cabinet for almost 15 years and is an experienced minister. I have my confidence that she will be able to do justice to her new role. We already have a robust system in both these ministries, and it shouldn’t be tough for both ministers to handle them.Q: You have mentioned that you will be seeking re-verification of the National Register of Citizens (NRC). How do you plan to take it forward?A: The state coordinator for the NRC has already filed an application in Supreme Court seeking re-verification of the list as it has glaring anomalies. We will wait for the SC to examine our request. If we get the order in our favour, we will revisit the NRC and if it SC decides against our request, we have to agree with the original document.Q: The issue of granting scheduled tribe (ST) status to six communities is pending. You have indicated that there are some leads in this issue. What are they and how do you plan to execute them?A: In the previous government, I headed a committee to prepare modalities for enlisting the six communities is ST. The Bill in this regard is pending in Rajya Sabha. Earlier, we were able to bring both sets of communities, those who are already enjoying ST status and the six others that are seeking the same, to the discussion table. We were able to arrive at consensus on some points. We need to ensure that while granting ST status to the six communities, the rights and privileges of those who are already ST are not compromised. We need a fine balancing act. There will be more discussions on this, and we are confident of a positive outcome.Q: Since you assumed charge of the home department, we have already witnessed transfers of many senior police officers. Can we expect a similar move in the bureaucracy?A: We have issued an order on Sunday for transfers of some senior district-level officers. The idea is to create a team for the next five years, which will be able to execute the new government’s initiatives efficiently.Q: You took oath with 13 others ministers. But there are some ministries that are yet to be allocated and 4-5 other ministers who can be accommodated in your cabinet. When can we expect a cabinet expansion?A: We will be expanding the ministry, but that’s not going to happen before the budget session, which will be in July.Q: As the new chief minister, what would be your appeal and assurance to the state’s residents in this time of crisis?A: I would like to tell the people that we are seeing some positive signs in the past one week and noticed that the spread of the virus has been arrested, at least temporarily. If we maintain discipline and continue with Covid-appropriate behaviour, Assam will be able to defeat the pandemic like we did during the first wave. My request to the people would be that sometimes we might need to take some harsh decisions, but these are needed for the good of the entire society. I urge them to cooperate.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/may-consider-lockdown-if-covid-cases-continue-to-rise-himanta-101621191488092.html
17-05-2021||India||Prevent immersion of bodies in rivers: Centre||Following reports of scores of dead bodies found floating on Ganga and its tributaries in wake of the second coronavirus pandemic wave, the Centre has directed states to prevent dumping of bodies in the river and focus on their safe disposal, and ordered the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) to carry out an overall monitoring and surveillance of water quality.“Namami Gange directs states to prevent dumping of dead bodies in the Ganga and focus on their safe disposal and providing support for ensuring dignified cremation,” the Jal Shakti Ministry said in a statement issued on Sunday.Over the past week, nearly 800 bodies have been fished out of the Ganga in Uttar Pradesh’s Ghazipur and Ballia districts, and Bihar’s Buxar district. Local administration suspect the bodies could belong to Covid patients but testing is difficult because the corpses are decomposedOn Saturday, officials from the Jal Shakti ministry; the National Mission for Clean Ganga; Central Pollution Control Board held a review meeting with the representatives of Uttar Pradesh and Bihar governments where it was decided that state pollution control boards will be roped in to keep a check on the river water quality while the CPCB will monitor the overall surveillance. States have also been urged to prevent sand burials along the river.“We may approach appropriate laboratories for water sampling like the national institute of virology (NIV) to understand what are the chances of the viral infection spreading through water. Other parameters will also be studied,” said a senior official from Central Pollution Control Board on condition of anonymity.“The situation is being followed up with several districts like Unnao, Kanpur rural, Ghazipur, Balia and Buxar, Saran in Bihar. However, some cases have also been reported from other districts. The state missions should follow up action taken with all districts,” said Rajiv Ranjan Mishra, Director General, National Mission for Clean Ganga, who was present at the meeting.Officials representing the Uttar Pradesh government -- Rajnish Dubey, Addl Chief Secretary, Urban Development and Anurag Shrivastava, Principal Secretary, Jal Shakti, UP and Project Director, State Ganga Mission said that district magistrates have intensified patrolling at the ghats to prevent dumping of dead bodies in Ganga. Around 13 additional crematoria, under Namami Gange, have been made available for cremations and the government is ensuring financial support to the needy for safe cremation as per Covid-19 protocol, an official added. The state Panchayati Raj Department has also announced financial support of ₹5000 for cremations in rural areas.Anand Kishore, Principal Secretary, Urban Development and Project Director, State Ganga Mission said that the state government will bear the cost of cremations and burials of Covid-19 patients. Patrolling has also been intensified in Buxar and Saran (Chhapra) areas, an official added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/prevent-immersion-of-bodies-in-rivers-centre-101621191427625.html
17-05-2021||India||Covid-19 case trajectory shows second wave is ebbing||While the second wave of the Covid-19 outbreak continued to burden India’s health care system, with the total number of confirmed infections in the country closing in on 25 million on Sunday, the trajectory of new infections for the entire country appeared to show signs of receding from a peak over the past week, according to data.For the first time since the start of the second wave, the number of active cases in the country began inching down – a crucial development as the onslaught of the second wave was marked by a soaring number of active cases, which resulted in shortages of vital supplies such as medical oxygen, life-saving drugs, hospital beds and ambulance services.A total of 281,911 new cases were reported on Sunday, the lowest in 27 days, taking the total number of infections in the country since the start of the outbreak to 24,964,718, according to HT’s Covid-19 dashboard.In the past week, there have been 328,947 new infections every day across the country on average; a week ago, this number was 391,819, the highest ever recorded and what appeared to be the peak of the second wave. This means that the rate of new infections reduced by 16% in the past seven days – the first time such a significant contraction of the outbreak has been reported in the country since February. At its peak, the week-on-week change in seven-day average of new infections was rising at more than 70% for the week ending April 11.The seven-day average of new cases, which denotes the country’s Covid-19 case curve, has now fallen for seven straight days for the first time since early February, underlining what appeared to be a clear reversal of trend and not just a few days of dropping cases. And this trend has taken place without daily tests going down – the seven-day average of samples tested has gone up 3.6% from last Sunday.Also Read | Delhi, Punjab looking forward to Sputnik V amid Covid-19 vaccine shortageThese findings were echoed in the epidemiological estimates by the University of Michigan’s Centre for Precision Health Data Science, which showed that India’s overall effective reproduction number (Rt) has dropped to 0.90. An Rt of more than 1 means an outbreak is expanding in a region, while that below 1 denotes a contraction.Delhi has seen the largest drop in the rate of new infections in the past week – the seven-day average of daily cases dropped 45% in the last week, from 18,374 to 10,043. In other words, cases in Delhi dropped more than three times the national average.In Uttar Pradesh, the seven-day average of new cases went down 39% in the last week, while this number dropped 36% in Chhattisgarh and Bihar, and 32% in Telangana. These were followed by Jharkhand (30% drop in average daily cases), Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra (27% and 25% contraction).On May 12, HT reported that at least six regions in the country – Delhi, Maharashtra, Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh, Telangana and Uttar Pradesh – had started reporting a steady drop in infections in the past few weeks, with another three – Bihar, Gujarat and Jharkhand – exhibiting early signs of a plateau.This trend, however, is not uniform across the country. While new infections are dropping in a majority of the country, a handful of regions, particularly in the country’s south, east and northeast, continue to defy the larger trend. The seven-day average of cases is still increasing through northeast the most – in Tripura, the number has risen the most in the country (65%), followed by 58% in Meghalaya and 37% in Manipur.States that held elections over the last two months are among the regions that are outliers. Tamil Nadu, for instance, is the state with the fastest rising outbreaks among India’s most populous regions – the seven-day average of new infections went up 26% in the past month (from 24735 new cases a day a week ago to 31137 for the week ending this Sunday). In Puducherry, the rate of new cases has gone up 24%, while it has gone up 9% in Assam and 8% in West Bengal in the past week. Kerala is the only state with recent elections where the outbreak has shrunk – though it has done so marginally, with a 3% drop in new infections.An analysis by HT on May 3 showed that in the four states and one Union territory that went to the polls, Covid-19 cases started rising much later than the rest of the country, but a steeper curve in these regions pushed them ahead in terms of new cases per capita.The number of active cases, meanwhile, has also starting decreasing – albeit slowly. Till last Sunday (May 9), there were a total of 3,750,895 active cases in the country, the highest this number has ever touched. However, since then, with cases dropping and recoveries picking up pace, the number of active cases has also started slowly inching down. As of Sunday night, the number of active cases in the country dropped to 3,522,840. On Sunday, active cases reduced by over 100,000, according to HT’s Covid-19 dashboard.Tracking the number of active cases – those still under treatment – in any region is crucial because these have a direct bearing on the pressure that the health care system is facing. Currently, there are still more than 3.5 times as many active cases in the country than there were during the peak of the first wave of the outbreak. This has caused massive shortages of supplies vital for the fight against the disease.While regions such as Delhi and Maharashtra appear to have seen off the worst of these shortages (with active cases dropping recently), other regions such as Tamil Nadu, West Bengal, Assam, Karnataka and the northeast states (where cases are still rising) now face the danger of such shortages in the near future.Experts said that while it is a good sign that cases are dropping across the country, they said it was too early to say they will remain down. “Some of the states that are yet to peak right now are among the most populous regions in the country. Add to that, despite our strides in testing infrastructure, we still don’t have a very clear idea of what is happening in rural parts of the country... In a situation like this, if cases are rising there, or dropping, we still don’t have a clear picture. A clear picture can only be established when we have true data, both in terms of cases and deaths, from these regions,” said Dr Lalit Kant, former head of epidemiology at the Indian Council of Medical Research.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid19-case-trajectory-shows-second-wave-is-ebbing-101621191044477.html
17-05-2021||India||500 nurses from Kerala duped, stranded in UAE||At least 500 nurses from Kerala who were promised high salary and other perks are stranded in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) after being allegedly duped by recruiting agents. Some stranded nurses have written to chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan. However, his office said it had not received any such complaint.One of them, Reen Rajan (30), said she applied for the job after she came across an advertisement in leading newspapers that UAE was recruiting nurses on urgent basis in view of the pandemic situation and Keralites will be given preference. “I had to cough up ₹2.30 lakh to the agent and later she was granted a visiting visa,” said Rajan, who spoke over the phone to HT. She said, the agent told her that work visa will be granted once they reach UAE. We are herded in dingy rooms for about a month. Some of them have returned after they came to know they were cheated. We were recruited by a Kochi-based agency ‘Take Off ’ two months back. Now these agents are saying we can work in care homes and massage parlours,” said Rajan, who quit her job with a private hospital in Kollam to take up the new assignment.She said that she sent a letter to chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan narrating her plight and also took up the issue with MLA K B Ganesh Kumar. When contacted, the CM’s office said they are yet to know about their complaint. Police are yet to register a complaint.Her brother Rijo Rajan, who is working in Kollam said, after he came to know about his sister’s plight he made inquiries about the agency and came to know that its proprietor Fizroze Khan was allegedly involved in another case of cheating and was in jail for some time. He said after his release he closed his agency “Keydot” and started a new one “Take Off” to cheat gullible aspirants. Most of the stranded said they paid between ₹2-4 lakh to get the visa.“Some of us have taken a loan to pay up. They know our precarious financial situation and so they are forcing us to do odd jobs. We were promised ₹1 lakh pay package and accommodation and they showed us some videos of nurses recruited by them. We were asked not to disclose it to anyone as recruitment of nurses was only permitted through government- approved agencies,” said another stranded nurse Susan Saji.Some of them said they applied after they were told that there were enough vacancies as hospitals need nurses urgently due to the pandemic situation.To contain the exploitation of such job aspirants, earlier, both union and state governments had constituted special bodies to recruit nurses. In Kerala, nurses are recruited through the Overseas Development and Employment Promotion Consultants Ltd and Non-Residents Keralites Affairs. Despite such approved agencies many approach such dubious agents and get cheated.Last year, Kerala police had busted a gang that recruited models for middle-east countries and later forced them to become escorts and gold carriers. Once they land up in foreign countries, these gang members seize their passport and other documents and they are forced to toe their diktats.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/500-nurses-from-kerala-duped-stranded-in-uae-101621191368903.html
17-05-2021||India||Delhi, Goa have most Covid deaths per 100k: Govt data||Delhi and Goa have the highest Covid deaths per one lakh population (DPL) in the country whereas Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and Odisha have lower rates, government data shows.These inferences are based on the health ministry’s Covid and vaccination data for May 15 and population projections for 2021 by the Census Commissioner of India and come at the time when some state governments are being accused of hiding actual death figures.“One thing clear from the data analysis is that some states such as Gujarat and Uttar Pradesh are hiding death numbers in a big way,” said James Wilson, a data analyst and member of the advisory committee of the Kerala Electricity Board, who has been analysing the health ministry’s Covid data for the past year.“There cannot be such a huge variation in death numbers unless some states are not transparent about reporting Covid deaths.”According to health ministry data, Goa has the highest death rate per one lakh population of 131.88 with 2,056 deaths reported. About one-fourth of these deaths took place during the second Covid wave that started in March 2020. On Goa’s high death per population rate, chief minister Pramod Sawant said it was on account of the state’s “complete transparency” in testing and death records.”In Goa we make sure that every Covid death is counted. Even if a person dies without being tested we conduct his test post-mortem and if he is Covid positive we include that in the figures,” he said.After Goa, Delhi has second highest DPL of 101 followed by Uttarakhand’s 40.57. Delhi government officials did not comment on the findings despite repeated requests for a response. Uttarakhand chief secretary Om Prakash said the state was transparent in reporting Covid cases and deaths even though several deaths of outsiders during the Mahakumbh were recorded in the state figures.Gujarat, which has been repeatedly accused of hiding Covid deaths, has a much lower DPL of 12.95. Divya Bhaskar, a Gujarati daily newspaper, had on Friday reported that the state government issued 1.21 lakh death certificates between March 1 and May 10 this year, 61,000 more than in the same period last year. Although the Gujarat government did not deny the figures, junior home minister Pratapsinh Jadeja said it was “mischievous” to corelate death certificates with Covid and accused the newspaper of trying to create a sensation.Gujarat’s neighbouring state of Maharashtra, which reported high Covid cases since March, had a DPL of almost 70, the highest among large population states. Karnataka has a DPL of 32, Chhattisgarh 39.30, Punjab 38.54, Andhra Pradesh 17.56 and Tamil Nadu 22.72. On the lower side are Bihar with 3.04, Telangana with 7.46 and Odisha with 5.21. However, Bihar’s neighbouring state Jharkhand’s figure is 11.52 and West Bengal’s 13.39.Uttar Pradesh has a DPL of 7.47, with 4,623 total Covid deaths reported so far, even as there have been reports of over 800 dead bodies found buried on the banks of the Ganga river in Kanpur, Gazipur and Unnao districts. The UP government has refuted the charge of hiding data, saying Covid deaths were being reported as per the Indian Council for Medical Research (ICMR) guidelines that prohibit recording of Covid deaths of people with co-morbidities. “We are strictly following ICMR guidelines and the data shows how effective our Covid management was,” said a UP government official.Madhya Pradesh, where burials and cremations as per Covid protocols in major cities such as Indore, Bhopal and Jabalpur were almost double of the Covid deaths reported, had a DPL of 8.18 with 6,913 total deaths reported. In Bhopal, close to 1,400 people were cremated with Covid protocols since April 1 even as official Covid deaths were only 425, said Bhopal-based social activist Seema Kurup, claiming the situation was similar in Indore and Jabalpur. State health minister Prabhuram Chaudhary said, “We did a door-to-door survey to identify Covid positive cases and our timely action is the main reason behind low death rate.”However, a recent report by the Seattle-based Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) at the University of Washington in Seattle estimated that actual Covid deaths in India as of May 6 may be 0.654 million (6.54 lakh), almost three times of the official count of 0.221 million (2.21 lakh). The IHME, which comes out with an annual Global Burden of Disease study, has been using an updated methodology to project Covid deaths in various countries in the world. Using the methodology to assess “excess deaths” , the IHME estimates that nearly seven million people have died worldwide as direct victims of the virus. This is about double the number of casualties reported on the basis of official or verifiable sources.Civil society experts have accused states of underreporting deaths, especially from Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Telangana and Gujarat. “There is a huge possibility of underreporting of Covid deaths, especially from rural areas, where there are not enough facilities for RTPCR tests. When RTPCR is not needed for admission in a Covid ward, how it could be a requirement for recording deaths. Any cremation or burial with Covid protocol should be considered a Covid death. This would provide realistic Covid death figures,” said Karnal-based civil rights activist Ramji Lal.(With inputs from state bureaus)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhi-goa-have-most-covid-deaths-per-100k-govt-data-101621191368300.html
17-05-2021||India||Covid-19 vaccination drive moves at a slow pace in populous states||Less than 2% of Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Bihar and Jharkhand’s population -- the states account for one-third of the country’s people -- has been fully vaccinated, even as several smaller states such as Tripura, Sikkim and Arunachal Pradesh have done much better, health ministry data shows.According to the health ministry, 2.5 % of India’s people have got both doses of vaccination while 9.3% have got a single jab as of May 16, 121 days after the drive started on January 16.Till May 16, the health ministry’s data showed, 98.8 million people have got a single dose and 41.7 million both doses of the Covid vaccine.“This data shows the enormous task ahead for us is to completely vaccinate 97% of the remaining population. We still need 2.4 billion doses to vaccinate the unvaccinated,” said Jamesh Wilson, a Kerala-based independent researcher, who juxtaposed the vaccination data with projected population figures for states for the year 2021.Also Read | Covid-19 vaccine: How Centre is scaling up Covaxin productionSeveral state governments had slowed down vaccination since the last week of April due to short supply of vaccines from the two Indian manufacturers – Serum Institute of India and Bharat Biotech – and as many as 12 states have or are in the process of floating global tenders for vaccines. However, officials in most states don’t expect to get vaccines from international manufacturers in the next three to four months.Some states such as Maharashtra, Karnataka and Rajasthan had to suspend vaccination of the 18-44 age group as enough vaccine were not available. States such as Punjab and Andhra Pradesh want the Centre to procure all vaccines and distribute them to the state rather than individual states trying to buying them from vaccine manufacturers in India and abroad.Niti Aayog member health VK Paul on Sunday told news agency PTI that the government plans to ramp up Covaxin’s per month production from the present 15 million doses to 100 million. The ministry of science and technology had earlier said Bharat Biotech will start manufacturing 10 crore doses per month by September. “Financial support is being provided as grant from GoI to the tune of approx ₹65 crore to Bharat Biotech’s new Bangalore facility which is being repurposed to increase the capacity of vaccine production,” the ministry said in a statement on Friday.The health ministry’s data showed that the progress of vaccination was abysmally low in Bihar, UP and Madhya Pradesh, which account for 32.2% of India’s population. These states combined have so far vaccinated only 1.51% of their population with both doses. Only 5.91% people in these states have been vaccinated with a single dose.Another five states --- Jharkhand, Punjab, Assam, Tamil Nadu and Telangana --- having 16% of the country’s population of India having given both doses to 2.32% of population and a single dose to 8.4% of population. “If we take the above mentioned 8 states together, they represent 48.2% of India’s population and only 1.78% of their population has got both doses. Less than 10% of the population has got a single dose,” Wilson said.Smaller population states such as Ladakh and Tripura have vaccinated more than 12% of their population with both doses and 29.05% and 23.13% of their population, respectively, with a single dose. Sikkim and Lakshadweep vaccinated 8.8% and 9.54% of their population, respectively, with both doses, the data shows.HT reported on Sunday that most of the vaccination in India has taken place in urban areas with large swathes of the hinterland yet to be brought under coverage. As per data on the Co-WIN app, doses administered in urban areas were 1.7 times of those in villages, where around 60% of the country’s population lives.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/vaccination-drive-moves-at-a-slow-pace-in-populous-states-101621191367566.html

At least 20 police personnel and several farmers were injured in the clashes, officials said.Farmers blocked the Delhi-Chandigarh National Highway 44 at Bastara in Karnal, the Hisar-Chandigarh highway in Kaithal, Kurukshetra-Pehowa-Paitala, Kurukshetra-Kaithal highway, NH-44 on Ambala-Patiala border , NH-73 on Ambala-Yamunanagar highway and toll plazas in Karnal, Panipat and Shahbad, for two hours from 5pm to 7pm, forcing the authorities to divert traffic to link roads.“Why did the CM have to visit Hisar to inaugurate the hospital, he could have done it virtually,” asked Haryana Bharat Kisan Union (Charuni) president, Gurnam Singh Charuni.“The police resorted to lathicharge and used tear gas shells, besides using plastic bullets to disperse the farmers in Hisar. Many farmers received injuries,” Charuni said, alleging that despite the state restricting gatherings hundreds of people were allowed to gather for the hospital inauguration.Khattar inaugurated the newly built 500-bedded Chaudhary Devi Lal Sanjeevani COVID Hospital in Hisar and farmers were stopped before they could reach the venue, the police said.Karnal superintendent of police Ganga Ram Punia said that traffic had been diverted from the NH 44 via link roads. He said that there were no reports of violence, but the police have been deployed to deal with any law-and-order situation.Hisar police spokesperson Vikas Kumar said a group started pelting stones at policemen, which led to the confrontation in which a few people, both farmers and policemen, got injured.At least 20 police personnel, including five women, were injured during the clash with farmers in Hisar, officials said.“The miscreants broke the barricade installed on the canal bridge and threw it into the water. They also attacked DSP Abhimanyu Lohan under the Jindal overbridge. The injured cops are being treated at the civil hospital,” a police spokesperson said.Charuni said the farm leaders had called a meeting at Hisar to decide further course of action.“ We will clear the road for ambulances, military convoys, fire brigade and tankers carrying oxygen. Farmers from Ramayana toll plaza will start marching towards the office of the Hisar IG and if our grievances are not accepted, we will start a dharna outside police stations across the state,” Charuni added.BKU leader Rakesh Tikait said they had asked the Hisar IG to release 85 farmers detained by the police.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/police-farmers-clash-in-hry-during-protest-over-cm-s-visit-101621191128108.html

A majority of villagers belonging to these areas are participating in the ongoing farmers’ agitation at Delhi borders, they added. On Saturday, Joga village in the district’s Bhikhi block was sealed for 10 days. The village, with a population of about 11,000 people, witnessed 10 Covid-19 deaths and 96 cases since May 1. Nangal Kalan, Khiala Kalan, Akkanwali, Phapphre Bhai Ke villages of the district have been declared containment zones since May 10. One urban pocket each in the towns of Mansa and Budladha was also declared as containment zones in the past one week. It is for the first time that villages in Mansa district have been declared containment zones after the second wave of the pandemic hit the state. An area is declared a containment zone after more than 15 cases of infections are detected. Deputy commissioner Mohinder Pal said police are strictly enforcing the containment protocol and have restricted unnecessary movement to contain the spread. “Most villagers were visiting dharna sites at very regular intervals. As they are falling sick in considerable numbers, villagers are reluctant to reveal details of their travel and places they visited. Ideally, they should have isolated themselves for five days after visiting the venue of a large gathering,” a district official said on condition of anonymity.Khiala Kalan, which currently has 34 active cases, reported two Covid-deaths in the last two weeks. On Sunday, two residents from Khiala Kalan block, including a 27-year-old man, succumbed to the virus. As many as 92 residents from the block tested positive on Sunday. With four deaths and 298 cases on Sunday, the number of active cases in the district rose to 3,299. Since May 1, the district has reported 5,164 new cases of infection and 52 Covid deaths. “House-to-house screening has begun. Healthcare teams are trying to convince villagers to follow Covid guidelines. We were able to vaccinate nearly 500 residents while a section (of the population) is hesitant to take the jabs,” Dr Hardeep Sharma, senior medical officer of Khiala Kalan public health centre, said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hub-of-farm-stir-5-villages-declared-containment-zones-101621190887552.html
17-05-2021||India||CoWIN to now allow bookings for 2nd Covishield dose only after 84 days||The Centre on Sunday announced that the CoWIN platform has been configured as per new directives to provide online appointments for the second dose of Covishield after 84 days, a move that came after the Union government extended the gap between two doses of the vaccine to 12-16 weeks.The Centre, however, said that previously booked appointments for second doses of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine will remain valid, with people getting the option to reschedule.“It is clarified that the requisite changes have now been done in the CoWIN digital portal. As a result, further online or on-site appointments will not be possible if the period after 1st dose date for a beneficiary is less than 84 days,” the Union health ministry said in a statement issued on Sunday.The Serum Institute of India (SII) locally manufacturers the Oxford-AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine under the brand name Covishield.“Additionally, already booked online appointments for 2nd dose of Covishield will remain valid and are not being cancelled by CoWIN. Further, the beneficiaries are advised to reschedule their appointments for a later date beyond the 84th day from the date of 1st dose vaccination,” it read.The statement was issued after the Covid working group — chaired by Dr NK Arora from the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) — recommended the extension of the gap between the first and second doses of the Covishield vaccine to 12-16 weeks from the existing 6-8 weeks.When Covishield was approved for used in India, its two shots were supposed to be spaced out between four and six weeks.Increasing the gap between the doses will allow governments to give the first jab to more people, and is consistent with studies that suggest a longer interval may offer better efficacy.Click here for complete Covid-19 coverage“There is quality data out currently in favour of increasing the gap further for improved efficacy, when it comes to Covishield vaccine. The second dose in this case acts as a booster shot, and even the first dose offers decent protection. It is a good move by the government,” said Dr NK Mehra, immunology and immunogenetics expert, who was formerly associated with New Delhi’s All India Institute of Medical Sciences.The Union health ministry has reiterated to the states and Union Territories that the online appointments booked for the second dose of Covishield prior to this change of the interval between the two doses must be honoured.“The Union Health Ministry has advised the Sates and Union Territories that the field staff may be instructed that, if such beneficiaries do come for vaccination, the second Covishield dose must be administered and they must not be turned away. They have also been advised to undertake awareness activities to inform the beneficiaries about this change,” the health ministry statement said.Two Covid-19 vaccines that are currently being used under the nationwide Covid-19 immunisation programme are SII’s Covishield and Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin.However, the revised interval is only for the Covishield vaccine, and there is no change for the Covaxin vaccine timeline that continues to be between 4 and 6 weeks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cowinto-now-allow-bookings-for-2nd-covishield-dose-only-after-84-days-101621189507459.html
17-05-2021||India||Use of steroids in Covid-19 treatment: What experts have warned so far||In the treatment of Covid-19 infections, doctors have time and again warned against the misuse of steroids. AIIMS director Dr Randeep Guleria on Saturday blamed the misuse of steroids behind the rise of the cases of mucormycosis during post-Covid recovery. But this is not the first time that the overuse of steroids has been flagged.What are steroids? Steroids are to treat inflammatory conditions which may be seen in a serious Covid-19 case when the virus is replicating. But its early and wrong use leads to more complications than benefits as steroids also repress the immune system."Recovery trials showed that steroids will benefit but it's also important to know when they're given. If given early before your saturation (O2) falls, it has a harmful effect. Covid patients who got steroids early had higher mortality than those who didn't. It is of no use if steroids are given on day 1. They are useful only in moderate to severe illness when oxygen saturation is falling," Dr Guleria said earlier.Taking steroid at an early stage of the disease can further replicate the virus, experts have said. Taking high doses of steroids in mild cases, on the other hand, may lead to severe viral pneumonia. Steroids should also be avoided in the first five days of the infection.Should patients with mild symptoms take steroids at early stage?#PIBFactCheckTaking steroids during early stage of #Covid19 can further replicate the #Virus.Take a look at this #PIBFacTree and know what Dr Randeep Guleria (Director, AIIMS) has to say about this! pic.twitter.com/HMUxd66YAlChairman of Institute of Liver Transplantation and Regenerative Medicine Dr Arvinder Singh Soin said steroid is one of the components of a vicious Covid triangle, the other two being Covid and diabetes. "Worse the diabetes, more severe the Covid and more the requirement for steroids. More the steroids, the worse the diabetes becomes," he said.We have seen more cases of black fungus (mucor) in the past week than we normally treat in 2 years.Must adhere to the @ICMRDELHI guidelines on steroid usage in COVID for 5-10 days & NO MORE.Also need a robust national registry recording all such cases. @drharshvardhanIn the Union health ministry's clinical guidance for Covid-19 patients, the use of anti-inflammatory therapy has been recommended only in moderate and severe cases, when the patient is either in the ward or in the ICU and the oxygen level is dropping. The steroid therapy is recommended only for a duration of five to 10 days, not more than that.Now it has also emerged that the cases of mucormycosis, which is a fungal infection and existed before Covid-19, are increasing because of steroid misuse.Dr Suresh Kumar, medical director of LNJP hospital in New Delhi, has said overuse, misuse, and rampant use of steroids in Covid-19 patients are causing black fungus cases. "If given to patients with oxygen levels over 90, black fungus is a possible side-effect. Early diagnosis is critical. A CT scan of the face would detect this infection, after which antifungal drug amphotericin will be used for treatment," he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/use-of-steroids-in-covid-19-treatment-what-experts-have-warned-so-far-101621184470534.html
17-05-2021||India||Petrol, diesel prices soar after ninth hike in 13 days||Petrol became costlier by 24 paise per litre and diesel by 27 paise a litre on Sunday as state-run retailers raised rates for the ninth time in 13 days, making the fuels costlier by ₹2.18 and ₹2.49 a litre, respectively, since May 4.Petrol prices crossed the ₹100 mark in several cities, particularly in Rajasthan, Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh on Sunday. Key cities to sell petrol over ₹100 per litre include Ratnagiri, Parbhari, Aurangabad, Indore, Bhopal, Gwalior, Jaisalmer, Ganganagar and Banswara.Among major metros, Mumbai has the highest fuel rates. While petrol is sold at ₹98.88 per litre in the financial capital of India on Sunday, diesel is sold at ₹90.40 a litre. Even as fuel rates in Delhi are the benchmark for the entire country, retail prices of the two fuels differ from place to place because of variations in state taxes and local levies.There are two key reasons for higher petrol and diesel rates – taxes on auto fuels and a spike in international oil prices. To be sure, much of the retail price is taxes. For instance, in Delhi, on May 16, central taxes accounted for 35.5% of petrol’s price, and state taxes, 23%. On diesel, central levies are over 38.2% while state taxes are about 14.6%. Through 2020, as global crude prices fell, the central government raised excise duty on fuel to shore up its finances. States too followed suit -- with revenue hit on account of the pandemic.International oil prices and the rupee-dollar exchange rate impact domestic pump prices as India imports over 80% crude oil it processes and pays in dollar. Benchmark Brent crude closed the week on Friday at $68.71 a barrel, with a gain of 2.48%. Fuel retail prices in India are aligned with their international rates of previous day. According to executives of state-run oil marketing companies, pump prices are also high because companies are recovering their past revenue losses. State-run oil marketing companies had incurred revenue losses for keeping any upward price movement of the two politically sensitive fuels under pause for 66 days since February 27 because of assembly elections in four states and one Union territory. The pump price rally in India started a day after poll results on May 4.During the 66-day pause on rate hike, state-run retailers had reduced petrol and diesel rates by 77 paise and 74 paise a litre, respectively in four small doses. But, the entire gains to the consumers were reversed in the first four consecutive rounds of rate hikes starting from May 4.HT wrote on April 28 that fuel rates would move north after the polls and their pump prices would start seeing small increments as state-run fuel retailers had been losing about ₹3 a litre on sale of the fuel because of higher international oil rates and depreciation of rupee against the dollar.The government deregulated the pricing of petrol on June 26, 2010 and diesel on October 19, 2014. Accordingly, state-run retailers are free to change pump prices every day. Public sector retailers — IOC, Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd (BPCL) and Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Ltd (HPCL) — control almost 90% of the domestic fuel retail market.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/petrol-crosses-rs-100-lt-mark-in-many-cities-following-ninth-rate-hike-in-may-101621152846744.html
17-05-2021||India||More shallow graves found on Ganga bank||Hundreds of bodies were found buried in shallow sand graves on the banks of the Ganga river in Uttar Pradesh’s Prayagraj district on Sunday, triggering panic among local residents.The graves, many of them covered with clothes or marked by bamboo sticks, were visible at Shringverpur Ghat, Arail, Jhunsi, and near Covid and non-Covid cremation ghats at Phaphamau. Some were also seen close to the Sangam area while a few others were visible from the Phaphamau Bridge, said a local resident on the condition of anonymity.Over the past week, close to 1,000 bodies were either fished out of the Ganga or found in shallow graves on river banks in Uttar Pradesh and Bihar. Local administration suspect the bodies could be of Covid patients but testing is difficult because the corpses are decomposed.According to a local resident, most of the bodies found now are of people who have recently died of Covid-19 and their family members don’t have money for cremation as the price of wood has gone up.“Up to ₹22,000 was being charged for a single cremation, till the administration fixed the price at ₹4,000 per body,” said the person.“For the last two-three months, people have been burying their dead here. Sand covering the bodies is blown away by strong winds, exposing the decomposing bodies. Predatory birds and dogs feast gather and feast on the remains. The government should make arrangements for proper burials,” Dina Yadav, a local resident, told news agency ANI.A priest at the Phaphamau Ghat, who requested anonymity, said people hire labourers for a few hundred rupees to dig graves for burial.Raju Nishad, a boatman at Phaphamau Ghat, said such burials pose a big health hazard to local residents.As the district administration and the police look to tackle the issue, a police team was deployed along the ghats in Prayagraj on Sunday, and officials were seen urging people to ensure safe burials and cremations. The district administration has also announced ₹5,000 aid to those who don’t have the money for cremation.Inspector general of police of Prayagraj range, K P Singh, said a cremation ground has been earmarked for burials of Covid patients as per protocols, and the police are no longer allowing burials on the riverfront.Earlier, similar scenes were witnessed in UP’s Unnao district, after which a team of the local police carried out an inquiry to find more bodies.Over the last week, Ghazipur and Bihar’s Buxar too have seen grim incidents of bloated, decomposing bodies floating in the river. Many washed up on the shores while some were pulled up by stray dogs.While it remains unconfirmed if the bodies in Prayagaraj are of Covid-19 patients, nearby residents have said such scenes have never been witnessed before and only started with the second Covid wave. “We have never seen such a sight near the river Ganga before. There are thousands of bodies here. The government should follow ‘Swachh Bharat’ and maintain cleanliness in the area,” Sanjay Srivastav, a local, told ANI.As per the HT dashboard, Uttar Pradesh reported 10,505 new Covid cases on Sunday, taking its total tally to 1,619,645. The toll in the state has reached 17,546 with 308 new fatalities.According to the district administration, 165 fresh cases and nine deaths were reported in Prayagraj on Saturday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/shallow-graves-on-ganga-bank-in-up-villagers-say-burials-spiked-recently-101620847125584.html
