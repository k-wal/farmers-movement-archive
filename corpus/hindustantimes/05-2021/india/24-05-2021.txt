A pre-submission meeting is expected “to be planned May-June 2021,” the guidance document said.According to the WHO, submissions to it for prequalification or listing under the emergency use procedure are confidential.If a product submitted for assessment is found to meet the criteria for listing, WHO will publish the results widely. Duration of the emergency use listing process depends on the quality of the data submitted by the vaccine manufacturer and on those data meeting WHO criteria, according to the agency.Meanwhile, Bharat Biotech International Limited (BBIL) has conveyed to the government that it has already submitted 90 per cent of documents to WHO for obtaining emergency use listing (EUL) for the Covaxin vaccine, sources said on Monday.The remaining documents are expected to be submitted by June, the Hyderabad-based Bharat Biotech Ltd told the Central government during a discussion on obtaining the World Health Organisation's authorisation for emergency use listing for Covaxin, sources said."BBIL is confident about obtaining WHO's emergency use listing," said a source.Noting that Covaxin has already received regulatory approval from 11 countries, sources said there was also interest from other 11 companies in seven nations for technology transfer and production of Covaxin.The company is in the final stages of negotiations with the Food and Drug Administration of the US for conducting small-scale phase-III clinical trials of Covaxin in the United States, sources said.Sources said the meeting with BBIL on the EUL was attended by the company's managing director V Krishna Mohan and his colleagues besides senior officers of the Ministry of Health, Department of Biotechnology and Ministry of External Affairs.Foreign Secretary Harsh Vardhan Shringla was among those who attended the meeting.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/need-more-information-who-tells-bharat-biotech-for-covaxin-emergency-use-listing-101621880247795.html

The facility is also equipped with oxygen concentrators.He requested Modi to talk to the farmers immediately to resolve all their grievances and said there is no scope for "egos" in a democracy.Only "dictatorships adopted an intransigent attitude towards people", he added.The farmers have been demanding that the Farmers' Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020; Farmers' (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020; and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020 be rolled back and a new law made to guarantee minimum support price (MSP) for crops.In a statement, Badal said instead of listening to the farmers, the central government "broke" talks with them and is trying its best to break up the agitation by tiring them out."I want to state unequivocally that the SAD is a representative party of the farmers and the poor and will always stand up to support them. I urge party workers to hoist black flags on their houses on May 26 to demand justice for the farming community," the SAD chief said.On Friday, the Samyukta Kisan Morcha (SKM), an umbrella body of over 40 farmer unions spearheading the protest against the farm laws, had written to Modi seeking the resumption of talks.Several rounds of talks between farmers and the government in the past have failed to break the deadlock over the legislations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-should-talk-to-agitating-farmers-urges-sad-chief-sukhbir-badal-101621880230837.html
24-05-2021||India||Stop release of Amazon Prime web series The Family Man 2, Tamil Nadu govt to Centre||Chennai: The Tamil Nadu government on Monday backed groups demanding the Centre step in to stop the release of The Family Man 2 web series on Amazon Prime OTT platform. In a letter to Union minister for information and broadcasting Prakash Javadekar, the state government said the web series “depicts the Eelam Tamils in a highly objectionable manner’. Information Technology Minister T Mano Thangaraj’s letter called the web series “condemnable” and “malicious”.The second season of the action-drama which revolves around an official of the National Investigation Agency (NIA) was previously scheduled to be released in February but was deferred. It is set to be released on Amazon Prime Video on 4 June. The trailer of the second season - the first season was released in 2019 - was released last week.In a statement announcing the state government’s opposition to the The Family Man 2, the government said it was “aimed at discrediting and distorting the historical struggle of Eelam Tamils in Sri Lanka.”“For example, branding Tamil speaking actress Samantha as a terrorist in the serial is directly an attack on the pride of Tamils living around the world and no one will tolerate this kind of motivated and mischievous campaign.” Samantha Akkineni plays the role of a Sri Lankan Tamil rebel in The Family Man 2, a 9-episode series.The criticism of the web series on social media started soon after the trailer was released. Soon, political parties started extending their support.The first to call for a ban on the The Family Man 2 was Tamil nationalist and chief of Tamil nationalist and Naam Tamizhar Katchi chief S Seeman who considers LTTE’s Prabhakaran as his idol. In the 2021 polls, his party emerged as the third largest after DMK and AIADMK. He said the The Family Man 2 portrayed the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) as a terrorist organisation and Tamils as violent people.The LTTE, founded by Velupillai Prabhakaran in 1976 to create an independent Tamil Eelam out of Sri Lanka, was banned in India after former prime minister Rajiv Gandhi’s assasination in May 1991.“If they refuse to ban the show and if they release it country-wide to try and create a false impression about Tamil people, I warn that they will have to face dire consequences,” Seeman said in a statement last week.On Sunday, Marumalarchi Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (MDMK) chief Vaiko also wrote to Javadekar to stop the release of The Family Man 2, saying that it depicted Tamilians as terrorists and ISI agents.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/stop-release-of-amazon-prime-web-series-the-family-man-2-tamil-nadu-govt-to-centre-101621879448656.html

However, the Congress has denied the allegation and claimed that the BJP is propagating a fake 'toolkit' to defame it.Last week, Twitter labelled as "manipulated media" a tweet by Patra on the alleged 'toolkit'. Twitter says it "may label Tweets that include media (videos, audio, and images) that have been deceptively altered or fabricated".||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/attempt-to-murder-freedom-of-speech-cong-on-twitter-india-office-searches-101621879231736.html

24-05-2021||India||Hisar clash: Haryana Govt agrees to withdraw cases registered against farmers||The Hisar administration on Monday agreed to withdraw cases registered against over 350 farmers after a clash escalated between them and the police on May 16 during Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar’s visit to inaugurate a Covid hospital.Thousands of farmers, including women and youths, on Monday started assembling at four toll plazas on the outskirts of Hisar to start a protest march in front of the divisional commissioner’s office. From there, the farmers went to Krantiman Park where a farmer, identified as Ram Chander Kharab of Uglana village, died of heart attack.As many as 4,000 rapid action force personnel and Haryana armed police staff of Bhiwani, Hisar, Sirsa, Jind, and Fatehabad were deployed to restrict the entry of protesters inside the city.Anti-riot vehicles and a wall were erected to stop the movement of farmers but the protest ended peacefully. No untoward incident was reported in district.The farmers’ march was stopped at Fawara Chowk, nearly 1km from the commissioner’s office and a 26-member farmer delegation was invited by the district administration to hold talks.Farm leaders including BKU spokesman Rakesh Tikait, Gurnam Singh Charuni, Balbir Singh Rajewala, Joginder Singh Ugrahan, Vikas Sisar and others moved ahead for discussion with the district officials.To avoid any mishap, Tikait led the protest and his SUV was at the forefront during the protest march.After attending the meeting with the district administration, Tikait said the administration has agreed to revoke cases registered against peasants in connection with the May 16 incident and will take legal course of action to withdraw the cases.“It was decided to withdraw cases within a month’s time. If the Hisar administration tries to betray us again, we will start a ‘pucca morcha’ here,” he said.“The administration has accepted our demand to give government job to the kin of Ram Chander, who died of heart attack during the march. We will observe black day on May 26 on completion of six months of the farm agitation. The government should accept our demands and end this deadlock,” he added.Tikait said 12 opposition parties supported them in the media but none of them sat in the tents during the agitation.Hisar SDM Jagdeep Singh said the administration and farmers have agreed to withdraw the cases registered against farmers within a month.“We have agreed to provide job to the deceased farmer’s family member on DC rate,” the SDM added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/hisar-clash-admn-agrees-to-withdraw-cases-registered-against-farmers-101621876569567.html
24-05-2021||India||CPEC will not affect China's stand on Kashmir issue: Zhao Lijian||China on Monday again defended its controversial USD 60 billion CPEC project with Pakistan, disregarding India's protests as it is being laid through Pakistan-occupied Kashmir, saying it is an economic initiative and has not affected its principled stand on the Kashmir issue.Leaders of China and Pakistan have praised the progress of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) in recent days as the two close allies celebrated the establishment of 70 years of their diplomatic relations.India has protested to China over the CPEC, the flagship project of China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), as it traverses through Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK).The massive infrastructure project connects China’s Xinjiang province with Gwadar port in Pakistan’s Balochistan province.China has been defending the CPEC, saying it is an economic project not aimed at any third country.Answering questions on the CPEC at a media briefing on Monday, Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said that "since its launch, the CPEC, as an important pilot project of the BRI, has made significant and positive progress in such areas as transportation infrastructure, energy, ports and industrial parks”."At the same time, it is also actively reaching out to Afghanistan and other regional countries," he said in updated comments on Chinese Foreign Ministry website.Asked how China sees regional prosperity being furthered by the CPEC in view of India's position that it passes through Indian territory illegally occupied by Pakistan, Zhao said the project has not affected China's principled position on Kashmir."As for whether the CPEC involves the Kashmir issue, China has made it clear on many occasions that the CPEC is an economic cooperation initiative, which is not targeted at any third party, has nothing to do with disputes over territorial sovereignty, and will not affect China's principled position on the Kashmir issue," he said.On the CPEC's extension to Afghanistan, he said, "as for China's discussions with Afghanistan and other third parties on extending the CPEC, I can tell you that China, Pakistan and Afghanistan have been in communication through diplomatic and other channels"."We have also noted that Afghanistan imports and exports relevant goods through Gwadar and Karachi ports. The three parties are discussing the extension of the highway and expressway in Pakistan to Afghanistan," he said.In a message to his Pakistani counterpart Arif Alvi on Friday on the 70th anniversary of the establishment of the China-Pakistan diplomatic relations, President Xi Jinping said the CPEC has achieved remarkable results.Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan said at a high-level meeting in Islamabad that the CPEC will bring economic progress not only to Pakistan but the entire region.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cpec-will-not-affect-china-s-stand-on-kashmir-issue-zhao-lijian-101621876287523.html
24-05-2021||India||Covid fear making people wary of shifting to cyclone shelters in Odisha||With the Odisha government launching a massive evacuation drive to save people from the fury of Cyclone Yaas, many people in the coastal districts of Kendrapara and Jagatsinghpur are reluctant to move to government shelters as they are scared of catching coronavirus, an official said.It is an enormous challenge for safeguarding people this time amid the raging pandemic, the official said."Maintaining social distancing norms while carrying out evacuation has become an uphill task. Still we are trying to convince the people not to take chances and shift to cyclone shelters and pucca houses," said the official who is monitoring evacuation work in Erasama block of Jagatsinghpur district.The seaside block was battered by the 1999 super cyclone as an estimated 10,000 people had perished then."We are planning to begin the evacuation work on Monday evening or early morning on Tuesday. There are signs of reluctance among some sections of people. The fear of getting infected with Covid-19 in cyclone shelters is bothering them."But we have sensitised the locals for adhering to Covid-protocols while evacuating people. Those who were unwilling are slowly evincing interest to shift to safer places" said Rabindra Pradhan, Block Development Officer, Rajnagar block in Kendrapara district.Around 100 people have so far been shifted to Okilopal cyclone shelter while 20 pregnant women from Talchua and Rangani were shifted to Rajnagar Community Health Centre, he said.The block administration has readied 46 cyclone shelters and 51 school buildings, he said.Around 35,000 to 40,000 are being planned to be shifted to temporary shelters."If those residing in vulnerable pockets do not volunteer, we may opt for forced evacuation because of the anticipated severity of the cyclone this time," he added.Cyclone Fani had battered coastal Odisha in May 2019. However, the evacuation exercise was not difficult as there was no Covid-19 scare then.In May last year, Odisha had faced the threat of cyclone Amphan when the state was battling the first wave of Covid-19.The cyclone had largely spared the state hitting the West Bengal coast, the authorities had not faced the challenges of massive evacuation last year.With the Covid surge being much more pronounced than last year, the fear of contracting the infection remains uppermost in peoples minds."Shifting to a shelter house is a safer option. Thats why we moved to the building in the evening hours. We are aware of the Coronavirus threat but we will abide by Covid safety protocols."Our village is quite vulnerable to tidal surge if the cyclone strikes. So we have made up our mind to battle Covid and cyclone simultaneously," said Gouranga Rout, a native of Ambiki village in Jagatsinghpur. Cyclone Yaas is likely to cross Odisha-West Bengal coast on May 26.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-fear-making-people-wary-of-shifting-to-cyclone-shelters-in-odisha-101621874905372.html
24-05-2021||India||‘3.6% of hospitalised Covid-19 patients had fungal, bacterial infections’: ICMR study||Just as cases of black fungus are being reported in Covid-19 patients during the second wave of the pandemic, secondary bacterial and fungal infections affected at least 3.6% (ranging from 1.7% to 28% between hospitals) of the hospitalised patient with coronavirus disease (Covid-19) during the last wave, found a study by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) published on Monday.The mortality in patients with these secondary infections increased to 56.7% as against 10.6% among the hospitalised patients in the ten network hospitals from where data was collected. The mortality in those with secondary infections was as high as 78.9% in one of the hospitals, the data shows.“What we found was that most of these secondary infections, 78% of them, were acquired at the hospital; the indication for infections started two days after hospitalisation and most of the samples had gram-negative bacteria showing that they were hospital-based infections. This could be because infection control policies at the hospitals went for a toss amidst the pandemic. Hand hygiene wasn’t as good because of double gloving and use of PPE kits in the hot weather also added to it,” said Dr Kamini Walia, corresponding author of the paper and scientist with the epidemiology and communicable diseases department at the (ICMR).She added, “The most common pathogens causing the infections were Klebsiella pneumonia and Acinetobacter baumannii; usually E Coli is the most common pathogen found as per the previous ICMR reports. Both infections are very difficult to treat because they have acquired a lot of resistant genes over time. The treatment will further become difficult post-Covid. Hospitals must invest in infection control and rationalise antimicrobial prescriptions.”Interestingly, the hospitals did not report cases of the fungal infection mucormycosis, cases of which have exploded during the second wave.“We have a double whammy; Covid-19, along with the secondary infections, increases mortality significantly. We saw primarily bacterial infection as reported in the study; mucormycosis cases being reported after the second wave is largely to do with the overuse of steroids. At the peak, steroids had vanished from the market. This has never happened before; it is one of the most common medicines available,” said Dr Chand Wattal, head of the department of microbiology at Sir Ganga Ram hospital, one of the ten centres that were included in the study.More importantly, the study cautions about the increase in antimicrobial resistance in the coming years due to excessive use of stronger medicines. Around 74.4% of the total antimicrobials prescribed in the hospitals were from the Watch and Reserve category of the World Health Organisation (WHO).The WHO classifies all antibiotics in three categories – Access drugs that can treat commonly encountered pathogens and have lower resistance potential, Watch drugs that have higher resistance potential and are critical for treatment, and Reserve drugs that need to be saved as last resort for drug-resistant microbes and given only once an infection is confirmed.“Around 47% of the infections were found to be multi-drug resistant but more than 74% of the antimicrobials prescribed were from the Watch and Reserve category. And, the ten hospitals from where we have collected data are in the ICMR network, they have been trained in infection control and antimicrobial stewardship. We can only imagine what is happening in other hospitals,” said Dr Walia.“These hospitals are backed by good lab facilities and many of these antibiotics should be prescribed only after the culture test comes positive. However, a very low number of samples were collected for microbial culture,” she said.Of the 17,534 patients with Covid-19 admitted to the ten hospitals between 1 June 2020 and 30 August 2020, only 7,163 samples were sent for microbial culture – with multiple samples being from the same patients. The low sampling, doctors said, was because of the practical problems, not many healthcare workers wanted to collect these samples during the first wave when not much was known about the disease.“The sample size decreased considerably because people were scared to take the samples, especially those that generate aerosols such as lavage (a procedure where the lower respiratory tract is flushed with fluid which is collected for diagnosis). The sampling has increased now that people are aware of how to protect themselves,” said Dr Wattal.“This is the chicken or the egg situation. We use stronger antibiotics because there are many resistant infections, but because we use these antibiotics we put more pressure on the pathogens to become further resistant. Say, we send out samples of 100 patients for culture, only 40 come back positive but the others have the signs and symptoms of an infection, so we prescribe antibiotics to all depending on the type of pathogens found in the 40 samples. Second, the culture takes a couple of days but in the meantime, we have to prescribe medicines empirically. But, there is no doubt we use a lot of antibiotics,” said Dr Sumit Ray, critical care specialist from Holy Family Hospital.“We need to de-escalate once the culture report comes, we need to prescribe based on whether the infection was acquired in the community or the hospital, there should be a restricted antibiotic policy where the doctor has to explain to a committee why the higher antibiotics are being used. There have to be several levels of checks and balances,” he said. There are no guidelines on the rational use of antimicrobial in Covid-19 patients by the ICMR.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/36-of-hospitalised-covid-19-patients-had-fungal-bacterial-infections-icmr-study-101621875188360.html
24-05-2021||India||FIR filed in Arunachal against Punjab man for racist remarks in YouTube video||The Arunachal Pradesh Police on Monday registered a First Information Report against a Punjab-based YouTuber for racial slurs against a former Union minister Ninong Ering and people of the northeastern state in a video uploaded on Sunday.Paras Singh’s video had gone viral soon after he uploaded the video on his YouTube channel “Paras Official” on Sunday, provoking massive outrage and support for demands for stringent action against him.In his video, Paras Singh commented that Ering, a sitting MLA, doesn’t look like an Indian and even his name “sounds foreign”. He also said people from Arunachal Pradesh don’t look like Indians and the state was probably a part of China. Paras Singh was sore that Ninong Ering had written to Prime Minister Narendra Modi to seek a ban on a gaming app called Battlegrounds Mobile India, saying it was a new version of PUBG, another game which was banned in India earlier. His YouTube channel, which focuses on video and online games, has 4,55,000 subscribers.As the chorus for action against the young Punjab man became louder, Arunachal Pradesh chief minister Pema Khandu stepped in on Monday to announce that a FIR had been filed against him. “Based on the video that aims at inciting ill will and hatred towards the people of Arunachal Pradesh, police have already initiated action,” Arunachal Pradesh Chief Minister Pema Khandu tweeted on Monday. He said a police case under sections 124A, 153A and 505(2) of Indian Penal Code (IPC) for sedition, promoting hatred or ill-will between racial or regional groups and public mischief with intention to incite a community, was registered.“Social media account of the person is being thoroughly investigated for details about his activities. Technical resources are being employed to gather his current whereabouts. Use of social media should be with due caution and any infringement will lead to action as per law,” Khandu said in another tweet. Following the reaction on social media platforms, Paras Singh deleted the video and posted a new one to apologise for his remarks. Later in the evening, his mother also posted another video to make the same point. She said her son had been picked up by some people who identified themselves as policemen and asked people to forgive “my only child”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/fir-filed-in-arunachal-against-punjab-man-for-racist-remarks-in-youtube-video-101621873868009.html
24-05-2021||India||Bharat Biotech to provide documentation for Covaxin’s emergency use listing by June||India’s Bharat Biotech intends to provide additional documentation needed for WHO’s emergency use listing of the Covaxin vaccine by June and is in final negotiations with American authorities for conducting small-scale phase III clinical trials in the US.The status of the application for emergency use listing of Covaxin by the World Health Organization (WHO) was assessed at a virtual meeting on Monday that was joined by foreign secretary Harsh Shringla, senior officials of the health ministry and Bharat Biotech managing director V Krishna Mohan.WHO’s latest update on emergency use listing (EUL) of Covid-19 vaccines, issued on May 18, shows Bharat Biotech submitted an expression of interest for EUL on April 19. The UN’s health agency sought more information from Bharat Biotech following the submission.“On the issue of WHO’s authorisation of EUL for Covaxin, Bharat Biotech officials noted that the company had submitted 90% of documentation required to WHO. The remaining is expected to be submitted in June,” a person familiar with developments said on condition of anonymity. Bharat Biotech is “confident about obtaining EUL, given its experience of getting its other vaccines pre-qualified by WHO,” the person added.The Hyderabad-based biotechnology company is in the final stages of negotiations with the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to conduct small-scale phase III clinical trials of Covaxin in the US, people familiar with developments said.Covaxin, billed as the first indigenous Covid-19 vaccine, was developed by Bharat Biotech in collaboration with the National Institute of Virology (NIV) under the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR).WHO’s emergency use listing will allow countries to expedite regulatory approvals for Covaxin and also make the vaccine eligible for supply to the WHO-backed COVAX facility, which was set up to distribute vaccines to low and middle-income nations.The external affairs and health ministries are playing key roles in facilitating the EUL of Covaxin. A total of 19 firms from around the world have sought EUL for their vaccines from WHO, and the listing has been finalised for seven applicants, including the Serum Institute of India (SII) which manufactures the AstraZeneca vaccine with the brand name Covishield.The matter has gained urgency after several countries, especially the 27 members of the European Union, announced they would allow the entry of fully vaccinated travellers. While the AstraZeneca vaccine is among those approved by these countries, Covaxin doesn’t figure on their list.“It is important to note that no country has instituted a vaccine passport. Countries have their own requirements for approval, which in most cases involves travel by carrying a negative RT-PCR report,” a second person said.Monday’s meeting was also informed that Covaxin has received regulatory approval in 11 countries. Eleven companies from seven countries have shown interest in technology transfers for the production of Covaxin, the people cited above said.India has so far supplied Covaxin under its Vaccine Maitri initiative, either as grants or commercial sales, to Myanmar (200,000 doses), Mauritius (200,000 doses), Iran (125,000 doses), Paraguay (200,000 doses), and Zimbabwe (35,000 doses). However, there have been no exports of Covaxin since March and the people said supplies to foreign countries were unlikely in the immediate future.Bharat Biotech is currently in the final stages of submitting documents for Covaxin’s regulatory approval in Brazil and Hungary, and the firm has held extensive consultations with both countries. The firm has also said that all regulatory approvals have “retrospective and prospective effect”, the people said.“Bharat Biotech is in regular touch with regulatory authorities in several countries, and it is confident about the robustness of its dossier as it has data for anti-body persistence after six months as well as eight months,” the second person said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bharat-biotech-to-provide-documentation-for-covaxin-s-emergency-use-listing-by-june-101621871533572.html

The chief minister also said that vaccines procured should be distributed free of cost to the states.In the letter, Vijayan said that universal vaccination drive is the only way to achieve herd immunity against the coronavirus disease in the long run. He also said that the scarce supply of vaccines in relation to the vast demand is the biggest hurdle for achieving universal vaccination.Vijayan also said that the vaccine prices would increase if states decide to procure individually via global tenders. “Based on the circumstances narrated above, I request that the Union Government may kindly take the lead in assessing the vaccine demand of each State and float a global tender taking into account the cumulative need. This will help in reducing the prices. We also reiterate the request that vaccines may be provided free to all states as it should be treated as a public good from which none should be excluded,” he wrote in his letter.Also read | ‘Third wave of Covid might not impact children, however...’: AIIMS directorEarlier on Monday, Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal said that US Covid-19 vaccine makers Pfizer and Moderna have both refused to sell vaccine shots to the Delhi government. “We have spoken to Pfizer and Moderna for vaccines, and both the manufacturers have refused to sell directly to us.

EUL helps the United Nations in procurement agencies and WHO member-states in determining if any necessary unlicensed medical product should be approved for use. The rotavirus, polio, and typhoid vaccines produced by the Hyderabad-based Bharat Biotech have been pre-qualified by WHO.Bharat Biotech is also in the final stages of submission of documents for regulatory approval of Covaxin in Brazil and Hungary, who are reportedly confident about the efficacy of the vaccine as they are in possession of data to show that antibodies following immunization persist even after 6-8 months after vaccination.“BBIL is in the final stages of submission of required documents for Covaxin’s regulatory approvals in Brazil and Hungary,” sources told news agencies.“BBIL is in regular touch with regulatory authorities in Hungary & Brazil. They're confident about the robustness of their dossier, as they've data for antibody persistence after 6 as well as 8 months,” the source added.Bharat Biotech held a meeting with government officials to discuss the EUL listing of Covaxin, sources told agencies. The meeting was attended by the managing director V Krishna Mohan, senior officers of the Ministry of Health, department of Biotechnology and Ministry of External Affairs.Foreign secretary Harsh Vardhan Shringla was also in attendance, reported PTI. The manufacturer conveyed to the government that 90% of the required documents asked for by WHO for emergency listing has already been handed over and the rest will be submitted in June.Individuals inoculated with both Covaxin and Russia’s Sputnik V may not be allowed to travel as WHO is yet to include either in its emergency use listing. Covaxin needs to be included in WHO’s EUL to be eligible for procurement through global vaccine alliance Covax.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bharat-biotech-confident-of-covaxin-making-it-to-who-emergency-use-listing-sources-101621868431232.html

Frontline teams have identified overhead Optic Fibre Cables (OFC) that need to be safeguarded and teams kept at standby for quick repair and restoration of the networks and services."COAI and its members, along with Infrastructure Providers (IPs), ISPs, are closely monitoring the situation. We are also coordinating with NDMA, state and local authorities. Preventive measures and steps to minimise the impact of cyclone Yaas on telecom infrastructure in West Bengal and Odisha are being undertaken," the COAI said.Barely a week after cyclone 'Tauktae' battered the western coast leaving behind a trail of destruction, the country is bracing for cyclone Yaas on eastern coast.The India Meteorological Department (IMD) had said on Sunday that the cyclone is likely to make landfall on May 26 evening between Paradip in Odisha and Sagar islands in West Bengal after intensifying into a very severe cyclonic storm with wind speed ranging from 155 kmph to 165 kmph, gusting to 185 kmph. It will start bringing heavy rain in coastal areas from Tuesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/steps-being-initiated-to-minimise-impact-of-cyclone-yaas-on-telecom-infrastructure-in-west-bengal-odisha-coai-101621867911145.html

He also said that people should be aware of the fact that Mucormycosis is not contagious and is not communicable as well.“90-95% of patients getting infected by Mucormycosis were found to have been either diabetic or were using steroids during their Covid-19 recovery. There are several types of fungal infections like candida, aspergillosis, cryptococcus, histoplasmosis and coccidioidomycosis. Mucormycosis, candida and aspergillosis are the ones observed more in those with low immunity,” Guleria further added.The Aiims director also said that people who have developed warning signs of Mucormycosis should immediately consult doctors and seek treatment. “Some warning signs for Mucormycosis such as headache, rusting or bleeding from nose, swelling below the eye, lowering of facial sensation, if observed in high-risk patients or those taking steroids should be informed to doctors so that early diagnosis and treatment can be given to the affected patients,” Guleria said.Mucormycosis cases have become a cause of concern for the Centre as well as state governments as a rise in the number of cases led to several states declaring it as an epidemic. The disease has a mortality rate of 50% if it remains untreated. The disease happens due to a fungus called Mucormycetes which is present around us but most people with strong immune systems are able to ward off its effects under normal circumstances. The treatment of Mucormycosis is costly which is causing problems for families of persons affected with the disease.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/identifying-fungus-by-its-colour-leads-to-confusion-guleria-on-mucormycosis-101621866622945.html
24-05-2021||India||See if you can give Covid vaccine free, Kerala high court to Centre||Thiruvananthapuram: The Kerala High Court on Monday asked the Centre why it wasn’t giving the Covid-19 vaccines free to people, adding that it could use part of the ₹99,000 crore dividend announced by the Reserve Bank of India to fund the initiative.Justice Vinod Chandran made the suggestion during a hearing of a petition that challenged the differential pricing adopted for the vaccines, depending on who buys the dose. The judge said the free vaccines would cost the central exchequer about ₹34,000 crore, pointing that the Centre could dip into the ₹99,122 crore dividend announced by the central bank last week.“You have an additional income from the RBI, why don’t you use it for this purpose. We are asking you to ask your policy makers about this,” the court told Raj Kumar, the standing counsel for the Union government.Raj Kumar said the pricing of the vaccines was a policy issue and he needed time to get back on this.But he also underlined that the Centre was giving the vaccines free of cost to people above 45 years of age and about 80 lakh vaccines had already been given to Kerala.At this point, the court said this was not the time to get into matters of federalism and centre-state relations. In Kerala, 20 lakh people have received both doses of the vaccine. Another 60 lakh have got the first jab. But the state has been able to get only 5 lakh vaccines on payment basis. It has placed orders for 1 crore vaccines; 70 lakh Covishield and 30 lakh Covaxin doses.The Supreme Court is already hearing a petition that has questioned the differential pricing for the vaccines. At a hearing earlier this month, the top court observed that the existing policy will “result in a detriment to the right to public health” and indicated that there were several aspects of the vaccine pricing policy adopted by the Central government which require that policy be revisited.West Bengal and Rajasthan governments have already announced plans to approach the Supreme Court to seek a new policy that adopts uniform pricing and distribution for Covid-19 vaccines.Meanwhile, Kerala reported 17,821 new cases on Monday when 87,331 samples were tested with a test positivity rate of 20.41 per cent. The state also reported 196 deaths and active covid-19 cases are 2,59,179, according to the data released by the state health ministry.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/see-if-you-can-give-covid-vaccine-free-kerala-high-court-to-centre-101621866848028.html

Many states and Union territories (UTs) have begun to ramp up their health infrastructure to brace for another wave of infections.However, the Centre said on Monday that there is no clear indication whether children will be severely affected in the third wave of the pandemic. Addressing a press conference on the coronavirus situation in India on Monday, All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) director Dr Randeep Guleria said, “It has been said that children will be infected the most in the third wave, but the Paediatrics Association has said that this is not based on facts.

They are the backbone of the society and the future of the country. Some of the challenges include stress and mental issues, smartphone dependence and addiction, interrupted education opportunities and nutritional issues.” the AIIMS director said and urged citizens to form help groups to address these issues.Guleria’s remarks came two days after Niti Aayog member (health) Dr VK Paul said on Saturday that children can spread Covid-19 but they experience only mild symptoms and the mortality rate is very low among them. He added children only account for not more than 3-4% of hospital admissions in a Covid facility.Also Read| Covaxin trials on children expected to start in June: Bharat Biotech“They (children) often do not require hospitalisation.

After the Centre's announcement, Gujarat Health and Family Welfare Department issued a statement saying this new feature of "on the spot registration" will not be applicable in the state for now. The state government will continue to follow the present system of "prior registration" wherein beneficiaries are given the date, time and place of vaccination after they complete the online registration process, Principal Secretary, Health, Gujarat, Jayanti Ravi said in the statement. Ravi said there was no change in this system as of now and people who wanted to get inoculated should get themselves registered through the official mobile application or website. She also denied some media reports suggesting that instead of prior registration through a mobile application or official website, people in the 18-44 age band can now opt for "on the spot" registration by just walking in vaccination centres in Gujarat. Earlier in the day, the Union Health Ministry said that on-site registration and appointment has now been enabled for the 18-44 years age group on the CoWin platform for Covid-19 vaccination. However, this feature is being enabled only for government Covid Vaccination Centers (CVCs) at present, it said. This feature will not be available for private CVCs and they will have to publish their vaccination schedules exclusively with slots for online appointments. This feature will be used only upon decision of respective states and UT governments. A total of 1,83,843 beneficiaries in the age group of 18 to 44 years received the first dose of the vaccine so far as of May 23, the state government had said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/gujarat-to-deliver-covid-19-jabs-for-18-44-age-group-only-through-prior-registration-101621863351098.html

A 57-year-old from Delhi who recounted her experience to news agency PTI said there was a scarcity of doctors, with hardly any one coming to check on the patients initially. She said three patients died before her eyes on the bed right across from hers."Hardly any doctor attended to us for the first two days. There were six of us -- women and men -- in the same Covid-19 ward. I watched at least three people die on the bed right across from mine," the woman told PTI.The staff was overworked and overburdened and patients had to clamour for medical attention by throwing empty bottles out of the door. The patients had to rely on each other to be able to do regular things like going to the washrooms, which were unisex and kept in a terrible condition.“We had to throw empty plastic bottles out of the door to catch the staff's attention,” she said.“There was no one to take us to the washroom and we, the patients, would hold each other's hands and go to that very unhygienic toilet, which was down the hall and unisex.” she added.She also recalled how apathetic the staff had grown after a while and when an aged patient took off his oxygen mask the staff replied that if anything happened to him the latter won’t be affected."When the old man right across from my bed would take off his oxygen mask repeatedly, the ward boy would shout at him and say 'Uncle ji, this won't affect us. So, you can keep doing this'," she recalled.Miles away in Puducherry, another patient, Alamelu, had a similar experience at the Covid care centre she was admitted to. Her daughter Siva Shakthi got her discharged from Indira Gandhi Medical College owing to unhygienic conditions and lack of separate toilets for men and women."The hygiene was pretty bad. That's why she had to come back in just three-four days. Both men and women had to use the same toilet. It was very disturbing,” Shakthi narrated.Alamelu, who suffers from heart issues and a high-blood pressure, received medication in the hospital but not drips, and had to take care of herself because of a shortage of staff."Medication was given but drips weren't. You had to take care of yourself which is the case with a lot of hospitals in the country today," she added.As the second wave shows signs of slowing down and states gear up to prevent a third wave, experts are calling for more attention to be paid to the mental toll the pandemic has taken on survivors and their families alike.Dr Rajiv Mehta, who is a part of the psychiatry department at Sir Ganga Ram Hospital in the national capital told news agency ANI that families should keep in touch with their ailing members and talk at least 2-3 times a day to help bolster their spirits. He also asked doctors to give their patients adequate time and listen to them.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid19-survivors-recount-harrowing-tales-of-death-and-neglect-at-hospitals-101621861583346.html

Guleria said there are many patients who will experience several symptoms even after recovering from the coronavirus disease and they need to be treated for them. “If the symptoms are seen for 4-12 weeks, it is called ongoing symptomatic Covid or post-acute Covid syndrome. If symptoms are seen for more than 12 weeks, it is called post-Covid syndrome or non-Covid,” Dr Guleria said during a routine press briefing.Among the common symptoms recovered patients experience are trouble in breathing despite normal lung function and capacity, cough for weeks, chest pain, anxiety and increased pulse rate, the senior doctor said. “These symptoms are post-Covid or Covid are due to the body’s immune system or inflammatory response,” he said.Also read | 3.6% of hospitalised Covid patients had fungal, bacterial infections: ICMR studyAnother common symptom is chronic fatigue syndrome, with people complaining of joint pain, fatigue body ache and head ache, and requires symptomatic treatment, Guleria said. “There's another symptom, generally termed as 'brain fog' on social media, seen in those recovered from Covid who find it difficult to concentrate and suffer from insomnia and depression,” he said.He suggested multi-disciplinary post-Covid clinics to rehabilitate people who have recovered from the viral disease. “I want to stress that as the recovery rate goes up, post-Covid patients will also go up and we should prepare so that we are able to manage them."Also read | Top Delhi doctor gives tips to combat black fungus amid alarming rise in casesAccording to the Union ministry of health and family welfare, India’s daily recoveries outnumbered new Covid-19 cases for the 11th consecutive day on Monday and the cumulative positivity rate stood at 8.09 per cent.

According to India Meteorological Department, the cyclone is very likely to cross north Odisha-West Bengal coasts between Paradip and Sagar islands around noon of May 26, this Wednesday, as a very severe cyclonic storm.Though the impact on Andhra Pradesh is expected to be minimal, chief minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy told Union home minister Amit Shah during a video conference on Monday that the state’s official machinery was being vigilant. Chief ministers of Odisha and West Bengal, and the Lieutenant Governor of Andaman and Nicobar Islands were also present at the meeting.Reddy said the cyclone could impact north coastal Andhra Pradesh and a few other coastal districts. A high alert was sounded in Visakhapatnam, Vizianagaram and Srikakulam district, he said. “The process of evacuation of people in the vulnerable areas had commenced in Srikakulam district, bordering Odisha. The process will be followed in other districts as well,” the chief minister said.

He has also instructed the officials to keep a close watch on oxygen shortage during the storm. Power supply to oxygen refilling plants should be on uninterrupted, he said. He also directed the officials to be ready to make alternative arrangements if there was any difficulty in procuring oxygen from Odisha due to the cyclone. There should be further adequate reserves of oxygen. An official release said Andhra Pradesh is largely dependent on supplies from steel plants located in eastern India -- Angul, Kalinganagar and Rourkela. Any disruption of the supply from these places can cause severe distress in the state.

24-05-2021||India||Vaccination key to controlling Covid-19, but Centre doesn’t seem to care, says Rahul Gandhi||Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Monday criticised the government for not “paying necessary attention” to slow pace of the vaccination drive across the country and reiterated that it is the only way the Covid-19 pandemic can be controlled.“Vaccination is the key to controlling the pandemic but GOI doesn’t seem to care,” tweeted Gandhi on Monday.Vaccination is the key to controlling the pandemic but GOI doesn’t seem to care. pic.twitter.com/iazLYEXHY3The Wayanad MP’s words come close on the heels of states like Karnataka, Maharashtra and Delhi closing vaccination drives for those in the age group of 18-45 years due to the shortage of vaccine doses. Congress hit out at the Centre on Sunday over its handling of the vaccination drive and asked the Union health ministry to produce district-wise, and not state-wise, data of the jabs being delivered every day, citing the latter as a tactic to hide “alarming facts”.Also Read: Modi government cannot say it didn't anticipate consequences, it has been forewarned: Chidambaram on vaccine crisis"The Union health ministry should put out a daily statement on the number of vaccines administered district-wise every day. The number for the whole state hides many alarming facts," Senior Congress leader P Chidambaram tweeted.“Will Union health minister Harsh Vardhan, who had said that there is 'no shortage' (of vaccines), please respond to the facts emerging from Delhi and Telangana?" he added.The Centre implemented a liberalised pricing and accelerated national Covid-19 vaccination strategy from May 1, where 50% of the required vaccine doses are supplied by the Union government and 50% are to be acquired by the states through direct procurement. To this end the states had started floating global tenders for procurement of vaccines but the US pharma giants Pfizer and Moderna Inc declined to sell directly to the states. The Centre has promised states a total of 5,86,29,000 doses of both Covishield and Covaxin between May 1 and June 15.The opposition parties have been hitting out at the Centre for shortage of vaccines and its handling of the pandemic in general. News agency Reuters reported on Sunday that the recent government directive on delaying vaccination by 3 months for those who have recuperated from Covid-19 was done to buy some time for ramping up vaccine stocks. Citing Narendra Kumar Arora, head of the government's National Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation, the report said the vaccination drive was prematurely opened up to all adults without inoculating the most vulnerable groups first. India has so far completely inoculated just 3% of its 1.35 billion people.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/vaccination-key-to-controlling-covid-19-but-centre-doesn-t-seem-to-care-says-rahul-gandhi-101621854782168.html

24-05-2021||India||Amid raging Covid-19 pandemic, Telangana villages remain free from virus||At a time when the second wave of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) has been wreaking havoc in the entire country, some villages in Telangana remain unaffected by the dreaded infection, at least till now, HT has learnt. Take the case of Dammayyapeta, a small village of Kodimyal block in Jagitial district. Tucked away a little deeper from the main road and surrounded by hillocks, this village, with 293 houses and a total population of 1,144, has not reported even a single case of Covid-19.“Most of the youth in the village are educated and have been reading about the Covid-19 in the newspapers and watching it on the television. But we have been following the suggestions given by the health department officials to keep the virus at bay,” Dammayyapeta sarpanch Tuniki Narsaiah told HT.The villagers have been following strict Covid-19 restrictions ever since the first wave of Covid-19 struck the country in March 2020. “We held a meeting of gram panchayat and adopted a resolution on how to follow the rules and avoid spreading of Covid-19. It has yielded good results; touchwood, we haven’t witnessed even a single case of the infection in our village till now,” Narsaiah said.Interestingly, the houses in the village are built in a peculiar pattern for several decades. There is at least 10 metres gap between any two houses. “This has made things easy for people to maintain adequate social distance. We made wearing of masks compulsory for all the villagers,” the sarpanch said.There have been no public gatherings and community celebrations in Dammayyapeta for the last year. “It was a collective decision by the entire village. The weddings are confined only to the families of the grooms and the brides. Unlike in the past, no relatives or friends are allowed and no marriage feasts,” K Sudhakar, a village youth, said.The gram panchayat officials have been sanitising the village with sodium hypochlorite solution once in three days. “We are not permitting any outsider to enter the village unless there are valid reasons and only if the person has no Covid-19 symptoms. However, we are not insisting such people produce a Covid-19 negative certificate,” Narsaiah said.The villagers have also been asked not to go out of the village unless it is very essential. “They are following all the Covid-19 protocols when they go out and return to the village. Even those running provision stores in the village go out of the village to fetch commodities only once or twice a month,” he said.Most of the villagers are farmers and about 200-250 people work as labourers who regularly go on work under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Programme. They wear masks and maintain strict physical distancing. “We did not have a problem in selling our agriculture produce as the agriculture department officials set up a procurement centre near the village,” Venkataiah, a farmer, said.Another tribal village Jagannathpur of Raikal block of the same district has also managed to remain free from Covid-19 in the second wave. This village, inhabited by the Gond tribes, has a population of around 1,000 people and none of them have tested positive for Covid-19 till date.“The credit goes to the villagers who take collective decisions to follow strict Covid-19 guidelines,” said Vijaya, sarpanch of the village.When contacted, Jagitial district medical and health officer Puppala Sridhar said the medical teams had been visiting the villages regularly to conduct fever survey and identify Covid-19 patients. “It is really commendable that some of these villages have been following the Covid-19 guidelines sincerely to avoid the spread of the virus – a sense which is lacking in many urban areas,” he said.Unconfirmed reports said three tribal villages in Nirmal district, Pentadari, Ippacharmi and Lakshmi Nagar of Saarangapur block, besides Gollapalli village of Devaruppula block of Jangaon district, and Chainpaka village of Chityal block in Jayashankar Bhupalpalli district, have also reported zero Covid-19 cases this year so far.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/amid-raging-covid-19-pandemic-telangana-villages-remain-free-from-virus-101621855027614.html
24-05-2021||India||Covid vaccination: Centre enables on-site registration for 18-44 age group||Union ministry of health on Monday enabled on-site registration for 18-44 years age group on the CoWin platform for all government Covid vaccination centres. This was in addition to the facility of online appointments provided for this population group, it said in a statement.“…based on the various representations given by the states and inputs received by Union Health Ministry for the vaccination of 18-44 years age group, the Union government has now decided to provide facility of on-site registration/facilitated cohort registration on CoWIN digital platform for 18-44 years age group,” the statement said.As per government data, 10 million beneficiaries in this population group have currently been vaccinated across the country.“Even though CoWIN provides for features such as registration of up to 4 beneficiaries with a mobile number, facilitated registration and appointments through applications, such as ArogyaSetu and Umang and through the Common Service Centres etc., people requiring cohort’s facility and those without access to internet or smart phones or mobile phones may still have limited access for vaccination. Therefore, the feature of on-site registration and appointment is now being enabled for 18-44 years age group on CoWIN,” it added.The service, however, currently is allowed only for government-run vaccination centres, and private centres will have to publish their vaccination schedules exclusively with slots for online appointments.Also Read | Pleas on ex gratia for Covid victims: SC seeks Centre’s replyWith the launch of phase 2 of the national Covid-19 vaccination drive on March 1, this year, facility for only online registration and appointment of citizens aged 45 years or more was offered on CoWIN digital platform. Later, the Central government expanded the drive to include people in the age group of 18 to 44 years from May 1, under the implementation of the Liberalised Pricing and Accelerated National Covid-19 vaccination strategy. Initially, the facility of only online appointment mode was offered to people in this age group in order to avoid overcrowding at the vaccination centres.However, the ministry has also allowed the vaccination centres offering online slots only to take some walk-ins at the end of the day against cancellations, to avoid vaccine wastage.“… In case of sessions exclusively organised with online slots, towards the end of the day, some doses may still be left unutilised in case the online appointee beneficiaries do not turn up on day of vaccination due to any reason. In such cases, on-site registration of a few beneficiaries may be necessary to minimise the vaccine wastage,” the ministry statement read. The Centre has also directed states to issue clear instructions to all district immunization officers, to strictly adhere to decision regarding the extent and manner of using the on-site registration and appointment feature for this age group. The ultimate decision, however, will be of the state whether to offer this facility for 18-44 years category or not.“State/UT must decide on opening of on-site registrations/facilitated cohorts’ registration and appointments for 18-44 years age group based on the local context just as an additional measure to minimize vaccine wastage and for facilitating vaccination of eligible beneficiaries in the age group 18-44 years. Also, abundant caution should be exercised and extreme due care should be taken while opening up of on-site registration… in order to avoid overcrowding at vaccination centres,” the statement further read.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-vaccination-centre-enables-on-site-registration-for-18-44-age-group-101621854247231.html

24-05-2021||India||Full-scale production of Sputnik V in India this summer: Russian developers||The developers of Russia’s Sputnik V Covid-19 vaccine and Panacea Biotec announced on Monday that full-scale production of the doses in India will start this summer. The Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF) or Russia’s sovereign wealth fund has tied up with Indian pharmaceutical firms such as Gland Pharma, Hetero Biopharma, Panacea Biotec, Stelis Biopharma and Virchow Biotech to manufacture more than 850 million doses a year. Sputnik V has been granted approval for emergency use by India’s drug controller. “The first batch produced at Panacea Biotec’s facilities at Baddi will be shipped to the Gamaleya Center [in Russia] for quality control. Full-scale production of the vaccine is due to start this summer. Company’s facilities comply with GMP [good manufacturing practice] standards and are prequalified by WHO,” RDIF said in a statement. Sputnik V was registered in India under the emergency use authorisation procedure on April 12 and use of the Russian vaccine started on May 14. Also Read | Covid-19: When citizens protect the right to lifeRDIF and Panacea Biotec have agreed to produce 100 million doses a year of Sputnik V. RDIF CEO Kirill Dmitriev said: “Launch of production in India in partnership with Panacea Biotec marks an important step in helping the country fight the pandemic. Production of Sputnik V supports efforts of India’s authorities to leave behind the acute phase of Coronavirus as soon as possible while the vaccine will also be exported at a later stage to help prevent the spread of the virus in other countries around the world.” Rajesh Jain, managing director of Panacea Biotec, said: “This marks a significant step as we initiate production of Sputnik V. Together with RDIF, we hope to help bring a sense of normalcy back to people across the country and around the world.” The Russian side has also announced plans to ship 18 million doses of Sputnik V to India, including three million doses in May, five million doses in June and 10 million in July. However, some questions have arisen about the Russian side’s ability to meet these commitments due to the production facilities in Russia being stretched by demands from around the world. Dr Reddy’s Laboratories has tied up with RDIF for the distribution of Sputnik V in India, including both made-in-Russia doses and locally manufactured shots. Sputnik V has so far been registered in 66 countries with a total population of more than 3.2 billion. RDIF and Gamaleya Center have said the efficacy of Sputnik V is 97.6%, based on analysis of data on coronavirus infection rate among those vaccinated in Russia with both doses of Sputnik V from December 5, 2020 to March 31, 2021. The vaccine is based on the platform of human adenoviral vectors and uses two different vectors for the two doses, which RDIF says provides immunity “with a longer duration than vaccines using the same delivery mechanism for both shots”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/fullscale-production-of-sputnik-v-in-india-this-summer-russian-developers-101621852627656.html

Patients of kidney disease, cardiac and liver disorders are also at a high risk of getting infected.Also Read| 5,424 cases of Mucormycosis reported in 18 states and UTs: Harsh VardhanSpeaking to news agency ANI, Dr Suresh Kumar, medical director of Lok Nayak Jai Prakash Narayan Hospital said, “Black fungus occurs in people who have poor immunity or are suffering from diabetes. Use of steroids increases blood sugar and due to this, the fungus enters through breath. It then spreads to the lungs and the entire body and also damages the kidneys.”Dr Kumar added the only way to prevent Mucormycosis is by keeping blood sugar levels under control, consuming steroids only on the advice of doctors, and keeping the face masks clean. He also suggested against using dry oxygen.The LNJP hospital has so far reported 36 cases of Mucormycosis, Dr Kumar said, adding 30 of them are Covid-19 patients. More than 300 cases have been reported across Delhi.

It is further expected that the remaining population in the 45+ age category will be covered within a few days,” the spokesperson said.On Saturday, UT’s lieutenant governor Manoj Sinha had directions district commissioners (DCs) to scale-up the drive after reports of low vaccination rate in some districts.As many as 51 people lost their lives to Covid-19 on Sunday in the UT, taking May’s fatalities to 1,282 and overall death toll to 3,564. The region also recorded 3,308 fresh infections, taking the overall cases to 2, 70,621.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jammu-and-kashmir-to-accelerate-vaccination-of-18-to-45-years-age-group-101621851788250.html
24-05-2021||India||Plea on ex gratia for Covid victims: SC seeks Centre’s reply||The Supreme Court on Monday asked the Centre if there was any policy or scheme under the National Disaster Management Act 2005 to pay ex gratia compensation to kin of persons who succumbed to Covid-19 pandemic.Two petitions, filed by Reepal Kansal and Gaurav Kumar Bansal respectively, were heard by the Supreme Court where a reference was made by the petitioners to Section 12(iii) of the Disaster Management Act (DMA) providing for ex gratia monetary compensation for the families of those who have lost their lives during a notified disaster. A notification issued on April 8, 2015 by the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) under this very provision fixed this amount at ₹4 lakh to be paid out of the State Disaster Response Fund and National Disaster Response Fund. However, this notification was applicable for the period 2015-20.By a Central notification of March 14, 2020, Covid-19 was declared a ‘notified disaster’ under DMA. Relying on the same, the two petitions made out a case for compensation to be paid to all persons (including frontline workers) who had died due to Covid-19. More than 300,000 persons have died in the country due to Covid-19.Kansal’s petition demanded that death certificates issued to Covid-19 deceased must specify the cause of death as Covid-19 and not complications related to it. Agreeing with this view, justice Shah asked Centre’s additional solicitor general (ASG) Aishwarya Bhati, “Is there any uniform policy for issuance of death certificate. If benefit is to be given under Section 12 of DMA, then there must be uniform guidelines.”Also Read | Guarantors liable if firms fail to repay: Supreme CourtThe court directed the Centre to produce all relevant documents regarding the compensation scheme envisaged under Section 12 of DMA, the letter issued on April 8, 2005, and guidelines governing issuance of death certificate for patients affected by Covid-19. The court also sought the guidelines framed by Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) presently adopted in many states. The next hearing of the case is on June 11.The bench was alive to the reality that in most cases of death due to Covid-19, the municipal authorities or hospitals show cause of death as lung infection or heart ailment occurring due to Covid-19. “If benefit is to be given to such persons who died due to Covid-19, how will they be identified? Often the families of deceased do not know about such benefits. They may have to run from one end to another for getting these benefits,” the bench remarked.Kansal, in his petition filed through advocate SR Harisha said, “It is the right of the family to know the real cause of death of their family member/ relative on any official document.” In most deaths, the medical officers are not conducting post-mortem examination, he added.Making out a case for compensation under Section 12 for frontline workers, Bansal pointed out, “At a time when personnel from healthcare sector, police department, municipal boards, Nagar Nigam, etc are acting as backbone of our country in fighting against the Covid-19 pandemic, it is the very basic and fundamental duty of Centre to provide social security to those families whose members are losing their lives.”Section 12 of the DMA provides “Guidelines for minimum standards of relief” which states as follows: “The National Authority shall recommend guidelines for the minimum standards of relief to be provided to persons affected by disaster, which shall include,— (iii) ex gratia assistance on account of loss of life as also assistance on account of damage to houses and for restoration of means of livelihood.”The April 8, 2015 MHA notification that fixed ₹4 lakh ex-gratia stated, “ ₹four lakh per deceased person including those involved in relief operations or associated in preparedness activities, subject to certification regarding cause of death from appropriate authority.” This was the reason the petitioners demanded death certificate to reflect Covid-19 as cause of death.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/plea-on-ex-gratia-for-covid-victims-sc-seeks-centre-s-reply-101621850167232.html

State/UT must decide on opening of on-site registrations/facilitated cohorts’ registration and appointments for 18-44 years age group based on the local context just as an additional measure to minimize vaccine wastage and for facilitating vaccination of eligible beneficiaries in the age group 18-44 years,” the health ministry added.Also read | 6 things you should not do before or after vaccination, Centre issues guidelineThe ministry said the facility of only online appointment mode initially to people in the age group of 18 to 44 years helped to avoid overcrowding at vaccination centres. The Centre expanded its massive vaccination drive for people in the age group of 18 to 44 years on May 1.“In case of sessions exclusively organized with online slots, towards the end of the day, some doses may still be left unutilized in case the online appointee beneficiaries do not turn up on day of vaccination due to any reason. In such cases, on-site registration of a few beneficiaries may be necessary to minimize the vaccine wastage,” the health ministry said. It added that even though CoWin provides for registration of up to four members with a mobile number, facilitated registration and appointments through applications such as Aarogya Setu and Umang and through the Common Service Centres etc, people need “facilitated cohort’s facility and those without access to internet or smart phones or mobile phones may still have limited access for vaccination.”Also read | Centre to supply over 5 crore Covid-19 vaccine doses to states and UTsThe Union health ministry has advised states and Union territories to issue clear instructions to all district immunisation officers to strictly adhere to decision of respective state and UT government “regarding the extent and manner of using the on-site registration and appointment feature for 18 to 44 years age group”. “Fully reserved sessions can also be organised for providing vaccination services to beneficiaries belonging to facilitated cohorts. Wherever such fully reserved sessions are organized, all efforts must also be made to mobilize such beneficiaries in sufficient numbers,” the ministry said.Also read | CoWin to now allow bookings for 2nd Covishield dose only after 84 daysThe ministry also advised states and UTs that “abundant caution should be exercised and extreme due care should be taken while opening up of on-site registration and appointment for 18-44 years age group, in order to avoid overcrowding at vaccination centres”, the statement said.According to the health ministry, the cumulative number of Covid-19 vaccine doses for the 18-44 age group under the third phase of the vaccination drive crossed 10 million on Monday.

24-05-2021||India||Will not arrest Param Bir Singh till June 9: Maharashtra govt tells high court||The Maharashtra government has assured that it will not arrest former Mumbai police commissioner Param Bir Singh in a case filed against him under the SC/ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Act till June 9 if he cooperates with the probe and doesn’t seek relief related to this case from the Supreme Court, said senior counsel Darius Khambata, who is representing the state government.The assurance came during the hearing of a petition filed by Singh in Bombay high court, seeking to quash the FIR registered against him on a complaint of police inspector Bhimrao Ghadge. The vacation bench of justices S S Shinde and N R Borkar was hearing the matter.Singh last week filed a petition in the apex court, alleging that he is being hounded and continuously harassed with multiple cases instituted against him by the Maharashtra government as vendetta, after he complained to chief minister Uddhav Thackeray against former home minister Anil Deshmukh.He urged the SC to shift all the enquiries set up against him to another state and also sought for the FIRs registered against him to be transferred to the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI).Khambata on Monday told the HC that Singh “cannot ride two horses” at a time and seek reliefs from both the high court and the Supreme Court in the same case.The bench accepted the state government’s statement that it would not arrest Singh till June 9, and directed him to not seek reliefs pertaining to this particular case before the SC. Singh’s counsel Mahesh Jethmalani agreed to the directive.Ghadge’s advocate Satish Talekar opposed the interim protection from arrest granted to Singh.The court, however, noted that the case dates back to 2016. “The FIR has been filed after five years. You (complainant) waited for so long…nothing will happen if you wait for two more weeks. He (Singh) has not been arrested for all these years. What purpose will it serve if he is arrested now,” the court said.The bench also noted that Singh is still in service and is an officer of the government’s police force.Justice Shinde also expressed his displeasure with Singh’s statement before the SC claiming he was constrained to approach the apex court as the high court was not hearing the matter.Khambata said Singh’s submission before SC made an unfounded accusation against the HC by suppressing facts. He pointed out that on May 13 the high court had heard and adjourned the matter after the government assured to take no coercive action against Singh.Ghadge’s advocate Satish Talekar said it seemed that Singh was resorting to forum shopping, an approach disapproved by the SC.Jethmalani apologised to the bench and said the statement was incorrect. “We will withdraw the statement from the petition filed in the Supreme Court,” he said.The vacation bench adjourned the case to June 9 so that it could be placed before a regular bench of the high court to avoid rehearing of the matter.The FIR against Singh is based on a complaint filed on April 29 by police inspector Ghadge, now posted at Akola in Maharashtra.Ghadge made a series of allegations of corruption against Singh and other officers when Singh was posted in Thane.The FIR, which is now transferred from Akola to Thane, claimed that Singh during his term as Thane police commissioner in 2015-16, pressured Ghadge to drop the names of some developers from Kalyan-Dombivali area from a corruption case and when he refused, the IPS officer framed him up in false cases.Ghadge also claims in the FIR that though he had complained against Singh to various authorities including the then chief minister Devendra Fadnavis, they were not acted upon forcing him to file a case under the SC/ST Act against Singh in 2021. Ghadge belongs to the Mahar community, a scheduled tribe. The state CID is conducting a probe into the case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/will-not-arrest-param-bir-singh-till-june-9-maharashtra-govt-tells-high-court-101621848007021.html
24-05-2021||India||Covid-19 vaccination: Centre enables on-site registration for beneficiaries of 18-44 age group on CoWIN||The Centre on Monday opened on-site registration and appointment for Covid-19 vaccination for beneficiaries between the age of 18 to 44 years on its CoWIN platform, the ministry of health and family welfare said in a release. Earlier, only online registration was allowed to avoid crowding at the vaccination centres.However, the facility to register at the site is restricted to only government vaccination centres, for now. "Private Covid vaccination centres will have to publish their vaccination schedules exclusively with slots for online appointments," it stated.The ministry also said that that the action has been taken in order to minimise vaccine wastage as some doses may be left unutilised in case the online appointee beneficiaries do not turn up on the day of vaccination due to any reason. "In such cases, on-site registration of a few beneficiaries may be necessary to minimise the vaccine wastage," it stated.The move also aims to expand the inoculation drive to people eligible for the vaccine shot but may not have access to the internet or mobile phones to book the appointment through CoWIN, the official portal created by the Centre to book vaccination slots at both government-run and private hospitals.People in priority groups are already allowed to register at the vaccination centre to receive the jab.The central government opened the immunisation drive for all above 18 on May 1 in the third phase. In previous phase, people above 45, and with comorbidity were allowed to receive the shot.India rolled out the nationwide vaccination drive on January 16. However, it hit a roadblock to maintain its pace in the past couple of months owing to shortages of vaccines and beneficiaries across the country facing difficulty in finding slots on the CoWIN.The government is currently using Covishield, developed by Oxford University and AstraZeneca and manufactured by the Serum Institute of India, and Bharat Biotech's indigenously manufactured Covaxin for vaccinating the people of the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid19-vaccination-centre-enables-on-site-registration-for-beneficiaries-of-18-44-age-group-on-cowin-101621846345819.html

Of these, 18,043,015 million vaccine doses are still available with the states and the UTs to be administered, the health ministry said.More than 4.80 million vaccine doses are still in the pipeline and will be distributed to states within the next three days, the health ministry said. "Vaccination is an integral pillar of the comprehensive strategy of Government of India for containment and management of the pandemic, along with Test, Track, Treat and COVID Appropriate Behaviour," the health ministry said in a release on Monday. In addition, the government is also facilitating direct procurement of vaccines by the States and UTs, it also said.As of May 23, the total consumption, including wastage, is 200,008,875 doses, the health minister also mentioned.This comes as several states in the country, including the national capital, halted the vaccination drive for the people in the age group of 18-44. The Centre opened the immunisation drive against the coronavirus disease for all above 18 on May 1. However, it is yet to pick a pace in the country due to the shortage of vaccines leading to the unavailability of slots.On Saturday, Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal urged the Centre to increase the quota of Covid-19 vaccine for the national capital as it faces a huge crunch of the shots. Kejriwal also cited the temporary halt in the vaccination of people in the age group of 18-44 years to flag the shortage of doses in Delhi. Vaccine stocks for the age group are over and the centres where they were being administered have been shut, Kejriwal said.Kejriwal further said that Delhi requires 80 lakh vaccine doses per month; "However, we only received 16 lakh vaccine doses for May," he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/over-4-80-mn-covid-19-vaccine-doses-to-be-distributed-to-states-uts-centre-101621843883331.html

All these cases have been reported from 18 states and Union territories, the health minister also said, adding, out of the total, 4556 patients have a history of Covid-19 infection and 55% of them had diabetes, as per the ANI report.With Covid-19 cases now below record levels, doctors in India are battling with the black fungus epidemic. The infection attacks the immune system of the patient and most likely to have fatal results in patients with comorbidity like diabetes.Mucormycosis is caused by exposure to mucor mold, which is commonly found in soil, air and even in the nose and mucus of humans. It spreads through the respiratory tract and erodes facial structures. Sometimes, doctors have to surgically remove the eye to stop the infection from reaching the brain.Doctors are suspecting that the sudden surge in mucormycosis may be linked to the rapid use of steroids to treat Covid-19 patients. Mucormycosis has a high mortality rate, however, it is not contagious but its frequency in the last month has left doctors worried.On Saturday, Union minister of chemicals and fertilizers DV Sadananda Gowda announced an allocation of 23,680 additional vials of Amphotericin-B, a key drug to treat the raging infection amid complaints by many chief ministers regarding the shortage.India's death toll from Covid-19 crossed 300,000 as the number of daily fatalities hovered above 4000. The country’s Covid-19 tally, meanwhile, has increased to 26,752,447 after 222,315 positive cases were detected in the 24-hour period.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/5424-cases-of-mucormycosis-reported-in-18-states-and-uts-harsh-vardhan-101621842809723.html

Vardhan was speaking at the 27th group of ministers' (GoM) meeting on Covid-19."When we talk about genome sequencing, over 25,739 samples have been sequenced by INSACOG and 9,508 were found with variants of concern. Out of these, B.1.617 variant was found in almost 65 per cent of the samples making it one of the most common variants," said Vardhan.Also Read: All that we know about the B.1.617 variantThe INSACOG is a consortium of 10 institutes of the Centre, that is involved in the genome sequencing of the Sars-CoV-2 virus.The health minister also said that state governments have been requested to send the samples regularly for genome sequencing.Vardhan further highlighted that depite being a Sunday, more than 19 lakh samples were tested for Covid-19 on May 23, taking the cumulative total across the country beyond 33 crore.The B.1.617 variant of Covid-19 is primarily found in India. It has emerged as a global concern following its infectivity and transmitting capacity.There are three sub-lineages too of the variant - B.1.617.3, B.1.617.1 and B.1.617.2. The last two were first detected in December 2020 whereas B.1.617.3 was the first sub-lineage of this variant to be detected in October 2020 in India.In case of all the three sub-lineage, it has the potential to reduce antibody efficacy.The variant spreads so fast that both doses of two-dose regimen Covid-19 vaccines are needed to provide strong protection against symptomatic infection from it.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/b1617-variant-found-in-65-of-samples-sequenced-says-health-minister-101621837559379.html

These, along with the forensics test report conducted by the state government, have ruled out poisoning, which was suspected by some as a probable cause of deaths. The final investigation report on the May 13 deaths at Kanduli Hills area of Nagaon district is expected in the next few days. “We received report of the histopathology tests conducted by the department of pathology, College of Veterinary Science, Assam Agricultural University (AAU), on Sunday. This more or less confirms lightning as cause of the death of the elephants,” said Vasanthan, divisional forest officer, Nagaon. The report prepared by Prof SM Tamuli and assistant professor A Deka mentions “lesions are suggestive of high voltage electrical burn injury” as the tentative diagnosis of the tests. “We examined the tissues and other materials provided by the forest department and found desquamation of the keratinized layer (peeling off of the external layer of the skin,” said Prof Tamuli. The report accessed by HT also mentions “distortion and separation of intra epidermal tissues” and “separation of epidermal and dermal layers, highly dilated and congested blood vessels and severe haemorrhage observed in the dermal papillae as well as in the sub-epidermal region”. A preliminary technical report on incidents of lightning over and around the site where the elephants’ bodies were found by North Eastern Space Application Centre (NESAC) says that many lightning strikes took place in the area between 5.30am on May 12 to 5.30 am on May 13. “A large number of lightning strikes were reported around the area where the elephant bodies were found. The total number of lightning flashes reached 350 and CG (cloud to ground) flashes were 150 every 2 hours. That is a clear indication of the high flash rate over the area and its severity,” the report accessed by HT mentions. Officials said the report of the forensic tests conducted at the Assam government laboratory in Guwahati has also ruled out poisoning as the likely cause of the deaths. HT hasn’t seen its contents.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/lightning-killed-18-elephants-in-assam-says-pathology-report-101621836426592.html

The post of CBI director has been lying vacant since February 3 when Rishi Kumar Shukla completed his tenure. Additional director Praveen Sinha has been holding the post since then as the interim chief of the premier agency. People cited above said a list of Indian Police Service (IPS) officers from 1984 to 1987 batches was given to the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) after clearance by the ministry of home affairs (MHA) and department of personnel and training (DoPT). However, there is a possibility that officers from 1988 batch might also be considered for the post. The meeting is likely to take place at 7 pm at Prime Minister’s residence, when the panel will deliberate on the names given to them, officials said. Also Read | Rajasthan may move Supreme Court for uniform vaccine policyAmong the top contenders for the coveted post are 1984 batch IPS officers YC Modi (currently director general of National Investigation Agency), and Rakesh Asthana (director general of Border Security Force); and 1985 batch officers Subodh Jaiswal (director general of Central Industrial Security Force), Loknath Behera (Kerala police chief), and HC Awasthy (Uttar Pradesh police chief). Modi, Asthana, Behera and Awasthy have had considerable experience in CBI in the past and have investigated some crucial cases. One of the officers said that if the panel decides to consider 1988 batch as well for the post, then Praveen Sinha may also be a strong contender to lead the agency permanently. “There are high chances that the panel doesn’t agree on one name today and there could be another meeting,” said an officer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pmled-panel-to-decide-cbi-director-s-name-today-101621833006229.html
24-05-2021||India||Lunar eclipse, Supermoon and Blood Moon: All coming together on May 26||People around the world will witness a supercelestial event as the first lunar eclipse of 2021 will take place on May 26. What will make this even more special as it will coincide with a supermoon, a lunar eclipse and a red blood moon all at once!According to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) of the US, the total lunar eclipse would start at 4:47:39 am EDT. In India, it will be visible at around 2:17 pm and will end at 7:19 pm.What is a Super Moon?NASA defines Super Moon occurrence as when a full or new Moon coincides with its closest approach to the Earth. The closest point on the orbit is called "perigee," and when the full Moon appears at the perigee, it looks slightly brighter and larger than a regular full Moon, hence the name "Supermoon"Normally it is difficult to differentiate between the normal Moon and a supermoon, but if you compare it with two pictures side by side, it shows a difference in size.What is lunar eclipse?A lunar eclipse is when the earth comes between the Sun and the Moon, blocking the sunlight from falling on the Moon. There are two kinds of eclipse, partial and total, depending on how much earth's shadow has covered the Moon. This can only happen during the full Moon.May 26's eclipse is a total lunar eclipse when the Moon and Sun are on opposite sides of Earth, forming a straight line and completely covering the Moon.Best places to see Lunar EclipseThe best place to see the eclipse will be the middle of the Pacific Ocean, Australia, the east coast of Asia and the west coast of America. It will be visible on the eastern half of the US, but only the very earliest stages before the Moon sets.What is red blood Moon?During the eclipse, when the Moon is covered by the earth's shadow it goes darken, however, it doesn't go completely black. Instead, the Moon takes a red colour, therefore total lunar eclipse is often called red or blood moon.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/lunar-eclipse-supermoon-and-blood-moon-all-coming-together-on-may-26-101621832055881.html

The arrested politicians are sitting ministers of Mamata Banerjee-led West Bengal government, Firhad Hakim and Subrata Mukherjee, Trinamool Congress legislator Madan Mitra, and former MLA Sovan Chatterjee.The CBI has also challenged the high court orders putting the leaders under house arrest, and constituting a larger bench to hear the bail plea of the accused leaders. “The CBI has moved the Supreme Court when the high court has already constituted a larger bench to hear the case. We will oppose it,” said Kalyan Banerjee, advocate and Trinamool Congress MP. Also Read | Narada case: Sovan Chatterjee in house arrest after release from hospitalOn Friday, the high court put the four politicians under house arrest and constituted a larger bench to hear the bail plea after a difference of opinion split the two-judge bench on granting them an interim bail in a corruption case. The four were in judicial custody since May 17 after the CBI arrested them in connection with the Narada case. Though a special CBI court granted them bail, the high court stayed the order and the four were sent to judicial custody. Since Friday, however, they have been put under house arrest. While Hakim and Chatterjee returned home and are now under house arrest, the other two are admitted in state-run hospital. “It is CBI’s effort to delay the hearing. But we have already filed a caveat in the Supreme Court and the hearing can’t be one-sided,” said another advocate. The case pertains to a controversy that erupted ahead of the 2016 assembly elections after Narada News portal uploaded a series of videos purportedly showing a number of high-profile TMC leaders receiving money in exchange for favours to a fictitious company. TMC has linked the arrests to Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)’s loss in the recently concluded assembly polls. It has questioned why the CBI didn’t arrest Suvendu Adhikari and Mukul Roy, who were also seen in the sting videos but have since switched from TMC to BJP. CBI’s plea to transfer the Narada trial out of the state is also pending before the high court. The CBI has named West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee, law minister Moloy Ghatak, and lawmaker Kalyan Banerjee as respondents in its plea to transfer the trial of the case from the lower court. It claimed violent protests orchestrated by the TMC against the arrests hampered its probe and intimidated lower courts. Banerjee staged a six-hour dharna at the CBI’s office in Kolkata after the four were arrested last Monday. Ghatak led nearly 3,000 workers and supporters to the court premises. Outside CBI’s office, hundreds of TMC supporters staged a protest and threw bricks, bottles, and shoes at central forces.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/narada-sting-5-judge-bench-to-hear-leaders-bail-plea-cbi-moves-sc-101621831506395.html

They have known each other for a long time and share a close and easy relationship, going back to their previous avatars as India’s foreign secretary and deputy secretary of state in the Obama administration respectively. Blinken had also visited India during Jaishankar’s tenure as foreign secretary.Also Read | US Congressional committee passes resolution to express solidarity with IndiaJaishankar is also expected to meet National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan, another old acquaintance. But there was no word yet about his meetings with other cabinet members, including Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin, the first, and only, Biden cabinet member to visit India so far, in March, when he had also met Prime Minister Narendra Modi.Visiting foreign ministers don’t always get a meeting with the American president. And in these times of social restrictions, though it’s being rapidly wound down in the White House because of rising vaccinations and dipping case, Americans have been even less willing to break the protocol.Australian foreign minister Marise Payne was in Washington DC in March. She met Blinken and Sullivan and others but, did not get a meeting with President Biden. And Australia has been a treaty ally of the US since 1951 and a member of the Five Eyes intelligence sharing alliance with the US, United Kingdom, New Zealand and Canada.Jaishankar and defence minister Rajnath Singh became the first Indian ministers to meet an American president in 15 years when they had a “courtesy call” with then President Donald Trump in 2019, after wrapping up their 2+2 ministerial dialogue meetings with their then counterparts Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Secretary of Defense Mark Esper.The two before them were former cabinet members of the Vajpayee government — home minister LK Advani and foreign minister Yashwant Sinha. Advani got a “drop by” meeting with President George W Bush in 2003 when he was in a meeting with then National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice and Sinha got an Oval Office meeting the year after, in 2004.Jaishankar’s DC itinerary is still evolving. But, as stated in the announcement of his visit by the external affairs ministry, a major part will be meeting with the business community. He will meet representatives and members of the US-India Business Council (USIBC), an arm of the powerful US chamber of commerce, and the US-India Strategic Partnership Forum (USISPF), a competing group backed by most major companies invested in India.It is also understood that Jaishankar will meet some members of US congress at a dinner hosted by Indian ambassador to the US Taranjit Singh Sandhu. This will be a key part of the visit as well because of the overwhelming bipartisan support ties with India in US congress.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jaishankar-in-us-talks-to-cover-covid-bilateral-ties-101621829646187.html
24-05-2021||India||Very severe cyclonic storm Yaas to cross Odisha-Bengal coasts on May 26 evening||The depression over eastcentral Bay of Bengal has intensified into cyclonic storm, Yaas, and is likely to intensify further into a very severe cyclonic storm (wind speed of 118 to 166 kmph) during the subsequent 24 hours, according to India Meteorological Department.Yaas would continue to move north-northwestwards, intensify further and reach northwest Bay of Bengal near north Odisha and West Bengal coasts by Wednesday morning. It is very likely to cross north Odisha -West Bengal coasts between Paradip and Sagar islands by Wednesday evening as a very severe cyclonic storm.Though oceanic and atmospheric conditions over Bay of Bengal are favourable for intensification of Yaas, experts hope it will not intensify to an extremely severe cyclone because it has formed close to the coast and has less time over the unusually warm ocean.“The north Bay of Bengal where the cyclone is forming, is very warm, with the temperatures reaching up to 32 degrees Celsius (°C), 1-2°C above normal. The subsurface ocean heat content is also warm and conducive for the system to intensify into a cyclone. However, since the distance between the location of cyclogenesis and landfall is short, the cyclone won’t spend much time over the ocean. This will prevent it from intensifying to an extremely severe cyclone. In contrast, Cyclone Tauktae spent several days in the Arabian Sea, drawing the energy in the form of heat and moisture from the warm waters below. We won’t see this happening for cyclone Yaas,” said Matthew Roxy Koll, a climate scientist at the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology.Also Read | How India is bracing for another ‘severe cyclonic storm’ Yaas“#CycloneYaas will become the second intense tropical cyclone (severe cyclonic storm or above as per the IMD scale) to have formed to the north of 15°N latitude & west of 88°E longitude in the month of May since 1980. Previously, Cyclone Aila had formed over this region in 2009,” tweeted Akshay Deoras, an independent meteorologist and researcher at the University of Reading, England.“Since tropical cyclones generally form further to the south over the Bay of Bengal, #CycloneYaas will become the most intense tropical cyclone that formed so close to #Odisha & #WestBengal coasts in the month of May since 1980 & made landfall over these regions,” he added.A comparatively shorter time over sea could prevent Yaas from intensifying into an extremely severe cyclone (wind speed of 167-221 kmph) or a super cyclone (over 222 kmph), said IMD scientists but did not rule out the possibility of further intensification.“Comparatively, its time over sea is less. Fani had formed over Andaman Sea, Amphan also formed towards south. After Aila, this is probably the first to be comparatively closer to coast. The landfall location of Yaas will be slightly to the west compared to Amphan which made landfall over Sunderbans,” said Sunitha Devi, in charge, cyclones at IMD.She said warm waters of Bay of Bengal could still provide a lot of energy to Yaas for further intensification. Taking a more intense form cannot be ruled out at the moment, she added. Over Andaman and Nicobar Islands, light to moderate rainfall is likely at most places with heavy to very heavy falls at isolated places on May 23 and 24.

24-05-2021||India||Covaxin trials on children expected to start in June: Bharat Biotech||Bharat Biotech, the maker of coronavirus disease vaccine Covaxin, is expected to start paediatric trials from June, the company's Business Development and International Advocacy Head Dr Raches Ella on Sunday."We focused on developing the product last year. Now our focus is on ramping up our manufacturing capacity. Kids vaccine trials of Bharath Biotech may get the license in the third quarter of this year," Dr Ella said during a virtual conversation with members of FICCI Ladies Organisation (FLO), Hyderabad.Responding to a question from one of the participants, Dr Ella said that Bharat Biotech will be ramping up the manufacturing capacity of Covaxin to 700 million doses by the end of this year."We are happy to have the full support of the government because of which we are able to stand where we are today in this journey. The vaccine is co-developed by us and ICMR. The government placed an advanced purchase order of ₹1,500 crore. This will help us to increase our risk appetite. That is why we are expanding to Bangalore and Gujarat," he added.The young executive of Bharat Biotech also said that the company expects approval from the World Health Organization (WHO) for Covaxin by the end of the third or fourth quarter. Since the vaccine is not included in WHO's Emergency Use Listing (EUL), people who have been fully vaccinated by both doses of Covaxin might not be allowed to travel internationally.Meanwhile, on Covid-19 prevalence among children, NITI Aayog member (Health) Dr VK Paul said on Saturday that seropositivity rate between 10-17 years is roughly the same as between 30-40 and children can also spread the infection."Whenever children contracted the infection then almost always symptoms are minimal, very mild disease or they are asymptomatic and because it is mild the mortality is very very less in them," he said."Protecting children from infection is equally important so that they do not become part of the transmission chain," he further said.Indigenously produced Covaxin, along with AstraZeneca's Covishield and recently approved Sputnik V from Russia, is being used in India for inoculating people against Covid-19.So far, India has administered about 195,004,184 doses of vaccine against coronavirus disease, the most after China and the United States.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covaxin-trials-on-children-expected-to-start-in-june-bharat-biotech-101621826763212.html

He also said the decision of imposing lockdown was a tough call that has brought the situation under control. “I chose to impose lockdown by going against people’s wishes. It was the harshest decision to take as it brings restrictions on their livelihood, but I was ready to face their discontent. Today, the situation has come under control, but we are yet to get success. The success is of the people who have shown restraint, not mine,” Thackeray said.He was addressing an open virtual meeting of expert doctors from the state task force to guide other doctors and parents over dos and don’ts in case a child is found infected with the Covid-19 virus.

It is expected to make landfall on Wednesday evening between Paradip in Odisha and Sagar islands in West Bengal. The storm packs in winds with speed ranging between 155 kmph and 165 kmph, gusting to 185 kmph."It would continue to move north-northwestwards, intensify further and reach Northwest Bay of Bengal near West Bengal and north Odisha coasts by 26th May morning," the Cyclone Warning Division of the IMD said. From Tuesday, it will start bringing heavy rain in coastal areas, the weather department also said.In view of the severity of the cyclone, the army and navy have kept their resources on standby, including military aircraft and warships. The National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) and the coast guard teams are also ready to be deployed to assist civil authorities at short notice, officials said.On Sunday, the Indian Air Force (IAF) airlifted 21 tonnes of relief materials and 334 NDRF personnel to Kolkata and Port Blair, as Andamans are also threatened by the cyclone which formed in the Bay of Bengal. According to a report by PTI, the IAF has kept 11 aircraft and 25 helicopters ready to carry out relief work.Prime Minister Narendra Modi chaired a high-level meeting on Sunday to review the preparedness of the state and central agencies ahead of the expected landfall of the cyclone. During the meeting, PM Modi called for a timely evacuation of those involved in offshore activities.He also asked officials to work in close coordination with the state authorities to ensure people living in high-risk areas are evacuated safely.PM Modi also stressed on the need to ensure that the time duration of outages of the power supply and communication network is minimum and these links are restored swiftly, PTI reported citing PMO statement.In Odisha, the navy has positioned eight flood relief teams and four diving teams. Meanwhile, the West Bengal government has set up a control room at the state secretariat Nabanna to monitor the situation. Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee will stay in the control room during the period.The neighbouring Bangladesh which also shares a border with West Bengal, is also monitoring the situation. "All the boats and fishing trawlers have been ordered to come close to the coast as a precautionary measure. Tomorrow (Monday) we will have a better idea where it is heading," new agency AFP quoted Bangladesh Meteorological Department senior weather forecaster Bazlur Rashid, as saying on Sunday.Cyclone Yaas is set to hit days after the severe cyclonic storm, Tauktae, wreaked havoc along India's west coast, leaving a trail of destruction behind.The storm left over 100 people dead and damaged thousands of houses in Gujarat, Goa, Maharashtra, Karnataka and Kerala. Besides at least 70 people died after a barge sank in the Arabian Sea during the storm.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/how-india-is-bracing-for-another-severe-cyclonic-storm-yaas-101621824750126.html

"External Affairs Minister will have two interactions with business forums on economic and Covid-related cooperation between India and the US," said the ministry statement.India is engaged in talks with various US entities involved in Covid vaccines production and is looking forward to procuring and subsequently producing these vaccines. The issue of vaccine procurement is expected to be a key agenda item during Jaishankar's interaction with US leadership and other stakeholders.The US has already announced that it is going to distribute 80 million vaccines from its stockpile to countries in need.With India hit badly by the second Covid wave, efforts of New Delhi will focus on getting the maximum and also looking for tie-ups with vaccine developers to produce in India.US has a stockpile 60 million Astra Zeneca vaccine doses and also Pfizer, Moderna and Johnson & Johnson Covid-19 vaccines.US is playing a lead role in assisting India's fight against the Covid-19 virus.

24-05-2021||India||Supreme Court to hear PIL over financial stress to borrowers due to Covid-19||The Supreme Court will on Monday hear a Public Interest Litigation (PIL) on the financial stress faced by the borrowers during Covid-19 time. The PIL has been filed by a lawyer Vishal Tiwari and seeks directions to the Centre to take measures to overcome the financial stress.The petition will be heard by a two-judge vacation bench of justices Ashok Bhushan and MR Shah.The PIL sought direction to the Centre to permit all the lending (financial) institutions to grant interest-free moratorium period for term loan and defer the payment of loan instalments for a period of six months or till the situation from Covid-19 normalises.It has also sought a direction from the Centre to banks and other financial institutions to not take strict action against the property of a borrower for six months, citing the tough lives of daily wage earners which has been affected by lockdown-like measures imposed due to the pandemic."Their financial burden should be decreased and citizens should not lose their dignity. Financial policies are made by the government but in the present time above financial policies, the question is of survival. And the population of our nation should survive with dignity and without any stress," the petitioner said in his plea.In March this year, the Supreme Court ordered banks against charging borrowers any penal interest or compound interest (interest on interest) on loans during the moratorium on repayment of loans from March to August 2020 in view of the Covid-19 pandemic.It rejected a request by individuals and traders’ associations for waiver of complete interest during the moratorium.The court clarified any penal interest or compound interest charged by banks for non-payment of any loan amount during moratorium shall be refundable. And if the bank is not in a position to refund, the same shall be adjusted in the loan amount, it added.The bench said decisions on economic policy matters should be left to the government and courts should not interfere even if a second view is possible.(With inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/supreme-court-to-hear-pil-over-financial-stress-to-borrowers-due-to-covid19-101621819972118.html

Sandhu, the nephew of freedom fighter Bhagat Singh, died recently due to post-Covid complications."When the government wants to talk, the Samyukta Kisan Morcha will talk,” Tikait said, asserting that it has to be about repealing the Centre's new farm laws.The Samyukta Kisan Morcha (SKM), an umbrella body of over 40 protesting farmer unions, on Friday had written to the prime minister, urging resumption of talks over the three farm laws they have been agitating against since November last year.Several rounds of talks between farmers and the government have failed to break the deadlock over the three central laws.A government panel had met farmers leaders on January 22. There have been no talks between the two sides since January 26 when the farmers' tractor rally in the national capital turned violent.Tikait said May 26 will mark six months of the farmers' protest at Delhi borders."For six months, farmers have been protesting at border points, but the government is not listening,” he said.Twelve major opposition parties, including the Congress, TMC, Left parties, SP, NCP and the DMK, on Sunday extended their support to a countrywide protest call given by the Samyukta Kisan Morcha on May 26.According to Haryana BKU chief Gurnam Singh Chaduni, farmers in large numbers from Karnal district on Sunday left for the Singhu border as farmers will be observing May 26 as "black day" to mark six months of their protest.Farmers have been camping at Delhi's borders since November 2020 demanding that the Farmers' Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, Farmers' (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020 and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020 be rolled back and a new law made to guarantee minimum support price for crops.The government, however, has maintained the three central laws are pro-farmer.

24-05-2021||India||Wrestler Sushil arrested over colleague’s murder in stadium||Double Olympic medallist, Sushil Kumar, wanted in the murder of fellow wrestler Sagar Dhankad, was arrested by the Delhi Police on Sunday morning from the outskirts of the Capital after being on the run for 19 days and sent to police custody for six days by a city court.Kumar and his five associates are wanted by the police after Dhankad, a former junior national champion, was beaten to death inside the Chhatrasal Stadium, the wrestling hub in northwest Delhi, on May 4. Police had announced a reward of ₹1 lakh for Kumar’s arrest.The Chhatrasal Stadium has virtually been Kumar’s home since his early days in the sport. He is the only Indian to win two individual Olympic medals, bronze at 2008 Beijing and silver at 2012 London, where he was the flag-bearer. He is also the only Indian to win a world championship, in Russia in 2010.Delhi Police deputy commissioner (special cell), Pramod Kushwah, announced the arrest of Kumar and his accomplice Ajay. “Both have been charged with murder, attempt to murder, assault, criminal conspiracy, criminal intimidation and under other relevant sections, including the Arms Act,” Kushwah said. Police said the two were arrested from Mundka in outer Delhi when they came on a scooter to borrow money from a contact. The Delhi Police special cell acted on information received from Punjab, where the two men had taken shelter.“As per our information and surveillance, hours after the murder took place, Kumar along with his associates had fled to Haridwar. They had switched off their cell phones and were frequently changing locations to evade arrest. In the past 19 days, they went to Rishikesh and then to Dehradun. They then stayed at a few places in Haryana and went to Punjab. Late on Saturday night, we got information that Kumar will come to Mundka along with another of his wanted associate. We set a trap and arrested both soon after they were spotted near a metro station,” said an investigator, who was part of the operation but did not wish to be named.Another officer said questioning the two men and detailed analysis of call logs and other technical evidence will lead the police to the remaining accused. A non-bailable warrant was issued against Kumar and six others on May 15 and a lookout circular on May 10.Dhankad and his two friends, Sonu and Amit Kumar, were allegedly assaulted by Kumar and his friends inside the stadium. Dhankad subsequently died. Police believe the two groups clashed over a disputed flat in Model Town area that Kumar had rented to Dhankad. Investigators believe a dispute over rent snowballed into the clash. The day after the clash, police arrested one Prince Dalal and recovered a video clip from his phone that purportedly shows Kumar and others assaulting Dhankad and his friends.Sagar’s father, Ashok told ANI: “There is strong evidence against him (Kumar), severe punishment should be given to him. I have full faith in law.”Kumar’s father-in-law and wrestling coach Satpal Singh did not respond to calls. A person close to the wrestler’s family said: “The family is naturally very disturbed. It’s not only the family, but when something of this sort has happened, relatives and people who are close to him are also worried.”Delhi Metropolitan Magistrate, Divya Malhotra, sent Kumar to six days in police custody saying the “allegations against the accused are grave in nature”. The court allowed police to interrogate Kumar and co-accused Ajay, noting that a number of persons, including notorious gangs based outside Delhi, are involved and are yet to be arrested.“The CCTV installed at the place of incident has allegedly been tampered with and there is no sign of its DVR. All these points require detailed investigation by the police,” the order said. The police had sought custody for 12 days.Additional Public Prosecutor Atul Shrivastava told the court that five persons, including Dhankad, were abducted from Model Town and Shalimar Bagh, brought to Chhatarsal Stadium and mercilessly beaten up by the accused persons and their associates with sticks and fire arms.He submitted that more than 15 people are suspected to be involved. A loaded gun with live cartridges was recovered from a vehicle parked outside the stadium, and subsequently some sticks were also recovered. Kumar’s interrogation was required to ascertain motive, recover the weapon used and the clothes he wore during the incident.“We have to establish the chain of incidents and need the custody of Kumar for recreation of the scene of crime. We have to recover the mobile and SIM of the accused…. The camera at the stadium was dismantled and he took away the DVR of the place. This has to be recovered.”BS Jakhar, Kumar’s advocate, opposed remand and said all the things could be recovered in 3-4 days. He said the pistol found in Kumar’s car is a legal weapon issued by the Delhi police.He said Kumar is a celebrated wrestler and not some notorious criminal who may flee from justice. “Rather he has clean antecedents and has been falsely implicated in the case only to extort money. Moreover, both the accused persons are ready to cooperate in the investigation,” he said.Kumar, a senior commercial manager with Northern Railway, is on deputation to the Delhi government and was posted as Officer on Special Duty at the Chhatrasal Stadium. He is also president of the School Games Federation of India.“Sushil Kumar is one of our star wrestlers; he has been a motivation for so many young wrestlers. To see him in this situation is very sad and disappointing,” wrestling federation assistant secretary, Vinod Tomar, said.(With inputs from Avishek Roy)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/wrestler-sushil-arrested-over-colleague-s-murder-in-stadium-101621813978996.html
24-05-2021||India||Now, Ghaziabad hospital reports 7 cases of ‘white fungus’ infection||As many as seven recovered Covid patients have been diagnosed with invasive aspergillosis, commonly known as white fungus, so far in Ghaziabad.According to the health department, while cases of white fungus are new, as many as 41 patients of mucormycosis or black fungus are being treated in the district as of now. However, at least three patients in the district have developed both the fungal infections, doctors said.The Harsh ENT Hospital in Raj Nagar has a total of 26 such patients – seven are patients of white fungus while the rest are black fungus patients.Doctors at the hospital said that white fungus in the patients was confirmed on the basis of histopathology reports.“Invasive aspergillosis or white fungus or is a post-Covid complication in which the infection goes to the lungs and causes pneumonia, while black fungus takes a different route and goes to the sinus, eyes and further to the brain. Three of our 26 patients have developed both the fungi. These infections develop in the post-Covid stage in patients, after 15-30 days (of testing negative),” said Dr BP Tyagi, senior ENT surgeon, who is treating the patients.Invasive aspergillosis is a rapidly progressive, often fatal infection that occurs in patients who are severely immunosuppressed. In this case, doctors said, most patients are those who have recovered from Covid who had low immunity because of steroidal drugs they were administered to fight the coronavirus disease.“These are mostly found in diabetic patients. While black fungus can be operated upon and taken out from the eyes and sinus, the white fungus has only one mode of treatment – through injections as – parts of the lungs cannot be taken out. While patients are administered Amphotericin injections, those suffering from white fungus are also given posaconazole injections and tablets, in addition. All seven patients suffering white fungus have mild to moderate symptoms,” Dr Tyagi added.Eleven of the mild to moderate symptoms of black fungus and getting treatment through the OPD and staying in home isolation, the doctor added.Doctors at Max Hospital, Vaishali said that they have 13 patients getting treatment for black fungus and two of these are likely to be discharged Monday.“Of these, a couple of patients have mild mucormycosis while others have sino-orbital-cerebral mucormycosis, where eyes and brain are involved. In a couple of cases, enucleation (removal of eye) was needed. There is another patient who would need mandibular (lower jaw) reconstruction, like the one needed in cancer patients. Two patients, who had mild symptoms are to be discharged after successful endoscopic treatment,” said Dr Sharad Joshi, principal consultant, department of pulmonology at Max Hospital, Vaishali.The district’s chief medical officer, Dr NK Gupta, said that the 41 patients in Ghaziabad getting treatment for these fungal infections include those from outside the district as well.“The drug posaconazole is effective in cases of white fungus, and is easily available. It has been seen that such infections have developed in Covid-recovered patients. We have directed hospitals to ensure proper hygiene and proper cleaning of equipment, including oxygen pipelines,” Dr Gupta said.“For cases of black fungus which require the drug amphotericin b, we have asked hospitals to refer patients to higher centres,” the CMO.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/now-ghaziabad-hospital-reports-7-cases-of-white-fungus-infection-101621813575801.html
24-05-2021||India||Parents, students in Delhi against CBSE exams amid Covid-19 spike||With the Centre once again not able to decide on the pending Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) Class 12 exams during a high-level meeting on Sunday, students, parents, principals, and education experts expressed concerns over the delays, with many of them now demanding that the exams be cancelled entirely.On Sunday, while the high-level meeting, chaired by Union defence minister Rajnath Singh remained inconclusive, officials said the majority of states were in favour of conducting exams, regardless of the format.Anand Saxena (17), a Class 12 student at a private school in south Delhi said, “While we are still struggling with the second wave of the pandemic and the possibility of a third wave, how is it even possible to conduct exams in such a situation? Who can take the guarantee that the situation will be better by July and August? We have been in Class 12 for the last 15 months. The government should cancel the exams and promote students using alternative methods of evaluation.”Parents, too, said they weren’t in favour of letting students travel for exams till cases subsided completely.Sweta Singh, the mother of a Class 12 student at a Mayur Vihar private school, said, “The government itself is conducting online meetings, but expects our 16-17-year-old children to appear in exams in person. We are not in favour of sending our children for exams till the number of cases comes to zero in the city.”Several principals said the government should act promptly to stop the anxiety children have been facing for 15 months.Ameeta Mulla Wattal, principal of Springdales School, Pusa Road, said, “We can’t leave students in the lurch. A clear decision needs to be taken, since children are going through a lot of mental stress... We need to come up with alternative criteria, since the pandemic continues to prevail. Students went through a lot of anxiety last year and the same is happening this year as well. We can also explore the possibility of delinking board exams from college entrance tests.”AK Jha, principal of the government co-ed Sarvodaya Vidyalaya in Rohini, said conducting exams amid the ongoing surge may be extremely risky. “If the government conducts exams by August-September, cases may rise once again. Students who are sick with mild symptoms might conceal their illness and appear for the exams due to the fear of missing out on a year. Students can also carry home the virus and endanger their family members,” he said.Educationist Meeta Sengupta said the government should think about doing away from the tradition of assessing the progress of students on the basis of “exams”.“It takes a lot of courage to be safe. And educational leaders need to demonstrate this courage and move away from tradition. There are several ways to promote students, and they need to work towards that, rather than tinker with the exam as a filter,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/parents-students-in-delhi-against-cbse-exams-amid-covid-19-spike-101621812685468.html
24-05-2021||India||Call on Class 12 exam by June 1 after state inputs||A high-level meeting called by the Union ministry of education on Sunday to discuss the feasibility of conducting CBSE Class 12 exams remained inconclusive, even as officials said there was “broad consensus” that the test must be held for a limited number of subjects and with a shorter duration after the Covid-19 situation comes under control.Union education minister Ramesh Pokhriyal “Nishank” said a decision on the matter was likely to be taken by June 1.The Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) has proposed to conduct exams between July and August, tentatively, and results may be announced in September, an official with knowledge of the matter said. Around 1,400,000 students are scheduled to appear in CBSE Class 12 exams this year.At least two states, Maharashtra and Delhi, were of the opinion at the meeting that the exams should not be conducted amid the pandemic. Several states also raised the demand for vaccinating students and teachers before conducting the exams, the official said on condition of anonymity. The Centre has asked states to submit their detailed suggestions on the matter by Tuesday.The virtual meeting was convened to decide on the Class 12 board exams and subsequent entrance examinations that were postponed earlier due to the second wave of Covid-19 across the country.Pokhriyal said that an “informed” and “collaborative” decision will be taken on Class 12 exams at the earliest. During the meeting, he also discussed “how important Class 12 exams are to decide the future of students”.“The meeting was extremely fruitful as we received immensely valuable suggestions. I have requested the state governments to send me their detailed suggestions by May 25. I am confident we will be able to arrive at an informed, collaborative decision regarding the exams and remove the uncertainty among students’ and parent’s minds by informing them of our final decision at the earliest. I want to reiterate that both students’ and teachers’ safety, security, and future are supremely important to us,” he tweeted.The education ministry issued a statement that said: “Various options regarding the methodology, process, duration and timings of the exams were discussed. While a broad consensus was there, however, it was decided that States and UTs may like to further examine the matter and send their feedback in writing by the 25th of May, 2021.”The meeting was chaired by Union defence minister Rajnath Singh and attended by several other ministers including Pokhriyal, minister of women and child development Smriti Irani, and information and broadcasting minister Prakash Javadekar. CBSE officials, education ministers of all states, education secretaries, and chairpersons of the state examination boards were also present at the meeting.During the meeting, two options proposed by CBSE for conducting Class 12 exams were discussed at length. In the first option, the examination for major subjects may be conducted at the “designated examination centres and in the existing format” like previous years, and for the minor subjects, “marks can be calculated as per the assessment scheme based on the performance in the major subjects.”Nineteen of the 174 subjects offered to Class 12 students are considered major subjects by CBSE. “Conducting exams in this mode will only be possible if the board has three months and another 45 days for compartment exams,” according to the document.The second option involves multiple changes, including conducting exams at schools where the students are enrolled, reducing the duration of examination, and switching to only multiple choice and short answer type questions. The process, as per the second proposal, can be completed in 45 days and results can be declared within 15 days of completion of the exams.According to the tentative timeline provided by CBSE, under the first option, the pre-exam activities may take place from July 1 to July 31 and the exams will be held from August 1 to August 20. The tentative result date will be September 20.Under the second option, the pre-exam activities will tentatively take place between July 10 and July 15. The first phase of the examination will be held between July 15 and August 1, while the second phase will take place between August 5 and August 26. The tentative date for the result will be September 5.A senior official who attended the meeting said that at least eight states, including Delhi and Maharashtra, demanded vaccination for children and teachers before exams are conducted. “Majority of the states suggested that the exams could be conducted for only the main subjects in shorter duration as suggested by the CBSE in its option B… The ministry will compile all the suggestions received by the states and UTs and then a final call will be taken after consulting with the higher authorities,” the official said.Delhi deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia, who also attended the meeting, said his government was not in favour of conducting exams amid the pandemic. “The consensus of the entire education community is that conducting exams is important but not by putting our students and teachers at risk. As a guardian of the State, Delhi Government is taking a stand to keep the safety and security of our students as the first and most important priority. Until we are able to vaccinate our students, we should not even think of administering the 12th Board Exams,” Sisodia said.Maharashtra education minister Varsha Gaikwad said: “Keeping in mind the ongoing pandemic situation ..., the option of a ‘no-examination route’ for class 12th students should be actively examined...Our focus should now be in evolving a uniform assessment policy, vaccination of all teachers & eligible students, and safe resumption of schools, colleges campuses for the next academic year.”Among the states that were in favour of conducting the exams were Uttar Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Punjab and Bihar. Punjab school education minister Vijay Inder Singla suggested that the exams of only three elective subjects be held. “If the education boards conduct examinations for elective subjects, it will be easy to maintain social distancing and other mandatory protocols in view of the pandemic,” he said.Officials in the Bihar education board suggested that exams should be conducted in the online mode.Uttar Pradesh deputy chief minister Dinesh Sharma on Sunday assured the Union education minister that their government was fully prepared to conduct the CBSE Class 12 examinations. “Since only a few thousands appear in the CBSE examination from Uttar Pradesh, there will be no problem in conducting the examination the manner in which the CBSE board wants.”Many students have been running social media campaigns demanding the cancellation of Class 12 exams amid the pandemic. A plea has also been filed in the Supreme Court asking for directions to the Centre, CBSE, and the CISCE to cancel the Class 12 examinations.(With inputs from state bureaus)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/call-on-class-12-exam-by-june-1-after-state-inputs-101621812020403.html

24-05-2021||India||Covid-19: What you need to know today||The Union government, and the governments of many states (Uttar Pradesh is a case in point, but the list includes even progressive states such as Tamil Nadu) have been accused of turning a blind eye to (in the case of the former) or actively orchestrating (in the case of the latter) the under-reporting of deaths from the coronavirus disease (Covid-19).How do you under-report deaths from Covid-19?Technically, this is possible in two ways, one generic and the other, specific.One, every year, in India, a certain number of deaths do go unreported. The dead are buried or cremated locally and informally (which means a graveyard or cemetery is rarely their final resting place) and the families do not bother to register the deaths, because there is nothing to be gained by doing so. In fact, applying for and receiving a death certificate may actually involve costs. Conversations I have had with government officials, volunteers at NGOs, and statisticians all converge on the point that these numbers have been coming down over the years. Over the past seven years, especially, India’s efficiency of welfare-delivery has greatly improved, with at least some of this welfare being in the form of a cash transfer into an Aadhaar-enabled bank account. In such cases, should the next of kin want to claim the balance lying in these after the account-holder’s death, they need a death certificate. It’s a simple cost-benefit equation.Two, in the current scenario, where states want to showcase their effective handling of Covid-19, it’s easy to misreport a cause of death. For instance, some of the same government officials and volunteers at NGOs tell me that, anecdotally, they are seeing a spike in deaths from diseases such as typhoid in some of India’s most backward states. HT’s own reportage shows that in many rural areas, testing is inadequate, and when someone dies, local health officials can pretty much decide how they died.Few states follow Indian Council of Medical Research guidelines on testing the dead for Covid-19. And even when those who test positive for Covid-19, and are hospitalised for the illness pass on, death audit committees — most states have one — often ascribe Covid-19 deaths to co-morbidities.Apart from the sheer dishonesty involved, such under-reporting affects our understanding of the pandemic itself, and its current and future trajectory in the country. I also believe lying about this disrespects the dead more than publishing photographs of funeral pyres or hundreds of shallow graves on river-beds. For reasons that have to do with morality, good governance, and science, both the federal government and the states need to address this issue (this is definitely more worthy of their attention and time than an editorial in The Lancet or the nomenclature of a variant of the virus).I’d like to suggest that the office of the Registrar General and Census Commissioner work with the states (which, in turn, will have to work with municipalities and corporations) on compiling a 12-year database of deaths. The long period average, between 2010 and 2019, by district and cause, can be the base. The deviation from these in 2020, irrespective of the mentioned cause of death, represent the excess deaths on account of Covid-19. And it is important to start updating this year’s deaths in the database too. Only this will provide a true picture of the pandemic’s cost, in terms of human lives, in India. And only this will provide an accurate epidemiological perspective of the pandemic’s run through the country — and help prepare for the third wave.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid19-what-you-need-to-know-today-101621811046286.html
24-05-2021||India||8 DNLA militants killed in Assam encounter||Eight Dimasa National Liberation Army militants were on Sunday killed in an encounter with security forces in Assam’s West Karbi Anglong district, along the Nagaland border, a senior official said.Following specific information about the presence of the militants in the area, a team of police officers and Assam Rifles personnel launched an operation, led by West Karbi Anglong Additional Superintendent of Police (ASP) Prakash Sonowal.An exchange of fire ensued between the security personnel and the militants in Michibailung area, following which eight members of the outfit were killed, the officer said.Six bodies were initially recovered, and two others, suspected to be that of the outfit’s top leaders, were spotted later in the day during combing operations in the remote region, along the interstate border.Assam chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma said that the operation has almost neutralised the DNLA and appealed to militants to shun violence.Assam Director General of Police Bhaskar Jyoti Mahanta said one security personnel was injured during the operation, but “he is now out of danger”.“DNLA has been involved in kidnapping, extortion and killings... A huge cache of weapons were recovered...,” he added.With Agency inputs||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/8-dnla-militants-killed-in-assam-encounter-101621810808792.html
24-05-2021||India||PM Modi reviews steps ahead of Cyclone Yaas||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday reviewed the preparedness of states and central government agencies ahead of the expected landfall of Cyclone Yaas – a low-pressure area in the Bay of Bengal has intensified into a depression that will cross the West Bengal and Odisha coasts on May 26 as a “very severe cyclonic storm” – and called for the timely evacuation of people.India has placed its military aircraft and warships on standby for rescue and relief ahead of Cyclone Yaas making landfall on the country’s eastern coast on May 26, officials familiar with the development said on Sunday. Army, navy and coast guard relief teams are also ready to be deployed to assist civil authorities at short notice, the officials said.At a high-level meeting, the Prime Minister asked officials to work in close coordination with states to ensure the safe evacuation of people from high-risk areas, and to ensure that the time duration of outages of power supply and communication network are minimum, a statement by the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) said.The Centre and states likely to be affected by Yaas have enhanced their vigilance and preparedness amid fresh memories of Tauktae – the strongest Arabian Sea cyclone in over 20 years – and the havoc wreaked by Amphan last year. The fact that the crossing of the cyclone, by current estimates, coincides with the spring tide (which could mean more storm surges) is worrying, according to experts.“It is very likely to cross north Odisha-West Bengal between the Paradip and Sagar islands by evening of 26th May as a very severe cyclonic storm,” it added. The state governments as well as the Centre are preparing for the cyclone that will bring winds with a speed ranging 155-165 kmph and gusting to 185 kmph.At the meeting, Modi asked officials to ensure proper coordination and planning with state governments so that there is no disruption in Covid-19 treatment and vaccination in hospitals. He called for involving various stakeholders such as coastal communities and industries, and reaching out to them and sensitising them, the PMO said.The ministry of home affairs is reviewing the situation and is in touch with the state governments, union territories and the central agencies concerned. It has released the first instalment of SDRF in advance to all states, and the National Disaster Response Force has pre-positioned 46 teams which are equipped with boats, tree-cutters, telecom equipment in five states and UT. In addition, 13 teams were being airlifted on Sunday for deployment and 10 teams were kept on standby, the PMO said. Union home minister Amit Shah, other ministers and senior officials attended the meeting with the PM.The Indian Air Force has kept one C-17, one IL-76, three C-130s, four An-32s and two Dornier transport aircraft on readiness for humanitarian assistance and disaster relief, IAF spokesperson Wing Commander Ashish Moghe said on Sunday. “Additionally, 11 Mi-17 V5s, two Chetaks, three Cheetahs, two Dhruvs and seven Mi-17 helicopters are also on alert for any eventuality,” he said.As of Sunday, the IAF airlifted 950 National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) personnel and 70 tonnes of cargo from Jamnagar, Varanasi, Patna and Arakonnam to Kolkata, Bhubaneswar and Port Blair in 15 aircraft.The navy, which was at the centre of rescue and relief efforts in Arabian Sea in the aftermath of Cyclone Tauktae, has also shifted into overdrive to respond to the situation likely to unfold along the eastern coast.The armed forces have commenced preparations to mitigate the impact of Cyclone Yaas, the defence ministry said.“The Indian Navy, fresh from HADR and rescue operations on the western coast, has moved 10 HADR pallets to Bhubaneswar and Kolkata, while five HADR pallets are ready at Port Blair. Eight ships of the Eastern Naval Command and Andaman and Nicobar Command have been embarked with HADR bricks (relief material) to provide succour to the people likely to be impacted,” the ministry said in a statement.Four diving teams and 10 flood relief columns are ready in Kolkata, Bhubaneswar and Chilika for providing assistance to the civil authorities at short notice, the officials said. Also, seven flood relief teams and two diving teams are ready at different locations in Andaman and Nicobar Islands. Naval aircraft and helicopters in Visakhapatnam and Port Blair are on alert to carry out search and rescue missions, the officials said.“Eight flood relief columns and three engineer task forces of the Indian Army are ready for immediate deployment on requisition by the civil administration. The armed forces are in constant touch with the civil administration of the affected states. Armed forces teams are aware of the need to keep the road and rail links open to ensure uninterrupted supply of life saving oxygen and drugs required for treatment at Covid hospitals,” the statement added.The ministry said the Indian Coast Guard has also mobilised its assets.“All ashore, afloat and aviation units are on high alert and ICG ships and aircraft have been deployed in Bay of Bengal and Andaman Sea,” said another statement.“In addition, 31 coast guard disaster relief teams with inflatable boats, lifebuoys and lifejackets are on standby. Medical teams and ambulances have also been kept on standby for swift mobilisation,” it added.With inputs from agencies||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-reviews-steps-ahead-of-cyclone-101621810110207.html
24-05-2021||India||Aashritha V Olety is India’s 1st woman flight test engineer||In yet another first for women in the Indian military, an officer of the Indian Air Force (IAF) has graduated from the Air Force Test Pilot School as the country’s first woman flight test engineer, officials familiar with the development said on Sunday.Squadron Leader Aashritha V Olety is the first and only woman in the IAF qualified for the role, and as a flight test engineer, she will be responsible for evaluating aircraft and airborne systems before their induction into the armed forces, said one of the officials. Olety, a native of Karnataka, has graduated as part of the 43rd Flight Test Course after completing a one-year course at the pilot school.Excluding the medical wing in which women have been serving for decades, the army accounts for 6,807 women officers, the IAF 1,607 and the navy has 704 women officers. In percentage terms, women still form a small part of the military -- 0.56% of the army, 1.08% of the air force and 6.5% of the navy.Test pilots, test engineers and test instrumentation engineers form an important team in test flying, said Air Vice Marshal Manmohan Bahadur (retd), a former test pilot and test flying instructor. “It’s a challenging avenue that requires theoretical and practical experience to test aircraft,” Bahadur said.The headcount of women in the military has increased almost three-fold over the last six years, with more avenues being opened for them at a steady pace. There are a total 9,118 women serving the army, navy and air force, with the services giving them more opportunities to boost career progression, the government told Parliament in February.One of the turning points for women in the military came in 2015 when the IAF decided to induct them into the fighter stream. The navy has also opened more avenues for women in recent years . Tanks and combat positions in infantry are still no go zones for women, who were allowed to join the armed forces outside the medical stream for the first time in 1992.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/aashritha-v-olety-is-india-s-1st-woman-flight-test-engineer-101621808906610.html

24-05-2021||India||Kamal Nath booked for ‘maligning image of India’ with variant remark||Madhya Pradesh Congress Committee (MPCC) president Kamal Nath was booked on Sunday for allegedly maligning the image of India internationally by claiming that the “Indian variant” of the coronavirus was responsible for the second wave of the pandemic, police said.The case was registered on the complaint of medical education department minister, Vishwas Sarang, and other BJP leaders. BJP leaders alleged that Nath held a virtual press conference and blamed the “Indian variant” for the second wave. BJP leaders also lodged the complaint on a video in which Nath is seen addressing Congress MLAs on the issue of shortage of fertilizers and other issues and telling them it is the right opportunity to start a fire so that farmers would get justice.The case has been registered under section 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant) of the IPC and section 54 (punishment for false warning) of the Disaster Management Act by crime branch, said Irshad Wali, deputy inspector general (DIG) of police.According to the FIR, “Kamal Nath said corona started with Chinese variant but now it is Indian variant of Covid-19 which is responsible for the second wave and many countries have suspended flights due to the Indian variant. Nath also said Indians who are working and studying in foreign countries are facing trouble due to it. But in real, foreign countries are trying to help India by sending important things to fight against the epidemic. Nath tried to misguide people and to create disturbance in the country.”“Nath also violated the norms of WHO in which the organisation clearly said no variant of virus should be named after a country, person, organisation or bird’s name,” the FIR said.The FIR also mentioned that Nath tried to spread anarchy by telling the Congress MLAs to start a fire to ensure justice for farmers.Minister Vishwas Sarang said, “Nath and other Congressmen are trying to create unrest in India and Madhya Pradesh by doing dirty politics as they had done during the 1984 riots. Nath insulted our country internationally and he should have been booked under sedition charges.”After the FIR, Nath said, “People who lost family members due to shortage of oxygen, injections, beds and other facilities during the second wave should also register an FIR against the heartless chief minister and other ministers of MP. People, who lost their family members due to Covid 19 and their deaths have not been included as Covid deaths, should also register an FIR against the CM and his cabinet ministers.”Former minister and Congress MLA Jitu Patwari said, “The BJP-led state government is misusing power to hide the data and the real pain of Covid-infected people. They are not concerned about India’s image but they are more concerned about the Prime Minister and BJP’s image. They should book all the Congress leaders because we will not keep mum on this lie of the state and the central government.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kamal-nath-booked-for-maligning-image-of-india-with-variant-remark-101621807675370.html
24-05-2021||India||Unified agency mooted for cross-border crimes||India should have Integrated Law Enforcement Centres (ILECs) on all its borders on the lines of the United States’ Department of Homeland Security (DHS), the UK’s Border Agency and the European Union’s Frontex to deal with cross-border crimes including infiltration, terrorism, smuggling of drugs, cattle, fake currency, arms, etc., the Bureau of Police Research and Development (BPRD) has recommended to the Centre.In a detailed report, prepared by IPS officer Santosh Mehra (additional director general – BPRD) and submitted recently to the ministry of home affairs (MHA), it was stated that the ILECs, working inside the existing Integrated Check Posts (ICPs), will have the mandate to register, investigate and dispose of all types of cross-border crimes with jurisdiction clearly defined and coinciding with government regulations with respect to border guarding forces.They will maintain a wealth of cross-border crime data and process it for short-, medium- and long-term trends. “Various factors affecting border security, such as political, economic, social, technological and legal environments etc. will be monitored. The data will be collated from different stakeholder agencies, mass-and-social-media, as well as cross-border sources,” according to the report, reviewed by HT.Subsequently, the ILECs will establish a situation room, where on the basis of collected, collated and analysed information from various sources, near real-time situation of the borders will be built up; and on the basis of continuous inflows of information, such situation will be updated. “On the basis of time-series data, the trends of border-crimes in a particular sector of border will be analyzed and utilized for planning routine operations by border guarding forces,” the report said.It has been recommended that each ILEC can have small self-sustaining investigative units of Customs, Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB), National Investigation Agency (NIA), Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI), Enforcement Directorate (ED), local police, Anti-Trafficking (Human) Cells, Intelligence Bureau (IB), Special Bureau of Research and Analysis Wing (RAW) and wildlife wing of ministry of environment, apart from officials from border guarding forces.Currently, all these agencies work in silos when it comes to border crimes.“There are different agencies active on (India’s) land borders operating within the silos of their specific mandate striving for agency[1]specific micro-level optimization with lesser degree of inter-agencies cooperation, coordination and complementarity. In fact, many a time, inter agencies competition leads to sub-optimal outcome at national level. There are instances of both gaps as well as overlapping in the role, jurisdiction and working of the agencies,” the report said.Citing examples of the US and Europe, the BPRD pointed out that following the 9/11 attacks, the US underwent the biggest government reorganisation by merging 22 agencies from different departments (equivalent to ministries in India) into Department of Homeland Security (DHS). Similarly, Frontex is the main institutional arrangement for the external border management of the European Union; it covers all border-related threats of the EU. Likewise, the UK Border Agency was formed in 2008 by the merger of Border and Immigration Agency, UK Visas and Port of entry functions of HM Revenue and Customs, to look after all border crimes. Australia and Canada, too, have similar institutions.Mehra has stated that the ILECs will lead to synergy in efforts of different agencies. “The overall effectiveness of agencies while working in unison is likely to scale up in comparison to the existing situation, where they are working in their respective silos. For example, the powers of interception and electronic surveillance available with IB/RAW etc. can be complemented with the expertise available with NCB, the reach and manpower availability of BSF, the investigative skills and experience of the local police (all available under one roof) to detect and destroy modules focused on narco-terrorism,” the report prepared by him said.The report recommends preparing a draft act for the implementation of ILECs.Sameer Patil, fellow at the International Security Studies Programme at Gateway House, said: “India has been lacking synergy when it comes to border security management.

Five male cheetahs and three females will be donated by Endangered Wildlife Trust (EWT) of South Africa, said Alok Kumar, principal chief conservator of forest (Wildlife).The translocation of African Cheetah is a part of Government of India to reintroduce the fastest land animal in India after extinction of the Asiatic cheetah in the 1950s.The final call was taken after EWT national Cheetah Metapopulation manager Vincet Van Der Merwe visited Kuno eight days ago to assess the preparations and suitable habitat for cheetahs, said Kumar.Merwe found Kuno National Park to be one of the best habitats for translocation of cheetah in India. He gave a few minor suggestions including fencing to make it more suitable for the cheetah by September, said Kumar.Divisional forest officer, Sheopur, PK Verma said, “The expert, Merwe said Kuno has a perfect grassland and prey base for cheetahs. We have started preparation for translocation.”The central government has allocated ₹14 crore for the project. The state government had earlier projected an estimated expenditure of ₹22 crore under Annual Operation Plan (AOP, said a forest official, who didn’t wish to be quoted.“We don’t want to take any risk because it is a matter of pride for our country and the success of this project will decide the fate of translocation of more cheetahs in India,” said the officer.Additional PCCF (wildlife) JS Chauhan said: “The money will be used for the development of fencing, cutting thorny trees, cages for cheetah and transportation of cheetah from South Africa.”The Supreme Court approved the project in January 2020 and formed a three-member committee comprising of former director Wildlife of India Ranjit Singh, DG of Wildlife of India Dhananjay Mohan and DIG, Wildlife, Ministry of Environment and Forests to guide the National Tiger Conservation Authority in translocation of the African cheetah from South Africa and Namibia to India.The expert committee visited four sites in MP and one in Rajasthan to select the suitable habitat for cheetah. In early January, the committee submitted its report to the state government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/eight-cheetahs-to-be-translocated-from-africa-to-mp-s-kuno-national-park-101621807025578.html
24-05-2021||India||First instance of gharial breeding in natural habitat reported in Odisha||At least 28 gharial hatchlings have been sighted with their mother in the Satkosia gorge of the Mahanadi river in the first-ever case of breeding of the reptiles in natural conditions, wildlife officials said on Sunday.The tiny hatchlings were sighted on the back of the mother gharial and were also swimming independently in the gorge by Odisha wildlife officials over the past few days. Distinguishable by their long snout, the gharials are considered to be among the most critically endangered crocodiles with an estimated 200-400 remaining in the rivers of Uttar Pradesh as their habitat is threatened due to human encroachment and disruption of population through fishing activities. They are also genetically weak as compared to salt water crocodiles and muggers. Gharials caught accidentally in fishing nets are either hacked to death or have their snout chopped off by fishermen.Divisional forest officer of the Mahanadi wildlife division, HB Udgata said this is the first time in the past 15 years that gharials were seen breeding in natural conditions away from the artificial breeding centres.“Though we have been trying hard to get them to breed, it was not possible due to boating and fishing activities. In the last one year, four forest divisions around the gorge worked together to make the western part of Satkosia totally inviolate by stopping fishing and boating activities. Three of our research assistants also monitored the gharials and their courtship, which paid off,” said Udgata.The DFO said this is the first time that gharials have bred in natural conditions south of the Chambals where they are normally found. “The key was minimising human interference and it worked. They eat only fish and once fishing stopped they had plenty to eat. Given a chance, wildlife can make a stunning comeback,” he said.Only 14 gharials were spotted at the Satkosia gorge in 2019. A gharial project was started in Tikarpada in 1975 with the aim to increase their population as they are not considered as dangerous as other crocodiles.The state forest department in June 2019 released six gharials fitted with radio transmitters from the Nandankanan zoo into the Mahanadi river to track their migratory routes in order to save them from extinction. While two gharials died, one moved to the Luna river in Kendrapara district and covered around 150km. In December 2019, another radio transmitter-fitted gharial was killed by some fishermen in the Mahanadi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/first-instance-of-gharial-breeding-in-natural-habitat-reported-in-odisha-101621806730677.html

However, only farmers will participate in our movement.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/12-opposition-parties-extend-support-to-farm-unions-stir-on-may-26-101621806443172.html
24-05-2021||India||Barge P305 tragedy: Four more bodies recovered; toll touches 70||The Indian Navy and Indian Coast Guard (ICG) found four more bodies of crew members of barge Papaa305 (P305), which capsized in the Arabian Sea hours after cyclone Tauktae hit the Mumbai coast on May 17, on the seventh day of search and rescue (SAR) operation. The toll of the mishap has now touched 70. Meanwhile the wreck of barge P305 was located on the sea bed.Barge P305, which was deployed at an unmanned platform in Heera oil fields, one of the largest ONGC rigs in the sea, sank about 40 nautical miles west off Mumbai. As Cyclone Tauktae hit the Mumbai coast, the barge got de-anchored on the night of May 16, and hit a platform while drifting in the rough sea. It sank around 7pm on May 17 in choppy seas amid rough weather, which made search and rescue one of the most challenging operations undertaken by the Navy in four decades. Afcons Infrastructure, which leads the consortium that chartered the barge and hired its crew, said 261 members on board and Indian Navy and ICG rescued 186 members and found 70 bodies. A tugboat Varaprada carrying 13 crew members also capsized the same day. Two of its members were rescued by the Navy, while 11 are still missing.The agencies claimed on Sunday they found 17 more bodies at different beaches in Raigad district, Palghar and Valsad at Gujarat. Four of them were found to be of the P305 crew. Officials said seven bodies were recovered from Valsad, one from Daman at Gujarat, one from Arnala beach in Palghar district and eight bodies were found at Alibag, Murud, Nagaon and Sasawne in Raigad district, Maharashtra.A police team from Yellow Gate police station, along with those rescued from P305 and Varaprada, went to Valsad to establish the identities. “We are co-ordinating with the local authorities in Raigad, Daman and Valsad to check if the bodies are of any crew members of the cyclone-hit barges or other fishing boats. The team has also gone with rescued crew members for identifications,” said Suhas Hemade, senior inspector, Yellow Gate police station.Some of the bodies are in decomposed condition and bloated so DNA tests are being conducted to ascertain the identity, said an officer from the Yellow Gate police station.“Barge P305 was located on the seabed after systematic search by INS Maker employing advance side scan sonar. The diving started in the morning and managed to pinpoint the sunken wreck of P305 by specialised teams on board INS Maker and no bodies have been found,” said a Navy officer.INS Maker is proceeding to locate the wreck of tug Varaprada and diving operation will be conducted on Monday, added Navy officials. The search and rescue operation by naval and coast guard ships and helicopters will continue in the area to locate the remaining crew of the sunken vessels, said the officer.So far, 45 bodies have been identified in JJ hospital and 44 handed over to their respective families. Several other recovered bodies are in JJ hospital, but the police are securing DNA samples to ascertain their identity for the families, said a police officer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/barge-p305-tragedy-four-more-bodies-recovered-toll-touches-70-101621804063276.html

24-05-2021||India||Foodgrain stock highest since 2016: Govt data||India registered the highest food grain stock since 2016 this month due to record procurement of wheat from Punjab and Haryana, according to food ministry data.Food Corporation of India (FCI) said it had procured 850.3 metric tonnes (MT) of wheat and rice from farmers across India till May 18; another 260 MT of un-milled rice was also acquired, taking the total stock of grain in government warehouses to over 1,000 MT. This was 38% higher than 2016 when FCI had procured 527.9 MT of wheat and rice. This steadily went up over the years, with 524 MT acquired in May 2017, 607 MT in 2018, 642 MT in 2019 and 642 MT in 2020.A food ministry official said on condition of anonymity that most of it was acquired during the second wave of the pandemic, in April and May, through doorstep collection.Economists, however, questioned why the government couldn’t expand the public distribution system (PDS) to help more people hit hard by the second wave of the pandemic. “To be honest, I am shocked that though the stocks are so high, the central government has not expanded the PDS even though it was abundantly clear last year that many more people needed the food subsidy,” said Reetika Khera, development economist with Indian Institute of Technology, Delhi.The government procures grains from farmers across the country to provide rice and wheat under PDS to fulfil its obligation under National Food Security Act (NFSA), 2013, which mandates that 75% of the rural population and 50% of the urban population should be provided subsidised grain. Some states such as Tamil Nadu, Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand provide additional food items such as pulses under NFSA to ensure food security of poor families.The ministry website showed that the highest wheat procurement was from Punjab, followed by Madhya Pradesh, Haryana, and Uttar Pradesh. Wheat was sown in 31.5 million hectares, 10% higher than last year due to good monsoon. The highest paddy procurement was from Punjab, followed by Haryana, Telangana and Andhra Pradesh, the ministry said.Haryana said it had, till May 13, transferred ₹14,693 crore as minimum support price (MSP) for wheat directly into the accounts of farmers. In the same period, the Punjab government transferred ₹24,000 crore as MSP to the farmers.Higher procurement has resulted in the lifting of more food grains under PDS. Food ministry data shows 548.04 MT of wheat and paddy was allocated, of which 310.04 MT was distributed to the states. Till May 21, 146 MT of food grains had reached the people.But Khera said it wasn’t enough. “The government is showing no sign of using the food stocks to help the people during this unprecedented crisis that has gone on for a year now, and for which the government is partly responsible,” she said.Several reports coming from different states of people not getting subsidised food grains without ration cards seem to buttress the IIT economist’s argument.PDS covers roughly 800 million people — about 60% of the population — even though NFSA says it should cover 66% or a 100 million more people. This is much less than the government’s own claim made on June 4 last year that a billion people were covered under PDS.Right to Food Campaign, an informal network of organisations and individuals striving for food rights in India, believes that this under-coverage is because of the central government using 2011 population data to fix PDS coverage. As a result, over 400 million people are left to manage without any food support from the government, which is huge considering the loss of livelihood during the pandemic, the network had said in a statement on May 10.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/foodgrain-stock-highest-since-2016-govt-data-101621803171869.html

24-05-2021||India||How Covid-19 scaled Mt Everest||There’s a storm brewing in the Himalayas, and it’s not the usual kind.After nearly a year of no climbs, just a few in early winter, and now a return of climbers from around the world, three things have started to happen. Nepal’s Department of Tourism has given out hundreds of permits, eager for a return to business as usual. Cases of Covid-19 have begun to dot the trails, including the first recorded cases on Mt Everest. And climbers, who have paid upwards of ₹25 lakh for their chance to summit, are waiting it out despite the risk, because there’s been no announcement that permits will be honoured at a later date if they leave.The final touch: The only Covid testing being done at the base camps is informal, conducted by doctors accompanying larger expeditions, and almost all these tests are of the relatively unreliable rapid antigen variety.While international climbers are required to take the more reliable RT-PCR test on arrival in Kathmandu, this protocol isn’t followed uniformly. And there is no protocol for the testing of the Nepali staff who accompany climbing teams. This means that Covid-positive climbers and staff are mingling with others at the base camps, as well as making their way from camp to camp, kitchen to kitchen, and from one mountain to another.Among those caught in this perfect storm were Keval Kakka from Mumbai and Bhagwan Chawale from Pune. They arrived in the mountains in March and watched as things grew steadily worse. In April, they were among 70 climbers to summit Annapurna I, the first mountain to be attempted in the spring season (and incidentally the tenth-highest in the world).The plan had been to attempt multiple summits but amid the rising cases and bad weather, Kakka, a 30-year-old professional mountaineer and trekking guide, gave up and returned home, saying it felt unsafe. Chawale, a 38-year-old officer with the Life Insurance Corporation (LIC), waits on.In Kathmandu, meanwhile, lockdown was enforced once again earlier this month, with about 8,000 new cases reported every day. In the mountains, Covid-positive climbers and Sherpas have had to be airlifted mid-climb and put on ventilators. And the climbing community is abuzz with the news of what’s being called an “outbreak” on Everest. (Again, there are no numbers available to quantify the spread because there is no organised testing at the base camps).“Only the teams that had come with their own doctor and testing kits are able to conduct tests,” says Harshvardhan Joshi, 25, a mountaineer from Mumbai, who finally summited Everest on May 23. “Anxiety was rife. It felt like we were sitting on a Covid time-bomb.”He remained on the mountain nonetheless, he adds, because he’d invested years of training and ₹55 lakh in the expedition, and the government showed no signs of extending existing permits.Frozen freewaysThe lack of testing has taken climbers from around the world by surprise. Kakka and Chawale say they first became concerned when no tests were conducted as they and about 15 others made their way from Annapurna to the Dhaulagiri base camp in April end.The first symptoms of Covid-19 at Dhaulagiri surfaced in a team of Sherpas who had spent time together at Tatopani, a village en route the Annapurna I base camp, adds Kakka. (The two mountains are in close proximity; Dhaulagiri is the seventh-highest mountain in the world; incidentally, the Himalayas are home to 9 of the world’s 14 highest peaks).Spanish mountaineer Carlos Soria Fontan’s team had brought a few rapid antigen kits, and it was they who started testing people at the Dhaulagiri base camp. “About 50 people tested positive, of the 80 present. They were short on kits but more were made available by their agency,” says Kakka.Worse, he adds, there were no precautions being taken. “Four or five Sherpas were sharing tents, when there’s no need to do so at base camp. Those who had tested positive were walking around and touching things in the kitchen. Supplies coming in by helicopter were not sanitised or sterilised. And while evacuating people from base camp, they were putting the healthy ones with those who had tested positive, saying the latter had mild symptoms.”Between the shortage of manpower after key members of the rope-fixing team tested positive, and heavy snow dumps and avalanche conditions, most abandoned their climb on Dhaulagiri. Kakka, who was to also climb Makalu, the fifth-highest mountain in the world, decided to drop all plans and return to Mumbai.He is fortunate that he could — there is still a weekly flight operating from Kathmandu to Delhi. All other international flights have been cancelled until May 31. Some mountaineers are trying to charter private planes instead. “It’s not worth risking your life there. I just didn’t feel safe,” Kakka says. “They gave out so many permits just to run businesses and forgot about what could happen.”A red zone on EverestEverest, meanwhile, looks set to become a red zone for Covid-19. Nepal’s Department of Tourism (DoT) has issued a record 408 permits for Everest this season; another 125 permits have been issued for neighbouring Lhotse, which uses the same base camp and follows most of the same route (a number of climbers will be attempting both; among those attempting Lhotse is Chawale from Pune). Add in the support staff, and that’s more than 1,500 people at base camp since April.“Even the big expeditions that have their own doctors and kits have only rapid antigen tests,” says Dr Hemant Leuva, 48, a climber and general surgeon from Ahmedabad who is attempting Everest this season.When he realised the Everest ER team from the non-profit Himalayan Rescue Association had no provisions for testing (WhatsApp messages to an ER official at base camp have gone unanswered), he asked his wife Surbhi, also a doctor and mountaineer, to bring rapid antigen test kits with her when she arrived in early May.Surbhi arrived with 25 kits and so far, five of the staff and one climbing member have tested positive and been evacuated. “But there won’t be any official record of how many tests have been conducted, how many have tested positive or how many were evacuated,” Dr Leuva points out.Climbers are known to descend from base camp to villages lower down to rest, before returning for the summit push. That poses an added risk to both sides. Those who have the facility have been testing members on return. The rest simply continue up the mountain.Storms aheadCiting Covid-linked safety concerns, a number of teams have called off their Everest expeditions and left. On May 10, Spanish mountaineer Alex Txikon in a statement said he and his teammates Sendoa Elejalde and Inaki Makazaga were abandoning their climb “out of a feeling of responsibility” after “assessing the health situation.”Another agency, Mountain Trip, suspended its expedition on May 22, saying in a statement that their Sherpa team was “hit hard with Covid” and they saw “no opportunity to summit within safety margins”.China has called off all expeditions on Everest from the north side in Tibet. Pakistan has announced that Nepali citizens won’t be allowed in for the start of the climbing season that begins there in June, adding that any climbers who have been in Nepal in the three weeks prior won’t be allowed into Pakistan either.After calling off his Everest expedition, Austrian guide Lukas Furtenbach, who runs Furtenbach Adventures, painted a grim picture in a social media post on May 16. “We tried to do everything right... We were even more careful when the Covid outbreak in basecamp started, when we heard from the first teams with Covid cases, the government denying these cases... I was calling for a mass test in base camp. The call was ignored,” Furtenbach wrote.Status quoThe Nepal authorities have continued to deny a Covid-19 outbreak in the Himalayas since reports of the first case there emerged in mid-April. Mira Acharya, director of the DoT, visited the Everest base camp and told Reuters: “Doctors at the base camp said the situation was not as serious as it was reported. I did not see any terrible situation there.”A press release dated May 7, posted on the website of the Ministry of Culture, Tourism and Civil Aviation, refutes news of Covid-19 cases at base camp, calling them “rumours”. There has been no word from the government on this since.The lack of acknowledgement has a lot to do with the revenues and livelihoods linked to climbing in Nepal. A permit to climb Everest costs each climber $11,000 (about ₹8 lakh); the most affordable price for an entire climb would be about $35,000 (about ₹25.5 lakh). The tourism industry overall suffered losses of $330 million last year, according to Nepal government estimates.“So many of the staff didn’t announce any symptoms of Covid because they didn’t want to lose their income,” Joshi says. “But there are choppers flying in each day and they could easily carry samples back to Kathmandu.”While Joshi’s expedition is done, the wait continues for many others, with now no hope that permits will be extended as they’ve been in the past. The climbing season ends on May 29.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/how-covid-19-scaled-mt-everest-101621799223405.html
24-05-2021||India||Panic buying in Tamil Nadu as shops open ahead of intense lockdown||Hundreds of people thronged markets and showrooms as the Tamil Nadu government came under criticism for opening up all shops except malls, over the weekend, ahead of the one-week intense lockdown that will be imposed from May 24. To allow people to stock up provisions and vegetables, the government relaxed restrictions on May 22 and May 23 and allowed shops to remain open till 9 pm during which public transport also functioned. This not only led to panic buying but people were also seen shopping for textiles, jewellery, visiting salons and heavy traffic jams were seen in Chennai, Madurai and Trichy among other districts. During the extended lockdown, no shops will be allowed to open and the horticulture department will supply vegetables and fruits through 4,380 mobile carts. Only drug stores will remain open and supply of milk, water and newspapers will continue. The state’s on-going lockdown was from May 10 to 24 which has been extended on the advice of medical experts who estimate Covid-19 cases to peak by the end of May. Following that, chief minister MK Stalin also led an all-party meeting of legislators before making the announcement on Saturday. “It is sad that people treated the lockdown like a holiday and not as an emergency caused by Covid-19,” said Stalin at the meeting. He added that health and frontline workers cannot be burdened more and that the pandemic had to be brought under control so that educational institutions can also function soon.The expert committee had recommended extending the lockdown by at least two-weeks and to make it stringent as cases and deaths are continuing to rise and the time can be used for increasing health infrastructure, testing and surveillance. “We give strategic advice based on the disease. But how the government implements a lockdown is their administrative decision,” said one of the members on the condition of anonymity. “There is no other choice except going for a continued lockdown as cases are rising fast in the districts. Though Covid-19 cases in Chennai aren’t rising anymore, 99% of ICUs are occupied, hospitals are unable to shift people from oxygen support to ICUs, so the decline isn’t enough.”Doctors are concerned that the crowding over the weekend will lead to a spike. “By giving the people a free hand to do anything today and sending a message that it will be strict tomorrow onwards has given a sense of less fear,” said Dr Deepak Subramanian, deputy medical superintendent, GEM hospital, Chennai. “This crowding is not right at this stage. This is going to have an impact in the coming days. Chennai was flattening the curvebut I hope this doesn’t make it worse.”Public health experts are of the opinion that the state could have extended the lockdown by continuing the existing restrictions as they were and shouldn’t have permitted non-essential services. “It is a miscalculation. I don’t see malice, they just botched up,” says Dr J Amalorpavanathan, a public health expert and former member secretary of the Transplant Authority of Tamil Nadu. “The lockdown was beginning to show its results and they could have continued allowing essentials like buying vegetables for a few hours every day. Everybody will not have bulk cash when a government cart comes, you don’t know at what time it will come and it can’t enter narrow slums. Opening for 24-hours and then closing for a week isn’t logical. The government may not have anticipated what happened today. It’s frightening. I think the workers inside textile and jewellery shops would be the super spreaders because they were exposed to the crowds for more than 8-hours. Most of them wouldn’t have been vaccinated.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/panic-buying-in-tamil-nadu-as-shops-open-ahead-of-intense-lockdown-101621797664874.html

While the toll jumped to 25,282 across the state, the positivity rate stood at 2.40%, according to the bulletin of the state health department.Bengaluru accounted for 362 fatalities while Bengaluru rural recorded 30 deaths.Despite a dip in daily caseload, fatalities have increased over the last few days, which experts said was bound to happen as there would be a time lag between infection and death.“Deaths come 14 days after the infections are reported. So the deaths you are seeing now are patients from early May when we were at the peak. When infections come down, deaths will be high,” Dr. V. Ravi, neurovirologist and member of Karnataka’s technical advisory committee (TAC) told Hindustan Times in a recent interaction.Karnataka, particularly its capital Bengaluru, has seen a decline in the number of daily caseloads over the last one week. The state reported 25,979 new infections, including 7,494 in Bengaluru. The total number of active cases reduced to 472,986 across Karnataka and 255,842 in Bengaluru. The positivity rate also saw a decline and stood at 20.76%.“Many positives from today’s Covid numbers: Large blue diamond recoveries (35k) continue to outnumber new cases (25k), Large blue diamond new cases fall to 25k after a long time. Large blue diamond positivity rate falls to 20%, Large blue diamond daily testing continues to be robust at 1,25,000,” Dr K Sudhakar, Karnataka’s minister for health, family welfare and medical education said in a post on Twitter.However, the health crisis continues to deteriorate in several districts of Karnataka as the surge moves towards rural regions of the state.There were 18 deaths in Ballari, 11 in Hassan, 15 in Kalaburagi, 12 in Koppala, 13 each in Mandya, Shivamogga and Tumakuru, 22 in Mysuru, 17 in Uttara Kannada, according to the health bulletin.Karnataka reported 195,463 new infections in the last one week till 5 pm on Saturday, according to data from the state Covid-19 war room. The recovery rate is at 78.83%, according to government data.However, the positivity rate across the state has increased, data shows.Belagvi, the border district, had a positivity rate of 44.55% while Ballari, Uttara Kannada, Mysuru, Hassan, Tumakuru, Dharwad, Koppal and Chamarajanagar reported 37.30%, 37.08%, 36.53%, 32.89%, 32.63%, 30.94%, 30.17% and 30.17% respectively.The positivity rate in Karnataka (till 5 pm on Saturday) was 23.61% and 18.84% in Bengaluru.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ktaka-covid-toll-crosses-25k-with-626-new-deaths-101621796523865.html
24-05-2021||India||Health infra ramped up to fight Covid: Karnataka govt||Bengaluru Dr K Sudhakar, Karnataka’s minister for health, family welfare and medical education on Sunday said that the state’s healthcare infrastructure has been ramped up significantly to deal with the Covid-19 pandemic.“(The) capacity to test 1,50,000 to 2,00,000 samples per day, availability of 1,015 MT oxygen, availability of more than 22,000 oxygen beds, supply of Remdesivir as per requirement and various other measures initiated by the state government to control the pandemic has invariably ramped up the health infrastructure in the state,” according to a statement from Sudhakar on Sunday.The statement comes at a time when Karnataka is seeing a sharp spike in fatalities even though the daily caseload appears to have stabilised.The state recorded a new high in fatality rate at 2.40% and one of its highest single-day death toll as 626 more died, according to the daily bulletin of the state health department.Karnataka, particularly its capital Bengaluru, has seen a decline in the number of daily caseloads over the last one week. The state reported 25,979 new infections, including 7,494 in Bengaluru. The total number of active cases reduced to 472,986 across Karnataka and 255,842 in Bengaluru. The positivity rate also saw a decline and stood at 20.76%.Though, Sudhakar maintained that testing has been ramped up from 60,000-70,000 all the way to almost 100,000 per day, experts, however, have attributed the decline in cases to decrease in testing.A senior official of Karnataka’s health department said that it is doing “targeted testing” which prioritises primary and secondary contacts among others.Talking about oxygenated beds, the minister said that the total number of such beds have also been ramped up.“In March 2020 Department of Health and Family Welfare Karnataka had only 1970 oxygenated beds, 444 ICU beds and 610 beds with ventilators. Over the past one year additionally 22,001 oxygenated beds, 1,248 HFNC beds, 701 ICU beds and 1,548 beds with ventilators have been created. These facilities which were earlier restricted to district headquarters have been extended upto taluk and CHC levels,” the minister said.The statements come amid a growing demand for ICU and oxygenated beds as the surge continues in most parts of rural Karnataka.He also added that the state now has sufficient medical oxygen supplies. Karnataka had faced an acute shortage of medical oxygen until about a week ago and there have been arrests of people involved in black marketing of cylinders.Stating that there is no shortage of Remdesivir, Sudhakar said, “In the month of April 2021, purchase order has been given for 2,74,00 vials and (the) received quantity is 1,80,700 vials till date. Again in the month of May 2021, purchase order given for 51,360 vials and received quantity 11,000 vials till date,” he said. He added that a global tender for 5,00,000 vials and tender opened on May 17.He also said that the state government is working towards a comprehensive plan to ensure vaccination for every citizen by November or December.The BS Yediyurappa-led government has announced and cancelled vaccination for people in the age groups between 18-44 years at least three times due to critical shortage of vaccines.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/health-infra-ramped-up-to-fight-covid-karnataka-govt-101621796403760.html
24-05-2021||India||Political tensions stare at Karnataka govt as Covid subsides||Bengaluru: The calming of the Covid-19 crisis is likely to make way for resurgence of simmering political tensions in the state of Karnataka, according to people aware of the developments, who hinted at imminent changes within the B S Yediyurappa-led Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government.The persons cited above also suggested the possibility of a change in leadership, a topic that has lived through several news cycles ever since the 78-year-old leader assumed the chief minister’s role in July 2019.“Both corona (Covid-19) and by-election results have become a problem for those at the top,” a three-time BJP legislator from Karnataka said, requesting not to be named.Although Yediyurappa did see some success initially, his government came under fire in recent times over the management — or lack of it — of the pandemic from opposition parties, public and its own party in which its image and perception have taken a strong beating, people aware of the developments said.The theory that the BJP does not have a credible replacement for Yediyurappa or the support he enjoys from the Lingayat community, believed to be the single-largest caste group in Karnataka, has withered away with names of persons like Pralhad Joshi being mooted as possible alternatives.The chief minister has also spent a considerable amount of time dousing one crisis after another within his own cabinet to help assuage dented egos of his council of ministers, the persons cited above added.Ever since the pandemic broke out, Yediyurappa’s first biggest task in late March last year was to calm growing tensions between then health minister B Sreeramulu and Dr K Sudhakar, who only had the medical education portfolio then, in which the latter prevailed. However, since then, Sudhakar has also seen his position diluted further and has had his wings clipped, people aware of the developments said. Yediyurappa has changed the head of the state’s task force at least three times with Dr C N Ashwath Narayan now helming affairs. Narayan was made incharge of medicines, Basvaraj Bommai and R Ashok in charge of managing hospital beds, Jagadish Shettar to manage oxygen supplies and Arvind Limbavali handle call centres and war rooms, leaving little for Sudhakar to do.“The final step of implementation goes to the health ministry itself,” a senior party leader said, trying to downplay the alleged marginalising of Sudhakar.Like all his stints in the top chair, Yediyurappa’s fourth tenure as chief minister has been a turbulent one wherein the 78-year-old spent more time tackling the mushrooming political crisis over the pandemic.“Not that there is any lack of capability but there were some issues with the way in which some of them worked,” a minister said, requesting not to be named.The allegations of “bribe-for-bed scam” by Bengaluru Member of Parliament, Tejaswi Surya, was also considered as one of the instances of the party targeting its tallest leader in the state.The relations between Yediyurappa and the BJP’s top brass in Delhi too has soured over the last few months, people aware of the developments said, making it harder for the chief minister to manage the expectations of the population who were, during the 2018 and 2019 elections, made to believe that a common party in state and Centre would be beneficial to the state. But awaiting relief for floods, droughts and even aid during the pandemic from Prime Minister Narendra Modi-led Centre has added to the challenges of the chief minister. Though rebel voices like that of Basanagouda Patil (Yatnal), the firebrand BJP legislator from Bijapur (Vijayapura), appears to have fallen silent over the last few weeks, lack of action against him has bolstered several others to voice their concerns in candid conversation, if not in full public view.No action has been taken against Yatnal so far despite a show-cause notice issued to him in February, according to the party.“There were some initial problems but everything is fine now and there is nothing to state that there will be a change in leadership,” a BJP legislator and spokesperson for the party said on condition of anonymity.The most noticeable disgruntlement is directed towards B Y Vijayendra, the son of the chief minister, who has been accused of running a parallel administration under his fathers aegis. After aiding in two by-poll victories in KR Pete and Sira, the loss at Maski in which turncoat Pratapgouda Patil of the BJP was defeated served as a set back to his political debut. Vijayendra, who enjoys significant clout within the government, is also the state BJP vice-president.“It appears as though imminent decisions are being rescheduled due to the Covid-19 pandemic,” A Narayana, political analyst and faculty at Azim Premji University, told Hindustan Times.He added that there seems to be indications that some kind of ground is being prepared for significant changes, even though it was not being done in a straightforward manner.Legislators and analysts pointed out that by this time next year, Karnataka would be in full poll mode for the 2023 assembly elections.“The longer it takes for them to replace, it may get more expensive,” Narayana added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/political-tensions-stare-at-karnataka-govt-as-covid-subsides-101621796283829.html
24-05-2021||India||Stalin writes to Rajnath, seeks ‘urgent action’ to trace 16 missing fishermen||Tamil Nadu chief minister M K Stalin on Sunday sought Union defence minister Rajnath Singh’s “immediate intervention” to locate 16 fishermen who went missing near Mangalore coast when cyclone Tauktae led to severe storms in the Arabian Sea and adjoining areas last week. While 12 fishermen belonged to Tamil Nadu, the remaining four hailed from West Bengal. Officials said the mechanised fishing boat named Ajmeer Sha, with a Kerala registration, had ventured from Beypore fishing harbour in Kerala on May 5. “It has been informed that after Tauktae cyclone, there has been no contact with the crew of this boat,” Stalin said in his letter. The state had earlier requested Marine Rescue Coordination Centre (MRCC), east, west and the Indian Coast Guard station in Cochin to search and rescue the fishermen but there has been no update on them so far. “This has caused anxiety and distress among the families and fishermen community in the state,” Stalin said, requesting the defence minister for his ‘immediate intervention’ and ‘urgent action’ to rescue the missing fishermen.The letter comes a day after the families of the missing fishermen in Tamil Nadu wrote to the chief ministers of the state, Kerala and West Bengal, seeking assistance in this regard.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/stalin-writes-to-rajnath-seeks-urgent-action-to-trace-16-missing-fishermen-101621796163810.html
24-05-2021||India||Crowds throng markets as TN eases curbs before complete shutdown||The Tamil Nadu government on Sunday came under the criticism of health experts as hundreds of people thronged markets and showrooms amid a weekend relaxation on services ahead of the complete week-long lockdown from Monday.Barring shopping malls, all shops, delivering both essential and non-essential services, were allowed to run till 9 pm to allow the public to gather enough supplies ahead of the shutdown. However, the decision not only led to panic buying but people were seen shopping for textiles, jewellery among other items, leading to intense traffic in areas such as Chennai, Madurai and Trichy. Shops selling groceries and vegetables will remain shut during the lockdown period. Only the horticulture department will be allowed to supply vegetables and fruits through 4,380 mobile carts.Medical stores will remain open while services such as milk supply, water and newspapers will continue to function. On Sunday, the state recorded 35,482 cases and 422 deaths, according to the daily health bulletin. Expressing concerns over the government’s decision to open all shops, doctors said they feared that the weekend crowding would lead to a Covid spike. “By giving the general public a free hand to do anything today and sending a message that it will be strict from tomorrow onwards has created a sense of less fear,” Dr Deepak Subramanian, deputy medical superintendent, GEM hospital, Chennai, said. “The crowd is not right at this stage. This is going to have an impact in the coming days. The Covid curve in Chennai was flattening but I hope this doesn’t make it worse,” he added. Public health experts opined that the state could have extended the lockdown by continuing with the existing restrictions and shouldn’t have permitted non-essential services to function. “It is a miscalculation. I don’t see malice, they just botched up,” Dr J Amalorpavanathan, a public health expert and former member secretary of Transplant Authority of Tamil Nadu, said. “The lockdown was beginning to show its results and they could have continued allowing essentials like buying vegetables for a few hours every day. Everybody will not have bulk cash when a government cart arrives, you don’t know at what time it will come and it can’t enter narrow slums. Opening for 24-hours and then closing for a week isn’t logical. The government may not have anticipated what happened today. It’s frightening. I think workers inside textile and jewellery shops could act as super spreaders because they were exposed to the crowds for more than eight hours. Most of them wouldn’t have been vaccinated.”Reacting to the criticism, P K Sekar Babu, minister for Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments, who is also in-charge of Covid-19 control in Chennai, said the weekend relaxation was to ensure people did not suffer or ran out of supplies during the shutdown. “The chief minister gave this two-day window so that people do not suffer during the intense lockdown. If we didn’t allow this time, we would have been criticised for suddenly announcing a lockdown and we would have been questioned over what people would do for food and how they would go back to their hometowns,” he said.The state’s on-going lockdown was imposed from May 10 to 24, which was later extended with no relaxations on the advice of medical experts who estimated Covid-19 cases to peak by the end of May.Chief minister M K Stalin also held an all-party meeting of legislators before making the announcement on Saturday. “It is sad that people treated the lockdown like a holiday and not as an emergency caused by Covid,” Stalin at the meeting. He added health and frontline workers cannot be burdened further and that the pandemic had to be brought under control so that educational institutions could also resume functioning. The expert committee had recommended extending the lockdown by at least two-weeks and to make it stringent as cases and deaths continued to witness a surge in the state. They believed that the lockdown period could be used for increasing health infrastructure, testing and surveillance. “We give strategic advice based on the disease. But how the government implements a lockdown is their administrative decision,” one of the members said on the condition of anonymity. “There is no other choice except going for a continued lockdown as cases are surging in the districts. Though cases in Chennai aren’t rising anymore, 99% of ICUs are occupied, hospitals are unable to shift people from oxygen support to ICUs, so the decline isn’t enough,” the member added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/crowds-throng-markets-as-tn-eases-curbs-before-complete-shutdown-101621796104783.html
24-05-2021||India||TMC MP asks people to file police complaints against Governor Jagdeep Dhankhar||Adding to the acrimony between the ruling Trinamool Congress (TMC) and Raj Bhawan, the party’s Lok Sabha member Kalyan Banerjee on Sunday asked Bengal citizens to file complaints against governor Jagdeep Dhankhar at every police station in the state so that he can be prosecuted after his term comes to an end. “He is the butcher of the Indian Constitution. I urge people of Bengal to file complaints against him at every police station. I know that a case cannot be started against a governor. But we can do it after his tenure ends. Former governor Jagdeep Dhankhar can be lodged in the Presidency Jail,” Banerjee told reporters. Banerjee, a lawyer, represented urban development minister Firhad Hakim, panchayat minister Subrata Mukherjee and Kamarhati legislator Madan Mitra before the Calcutta high court this week after they were arrested on May 17 by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) in the 2016 Narada sting operation case in which they are accused of taking bribe. They were remanded in judicial custody and taken to Presidency correctional home. Former TMC leader Sovan Chatterjee was also arrested on the same charge. A charge sheet was filed against all four. TMC leaders targeted Dhankhar after the arrests because he sanctioned the prosecution. They alleged that he bypassed the assembly speaker whose sanction is necessary to prosecute MLAs. On May 9, the Raj Bhawan said in a statement that the governor had accorded prosecution sanction to the CBI against the three TMC MLAs and Chatterjee who was an MLA when the offence allegedly took place. This empowered the CBI to file the charge sheet. On May 10, Mukherjee and Hakim were sworn in as ministers by the governor at Raj Bhawan. Mitra took oath at the assembly on May 6. Dhankhar reacted to Banerjee’s comments saying he was stunned. “He is senior functionary @AITCofficial @MamataOfficial. He is senior parliamentarian @LokSabhaSectt. He is senior advocate @barcouncilindia @barandbench. Just stunned but leave the matter to sound discretion of cultured people of West Bengal and media,” tweeted Dhankhar. He also posted a video clip in which Banerjee could be heard making the statement. “Banerjee is a lawyer who represents the state in court. He is directly attacking the Constitution. His statement can be seen as that of the ruling party. The TMC has lost faith in the Constitution,” said Bengal BJP’s chief spokesperson Samik Bhattacharya. TMC leaders did not comment on Banerjee’s remarks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tmc-mp-asks-people-to-file-police-complaints-against-governor-jagdeep-dhankhar-101621796104332.html
24-05-2021||India||As cases drop in cities, TN shifts Covid fight focus to hinterlands||As the Covid-19 tally in Chennai, which was witnessing the highest number of daily cases in Tamil Nadu, remained static for a week, all concerns have now shifted to the number of infections and disproportionate death rates in smaller cities and hinterland with less healthcare facilities. On May 20, a two-tier city like Coimbatore reported 3,335 new cases and 20 deaths while a small district like Dindigul reported 389 new cases and 19 deaths. While Thiruvallur reported 1,791 cases and 20 fatalities, Vellore registered 567 cases and 36 deaths on the same day.While intensive care units (ICUs) and oxygen beds were available in Dindigul’s single Covid hospital, three government hospitals in Coimbatore had none of them available. “This is an indication of not just the state of the health infrastructure but also delay in detecting cases and timely-transportation of patients to hospitals. Our test-trace-isolate strategy has to be strengthened in rural areas and small towns,” Dr Prabhdeep Kaur, deputy director, National Institute of Epidemiology, said. “We did a lot in Chennai, everyone knows where to go for tests. There is so much awareness that the moment a person develops a symptom, they think maybe it is Covid. They get tested or if there is reluctance, they consult a doctor immediately. But that doesn’t happen in small towns and rural areas.”In Trichy district, for instance, fresh cases reported in its rural blocks have surpassed the urban areas in the past one week. From an average of 300 new cases, the figures jumped to 800 cases per day. “As the virus shifts from the major cities to smaller districts, I feel we are not prepared enough as the resources are less compared to Chennai to scale up. We need to assess the capacity, man power, oxygen beds, ICUs, testing capacity in smaller districts,” Kaur said, adding that the government could consider introducing rapid antigen tests in areas with limited laboratories to conduct RT-PCR testing.State health secretary J Radhakrishnan also said that though the Covid tally is static in Chennai and adjoining districts, the government is concerned of rising cases in major cities and towns like Coimbatore, Tiruppur, Erode, Thoothukudi, Madurai and Trichy as well as smaller towns like Ariyalur. “We are currently increasing oxygen-supported beds in the districts and we are planning to bring in a district-level containment plan,” Radhakrishnan said. The state has also decentralised its Covid-19 war room, presently functioning in Chennai, and has opened a Unified Command Centre in each of the remaining 36 districts. The helpline will triage patients and find oxygen and ICU beds for them. Tamil Nadu has been witnessing a rapid rise in cases among India’s 20 most populous regions even as the curve is on a downward trend in Maharashtra, Karnataka and Kerala. In the past one week, the state has reported the fourth highest number of daily cases in the country in absolute numbers – only Maharashtra, Karnataka and Kerala are reporting more infections on a daily basis right now. On Tuesday, with 33,059 infections in 24 hours, Tamil Nadu reported the highest number of infections in terms of daily count across the country. No ICU beds but a few oxygen-supported ones were available across Chennai’s government and private hospitals as of 7 pm on Friday.On Sunday, the state reported 35,483 cases and 422 deaths, taking the overall tally to 1,842,344 and 20,468, respectively. Chennai alone reported 5,169 cases and 81 fatalities.“We are decentralising oxygen centres across the city where patients can be supported with oxygen until a hospital bed is vacant. At least 3,000 such beds are being planned,” Greater Chennai Corporation commissioner Gagan Singh Bedi said. Civic officials attributed the drop in cases in Chennai to surveillance and a change in strategy in triaging. For those below 60 years of age and no comorbidities, the corporation’s health team triaged the patients at home to prevent them from coming to screening centres and therefore, reduce the risk of further spread and exposure. “The state has a pragmatic triaging protocol that empowers the primary healthcare system to take care of mild, moderate patients,” Kaur said. “They initiate treatment even for severe cases while they are being transported which means the delays get reduced. This should help especially in the rural areas and smaller districts so one doesn’t have to wait till they reach the hospital to start treatment. This should help in reducing deaths.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/as-cases-drop-in-cities-tn-shifts-covid-fight-focus-to-hinterlands-101621795983779.html
24-05-2021||India||India may firm up plans to export Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin||New Delhi: India has received enquiries from other countries for the export of the indigenous Covid 19 vaccine Covaxin jointly developed by Bharat Biotech and the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), according to government officials aware of the development.New Delhi has been approached by at least two countries, Hungary and Paraguay for the commercial export of 1 million doses of Covaxin, with the first holding forth the possibility of access to the EU.To be sure, decisions on exprts are commercial ones that will have to be taken by Bharat Biotech. In February Bharat Biotech announced that it has signed a pact with Ocugen Inc, allowing the US-based biopharmaceutical firm to co-develop, supply, and commercialize the Indian vaccine maker’s Covid-19 vaccine Covaxin in the US market.According to the Union government’s affidavit in the Supreme Court, in May, Bharat Biotech has increased its capacity from 9 million to 20 million a month now, which will increase to 55 million units by July 2021. according to the government’s latest vaccine policy, half of these will be sold to the Centre and the other half to the states and private hospitals.“The govt of Hungary approached the government in mid- April for supply of 1 million doses for Covaxin by around May end on priority. It was also informed that they would grant EU Good manufacturing practice (GMP) certification to Bharat Biotech facilities that would also open India’s vaccine exports to the wider EU markets if the government would consider supplying the 1 million doses. This would not only open up India vaccine exports to the wider EU market (as certification granted by Hungary would be recognized in EU) in future but may also facilitate BBT’s negotiations with Brazil and other markets that they may be exploring as well…,” one of the officials said on condition of anonymity.“The Covaxin samples received from Bharat Biotech had already been approved by the National Institute of Pharmacy and Nutrition and the Hungarian National Drug Authority. We were informed that the expert team that visited India last month to audit BBT facilities had also returned and given its report. They were ready to grant emergency use authorization for Covaxin. It was also noted that certain issues were found during the expert team’s visit to BBT facilities. The Brazilian team that had visited BBT around the same time had also flagged these issues... ,” the official added.In March Brazilian health regulator Anvisa denied permission to import Bharat Biotech’s COVID-19 vaccine Covaxin into the country after its authorities found that the plant in which the vaccine is being made did not meet the Current Good Manufacturing Practice (CGMP) requirements. Bharat Biotech in February said it had signed an agreement with the Brazilian government for supply of 20 million doses of Covaxin during the second and third quarters of the current year. The vaccine maker then said: “the requirements pointed out during inspection will be fulfilled,” and that the timelines for fulfilment were under discussion with the Brazil NRA and will be resolved soon.’’Bharat Biotech did not respond to a detailed questionnaire sent on May 12.The government has also been approached for commercial contracts for Covaxin by Paraguay, according to a second official. According to the external affair ministry’s Vaccine Maitri portal. Paraguay has thus far received 2 lakh doses of vaccines as a gift.“ They (Paraguay) have thanked Prime Minister Modi for gifting the vaccines under its vaccine Maitri initiative. We were informed last month that negotiations were on between Paraguay, which is looking to sign a contract with Bharat Biotech for procurement million doses of Covaxin,” the second official added. A third official from the external affairs ministry confirmed this.On May 1 HT reported that Centre is also exploring the possibility of offering the locally developed coronavirus vaccine, Covaxin for production abroad through a technology transfer between commercial entities, according to government officials aware of the development.India’s indigenous vaccine, Covaxin is developed by Bharat Biotech in collaboration with the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) - National Institute of Virology (NIV). The indigenous, inactivated vaccine is developed and manufactured in Bharat Biotech’s BSL-3 (Bio-Safety Level 3) high containment facility.In a statement issued on April 20, Bharat Biotech said it was exploring manufacturing partnerships with partners in other countries, who have prior expertise with commercial scale manufacture of inactivated viral vaccines under biosafety containment.The company also said Covaxin has received Emergency Use Authorisation in several countries across the globe with another 60 in process. It has been granted EUAs in Mexico, Philippines, Iran, Paraguay, Guatemala, Nicaragua, Guyana, Venezuela, Botswana, Zimbabwe, among several other countries. It is in the process of getting EUAs in the US and Europe, according to Bharat Biotech.Earlier this month, a joint statement on the India- EU leaders’ meeting said: “Recognising the role of extensive immunisation as a global public good and concurring that the vaccination process is not a race amongst countries but a race against time, we welcomed the EU’s and its Member States’ contribution to vaccines’ production and their substantial support to the COVAX Facility, as well as India’s efforts to produce and distribute COVID-19 vaccines to over 90 countries through its ‘Vaccine Maitri’...We are committed to working together to better prepare for and respond to global health emergencies. We agreed to cooperate on resilient medical supply chains, vaccines and the Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients (APIs), and on the application of international good manufacturing standards to ensure high quality and safety of products.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-firms-up-plans-to-export-bharat-biotech-s-covaxin-101621795924954.html
24-05-2021||India||Rajasthan to move SC for uniform vaccine policy||Jaipur: The Rajasthan government is planning to approach the Supreme Court to ask for a new policy that ensures uniform distribution and pricing of Covid-19 vaccines, said a senior official familiar with the development. It will be the second state to do so after West Bengal, which had on May 7 moved the apex court for the exact same reason and demanded that the states be given the vaccines free of cost.Rajasthan’s vaccination programme has been slowed down by a shortage of jabs. So far, only 1.26 crore of its total population of 8 crore has been administered the first dose, and just 31.2 lakh have received the second. Of those vaccinated fully, 16.34 lakh are over the age of 60 and 7.48 lakh are in the 45-59 age-group. The state government is also spending ₹3,000 crore to inoculate people in the age group of 18-44 years. For this, it has ordered 3.75 crore vaccine shots from the Serum Institute of India (SII), which has been struggling to meet the huge demands raised by all states. So far, over 12.59 lakh people in this age-group have been vaccinated. The state has also floated a global tender to procure 1 crore doses but says that this should have been done by the Centre. “The state can bear the expenditure, but the tender should be floated by the government of India. The Centre can negotiate for a uniform rate, and check the credentials and credibility of the vendors,” said the aforementioned official on the condition of anonymity, adding that so far six to eight vendors have participated in the tender and some of them have been asked to provide more additional documents. The differential pricing, the official said, will result in competition among states, as the vendors participating in the global tender are quoting more than twice the price of vaccine — ₹300 per dose plus GST. Vaccine manufacturers SII and Bharat Biotech have been charging ₹150 per dose from the Centre, and ₹300-400 per dose from the states. The price should be capped at a uniform rate of ₹150, the official said. Centre’s announcement of differential pricing for vaccines was opposed by many states, and had led the Supreme Court to observe, in a suo motu case, that the policy was violative of a citizen’s constitutional rights and the Centre should revisit it. The Centre had asked the court not to interfere with an executive decision.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rajasthan-to-move-sc-for-uniform-vaccine-policy-101621795383760.html
24-05-2021||India||Moderna refuses to send jabs directly, says Punjab||Chandigarh US pharmaceutical company Moderna has refused to supply its Covid vaccine directly to Punjab, saying that its policy allows it to entertain such requests only from the government of India, a senior state official said on Sunday. The development came after the Amarinder Singh government reached out to several manufacturers, including Pfizer, Moderna, Johnson & Johnson, and Gamaleya (maker of Sputnik-V), for direct purchase, said state nodal officer for vaccination Vikas Garg. The state government said last week that it has storage space for 3.5 million Sputnik-V vaccines, which requires temperature of -18 degrees Celsius. But so far, only Moderna has replied to the request, Garg said. The company’s vaccine has so far inoculated over 90 million people. Moderna could not be reached for comments.Earlier, the Punjab government approached Covax, the global vaccine sharing programme, but was told that it would not directly deal with the state, Garg said. The Punjab government has said that it has so far received 4.4 million vaccine doses from the Centre, and the first dose has been administered to 3.66 million people while 730,000 have received the second shot. But due to the non-availability of jabs, the state has had to stop phases 1 (above 60 years) and 2 (above 45 years) of its vaccination programme in the last three days. “We are seeking more vaccines from the Centre. They will also advise how to deal with such manufacturers who directly deal with the Centre,” said Garg. Punjab had a tepid response to the programme as not many people turned up for vaccination in the early days.

24-05-2021||India||Nath booked for ‘maligning image of India’ with variant remark||Bhopal: Madhya Pradesh Congress Committee (MPCC) president Kamal Nath was booked on Sunday for allegedly maligning the image of India internationally by claiming that the “Indian variant” of the coronavirus was responsible for the second wave of the pandemic, police said.The case was registered on the complaint of medical education department minister, Vishwas Sarang, and other BJP leaders. BJP leaders alleged that Nath held a virtual press conference and blamed the “Indian variant” for the second wave. BJP leaders also lodged the complaint on a video in which Nath is seen addressing Congress MLAs on the issue of shortage of fertilizers and other issues and telling them it is the right opportunity to start a fire so that farmers would get justice. The case has been registered under section 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant) of the IPC and section 54 (punishment for false warning) of the Disaster Management Act by crime branch, said Irshad Wali, deputy inspector general (DIG) of police. According to the FIR, “Kamal Nath said corona started with Chinese variant but now it is Indian variant of Covid-19 which is responsible for the second wave and many countries have suspended flights due to the Indian variant. Nath also said Indians who are working and studying in foreign countries are facing trouble due to it. But in real, foreign countries are trying to help India by sending important things to fight against the epidemic. Nath tried to misguide people and to create disturbance in the country.”“Nath also violated the norms of WHO in which the organisation clearly said no variant of virus should be named after a country, person, organisation or bird’s name,” the FIR said.The FIR also mentioned that Nath tried to spread anarchy by telling the Congress MLAs to start a fire to ensure justice for farmers. Minister Vishwas Sarang said, “Nath and other Congressmen are trying to create unrest in India and Madhya Pradesh by doing dirty politics as they had done during the 1984 riots. Nath insulted our country internationally and he should have been booked under sedition charges.” After the FIR, Nath said, “People who lost family members due to shortage of oxygen, injections, beds and other facilities during the second wave should also register an FIR against the heartless chief minister and other ministers of MP. People, who lost their family members due to Covid 19 and their deaths have not been included as Covid deaths, should also register an FIR against the CM and his cabinet ministers.” Former minister and Congress MLA Jitu Patwari said, “The BJP-led state government is misusing power to hide the data and the real pain of Covid-infected people. They are not concerned about India’s image but they are more concerned about the Prime Minister and BJP’s image. They should book all the Congress leaders because we will not keep mum on this lie of the state and the central government.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nath-booked-for-maligning-image-of-india-with-variant-remark-101621794963715.html
