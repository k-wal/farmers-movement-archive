27-05-2021||India||3 more Rafale jets land in India from France||Another batch of three Rafale fighter jets landed at the Ambala airbase on Thursday, taking the total number of Rafales in the Indian Air Force (IAF) inventory to 23.According to people aware of the development in Dassault, four aircraft were supposed to take off from Merignac-Bordeaux airbase in France on May 20, but only three could because of the unavailability of more mid-air refuellers in the UAE.Although four Rafale Omni role fighters were supposed to leave on May 20, the flights were rescheduled due to maintenance issues with the mid air refuellers. The fighters could only take off today due to long weekend holidays in France, the people cited above said.The IAF is all set to resurrect the 101 “Falcons of Chamb” squadron at Hashimara in West Bengal. It is expected that the full deliveries of 36 Rafale aircraft will be completed well before April 2022 as announced by Union defence minister Rajnath Singh in Parliament.With India likely to buy more front-line fighters to complete the stalled requirement of 126 medium multi-role combat aircraft (MMRCA), the French have not only offered hot engine technology to India but are also willing to jointly develop extended range and capability Hammer air-to-ground missile under the Atmanirbhar Bharat route. French engine manufacturer Safran has already conveyed the offer for jointly developing aircraft engines upto 100 Kilo Newton thrust as well as share the hot engine technology which Indian allies in the west are reluctant to share.France has also offered to share and jointly develop technology for longer range and heavier Highly Agile and Manoeuvrable Munition Extended Range (Hammer) missile which is currently part of the weapons package on the Indian Rafale. With a range of over 70 kilometres, the Hammer weapon can be guided on to the target using GPS, Inertial Navigation and Infra-red seeker with the capability to adjust to target location mid-air using maps for course correction. The latest version of this weapon has a 1,000 kilogram bomb and with laser guidance technology.India ordered 36 warplanes from France (equivalent of two squadrons) in 2016 for ₹59,000 crore under a government-to-government deal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/3-more-rafale-jets-land-in-india-from-france-101622136641072.html

Mariani MLA says he was target||Guwahati: Unidentified miscreants, suspected to be from Nagaland, fired at Assam legislator Rupjyoti Kurmi on Thursday when he went to look into allegations that some people from Nagaland had encroached on land along the Assam-Nagaland border.Assam chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma expressed shock at the incident and directed special DGP, Assam Police, GP Singh, to visit the spot and conduct a comprehensive inquiry. Rupjyoti Kurmi, the Congress MLA from Mariani in Jorhat district that also borders Nagaland, said the incident took place when he was touring the Disoi Valley reserve forest area, located around 5 km from Mariani town.“I had received information a few days back that people from the Nagaland side had encroached on an area which falls in my constituency. When I visited the spot on Thursday with local residents and some police personnel, there was unprovoked firing on us from the other side,” Kurmi said. “More than 20 rounds were fired at us and my personnel security officers and the policemen accompanying me retaliated in self-defence. Thankfully no one was injured. I urge the state government to take up the issue seriously and remove the encroachment from Assam soil,” he added.Police said the situation was under control and additional security personnel deployed in the area.Jorhat superintendent of police Ankur Jain said he visited the area on Wednesday to take stock of the situation. “A day earlier, forest personnel went there and uprooted some betel nut trees planted in the area. The area is a disputed territory between both states,” Jain said.Jain said local police personnel had requested lawmaker Rupjyoti Kurmi to avoid visiting the area but the Mariani MLA went ahead. He was accompanied by local residents including minors in violation of the Covid-19 restrictions in place in the state.The presence of a large number of people and security contingent in the disputed territory appears to have triggered a reaction.“As the area is disputed, people from the Nagaland side might have got worried seeing the crowd and policemen at the spot. Shots were fired in the air from the Nagaland side with muzzle-loaded rifles to scare away the Assam residents. Our security personnel also retaliated by firing blank shots. No one was injured in the incident,” said Jain.The Jorhat district authorities are in touch with their counterparts in Mokokchung district of Nagaland to ensure that the situation doesn’t go out of control.“It is unfortunate that an elected representative from Assam was fired upon by Naga miscreants when he went to inspect the spot where encroachment took place. The Assam government should conduct a thorough inquiry and ensure that all encroachments from Assam are removed,” said Congress legislature party leader Debabrata Saikia.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/shots-fired-in-air-on-assam-nagaland-border-mariani-mla-says-he-was-target-101622133422213.html

27-05-2021||India||Covid-19 vaccine: What states claim about crunch in supply||Many state governments in India have complained about a shortage in the Covid-19 vaccine supply and have urged the Centre to boost the supply. However, the Union government has denied any crunch in vaccine availability and has accused the states of not properly managing the vaccine stock.“Centre is allotting enough vaccines to the states in a transparent manner as per agreed guidelines. In fact, states are also being informed in advance of the vaccine availability. Vaccine availability is going to increase in near future and much more supply would be possible,” Dr VK Paul, member of the Niti Aayog, said earlier on Thursday in a press release, intended to address the myths regarding the vaccination program. “The behaviour of some of our leaders, who in spite of full knowledge of the facts on vaccine supply, appear on TV daily and create panic among the people is very unfortunate. This is not the time to play politics,” he further said, without mentioning any names.On May 25, the Union health ministry said that vaccine wastage in some states like Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh, Tamil Nadu, Madhya Pradesh and Jammu and Kashmir, is higher than what was prescribed. The Centre asked states to keep the wastage below 1 per cent.Also read | Home ministry extends national Covid-19 containment measures till June 30Here is a look at what some state governments have said about a shortage in the Covid-19 vaccine stocks:Rajasthan: State health minister Dr Raghu Sharma on Thursday said that vaccination has been stopped due to non-availability of vaccines and would be resumed upon receiving new supplies, news agency ANI reported.“For June, GoI has allotted 12.66 lakh vaccines (both Serum Institute & Bharat Biotech); with this combined quota, it won't be possible to vaccinate 3.25 crore beneficiaries as double dose and wastage makes vaccine requirement nearly 7 crore,” ANI quoted Dr Sharma as saying.Punjab: The state joined Haryana, Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand in denying the vaccine wastage data released by the Centre. Health minister Balbir Singh Sidhu on Thursday said that there is a shortage of vaccines in the state.“We don't have vaccines in the first place. The supply that is being made to us is not at par with our demand. It is a matter of concern. It is a 'hand to mouth' situation for us almost every day,” ANI quoted the minister as saying.Delhi: On Wednesday, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal in a tweet in Hindi said that there is a severe shortage of Covid-19 vaccines in the country and further said that had people been vaccinated at the right time, then the second wave could have been prevented.His government had also shut the vaccination centres for people in the 18 to 44 years age group for four days citing non availability of vaccines.Tamil Nadu: Chief minister MK Stalin, earlier in the day, wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi asking for complete operational freedom to the state government in running the Integrated Vaccine Complex (IVC), established by the HLL Bio-Tech Limited (HBL) in Chengalpet, Tamil Nadu.He said that the facility would enhance the country’s vaccine production capabilities and also stressed on the need to ramp up domestic production of vaccines.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid19-vaccine-what-states-claim-about-crunch-in-supply-101622131229470.html

Arvind Kumar works as a manager at one of the branches of Punjab National Bank's (PNB) in Bokaro.The PNB, however, denied Kumar's allegations and said he staged a drama to defame the bank, Livehindustan reported.

27-05-2021||India||Home ministry extends national Covid-19 containment measures till June 30||The Union home ministry on Thursday extended the nationwide Covid-19 restrictions, put in place after its April 29 order, till June 30. The ministry said the restrictions are necessary to keep a check on the spread of the infection."The strict implementation of containment and other measures has led to a declining trend in the number of new and active cases, across States & UTs, barring some areas in the Southern and North-Eastern regions," the order by Union home secretary Ajay Bhalla said."I would like to highlight that in spite of the declining trend, the number of active cases presently is still very high. It is, therefore, important that containment measures may continue to be implemented strictly. Any relaxation by States/UTs, may be considered at an appropriate time, in a graded manner, after assessing the local situation, requirements and resources," the order further said.The home secretary asked states to work on strategy to bring down the number of Covid-19 cases.In the April 29 order, the MHA directed the states and Union territories to go for intensive and local containment measures in districts with a high number of Covid-19 cases to check the spread of the viral disease.It asked the states and Union territories to identify the districts Covid positivity rate was more than 10 per cent in the last one week.The MHA also asked the states to consider the containment measures, as conveyed in an advisory issued by the Union health ministry for immediate implementation based on an assessment of the situation.The health ministry said on Thursday that the second wave of Covid-19 is on the "downswing" in the country. It, however, highlighted that the current number of active cases is "still very high".NITI Aayog member (Health) V K Paul told a news conference here that the country continues to witness the stabilisation of the second wave in most parts, both by the number of cases and positivity rate, and despite a sustained and high overall testing coverage which is “reassuring”.India recorded 2,11,298 new cases of the infection, which took the nationwide tally to to 2,73,69,093.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/home-ministry-extends-national-covid-19-containment-measures-till-june-30-101622124997938.html
27-05-2021||India||'Completely baseless': Centre dismisses New York Times' report on India's Covid-19 toll||The government on Thursday dismissed as "completely baseless" a recent New York Times report on COVID-19 toll in India, saying it is not backed by any evidence.At a press conference, the Union health ministry said the report is absolutely false and based on "distorted estimates".The report titled "Just how big could India's true Covid toll be" estimated 600,000 deaths due to the infection in the country in a conservative scenario, 1.6 million estimated deaths in a more likely scenario and 4.2 million estimated deaths in a worse scenario.Dismissing the report, Health ministry Joint Secretary Lav Agarwal said, "It is completely baseless and absolutely false and not backed on any evidence." "The question does not arise that Covid-related deaths are getting concealed because since the beginning, our efforts have been that all cases and deaths are reported in a transparent manner. It is also necessary so that we can understand the overall trajectory of infection and what efforts have to be made so that required actions can be taken for it," he said.NITI Aayog Member (Health) V K Paul said the report is based on distorted estimates."The estimates have been done ad-hoc without any basis... reported cases are a part of a larger universe of total infections in any country," he said.He said the problem in the analysis arises "when certain number is thrown as mortality rate out of that infection". "If we go with our sero survey, then infection related mortality is 0.05 per cent and actual mortality is 1.1 per cent... They are taking 0.3 per cent - 6 times - on what basis has it been decided that it is 0.3 per cent of that large infection number - no basis at all," Paul said. He further said that if the same method is used, then by that estimate New York reported 50,000 deaths in May."I make it six times, it is 90,000 deaths and if I do it 12 times, it is 1.75 lakh deaths but they don't say that, they say it is 16,000. What I mean to say here is this is a distorted estimate for mortality. For infection estimate, they used our data only from January which can still be acceptable," Paul said. "On what basis this group pulls out infection mortality rate of 0.3 per cent in one scenario and 0.15 another scenario and 0.6 in another scenario? On what basis, this is just an assumption and a feeling of some people and this is something that should have been not published particularly in so called prestigious publication. I submit that we have a strong mortality tracking system which has stood the test of time," he said.Paul said there might be deaths where testing was not done but "outrageous factor suddenly without any basis and just on assumption is not fair and we don't accept it".||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/completely-baseless-centre-on-new-york-times-report-on-india-s-covid-19-toll-101622124318671.html
27-05-2021||India||In BJP leader’s unusual advice to IMA, a biting critique of yoga guru Ramdev||Dr Sanjay Jaiswal, the top Bharatiya Janata Party leader in Bihar, on Thursday, waded into the continuing row between the Indian Medical Association and yoga guru Ramdev, advising the association of doctors to mostly ignore the guru’s offensive against allopathic medicines.“Don’t waste your years of education and energy in useless discussion and instead concentrate on our noble profession,” said the doctor-turned-politician, a lawmaker from Paschim Champaran and Bihar BJP president in a Facebook post.“Concentrating on our profession would be the most befitting service to our innumerable colleagues who have lost their lives attending to their duties in the midst of the Covid-19 pandemic,” said the Bihar BJP president.Baba Ramdev has been in the eye of a fresh controversy when he questioned the efficacy of allopathic medicines in treating the dreaded coronavirus.“Ramdev is a yoga guru. Nobody can question his mastery of yoga. But he is certainly not a Yogi. A Yogi is one who has control over all his senses and brain. What he has done for yoga is comparable to what Coca Cola did for beverages. Indians have been, for ages, consuming Shikanji and thandai but after the advent of the soft drink giant, every home seems to be stocked with bottles of Pepsi and Coke”, Jaiswal said in his post.“There is no need to reply to all baseless talks. If you speak more, you start giving importance to others,” he advised the IMA.Jaiswal, who is among the first prominent BJP leaders to have criticised Ramdev for sparking off the controversy, however, batted for yoga.“It (yoga) is important as it keeps you disease-free but this is not a system of medicine,” he opined.He, however, asserted that every system of medicine “has its own limitations” which held true for yoga as well, a sophisticated form of physiotherapy which can help us ward off illnesses but can create problems if we take to it to cure existing ailments”.Dr Shahjanand Kumar Singh, IMA national president (elect), said Ramdev shouldn’t demoralise doctors who have done yeoman’s service to treat patients during the ongoing pandemic.“He (Ramdev) should stick to yoga and his Patanjali products,” said Dr Singh, adding that every state unit of IMA was contemplating legal action against the yoga guru.The IMA has already written to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, asking that Ramdev be booked under sedition charges for allegedly spreading misinformation on vaccination and challenging government protocols for treatment of Covid-19 and its Uttarakhand chapter has sent a ₹1,000-crore defamation notice to the yoga guru.According to the IMA’s complaint to the PM, Ramdev was seen claiming in a viral video that 10,000 doctors have died in the country despite taking both doses of the vaccines. The IMA said such statements were persuading people not to get the Covid-19 vaccines against the national interest of overcoming the pandemic, IMA said. “This in our opinion is a clear-cut case of sedition in addition to causing irreversible damage to the national interest and the poor masses of this country,” read the letter by IMA.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ramdev-is-yoga-guru-not-a-yogi-bihar-bjp-chief-s-biting-advice-to-ima-101622123699946.html

Prima facie, these statements are not only mendacious, but designed to impede a lawful inquiry by a private enterprise,” news agency ANI quoted Delhi Police officials as saying. “Twitter, being a public platform, must lead in demonstrating transparency in its functioning and should bring clarity into subject matters of public domain. Since the matter has been put in public domain, it’s important to set the record straight on tendentious statement made,” the officials were further quoted as saying.Accusing the social media giant of purporting to be an investigating, as well as adjudicating judicial authority, they also said that the police is the only legal entity to investigate, as duly laid down in the law, while courts are the only legal entity that can adjudicate.The officials further clarified that the Delhi Police registered a preliminary inquiry on the complaints filed by a representative of the Congress and, therefore, efforts by Twitter to portray it as a First Information Report (FIR) filed at the behest of the Government of India are “wholly and completely incorrect.”Also Read | After Delhi Police’s visit to Twitter office, Rahul Gandhi tweets about truthOn the alleged toolkit, the officials said that the declaration by Twitter that the toolkit is “manipulated media,” clearly shows that it was aware of facts of the case, and was hence asked to join the probe to provide the information it possesses.“Twitter’s latest statement is devised to seek dubious sympathy when they themselves not only refuse to comply with the law of the land but also claim possession of material evidence but also refuse to share it with duly recognised legal authority,” the police officials said further.The statement put out by the San Francisco-headquartered company on Thursday morning was over the visits by officials from the Delhi Police special cell to its offices in Delhi and Gurugram in connection with the alleged toolkit on May 24, as well as over the ongoing controversy on the IT Rules, 2021.

The people of Lakshadweep deserve a developmental vision that respects their way of life and reflects their aspirations,” Gandhi said. He cited Lakshadweep’s pristine natural beauty and said its unique confluence of cultures has drawn people for generations. He added the custodians of its heritage seek to safeguard the archipelago for posterity.“However, their future is threatened by the anti-people policies announced by the administrator of Lakshadweep, Shri Praful Khoda Patel. The administrator has unilaterally proposed sweeping changes without duly consulting elected representatives or the public. The people of Lakshadweep are protesting against these arbitrary actions.”Also Read | Lakshadweep MP Mohammed Faizal seeks recall of administrator Praful PatelGandhi referred to various orders Patel has passed since December 2020. He added the Lakshadweep Development Authority Regulation undermines safeguards pertaining to land ownership, dilutes environmental regulations for certain activities, and limits legal resources available to affected persons.He said the Prevention of Anti-Social Activities Regulation, Lakshadweep Animal Preservation Regulation, and end on restrictions on the sale of alcohol was a deliberate assault on the cultural fabric of the local community. Gandhi accused Patel of destroying the heritage of the archipelago, harassing its people, and imposing arbitrary rules.Patel has faced allegations of trying to “saffronise” the archipelago, where almost 95% of the population is Muslim.The Bharatiya Janata Party’s Lakshadweep unit president Mohammad Kasim on Tuesday joined the chorus of protests against the regulations.

Before China’s intervention, the paper insisted, Tibet was a “wretched and backward feudal serfdom” that was “doomed to die out”.But China does not recognise the CTA and hasn’t held talks with the Dalai Lama’s representatives since 2010.On day one in the CTA’s lead role, Penpa Tsering, who has spoken about his fears of cultural genocide in Tibet, sounded a conciliatory note, vowing to resolutely tread the path of Middle Way advocated by the Dalai Lama to reach out to the Chinese government to find a “mutually beneficial, negotiated, non-violent solution to the Sino-Tibet conflict”.Tsering, 54, was administered the oath of office and secrecy by the Tibetan Supreme Justice Commissioner Sonam Norbu Dagpo in presence of his predecessor Lobsang Sangay and spiritual leader the Dalai Lama, who attended the event virtually.In his inaugural address, Tsering promised that he will use all his energies to find a lasting solution for the Sino-Tibet conflict and the welfare of the Tibetan people.Till it is done, he said the Kashag (cabinet) shall represent the voices of Tibetans inside Tibet and optimise the global advocacy efforts. “We shall not dither from pointing out the gross mistakes of the Chinese government’s policies and programs and seek to redress, withdraw or amend the wrong policies,” Tsering promised.In future, the CTA President said, if and when the need arises to bring novelty in our approach in tune with the changing situation, it would be done in accordance with the democratic norms and consulting all important institutions.“We will be responsible to the Tibetan Parliament-in-exile and provide all necessary assistance to the three autonomous bodies, work out with NGOs irrespective of region, religion and political position and maintain transparency,” he said in a speech that focused on the immediate concerns of running the administration.In the days ahead of his oath ceremony, Tsering has been outspoken to counter China and the continuing effort in Beijing to choose the next Dalai Lama. How will they, he asked at an event earlier this month, because communist leaders don’t even believe in religion whereas the succession of the Tibetan spiritual leader is a deeply religious matter.Tsering told news agency Reuters earlier this month that he would continue to use all ways and means to reach out to the Chinese government. “We’ll use all ways and means to reach out to the Chinese government,” said Tsering. “If the Chinese don’t respond to us the only way we can keep the issue alive is to reach out to the international community,” he said, underlining that there was an urgent threat of “cultural genocide” in Tibet, and the international community must stand up to China ahead of the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/new-tibetan-president-offers-to-send-team-to-china-to-verify-white-paper-claim-101622119500566.html
27-05-2021||India||'Twitter's statement on IT rules an attempt to defame India to hide own follies': Govt||The Centre on Thursday lashed out at micro-blogging website Twitter, saying its statement on the country's new IT rules is an attempt to dictate its terms to the world’s largest democracy. The statement has been posted on Koo, the India-made social media platform, which gained traction earlier this year after the long-standing spat between the Centre on Twitter started around January-February.Also Read: Twitter says dialogue with Govt will continueThe government said that the unfortunate statement issued by Twitter is totally baseless, false and an attempt to defame India to hide their own follies. It asked Twitter to "stop beating around the bush and comply with the laws of the land".In the statement, the Centre strongly controverted the claims made by Twitter. "Twitter refuses to comply with those very regulations in the Intermediary Guidelines on the basis of which it is claiming a safe harbour protection from any criminal liability in India," the government statement said."India has a glorious tradition of free speech and democratic practices dating back centuries. Protecting free speech in India is not the prerogative of only a private, for-profit, foreign entity like Twitter," it added.The strongly-worded statement said that the only instance of scuttling free speech on Twitter is Twitter itself and its opaque policies. "As a result of this, people’s accounts are suspended and tweets deleted arbitrarily without recourse."Also Read: Amid controversy with WhatsApp, RS Prasad defends digital media guidelinesThe government also said that law making and policy formulation is the "sole prerogative of the sovereign" and a social media platform like Twitter has no locus in dictating what should India’s legal policy framework should be."The government also wishes to emphatically assure that representatives of social media companies including Twitter are and will always remain safe in India and there is no threat to their personal safety and security," the Centre said.In the latest round of the ongoing spat, Twitter said in a statement that it is concerned by recent events "regarding our employees in India and the potential threat to freedom of expression for the people we serve".The social network reiterated its commitment to India as a vital market, but criticised new IT rules and regulations that it said "inhibit free, open public conversation."In the new digital rules, social media companies like Facebook, WhatsApp and Twitter have been asked to identify within 36 hours the origin of a flagged message as well as conduct additional due diligence, including the appointment of a chief compliance officer, nodal contact person and resident grievance officer.Also Read: WhatsApp moves court against government of India. Here’s what it saidAccording to Twitter, the company is particularly concerned about the requirement to make an individual (the compliance officer) criminally liable for content on the platform, the requirements for proactive monitoring, and the blanket authority to seek information about its users.This, it said, represents dangerous overreach that is inconsistent with open, democratic principles.Twitter said it will continue to have dialogue with the government on the new rules.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/twitters-statement-on-it-rules-totally-baseless-false-govt-101622119119620.html
27-05-2021||India||Chhattisgarh activists reject police theory on Silger firing||Ten days after police firing killed three tribals protesting against a Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) camp at Silger village in Chhattisgarh’s Sukma, a two-member fact- finding team of activists said they didn’t find any evidence to support police claim that an armed group of 3,000 agitators, including Maoist cadres, took over the peaceful protests on May 17 and intended to burn down the CRPF camp, leaving the forces with no choice but to open fire.Human Rights activist Bela Bhatia and social activist Jean Dreze, who formed the fact-finding team, issued a press release on Thursday and said the locals were opposed to the CRPF camp fearing harassment.Three people were killed and many others were injured on Monday afternoon when security forces fired on protestors, agitating against the CRPF camp, opened on May 12 near Silger village - a Maoist stronghold along the border of Sukma-Bijapur districts.Chhattisgarh Police maintains that the CRPF camp was established in Silger village on 12th of May to mainly facilitate the Basaguda -Jagargunda road construction among other developmental works since the axis is an important corridor for Maoists in south Bastar region and a stronghold of People’s Liberation Guerrilla Army (PLGA) Battalion number 1, led by dreaded Maoist commander Hidma. PLGA is the armed wing of the Communist Party of India (Maoist), a banned organisation in India.The activists claim that the Silger camp was set up in the dead of night at around 3 am on May 12, without informing the villagers and about 40-50 of them were dispersed by force when they protested against the camp the next day. “On 14 May, about a thousand adivasis [tribals] of five nearby gram panchayats started a mass protest which went from strength to strength in the following days. Mass protests continue to this day,” the fact-finding report claimed.The report added that the protests swelled between May 14 and 16.“People shouted slogans demanding the removal of the camp. Every day the police tried to disperse them, sometimes with lathis, sometimes with “mirchi pataka” or tear gas. Dozens of protestors sustained minor injuries... and returned to their villages for local treatment,” the activists alleged.They cite witnesses to claim that the number of protestors might have reached 10,000 on May 17 and some of them started pelting stones after lathicharge, tear gassing and firing in the air by the security forces sent most running for cover.“Some protestors are said to have shouted that they would burn the police vehicles, but this did not happen,” the activists press release claims.“By that time the forces were on both sides of the road with protesters in the middle. Soon police firing started. Three protestors were killed on the spot (one of them, Uika Pandu – also called Murali – of Timmapuram village, who was hit in the head, was only 16 or 17 years old), at least another three had bullet injuries and as many as 40 were injured in one way or another,” the activists alleged.One survivor from Pusbaka village, who is now in the ICU in Bijapur, was shot in the back, the activists’ report claimed.The activists further said that the police theory that the protests were joined by armed cadres of Maoists who were looking to burn the camp down was “bizarre”.“This bizarre story does not fit with any of the testimonies we have heard. By that time [the protestors gathered] the camp had a huge presence of heavily armed personnel and there was no point in trying to attack it,” the report claimed.Explaining the reasons behind the protest against the camp, the report stated, “The main reason for people’s opposition to the camp is that they are afraid of harassment (eg, searches, beatings, sexual assault, fabricated cases, fake encounters and such).”To back their contention the activists claimed that an unarmed civilian named Midiam Masa was killed at Tolevarti village on May 22 near another new CRPF camp in the area while gathering mangoes with two other villagers.”Bastar region’s police chief (IGP), Sunderaj P refuted the claims made in the so called fact-finding report and said Silger villagers were properly briefed about the nature of the camp on May 13 by police officials and executive magistrate and they returned convinced with the response.“Meanwhile the Maoists were planning to destabilize this camp to protect their corridor. So the Naxals mobilized their frontal organization members and Militia cadres from the surrounding area and sent [them] to Silger on 17th of May with a conspiracy to instigate violence and launch an attack on the security forces deployed in the Silger camp,” the IGP said.He further claimed that some armed cadres hidden in the jungles attacked the camp triggering retaliation from the security forces.“On 17th of May, when the crowd started pelting stones and attacked the troops, utmost restraint was maintained by the security forces. The executive magistrate repeatedly issued warnings to maintain peace and order, which was ignored by the miscreants, who were basically the militia cadres acting on the behest of Maoist leadership,” the IGP said.He added that the security forces retaliated only after they were attacked by the armed cadres. He added that the three bodies recovered from the spot could not be identified by the villagers for two days since they were outsiders. He also refuted claims that one of the deceased was a minor.He further alleged that the Maoists compelled the villagers to bring all the three bodies to Silger village and were planning to cremate them as per the Maoist way of cremation but gave up when relatives insisted on cremating them in their own villages.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/chhattisgarh-activists-reject-police-theory-on-silger-firing-101622119259355.html

He is also expected to visit and hold meetings with officials in two affected states besides undertaking an aerial survey of the cyclone-hit areas on Friday.“About 106 teams of NDRF [National Disaster Response Force] were deployed … in West Bengal and Odisha that rescued more than 1,000 persons and removed more than 2,500 trees/poles that had fallen & obstructed the roads … Army and Coast Guard also rescued marooned persons, while Navy & Air Force were on the alert,” Modi was informed at the Thursday’s meeting, according to a statement.Modi highlighted the importance of preliminary weather reports as officials told him that accurate forecasting helped in evacuations in a timely manner and ensured the minimal loss of human life. He was told the damage assessment was being carried out and much of it was inflicted due to flooding. Modi was told power and telecom services have been restored in most of the affected areas.Also Read | Cyclone Yaas: 8 lakh people affected in JharkhandModi noted the active role played by central and states agencies and advised them to ensure an early return to normal life in these affected areas.

27-05-2021||India||In a crematorium, a silent Hindu-Muslim bond||Suneel, 56, and Aqeel, 20, both Kanpur-born, led ordinary, mundane lives. Suneel is deeply wedded to the idea of Sanathan Dharam, eternal duty, and religious practices come naturally to him. He lost his father as a five-year-old and studied through his early years to join a transport network.Aqeel, only 20, passed out of Class 12 and joined one of Kanpur’s many tanneries. The ₹8,000 he brought home every month, greatly supplemented the family’s income.The two met for the first time at the unlikeliest of places: Kanpur’s Bhairoghat crematorium. Both had volunteered to work with Madad Guru, a wing of Divya Prakash Sewa Samiti, an NGO that has lent its shoulder during the Covid-19 pandemic. Its 70 volunteers are cremating bodies, cooking food for the poor and distributing medical kits in rural areas.Suneel and Aqeel have no time to chat but have a deep bond that only grief can bring. They have carried hundreds of dead bodies and quietly laid them on the pyre.“There is some respite now. We are cremating 30 to 40 bodies everyday but in April, when the second wave hit like a tsunami, we have had rows and rows of bodies lying at the gates of Bhairoghat,” says Suneel.According to Ayush Gaur, founder of Madad Guru, “At the peak, we had 100 to 120 bodies per day. They just kept arriving in ambulances and we had to distribute tokens.”Some days, the token was kept on the sheets the bodies came wrapped in. They came straight from hospitals and often without family members. Rarely did two people from a family accompany a dead relative. The fear of contracting the virus forced many to bid farewell at the hospital itself. They would come the following day to collect the ashes.Also Read | Covid-19 and the disease of inequalitySuneel and Aqeel worked tirelessly. They had no time to talk; unburden themselves. Each body needed at least 250 kilograms of wood, some ghee and as Suneel said, “two yards of coffin cloth.” The families would not come but sometimes gave directions on a video call. “Make sure the last rites are done in accordance with Hindu traditions,’’ was a common request.A daughter came with her mother’s body. There was no one to help shift it from the tempo in which it arrived. The driver flatly refused but the volunteers stepped in.Disposing the dead has become a drill. Take the body out of the ambulance. Lay it in the queue. Build a pyre. Carry the body into Bhairoghat. Place it on the platform around pyres that were already aflame. Add some ghee and some straw, so the fires crackle and burn quicker. Pyres are usually not lit after sunset. They had to be laid to rest the day they came.There are no priests in Bhairoghat. Suneel knows the rituals. He is now a part of the Sanathan Dharam Ayog Mandal. What he was not prepared for and still finds difficult to accept is the fact that bodies were just abandoned. “I am anguished that family members were not willing to walk the last few steps for the last rites.”The anguish is deep but it has to wait. There is work to be done. The days go by in a haze. It’s the lengthening shadows of the night that Aqeel has problems with. Initially, he had trouble falling asleep. The long line of bodies was an image imprinted in his mind. “That’s all I could think of. Bodies of all ages, fastened in plastic sheets. But that was in the beginning. Now I’m so tired when I reach home, I just fall asleep.”Aqeel reaches every morning, wears a PPE suit, secures his mask firmly over his nose and mouth and gets down to work. He carries body after body, with help from another volunteer. “At least two people are needed to carry one body,” he said. A quick break when possible was taken, to quickly eat some food, has a sip of water. A restaurateur has loaned Madad Guru his kitchen where other volunteers are busy cooking and packing food.Also Read | India runs the risk of losing its pharma edgeFood is distributed to many. To its volunteers, the ambulance drivers, family members, junior doctors and the hungry. “Anyone who needs it,” says Gaur, whose daily schedule now entails driving into rural areas to distribute medical kits comprising masks, sanitisers and paracetamol tablets.Aqeel and Suneel usually eat after sunset. By then, their PPE suits are covered with soot and ash. They have no appetite but tell each other that eat they must. Last year, during the first Corona wave, both were involved with distributing food at the highway, for passing migrants.Both of them got calls from Madad Guru in end-March this year, asking if they were willing to volunteer again, this time at the crematorium.“If not now, then when? I consider myself lucky to have got this opportunity,” asks Suneel.Aqeel has no problem answering the question either. “Humanity demands that I lend my shoulder,” he says. He will return to the tannery when it reopens. The NGO has become an extension of his family. “The tannery is not paying me but when I need money, I get ₹1,000 to ₹2,000 from the NGO,’’ he says. His family knows he’s doing social service but doesn’t know he’s helping at the crematorium.Do they remember how many pyres they lit?“Hundreds,” says Suneel.“I didn’t light any pyre. Only helped carry the bodies,” says Aqeel.Why?“Because I’m a Muslim,” he says.“You are human,’ says Suneel.(Both wanted to be mentioned only by their first names)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-a-crematorium-a-silent-hindu-muslim-bond-101622119139657.html

She further said that the World health Organization (WHO) has no recommendation on vaccinating children, and no country is conducting these tests."As of now, no country in the world is giving vaccines to children. WHO has no recommendation on vaccinating children. Trials on children in India are going to begin soon. The decision is to be taken by scientists after data is available based on trials," Sitharaman tweeted.The finance minister also shared a release where the government busted seven myths around its handling of the coronavirus disease situation. Sitharaman added a clarification given by Niti Aayog member Dr VK Paul where he said that trials on children are at lower priority because of the risk involved."When any drug/vaccine is discovered, typically it is first sorted out in the adult population because you do not want to risk children," Dr Paul said in the tweet thread shared by Sitharaman in which he is speaking to news agency ANI."If we go with the paradigm of deaths as a public health objective, it's a lower priority," he further said.Amid a debate around inoculating children for the deadly infection, Dr Paul said that the vaccine developed by American pharmaceutical giant Pfizer can be administered to the younger population.He also said that the government has been pursuing Pfizer, Johnson & Johnson and Moderna since mid-2020 for the earliest possible imports, and has even waived local trials for well-established foreign vaccine makers.Pfizer has told Indian authorities that its vaccine is suitable for everyone aged 12 years or above and can be stored for a month at 2-8 degrees Celsius.The company, which has offered 5 crore doses to India between July and October, recently held a series of interactions with Indian government authorities.It shared with authorities the most recent data points regarding efficacy trials and approvals for its vaccine in various countries and by the WHO.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/trials-of-covid-19-vaccine-on-children-to-begin-soon-in-india-sitharaman-101622114873436.html

According to officials, the aircraft was flying towards Aligarh when a “technical glitch” forced the pilots to make an emergency landing.The instructor and trainee pilot were both not injured in the incident.“It was a two-seater trainer aircraft which made an emergency landing on the Yamuna Expressway. The trainer and the trainee are safe. They landed because of a technical glitch,” said Mathura’s Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) Dr Gaurav Grover.Elaborating further, Lokesh Bhati, the in-charge of Naujheel police station in Mathura, said, “Teams have arrived from Delhi and Aligarh to look out for the technical glitch that forced the aircraft to make an emergency landing. The trainer, Jagrath Yadav, landed the aircraft at around 12:30pm. Upon landing, the two pilots contacted the authorities, informing them of the accident.”Bhati further said that the aircraft was parked on a side of the expressway and, as such, it did not present any hurdle in traffic movement. The aircraft, whose landing spot falls within limits of the Naujheel police station, took off from Narnaul in Haryana and is owned by a private company, the Station House Officer (SHO) informed.The 165-km long Yamuna Expressway was inaugurated in August 2012 by then-Uttar Pradesh chief minister Akhilesh Yadav, and passes through Mathura and Aligarh.

He underlined vaccines are in limited supply globally, and companies have their own priorities, game plans and compulsions in allocating stocks. “They also give preference to countries of their origin just as our own vaccine makers have done unhesitatingly for us.”Paul said the Centre proactively eased the entry of vaccines approved by the US Food and Drug Administration, European Medicines Agency, UK’s Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency, Japan’s Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency, and World Health Organisation’s Emergency Use Listing into India in April. “These vaccines will not need to undergo prior bridging trials. The provision has now been further amended to waive off the trial requirement altogether for the well-established vaccines manufactured in other countries,” he said.Also Read | Politics behind US call for coronavirus origin probe, says ChinaBridging trials refer to supplementary trials performed in a new region or country to get more clinical data on efficacy, safety and dose regimen.States like Delhi have asked the Centre to procure vaccines and distribute them across the country as many of them have failed to get global vaccine makers to supply shots to them directly amid a shortage of jabs after a widened inoculation drive.The government in April said it will allow certain foreign-made vaccines to be rolled out and conduct parallel bridging clinical trials after they get the authorisation instead of requiring them to conduct bridging trials prior to seeking approval. It had said coronavirus vaccines cleared for use in the US, the UK, the European Union, and Japan will get fast-track approval in India to boost the pandemic response when India was recording the world’s biggest surge in infections.Paul said as soon as Pfizer indicated vaccine availability, the Central government and the company began working together. “Multiple rounds of discussions have happened with Pfizer, J&J & Moderna,” he said. “The government offered all assistance to have them supply and/or manufacture their vaccines in India,” said Paul in response to questions about India’s Covid-19 vaccine strategy.Paul said that no application of any foreign manufacturer for approval was currently pending with the drugs controller. “However, it is not that their vaccines are available in free supply. We need to understand that buying vaccines internationally is not similar to buying off the shelf items.”Paul said the Centre has remained engaged with all the major international vaccine manufacturers from mid-2020 and as a result of its efforts, Russian made Sputnik V vaccine trials got accelerated. He added with timely approval, Russia has sent two tranches of vaccines and accomplished tech transfer to Indian companies that would start manufacturing very soon. “We reiterate our request to all international vaccine makers to come and make in India – for India and for the world.”He referred to allegations that the Centre did not approve vaccines available globally, Paul said regulatory modifications were specially made to facilitate entry of foreign Covid-19 vaccine manufacturers. He added that included the condition of submitting local bridging studies while applying for emergency use authorisation in India.Pfizer is believed to have offered 50 million doses to India between July and October this year and sought indemnification among other regulatory waivers to export vaccines. In a statement to HT, the company said it remains committed to continuing its engagement with India towards making the Pfizer BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine available for use in the country. “Since the ongoing discussions are confidential, we cannot provide any further comments.”Paul denied allegations that the Centre was not doing enough to ramp up domestic Covid-19 vaccine production. “The central government is playing the role of an effective facilitator to enable more companies to produce vaccines from early 2020. There is only one Indian company [Bharat Biotech] which has the IP [intellectual property]. The government...has ensured that 3 other companies/plants will start production of Covaxin apart from enhancing Bharat Biotech’s own plants, which have increased from 1 to 4.”Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin production is also being ramped from about 10 million doses per month to nearly 100 million doses by October.Covishield and Covaxin were the first two shots to be approved in the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/local-trials-for-covid-shots-scrapped-to-fast-track-imports-101622114314117.html
27-05-2021||India||Covid-19 vaccine supply hasn't closed, says Dr VK Paul||Niti Aayog (health) member Dr VK Paul on Thursday said that Covid-19 vaccine supply hasn't closed. "To say Covid-19 vaccine supply has closed isn't true. Truth is that out of the available production, a distinct part is available to non-government channels, including state governments, to be used for vaccinating people of their state according to flexible approach by state governments," Dr Paul told news agency ANI.He further said that it has been found out that now Pfizer can be administered to the younger population. "When any drug/vaccine is discovered, typically it is first sorted out in the adult population because you do not want to risk children....It has been found out now that Pfizer can be administered to the younger population," said the NITI Aayog member.On vaccination for children, Dr Paul said that Covaxin has received permission and it will start pediatric trial. "I think they are going all the way to 2 years of age in systematic way. I have been told Serum Institute of India (SII) wants to begin pediatric trial of Novavax," he added.Paul further said that the World Health Organization (WHO) hasn't given any recommendation yet to cover pediatric population in general as any illness in that population group is extremely mild. "If we go with paradigm of deaths as a public health objective, it's at lower priority," he said.The Niti Aayog member added that they will have to prepare to give 1 crore doses in a day. "It will be possible in few weeks, we will have to prepare. We made possible 43 lakh doses in a day. We should bring it up to 73 lakh in next 3 weeks. We should make a system to achieve it," he said.This comes after Pfizer told the Centre that their Covid-19 vaccine can be administered to everyone aged 12 and above and can also be stored at 2-8 degree temperature for a month, sources told news agency ANI.The Pfizer vaccine which was created in collaboration with German biotechnology firm BioNTech is the only vaccine currently being administered to children in few countries.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid19-vaccine-supply-hasn-t-closed-says-dr-vk-paul-101622111211222.html
27-05-2021||India||Those who went to Delhi sent back with an answer, says K’taka CM Yediyurappa||Karnataka chief minister BS Yediyurappa on Thursday said that his only priority was to deal with the Covid-19 pandemic and had no reason to indulge in other matters.“I only have Covid in front of me. Controlling Covid and people’s welfare are my only priorities.If someone went to someplace, they have been sent back with an answer,” Yediyurappa told reporters in Bengaluru on Thursday.The statement comes a day after at least two Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leaders, including one minister, went to Delhi, purportedly to meet the top brass in connection with a possible change in leadership in the state.The clamour for a leadership change in Karnataka has grown louder with increasing instances of conflict within the BJP and the Yediyurappa-led government. The defeat in the Maski bypolls and wafer thin margin of victory in Belagavi Lok Sabha by-elections has also gone against the 78-year-old chief minister.At least two BJP legislators aware of the developments indicated a possible change post the calming of the pandemic. Among the leaders who had rushed to Delhi was CP Yogeshwara, member of the Karnataka legislative council, and minister for tourism, ecology and environment. Yogeshwara claimed on Thursday that he went to Delhi “for personal reasons”.“I keep going to Delhi and can’t tell everything to the media. I will share more in the coming days,” he said in Bengaluru.Also Read | Centenarian freedom fighter who spoke truth to powerHowever, he did reiterate that the BJP in Karnataka works like a coalition government with the other two political parties -- an apparent reference to Congress and Janata Dal (Secular)-- appearing to be in power. “The day I became an MLC also I said that it does not appear as a pure BJP government. It appears to be a three-party government,” he said.In 2018 assembly elections, Yogeshwara lost his seat against HD Kumaraswamy of the JD(S) in Channapatna. However, he was able to secure a seat in the legislature, apparently for his role in securing the support of the 17 turncoat legislators who defected to the BJP, leading to the collapse of the Kumaraswamy-led JD(S)-Congress coalition government in the state.Meanwhile, other ministers in the BJP tried to rally behind Yediyurappa, dismissing any speculation of a leadership change. MP Renukacharya, the BJP legislator from Honnali and political secretary to the chief minister, came down heavily on Yogeshwara for his apparent attempt to seek a leadership change.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/those-who-went-to-delhi-sent-back-with-an-answer-says-k-taka-cm-yediyurappa-101622113594297.html
27-05-2021||India||India scraps local trials for Covid vaccines to fast-track imports||The Centre on Thursday scrapped local trials for "well-established" foreign coronavirus disease (Covid-19) vaccines to fast-track imports, news agency Reuters reported.The government said it was in talks with American pharmaceutical giant Pfizer for "earliest possible" imports of its vaccine and that it had also had discussions with Johnson & Johnson and Moderna.Last month, India pledged to fast-track approvals for foreign vaccines but its insistence on local trials was a key reason for stalled discussions with Pfizer."The provision has now been further amended to waive the trial requirement altogether for the well-established vaccines manufactured in other countries," Reuters quoted the government saying in a statement. This was earlier announced by Niti Aayog (health) member Dr VK Paul in a statement, which said that the vaccine approved by the US Food and Drug Administration, European Medicines Agency and other reputed bodies, will not be required to undergo prior bridging trial and trials for “well-established” vaccines have been waived altogether.India started its nationwide vaccination programme on January 16 this year after the country's drugs regulator DCGI approved two vaccines - AstraZeneca's Covishield and Covaxin made by local firm Bharat Biotech. Russia-made Sptunik V is also available in the market now.But supplies are far short of the millions of doses the world's second-most populous country needs. Many state governments have flagged the issue to the Centre, with chief ministers claiming the Centre is not doing enough to procure vaccines from abroad.The government countered the allegation, calling it a myth. Dr Paul said on Thursday said that the government is engaged in discussions and deliberations with many pharmaceutical giants. The government even offered assistance for the domestic production of their vaccines. However, vaccines being in “limited supply globally” has hampered their efforts, Dr Paul said in the statement.Though India has tremendously increased the daily testing and vaccination of its population, just about 3% of the country's 1.3 billion people have been fully vaccinated.The country reported 211,298 new infections on Thursday, nearly half the daily infections it recorded earlier this month, which pushed the overall caseload to 27.37 million.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-scraps-local-trials-for-covid-vaccines-to-fast-track-imports-101622113378481.html

NZP curator VVL Subhadra Devi confirmed to HT that all the eight lions tested negative and were back in their enclosures. On April 24, these eight big cats were found to be suffering from mild respiratory distress. Based on the guidelines of the Central Zoo Authority, their nasal and oral discharge samples were collected and sent to the Laboratory for Conservation of Endangered Species at CSIR-Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology (LaCONES-CCMB). Also Read | Lion tests positive for Covid-19 at Etawah Safari Park“The samples were tested using RT-PCR, and found positive for coronavirus. The CCMB analysed the genomes of coronavirus samples from these lions, and did not find those to be a variant of concern. The source of infection has not been found yet,” a CCMB spokesperson said. The lions were isolated from other animals. “They responded well to the treatment and showed signs of recovery,” a zoo official said. After two weeks of treatment, there were no symptoms of the virus in the zoo. But the authorities continued to keep the lions in isolation for a couple of weeks more, before testing them for the virus again. The zoo has been closed for public since May 2, following an advisory from the Union ministry of environment, forests and climate change.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/all-8-covid-ve-asiatic-lions-in-hyderabad-recover-101622112990178.html

27-05-2021||India||Experts talk about myths, misconceptions around black fungus||Mucormycosis, previously known as zygomycosis and sometimes termed as black fungus, is a serious fungal infection, found generally in people with less ability to fight infection. As the cases of black fungus infection continue to rise in India, doctors and scientists are worried if there is more to it than just the use of steroids.Symptoms of this infection depend on the part of the body which is infected. It most commonly infects the sinuses and brain resulting in a runny nose, one-sided facial swelling and pain, headache, fever, and tissue death.Other forms of the disease may infect the lungs, stomach and intestines, and skin. It is generally spread by breathing in, eating food contaminated by, or getting spores of molds of the Mucorales type in an open wound.These fungi are frequently present in decomposing organic matter such as rotting fruit and vegetables, leaves, and animal manure, but do not usually have an effect as it is not transmitted between people.Risk factors for the infection include diabetes, lymphoma, organ transplant, iron overload, HIV/AIDS, and long-term steroids or immunosuppressants use. Diagnosis for black fungus is done by biopsy and culture, with medical imaging to help determine the extent of the disease.Treatment for it is generally done with amphotericin B and surgical debridement and preventive measures include wearing a face mask in dusty areas, avoiding contact with water-damaged buildings, and protecting the skin from exposure to the soil such as when gardening or certain outdoor work.Black Fungus tends to progress rapidly and is fatal in about half of sinus cases and almost all cases of the widespread type. To talk about the disease and to spread awareness for it, experts from Ujala Cygnus Hospital, Columbia Asia Hospital, and Paras Hospital shared their inputs.Dr Amitabh Malik, Chief- ENT, Paras Hospital, Gurugram spoke about the misconceptions among people regarding the disease and said, "The rising incidences and mortality related to black fungus have actually paved the way for lots of misconception and misunderstanding about the fungal infection. People have started alienating the families, whose members are diagnosed with black fungus, thinking it's a highly contagious infection."Speaking further on the subject, he continued, "Black fungus disease is not contagious, which means that it cannot spread from contact between humans or animals. But it does spread from fungal spores that are present in the air or in the environment, which are almost impossible to avoid. Some people also feel that it can happen due to eating fruit. Uncontrolled diabetes along with a Covid infection are the leading causes for a patient to develop black fungus."Ever since the first few cases of black fungus had been reported, there has been extensive media coverage about it. This has led to fear and confusion among the public about its causes and effects. Mucormycosis, colloquially known as the black fungus, has aggravated the devastating effects of the second wave of the Covid pandemic.What needs to be understood is that our bodies are constantly attacked by different bacteria and fungi but they are kept under control by our immune system. It is when this immune system is compromised due to unreasonable use of steroids, diabetes, or cancer treatment; it gives a breeding ground to these fungi and bacteria to grow rapidly.Most diabetic patients suffering from COVID-19, who are being given steroids, have a high chance of being affected by the black fungus. To prevent it, people should stop the misuse of steroids.Mucormycosis can affect the face, infecting the nose, the orbit of the eye, or the brain, which can cause even vision loss.Dr Shuchin Bajaj, Founder and Director, Ujala Cygnus Group of Hospitals said that "it can also spread to the lungs. Doctors treating COVID-19 patients, diabetics and those with compromised immune systems should watch for early symptoms including sinus pain or nasal blockage on one side of the face, one-sided headache, swelling or numbness, toothache and loosening of teeth to guard against black fungus infections."There is also the idea among people that excessive use of steroids is causing the infection. The expression 'excessive use of steroids' can be misleading.Dr Shashank Vashist, Consultant- ENT, Columbia Asia Hospital, Palam Vihar, Gurgaon said, "Steroids are effective in Covid patients who have moderate to severe disease, there is no other way to treat them. However, if steroids are used too early in the disease, it can be counterproductive. Identifying the right time to administer steroids is important and blaming steroids for black fungus can affect treatment of this category of patients."Another myth that has been doing rounds is that a person can get infected by black fungus by eating raw food. But there is no data available so far to support this claim.Earlier this infection was spotted in patients with uncontrolled diabetes and in immune-compromised patients only. But during this pandemic, patients in the third week of illness, when they are recovering, are found to be affected with black fungus.Hence, it becomes extremely important to circulate the right information about the infection so that all the necessary precautions can be taken with the right kind of treatment at the right time.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/experts-talk-about-myths-misconceptions-around-black-fungus-101622108490311.html

The Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Union Home Minister Amit Shah should listen to the outcry of the local people and send in a new Administrator. The Central government should recall this administrator. This is the demand of the people.""We do not want to give the issue any communal colour. We are fighting for our people. Patel is trying to implement only anti-people laws and regulations," he added.The MP further said that all the drafts are under the consideration of the Union Home Ministry now. "Our request to the Ministry is that all these draft notifications should be scrapped and this administrator should immediately be recalled and a permanent people-friendly administrator may be deputed to Lakshadweep. And for that, we will continue this protest and we hope that the Centre will cooperate with us."Explaining about the laws implemented by Patel, he said "When the administrator on his first visit to Lakshadweep unilaterally decided to cahge and relax the SOP which was envisaged for containing COVID spread. When the entire world was shook in the first wave of the infection, Lakshadweep was the only one place which was green zone for one long year. It was a combined effort of then administrator, elected representatives and the people of Lakshadweep. On his first visit, he unilaterally deciding to relax the SOP.""We requested him to restore the quarantine system. He didn't listened to that. I have protested in front of the people. But the voice of the people went unheard," he added.Faizal said that Panchayat rules and regulations are being changed according to his whims and fancies. "I am a member to the district panchayat, after this draft formulation, my membership is seized.

27-05-2021||India||'Health is a state subject': Centre defends vaccine strategy in 7 points||Defending the Centre's vaccination policy, which has entered the third phase now, Niti Aayog (health) member VK Paul on Thursday issued a statement busting seven myths regarding India's vaccination. In his statement, he also addressed issues like why many more companies are not given licences to produce vaccines, why states are not getting responses from global tenders etc.Myth 1: Central government is not doing enough to procure vaccines from abroadThe Union government sought to counter this myth by stating the Indian government has been engaging in discussions and deliberations with International vaccine manufacturers like Pfizer, Moderna, and Johnson & Johnson. The government even offered assistance for the domestic production of their vaccines. However, vaccines being in “limited supply globally” has hampered their efforts.“Vaccines are in limited supply globally, and companies have their own priorities, game-plans and compulsions in allocating finite stocks. They also give preference to countries of their origin just as our own vaccine makers have done unhesitatingly for us,” the press release stated.Myth 2: Centre has not approved vaccines being administered globallyThe press release stated that all Covid-19 vaccines which have been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration, European Medicines Agency, UK’s Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency, Japan’s Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency, and included by World Health Organization in its Emergency Use Listing will not be required to undergo prior bridging trial and trials for “well-established” vaccines have been waived altogether.“No application of any foreign manufacturer for approval is pending with the drugs controller,” the release stated.Myth 3: Center is not doing enough to ramp up domestic production of vaccinesDescribing its role as that of an “effective facilitator”, the government stated that the only Indian vaccine with the Intellectual Property Right, Covaxin, will be manufactured by three other producers, and Covaxin is also ramping up its production facility, and is working on an intranasal vaccine. Covishield production is being ramped up to 11 crore doses per month and foreign vaccine Sputnik is slated to be manufactured by six companies under the coordination of Dr Reddy’s.Myth 4: Centre should invoke compulsory licensingCompulsory licensing allows manufacturers to produce patented goods with the permission of the patent holder. Countering that, Dr Paul said, "Think about this: Moderna had said in October 2020 that it will not sue any company which makes its vaccines, but still not one company has done it, which shows licensing is the least of the issues. If vaccine-making was so easy, why would even the developed world be so short of vaccine doses?"Myth 5: Centre has abdicated its responsibility to the statesStates are aware of how the centre is doing all the "heavy-lifting" as far as vaccination is concerned. From January to April, the government ran the entire vaccination programme and it was well-administered, "compared to the situation in May", the statement said. "Health is a state subject and the liberalised vaccine policy was a result of the incessant requests being made by the states to give states more power. The fact that global tenders have not given any results only reaffirms what we have been telling the states from day one: that vaccines are in short supply in the world and it is not easy to procure them at short notice," it said.Myth 6: Centre is not giving enough vaccines to the statesTo counter calls by states across the country on lack of supply of vaccines, the Central government said it is “allotting enough vaccines to the states in a transparent manner as per agreed guidelines”. Cautioning certain leaders, who appear on TV to “create panic” among people, “in spite of full knowledge of the facts on vaccine supply”, Dr Paul said this is not the time to play politics.Myth 7: Centre is not taking any step towards vaccinating childrenA decision on vaccinating children should not be taken on the basis of "WhatsApp group" panic, the statement said. Such decisions will be taken by scientists on the basis of trials, it said. “As of now, no country in the world is giving vaccines to children. Also, WHO has no recommendation on vaccinating children,” the statement said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/health-is-a-state-subject-centre-defends-vaccine-strategy-in-7-points-101622105429701.html

He served as finance secretary in Odisha in the late Seventies and early Eighties before moving to Delhi where he served in various ministries before serving as the civil aviation secretary between 1992 and 1994. During his tenure in the aviation ministry, he was working on the merger of Indian Airlines and Air India, but it could not be carried out due to lack of political backing.After retirement, he served as the chairman of Odisha Public Service Commission. In 2001, he was asked to comprehensively review the reforms carried out in Odisha, the first state to privatise power distribution, and brought out a 100-page report which revealed the rot in the power sector. The six-member committee headed by Kanungo found that nothing was achieved despite spending billions of rupees over 5 years. The report, which created a huge stir, revealed how transmission and distribution losses continued to be the same as during the pre-reforms period in the power sector, collection efficiency went down and loan burden increased fourfold from ₹820 crore to ₹3300 crore.In 2014, he authored a book “A Bureaucrat Speaks” in which he wrote about how political opportunism, nepotism and corruption eroded the whole governance, making people despondent and cynical. The book detailed his experiences about dealing with the political elites including former Prime Minister Dr Manmohan Singh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/former-civil-aviation-secretary-falls-to-covid-19-in-bubhaneswar-hospital-101622105717455.html

He also claimed that the "administration demolished structures used by the fisherfolk, fired contractual workers in various government departments".Calling the latest reforms "draconian", Gandhi said the latest "regulations penalise dissent and undermine grassroots democracy"."The people of Lakshadweep deserve a developmental vision that respects their way of life and reflects their aspirations," he also said.Since taking over as Lakshadweep’s administrator last year, Praful Patel has been making tweaks in the local administration in Lakshadweep, sparking a countrywide outcry. The new reforms include implementing the anti-social Activities Regulation bill, 2021, or the goonda act in the island territory where the crime rate is already very low.The government also took over the control of the local administrative powers of the elected Zilla panchayat regarding-- education, health care, agriculture, animal husbandry and fisheries.The new proposal will also bring changes in panchayat regulations and will make any person with more than two children ineligible to contest panchayat elections. He also gave a nod to open liquor bars in the island, a non-alcoholic zone due to its Muslim population, to promote tourism; a beef ban and eliminating non-vegetarian food from the menu of Anganwadi children.Locals are protesting against the laws saying they are anti-people and are going against the culture of the land.However, the Centre has dubbed the criticism as a result of Patel's efforts to end "corrupt practices" involving local politicians prevalent and usher in development there.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/draconian-regulations-undermine-grassroot-democracy-rahul-gandhi-seeks-centre-s-intervention-in-lakshadweep-101622104720051.html

Police and fire service personnel rescued eight families from the area and took them to a cyclone shelter, they said.National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) and Odisha Disaster Rapid Action Force (ODRAF) personnel have been kept ready for rescue operations.The port town of Paradip, state capital Bhubaneswar and the seaside pilgrim town of Puri have largely remained unaffected by cyclone Yaas.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/naveen-patnaik-undertakes-aerial-survey-of-cyclone-hit-areas-in-odisha-101622103926677.html
27-05-2021||India||Black fungus, white fungus, yellow fungus: What we know about post-Covid infections||Delhi's Ganga Ram Hospital has reported a rare kind of white fungus on Thursday in which the infection has spread throughout the intestine. The development comes as black fungus cases in India are on the rise and reports of yellow fungus white fungus are spreading panic among people. Though not much is known about white and yellow fungus, experts have said the colour depends on the growth of the fungus and it is better to not identify them with colour. Labelling the same fungus with the names of different colours can create confusion, AIIMS director Randeep Guleria has recently said. "There are various types of fungal infections such as candida, aspergillosis, cryptococcus, histoplasmosis and coccidioidomycosis. Mucormycosis, candida and aspergillosis are the ones observed more in those with low immunity," he said.Black fungusIndia at present has over 10,000 black fungus cases approximately, as the threat of mucormycosis emerged as a greater one amid the ongoing second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic. Unchecked level of blood sugar, abuse of steroids during Covid treatment are being considered as the reasons for this outbreak. The government has ramped up the production and import of its drug and most states have notified this disease as an epidemic.White fungusOn Thursday, Delhi's Ganga Ram Hospital reported the first-of-its-kind white fungus where multiple perforations were found throughout the intestine. White fungus infection causing such damage has not been seen earlier, doctors said.So far, the white fungus was considered to be a common infection, curable by commonly available medicines. Dr Kavita Sachdeva, head of the ENT department of Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose Medical College hospital in Jabalpur, which recently reported cases of white fungus, said the hospital gets five white fungus cases every month. It is common in rural areas as it is carried by dust, hay or other such particles. Known as Aspergillus Flavus infection in medical parlance, it is not a new disease, nor is it as fatal as mucormycosis, she said, as quoted by PTI.Yellow fungusDr BP Tyagi, an ENT (Ear-Nose-Throat) specialist of Ghaziabad, told ANI yellow fungus is fatal as it starts internally and it is not easy to note its symptoms.According to an ANI report, Ghaziabad has reported a case of black, white and yellow fungus infections all at the same time in a 45-year-old patient.On yellow fungus, Dr Samiran Panda, the head of Epidemiology and Communicable Diseases at the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), said the specimen needs to be studied as the yellow fungus is seen in reptiles.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/black-fungus-white-fungus-yellow-fungus-what-we-know-about-post-covid-infections-101622102847311.html
27-05-2021||India||'Something fishy': Lawyer says Mehul Choksi may not have reached Dominica voluntarily||Mehul Choksi's lawyer Vijay Aggarwal on Thursday questioned the legality of Choksi's possible repatriation straight to India after Antigun Prime Minister Gaston Browne said that his country won't accept the fugitive businessman and he will be sent to India straight. The lawyer also doubted what is being seen as Choksi's bid to flee Antigua and said there should be no speculations about how he landed in Dominica. "My understanding is that his reaching Dominica is not voluntary. So, I find something fishy that nobody seems to be at the moment looking into the fact that how exactly he reached Dominica," he said.After being missing for days, Choksi was apprehended in Dominica. Arrangements were initially being made to hand him over to Antigua police, but PM Browne said he should be extradited to India as he enjoys rights and protection as a citizen of Antigua.Citing Section 9 of the Indian Citizenship Act, advocate Aggarwal said, Choksi can only be deported to Antigua where he has legal citizenship. "The moment Mehul Choksi acquired the citizenship of Antigua he ceased to be a citizen of India. Hence legally as per the Immigration and Passport Act, Section 17 and 23, he can be deported only to Antigua," Aggarwal said in a statement on Thursday.Also Read | 'No reliable info that Mehul Choksi has fled': Antigua PMAggarwal further asserted that Choksi can't be repatriated to India as there is an Antiguan High Court order restraining processing any request from India. "It has to be done legally and it is not a game of chess. We are dealing with a human being and nor a pawn that shall be placed here or there and it cannot be on somebody’s desires and whims," Aggarwal also said.He also said that as per the universal declaration of human rights, there are "international covenants on voluntary repatriation and a person can be deported to only the country to his citizenship".Choksi is wanted in India in connection with ₹14,000 crore Punjab National Bank (PNB) loan fraud and money-laundering case. He fled to the Caribbean island nation of Antigua and Barbuda in 2018 after the Indian police launched an investigation against the diamantaire.He is accused of siphoning off close to ₹7,080 crore in the ₹13,578 crore PNB fraud. Choksi was also allegedly involved in the stock market manipulation in 2013.He went missing on Sunday evening after he left his home for dinner.After Choksi was captured in Dominica, Browne said "he may have entered the island illegally, possibly by boats"."The Dominican government is cooperating with the Antiguan and Indian governments. We have requested Dominican law enforcement agencies to not return him to Antigua where he has legal and constitutional rights as a citizen. We specifically requested them to have Indian law enforcement agencies make necessary arrangements to have him returned directly to India," ANI quoted Browne as saying.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/something-fishy-lawyer-says-mehul-choksi-may-not-have-reached-dominica-voluntarily-101622100801084.html

27-05-2021||India||Challenges ahead for new CBI director Subodh Kumar Jaiswal||Subodh Kumar Jaiswal, who took over as the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI)’s 33rd director on Wednesday, has his work cut out. He is expected to take forward his predecessor Rishi Kumar Shukla’s attempt to restore the federal agency’s credibility. The agency faced its worst credibility crisis in 2018-19 following a rift between then CBI director Alok Kumar Verma and his deputy, special director Rakesh Asthana, when almost all of its decisions and even a routine transfer came under the scrutiny of media and the courts.The agency has also lately faced criticism in cases such as the Narada string operation that are perceived to be political in nature. The CBI arrested West Bengal ministers Firhad Hakim, Subrata Mukherjee, ruling Trinamool Congress (TMC) lawmaker Madan Mitra, and former mayor Sovan Chatterjee last week over bribery charges in the Narda case five years after videos of the sting purportedly showed them taking money in exchange for favours to a fictitious company.West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee has accused the agency of making the arrests on the Centre’s directions. She staged a sit-in at the CBI’s office in Kolkata in protest against the arrests while hundreds of TMC supporters protested outside.Watch | How CBI chief Subodh Jaiswal is linked with Scam 1992 sequel on Abdul Telgi﻿﻿The agency has been at loggerheads with the West Bengal government also over its action in cases including Saradha, Rose Valley chit fund scheme, and the probe into an illegal coal mining case in the state. Family members of Mamata Banerjee’s nephew, Abhishek Banerjee, have been questioned in the coal case.The Shiv Sena-led Maharashtra government has criticised the CBI for registering a case against former state home minister Anil Deshmukh over alleged extortion and for influencing transfers in the state. The ruling Maha Vikas Aghadi coalition in the state has called the CBI probe against Deshmukh “illegal” and “an attempt to defame” him.Jaiswal reported to Deshmukh when he was the Maharashtra police chief until December last year. He will now be overall in charge of the probe against Deshmukh.There has not also been much progress in the CBI’s probe into actor Sushant Singh Rajput’s death in June last year after the case was transferred to the agency when Jaiswal was the Maharashtra police chief. The Mumbai police had concluded that Rajput died by suicide. The Maharashtra government has repeatedly questioned the lack of progress in the case. It has maintained the Centre transferred the case to the CBI in view of elections in Rajput’s native Bihar last year.Jaiswal, who is seen as an upright officer who does not interfere much in investigations, takes over when eight non-Bharatiya Janata Party-ruled Punjab, Kerala, Maharashtra, Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh, West Bengal, Rajasthan and Mizoram have blocked the CBI from conducting probes in these states without prior permission.There has also been an environment of mistrust between Indian Police Service (IPS) officers and the cadre officers within the agency. People aware of the matter said the cadre officers feel that the IPS officers “do not work for them and treat CBI as a platform for influence in Delhi”. The cadre officers complain that their career progression has been slow in the agency as they do not get to head the agency’s key branches or units. IPS officers, who lead most investigation units and branches, feel that cadre officers do not want to leave their comfort zones. Jaiswal is said to be strict when it comes to transfers and promotion rules.Jaiswal was named as the CBI chief on Tuesday after a Prime Minister Narendra Modi-led panel cleared his name on Monday evening. Names of the other two contenders for the top CBI post--Rakesh Asthana and YC Modi--were dropped after Chief Justice of India N V Ramana, a member of the panel, cited a March 2019 ruling of the top court that officers with at least six months left in retirement should only be considered.Former CBI joint director NR Wassan said the agency has its own procedures and intricacies, which take time for somebody coming from outside to understand. “But being an outsider has its advantages as well as disadvantages. While a person with zero experience in CBI would not have any preconceived notions about any case, he will take time to understand the procedures, intricacies, and human resources of the agency.”Wassan said Jaiswal comes with a good reputation, but a lot will depend on whether he is a good learner and works with an open mind. “Also, if he is supported by a good team of deputies, he should be able to manage.” Wassan added one of the key challenges for Jaiswal will be how to stop corruption within the CBI. “Most of the officers down below have become corrupt. Identify them and set processes to make sure that this does not happen in future.”Shukla tried to bridge some gaps in the agency by ordering mass transfers of officers, who had spent more than prescribed time in a particular unit or branch. He allowed personnel to approach him in case of any grievance.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/challenges-ahead-for-new-cbi-director-subodh-kumar-jaiswal-101622100677308.html
27-05-2021||India||Lakshadweep: All-party meeting today to discuss plan of action||An all-party meeting is scheduled today in Lakshadweep against the administrator’s decisions even as the collector of the islands has called a press conference in Kochi later in the day to explain the position of the administration in the stand-off. An archipelago in the Arabian Sea, Lakshadweep has been in the news since local people protested against some changes brought in by the acting administrator, Praful Khoda Patel, which they allege will destroy the unique culture of the Union Territory. They allege that these sweeping changes, which were introduced in the name of tourism development, will destroy the character of the island where 97% of the land is covered by forests and 95% of the population is included in the scheduled tribe category. “We will discuss all issues at the online meet. It seems the administrator is taking more retaliatory measures. All options are open. We are happy the whole country is aware of our burning issues now,” said Abdul Khadar, panchayat president of Kavaratti which is the capital of the UT. Also Read | Lakshadweep: Tackle the brewing discontentRecently, many Congress and CPI(M) MPs wrote to the President, expressing their anger over what they called unilateral decisions of the administrator, and sought his recall. They alleged that the administrator decided to introduce norms for private property development, anti-goonda rules that gave police powers to detain anyone, removed beef from the mid-day meal, allowed cutting of trees for road expansion projects and introduced a two-child norm for contesting in local body elections without any consultation with people. They said Patel was trying to “saffronise the island” where almost 95% population is Muslim. The erstwhile ruler of the island, the Arakkal royal family in Kannur, has also expressed concern over the developments and said the local people should be taken into confidence before taking any decision. The royals had given up their right to island in 1905 to the British for an annual pension of ₹23,000. “Island people are most peace-loving ones. Let people live peacefully and let their wishes prevail,” said Ashraf Adhiraja of the royal family.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/lakshadweepallparty-meeting-today-to-discuss-plan-of-action-101622099777169.html
27-05-2021||India||New rules to prevent abuse and misuse of social media: Ravi Shankar Prasad||Union electronics and information technology minister Ravi Shankar Prasad on Thursday maintained the government “fully recognises and respects the right of privacy” and said the new rules for intermediaries were designed to empower citizens and prevent the “abuse and misuse” of social media.“The new Rules require the social media companies to set up an India-based grievance redressal officer, compliance officer and nodal officer so that millions of users of social media who have a grievance get a forum for its redressal,” Prasad posted on Koo, the Indian alternative to Twitter.The comments came two days after WhatsApp cited “dangerous invasion of privacy” and threats to free speech of its 400 million users in India and moved the Delhi high court against the rule that mandates social media intermediaries to identify the first originator of a message on the orders of a court or executive authority.Prasad said ordinary users of WhatsApp have nothing to fear about the new rules. “Its entire objective is to find out who started the message that led to commissioning of specific crimes mentioned in the Rules,” he said.Also Read | Google respects legislative processes but pushes back when needed: Sundar PichaiHe clarified the “obligation to reveal” the first originator of an offensive message already in circulation “relates only to offences relating to sovereignty, integrity & security of India, public order, rape, child sexual abuse”. “That too when other less intrusive measures are not effective,” he said.The government on Wednesday wrote to social media companies such as Facebook and Twitter to send details of their compliance officers, nodal contact persons, resident grievance officers and physical contact addresses in India. It asked them to confirm if they have complied with the new Information Technology Act guidelines after the deadline to do so ended on Tuesday.The controversial guidelines seek the companies to put in place a new mechanism to regulate content, appoint officers, who will be liable for compliance, and adopt features such as traceability of messages and voluntary user verification.Most of the prominent companies, including Facebook, Twitter, WhatsApp, and Google, are yet to comply with the new rules.WhatsApp has a resident grievance officer. It is yet to appoint a compliance officer. Twitter and Facebook have not appointed anyone yet.Facebook on Tuesday said it aims to comply with the new guidelines but indicated there were unresolved issues.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/new-rules-to-prevent-abuse-and-misuse-of-social-media-rs-prasad-101622099418946.html

"That too when other less intrusive measures are not effective," he added.WhatsApp, which has nearly 400 million users in India, asked the Delhi High Court on Tuesday to declare that one of the new social media rules is a violation of privacy rights in India's constitution.The new rules require social media companies to set up an India-based grievance redressal officer, compliance officer and a nodal officer. This is made mandatory so that the users who have grievances can get a forum for its redressal, the minister said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/amid-controversy-with-whatapp-rs-prasad-defends-digital-media-guidelines-on-koo-101622096538883.html
27-05-2021||India||Twitter 'concerned' for India employees, says dialogue with Govt will continue||Twitter on Thursday said it is concerned about the safety of its India staff as it indirectly described the recent visit of a team of Delhi Police's Special Cell at its New Delhi office as "use of intimidation tactics by the police".Reiterating its commitment to serve the people of India, the microblogging platform said it will continue its constructive dialogue with the Indian government. "It is the collective responsibility of elected officials, industry, and civil society to safeguard the interests of the public."The statement comes amid Twitter's long-drawn battle with the government which started around January-February this year. The tussle has been going on as the Centre has accused Twitter of dragging its feet in blocking content flagged by the Centre, while Twitter defended its action citing freedom of speech. This is also Twitter's first official response regarding the new IT rules which were announced on February 25 and the social media intermediaries operating in India were given three months' time to comply.Delhi police visit Twitter offices in city, Gurugram over ‘toolkit case’Adding to the ongoing disagreement between the government and the social media platform, Delhi Police on Monday visited the Twitter office to serve a notice to Twitter's India head for tagging a tweet of BJP spokesperson as "manipulated media".Combining both the issues, Twitter issued a statement in which it cleared that the new IT rules have elements that inhibit free conversation and, at present, Twitter has pressing issues like the “safety of its employees in India”.“To keep our service available, we will strive to comply with applicable law in India. But, just as we do around the world, we will continue to be strictly guided by principles of transparency, a commitment to empowering every voice on the service, and protecting freedom of expression and privacy under the rule of law,” it said.“Right now, we are concerned by recent events regarding our employees in India and the potential threat to freedom of expression for the people we serve. We, alongside many in civil society in India and around the world, have concerns with regards to the use of intimidation tactics by the police in response to enforcement of our global Terms of Service, as well as with core elements of the new IT Rules,” it added.It, however, plans to “advocate for changes to elements of these regulations that inhibit free, open public conversation” and for that, the ongoing constructive dialogue with the Centre will continue, it said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/twitter-concerned-for-india-employees-will-continue-dialogue-with-government-101622097433580.html

27-05-2021||India||Government’s helplines for us found wanting, say migrant workers||A 35-year-old migrant worker from Uttar Pradesh, who identified herself as Khatoon, worked at an automobile factory in Gurugram and earned ₹10,000 monthly until she lost her job when the lockdown to check the second Covid-19 wave was imposed in April. Khatoon said she was paid just half of her salary for the last month of her work and even found it difficult to feed her children. An NGO helped her with some immediate ration and asked her to call Haryana’s assistant labour commissioner Jaideep Yadav to seek help to get her salary. Yadav’s number is listed among those of 100 central labour commissioners tasked to address migrant distress in 20 states.Khatoon said when she called up Yadav for help, instead of listening to her, he started questioning her how she managed to get his number. She added after repeated requests for help, Yadav asked her to WhatsApp him the details. Khatoon, a single mother, does not have a smartphone, and gave up and never called back Yadav, who was unavailable for comments. Many migrant workers across India said they were not even aware of such helplines.Anindita Adhikari of the Stranded Workers Action Network (Swan), a volunteer group working for migrant workers, said they contacted 80 labour commissioners in 20 states and found none of these helplines was able to offer any basic support. “These are just an eyewash,’ Adhikari said.Swan, which said it has been supporting around 45,000 workers by providing them ration and financial assistance, said that when they called on these helplines, the responses varied. Most of the officials answered the calls but many were not even aware that their numbers were listed as helplines for workers. A commissioner wondered how Swan got him number while another refused to take calls again.Also Read | India’s daily Covid-19 infection count goes up to 211,298, death toll at 315,235Prakash Kumar Mishra, a migrant worker from Bihar, said the tile manufacturing firm in Bengaluru he worked for was closed when the lockdown was imposed, and the owner left the city without paying them their salaries. “It was after we threatened that we will lodge a complaint with the labour commission that we got our salaries,” said Mishra. He said he called on a helpline number for ration help but was told there was no such provision. When Mishra told the officer in charge his family was starving, he was told to look for free food being distributed.The government has said it helped tens of thousands of workers via these helplines last year and that this year the workers can call on them for support related to ration, non-payment of wages, basic financial assistance, protection from eviction by landlords and travel support.Most officials in charge of these helplines told Swan they cannot do much for private-sector workers even as Union labour secretary Apurva Chandra has said the designated officials would be available for any kind of help.Many officials have been asking for complaints to be submitted in writing even as most workers are unlettered. According to Swan, some have even asked for complaints via emails.A labour ministry spokesman said help was being provided but did not have the details about the number of requests resolved so far. He added the data will be provided later.Adhikari filed an application under the Right to Information Act on May 8 seeking details of state-wise requests received and resolved by these helplines. There has been no response from the labour ministry yet. Swan on May 7 wrote a letter to the central labour commissioner DPS Negi and seven state labour commissioners highlighting specific cases for help. “Neither did the Centre nor did any other state give any response,” Adhikari said.Negi said they have been holding weekly meetings to monitor the redressal of the complaints even as the number of people calling on helplines is very few as compared to last year. The government last year said over 20,00,00 workers were helped last year via these helplines. Negi said that not more than 4,500 complaints have been resolved this year.Also Read | Here’s why you shouldn’t post your Covid vaccination certificate on social media“The complaints mostly have been about unpaid wages and the reason for such a smaller number of redressals is that there has been no mass migration like last year. Employers generally withhold wages when workers leave their places of work. This was not the case this year,” Negi said. He added that the labour ministry has directed all the industries to convince their workers to stay in states where they work and pay them wages as well. “Since there is no national lockdown and the state lockdowns as well have exempted the construction activities, where most these migrant workers are employed, this has caused a decrease in migration.”Negi said if anyone wants to travel back home, there are special trains. “In our review meetings, we have senior officials from the railway ministry as well who have been ensuring all the help to those workers who want to get back home.” Negi said the state governments were responsible for providing ration to workers. He added the control rooms were not empowered to direct ration support nor income support. “India is a federal country and most of these powers lie with the states. Whatever complaints we get out of our domain, we forward them to states.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/governments-helplines-for-us-found-wanting-say-migrant-workers-101622096837497.html

DCP south Atul Thakur said Gaurav has been arrested on charges of cruelty to the animal as he risked his pet's life by making the video. The video has already been deleted from YouTube and the YouTuber issued another video apologising for the earlier video.A case was registered against Gaurav in Malviya Nagar police station after People for Animal raised an issue with the cruelty showed in the video.The video in question was shot on May 21 and was released on YouTube under the title 'Flying Dollar with helium gas balloon'. In the video, which starts with a shot taken on a car, Dollar can be seen flying, while Gaurav says, "Let's make Dollar fly". A woman was also there in the video."Please don't take it wrong. When we will fly Dollar, we will take all safety precautions," Gaurav said in the now-deleted video. The video shows how the YouTuber got ready with drones and a few other equipment and then drove to a shop first to buy ballons.

Seawater also entered Shankarpur village in the district forcing people to leave their homes and seek shelter elsewhere.A resident of Shankarpur, Putul who had to move to a relative's house after the cyclone washed away his home, said he was surprised to see the level of the water as it rose to the "severe" level. "I am shocked to see this kind of effect. Earlier also there had been cyclones but not severe like this. We were stuck in the houses due to the flood and managed to escape but our documents got washed away. We are going to take shelter in our relative's house. We lost belongings too," news agency ANI quoted him as saying.Another resident of a village, Taps Bera said, it will take more than a year to return to normal life, as per ANI report. "I am taking my family and shifting to other villages. It will take more than a year for normal life to return," he said.Apart from Midnapore and Shankarpur, the cyclone also impacted Bankura, South 24 Pargana and Jhargram districts in West Bengal. Around 1,100 villages had been flooded by storm surges, leaving at least 50,000 homeless, news agency Reuters reported citing authorities.Packing gusts of up to 140 kph (87 mph), cyclone Yaas made landfall on Wednesday.

Choksi, who has sought refuge in Antigua after allegedly cheating Punjab National Bank of ₹13,578 crore along with his nephew Nirav Modi, and fleeing India in 2018, left his home on Sunday to go for dinner at a well-known restaurant in the southern part of the island and was never seen again. He was located in Dominica, another Caribbean island country 101 nautical miles from Antigua. He is currently in the custody of Criminal Investigation Department of Dominica, with whom Indian officials are coordinating, people familiar with the development said. Gaston Browne has said that he has requested Dominica PM Roosevelt Skerrit and the law enforcement agencies there not to return Choksi to Antigua, where he has legal and constitution protection as a citizen. “We have requested that he be detained and to make arrangements with Dominican government to have him returned to India,” Browne told ANI, while adding that “Choksi may not enjoy the same protection in Dominica”. He added that Choksi made a monumental error by skipping Antigua. A senior official in India said, “We are in touch with authorities in Dominica to get him repatriated to India. He is not a citizen there so he can be deported quickly.” The police in Dominica apprehended him in the northern territory of the island on the basis of a yellow notice issued by Antigua after he went missing. Also Read | UK judge’s order brings Indian banks closer to recovering debts from MallyaChoksi’s lawyer, Vijay Aggarwal, had said on Wednesday evening, “I have spoken to family, family is happy and relieved that finally whereabouts of Mehul Choksi are known. And efforts are being made to speak to him so that one can know the clearer picture that how he was taken to Dominica.” On Tuesday, the Antiguan Prime Minister had said that if Choksi had fled the country, he would have done so using a boat. The Antiguan government has said on several occasions that it is ready to extradite Choksi to India for which the process is already going on. His extradition case, as well as revocation of citizenship by Antigua, is currently being pursued in a court there, which he has challenged. If Dominica agrees to repatriate Choksi directly to India, it will happen on the basis of Interpol red notice because India doesn’t have any formal arrangement with Dominica to extradite persons, according to people familiar with the process. India has cordial relations with Commonwealth of Dominica, which has population of over 72,000. As part of Vaccine Maitri, India donated 35,000 doses to Dominica in February this year. India exports mainly pharmaceutical products, readymade garments, textiles and home furnishings, and food products to Dominica, while the latter exports mainly scrap metals. Bilateral trade between India and Dominica during 2017-18 amounted to US$2.38 million. The Indian government also provided financial support of US$ 1 lakh as immediate relief and granted US$ 1 million for infrastructure re-construction in Dominica under the India UNDP Fund in the aftermath of Hurricane Maria in 2017.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/repatriate-mehul-choksi-to-india-antigua-tells-dominica-101622088736819.html

He is now with the Hoover Institution, an arm of Stanford University.“I think people do worry of what would happen if things go badly,” Jaishankar added from New York, citing conversations he has had with counterparts around the world, especially in Europe, about the future of Afghanistan post US withdrawal, without settling the key issue of who will be in charge. He left shortly for Washington DC for the second leg of his five-day visit to the United States.President Joe Biden has announced that all US troops will be out of Afghanistan by September 11, the 20th anniversary of the terrorist attacks that led to the US-led invasion of Afghanistan in search of the perpetrators, al Qaeda leaders and operatives sheltering there under the protection of the Taliban regime.Also Read | Biden asks US intel officials to investigate Covid-19 origin amid Wuhan lab rowIndia has a place at the table in America’s post-pullout plan, as detailed in the leaked letter from Secretary of State Antony Blinken to President Ashraf Ghani. But New Delhi, irrespective of the party in power, has long advocated some US military presence in Afghanistan, no matter how small, for a scarecrow deterrent impact on terrorism in not only Afghanistan but all of South Asia, especially in Pakistan.Biden’s Afghanistan policy, which is a continuation of President Donald Trump’s policy moored in ending “endless wars”, is the only major issue muddying bilateral relations at this time. It was trade and related issues — such as the termination of special tariff concessions for Indian imports under a US programme called Generalized System of Preferences — during the Trump administration and trade and climate change under President Barack Obama.Defying Trump-supporting Indian skeptics and hawks, Biden has accorded top billing to the relationship with India: Prime Minister Narendra Modi was among the first world leaders he called after moving into the White House; hosted the first summit of the leaders of the Quad, which includes India; dispatched one of his senior Cabinet members Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin to New Delhi as part of first foreign visits by his top officials; invited Modi to a climate summit; backed a proposal by India and South Africa to temporarily waive patent protections for Covid-19 vaccines; and sent $100 million worth of oxygen supplies, PPEs and therapeutics to help India deal with a deadly second wave of Covid-19 cases.And now, Biden is expected to name a close political ally as ambassador to India, Eric Garcetti, currently mayor of Los Angeles.Jaishankar arrived in Washington DC Wednesday with an itinerary packed with meetings over the next two days. He is scheduled to meet Secretary of State Blinken, Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin, US Trade Representative Katherine Tai — all Cabinet members — and National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan. And possibly — chances are remote to none — President Biden.The minister is also meeting members of top business bodies US-India Business Council (an arm of the US chamber of commerce, one of the most powerful lobbying groups) and the US-India Strategic Partnership Forum, which is backed by most major US investors in India and the Modi government.Jaishankar will meet some lawmakers as well, but not as many as Indians would have wanted to, at a dinner hosted by Indian ambassador to the United States, Taranjit Singh Sandhu. “l look forward to meeting with India’s External Affairs Minister @DrSJaishankar, Ambassador @SandhuTaranjitS, and other leaders concerned with the US-India relationship, for dinner this evening,” said Congressman Brad Sherman in a tweet.

US health regulator rolled out the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine for children between the ages of 12-15 on May 14, Canada had approved their shot for children on May 5. The European Medicines Agency is also evaluating its use in children.The initial advisory had suggested that Pfizer vaccines should be stored at a temperature of minus 70 degree celsius, which was considered to be almost impossible for tropical countries with underfunded cold storage infrastructure, but the company has since revised the advisory and the vaccines can now be stored at minus 25 degrees and even at 2-8 degrees for a month.PTI had reported on May 26 that Pfizer is willing to export five crore vaccine doses over the course of four months, starting with one crore vaccine doses in July, one in August, two crore in September and finally another one crore in October. However, the manufacturer has agreed to hold talks with the Government of India and accept payments directly from them. Earlier, both Pfizer and Moderna had refused to sell vaccines directly to states.Pfizer also took up discussions on indemnity and liability protection against any claims that might arise from the use of their vaccine. Sources told ANI that the pharma giant asked for relaxation in some clauses before it supplies vaccines to India. Pfizer seeks indemnity and liability protections in all of their agreements consistent with applicable local laws and has one with 116 countries in the world. Indemnification clauses are often included in contracts with governments for the supply of necessary vaccines during any public health emergency.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pfizer-holds-talks-with-centre-on-covid-19-vaccine-s-suitability-for-children-101622085073444.html

Browne said he has requested PM Skerrit and law enforcement in Dominica to not return Choksi to Antigua where he has legal and constitutional protection as a citizen, the news agency reported.The prime minister also said that Choksi made a "monumental error" by fleeing the island. His family members staying in Antigua are legal citizens and they are not known to be "let's say criminals", the prime minister said."He (Choksi) was found in Dominica. He may have entered the island illegally, possibly by boats. The Dominican government is cooperating with the Antiguan and Indian governments. We have requested Dominican law enforcement agencies to not return him to Antigua where he has legal and constitutional rights as a citizen. We specifically requested them to have Indian law enforcement agencies make necessary arrangements to have him returned directly to India," Browne told ANI.Watch | ‘Dominica agreed for Mehul Choksi's repatriation to India’: Antigua PMThe Indian and Antiguan authorities are in touch with the Dominican government, he said.According to reports, Mehul Choksi, wanted in India in connection with a ₹13,500-crore loan fraud in Punjab National Bank, went missing on Sunday. He was last seen on Sunday evening at 5.15pm leaving the home in a car.

The cyclonic storm 'Yaas' weakened into a deep depression and lay centred at 2330 hours IST of the 26th May over south Jharkhand and adjoining north interior Odisha. Likely to move northwestwards and weaken gradually into a depression during next 12 hours," IMD posted on Twitter on the early morning of Thursday.Click here for live updates on Cyclone YaasJharkhand was put on high alert and a complete lockdown was imposed in some parts of the state to prevent people from venturing out as the authorities evacuated those staying in low-lying areas and shifted them to storm centres ahead of the Cyclone's expected arrival in the state. As many as 10,000 people were moved to safer zones, officials told news agency PTI on Wednesday. "Operations are being executed on a war-footing in vulnerable areas in East and West Singhbhum, besides some other districts which are expected to be hit by the cyclonic storm Yaas," disaster management secretary Amitabh Kaushal said."We are witnessing heavy rainfall and there has been damage to the power transmission network besides trees have been uprooted," East Singhbhum Deputy Commissioner Suraj Kumar said. At least four people were killed due to the storm and it left behind a trail of destruction with damaged homes and flooded farmland in West Bengal and Odisha. In view of the storm, more than 21 lakh people had to be evacuated from danger zones in Odisha, West Bengal and Jharkhand.

27-05-2021||India||WhatsApp users in India won't be affected, says Centre amid legal battle over privacy||The Centre on Wednesday clarified that the normal functioning of Whatsapp will not be impacted because of the measures the information technology ministry proposes to take if the platform does not comply with the new rules where the Centre wants the first originator of a message to be identified if required. The ministry specifically mentioned WhatsApp as it moved the Delhi high court and challenged the Centre's new rules, stating that this violates the right to privacy and the company's end-to-end encryption policy. The government said this last-minute challenge was clear defiance.Here is what the government said:Tracing the first originator is only the last stepThe ministry clarified that the clause with which WhatsApp raised a problem is not the first step. When all other remedies will prove to be ineffective, then only this route will be taken following a law-sanctioned process.Why knowledge of the first originator is importantThe Centre has said that punishing one who started mischief leading to crimes like rape is in the public interest. "We cannot deny as to how in cases of mob lynching and riots etc. repeated WhatsApp messages are circulated and recirculated whose content are already in the public domain. Hence the role of who originated is very important," the government said.WhatsApp should find a solutionThe ministry on Wednesday said that the debate on whether encryption would be maintained or not is misplaced. WhatsApp should find a technical solution through encryption or otherwise so that privacy is maintained and necessary information to ensure public order and national security can also be obtained by the government.Services won't be impactedNone of the measures proposed by India will impact the normal functioning of WhatsApp in any manner whatsoever and for the common users, there will be no impact, the Centre said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/whatsapp-users-in-india-won-t-be-affected-says-centre-amid-legal-battle-over-privacy-101622080285242.html
27-05-2021||India||Jaishankar arrives in Washington DC, to meet defence secretary Lloyd Austin||External affairs minister S Jaishankar, who is currently on a visit to the United States, arrived in Washington DC on Wednesday for a series of meetings with key officials of the Biden administration including secretary of state Antony Blinken.During the three days stay in Washington DC, Jaishankar will also meet his American counterpart, defense secretary Lloyd Austin, and National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan, along with other key members of the Biden administration. According to a report by ANI, the discussion between the ministers will focus on the progress made in the bilateral relations in the first 100 days of the Joe Biden-led government. The discussions will also lay the groundwork for the rest of the term of US President Joe Biden.However, the timing for a meeting between Blinken and Jaishankar has not been announced as of yet, as the US State Secretary is travelling in the Middle East to continue with the peace process in the wake of the Israel-Palestine conflict. "The secretary is meeting with the external affairs minister, will continue discussions that the two held in New Delhi in March and will continue the robust bilateral defence and security relationship between our two countries. We are looking forward to having him here at the Pentagon and hosting him for a good set of talks," Pentagon press secretary John Kirby informed in a press conference.Jaishankar arrived in the US on May 24 and the visit will continue till May 28. This is the first visit by any senior Indian minister to the US since President Biden took over the office in January.Before arriving in Washington, the foreign minister was in New York, where he met senior United States officials and discussed Covid-related cooperation between the two countries.On May 26, Jaishankar also met United Nations' secretary-general, Antonio Guterres. During the meeting, Jaishankar stressed the need for finding “urgent and effective” global vaccine solutions and called for “greater production” and “fairer distribution.”Later in the day, Jaishankar also held a discussion with US National Security Advisor General (retd) HR McMaster. During the discussion, Jaishankar said that there is a real appreciation of the potential of the India-US relationship and what it can do.Emphasising that he has a "big agenda" for the US-India relationship going forward, Jaishankar said, "I think our relationship has come a long way. It's today one of the major relationships in the world and my own sense is that in Washington today, there is a real appreciation of the potential of this relationship, what it can do. And it's true of New Delhi as well".(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jaishankar-arrives-in-washington-to-meet-defence-secretary-lloyd-austin-101622079296481.html
27-05-2021||India||Death in Himalayas: Poverty, fear and stretched resources worsening Covid crisis||Pramila Devi's shrouded body lay on a bier, resting on a rock on the banks of a muddy Ganges.The 36-year-old mother-of-three died the previous night in a village in the mountainous northern state of Uttarakhand, a day after testing positive for Covid-19.Devi's death on Sunday is a sign of how poverty, fear and a lack of facilities are adding to Covid-19 fatalities in remote villages, where many shun tests for fear of testing positive and being forced to go to hospital far from home.India's Covid-19 caseload stands at 27.16 million, with 311,388 deaths, federal government data from May 26 show. But some experts estimate numbers are far higher, due in part to low testing rates in India's hinterlands where Covid-19 cases are spreading rapidly.Devi's eldest daughter got married and moved away in late April after the family hosted a ceremony attended by over two dozen people, her husband Suresh Kumar, 43, told Reuters.Two weeks after that Devi suffered a bout of diarrhoea. But it was not until 10 days later that Kumar, who has no income and depends on handouts, took her to a nearby dispensary that has been turned into a small Covid-19 facility with four beds.The dispensary is equipped with one oxygen cylinder and one concentrator, said Aishwary Anand, the only doctor there.Devi tested positive for Covid-19 with very low blood oxygen levels. Anand advised Kumar to take her to a bigger hospital, but costs were a deterrent.The couple returned home, where their two other children - a 16-year-old boy and 10-year-old girl - were waiting.The next day Devi's nephew carried her to a creaky taxi which returned her to the dispensary. Another patient was using the oxygen cylinder and the oxygen concentrator did not work due to a power outage."We need power," Anand pleaded with an electricity department employee over the phone, as he paced the dispensary wearing white protection gear.Eventually power was restored, Devi had access to the concentrator and felt well enough to return home. But feeling sick again, the family called an ambulance to take her back to the clinic, where she was pronounced dead on arrival."I'm yet to inform my eldest daughter of her mother's death," a distraught Kumar said, as he crouched on the banks of the Ganges.FEAR OF TESTINGThe state of Uttarakhand, which shares its border with China and Nepal, reported 45,568 Covid-19 cases and 6,020 fatalities as of May 25.Its city of Haridwar recently hosted the weeks-long Kumbh Mela gathering that saw hundreds of thousands of ash-smeared ascetics and devout Hindus jostling to take a dip in the Ganges, which is considered a holy river.Some experts fear that the event led to a surge in Covid-19 infections both in the crammed city and other parts of India as devotees returned home.On the eastern edge of Haridwar, Uttarakhand's Pauri Garhwal district - where Devi's family live - has reported 5,155 Covid-19 cases and 241 deaths. But locals and doctors say many in the district suffering Covid-like symptoms refuse to get tested or test too late."We've launched radio and newspaper campaigns to spread awareness about Covid and encourage testing," said Manoj Kumar Sharma, the district's top health official. "But despite our efforts there is some resistance in rural areas to getting tested."Reuters reporters hiked uphill with medics for over an hour to get to Pitha, a village in the district with no road access.There, Jai Prakash, 38, pleaded with his neighbours to get tested. Despite his appeals, a dozen of the village's nearly 60 inhabitants did so.Only nine of around 200 inhabitants in the nearby village of Tangroli - declared a Covid-19 containment zone with more than a dozen positive patients - showed up for testing the same day that a medical team camped outside their village."My neighbour did not want to get tested," said Deepak Singh, who works for a company in New Delhi but returned to his village this month. "He asked me if I was willing to take care of his household expenses if he tested positive."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/death-in-himalayas-how-poverty-fear-stretched-is-worsening-covid-crisis-101622077187697.html
27-05-2021||India||Kejriwal inaugurates Delhi’s 1st drive-through jabs centre||Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Wednesday inaugurated the city’s first drive-through Covid-19 vaccination centre, set up by Akash Healthcare Super Speciality Hospital in Vegas Mall in Dwarka’s Sector 14 for people aged between 18 and 45, and said more such centres would be set up in the city.The centre will administer Covishield doses.“More drive-through vaccination centres are going to come up in Delhi in the coming days. One of them will be at a government centre in Chhatrasal (stadium), which is likely to be ready by Saturday. At least one more private drive-through centre is also set to come up,” he said.He added, “We can keep opening more drive-through sites for the convenience of people. But the problem is with the shortage of vaccines.”The centre in Dwarka’s Sector 14 has two vaccine sites -- one drive-through and the other a regular site. Charges at the drive-through facility will be ₹1,400 per dose, and shots can be availed only through appointment that can be made on telephone by calling 8800015999. The working hours are 9am to 5pm. “The drive-through site will also reflect in the CoWin system in another day or so,” said Dr Aashish Chaudhry, managing director at Aakash Healthcare Super Speciality Hospital.“We have set up a dedicated lane for vehicles which queue up for the vaccine drive. There is also a dedicated area where those inoculated can park their cars, switch on the AC and wait for 30 minutes for monitoring any potential adverse effects. In case of an emergency, they have to honk twice or flash their headlights. We have staff for emergency response and instructions are written on the wall in the parking area,” he said.On Wednesday, the centre vaccinated 40 people. “In the coming days, we aim to scale up the capacity to 100-150 beneficiaries per day,” said Chaudhry.“The other vaccine site at the centre will also have on-the-spot registration facility. This site will charge ₹1,000 per dose,” said a spokesperson of the hospital.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kejriwal-inaugurates-delhi-s-1st-drive-through-jabs-centre-101622076340571.html
27-05-2021||India||Black fungus cases grow, but Amphotericin B in short supply||With over 620 patients being treated for mucormycosis in city hospitals, Delhi is facing a severe shortage of the only last-line drug for the lethal fungal infection.The city has received 3,850 vials of Amphotericin B till Tuesday, against a requirement of over 30,000 doses a week, said senior officials in Delhi’s health department.“Delhi received some 400 vials of the medicine yesterday (Tuesday) and another 400 the day before. For 620 patients, Delhi needs nearly 4,000 vials of the medicine a day. The shortage is delaying patients’ treatment,” said Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Wednesday.State health minister Satyendar Jain said: “On May 23, 200 cases of the infection were reported. Now, there are around 70 cases being reported each day. Delhi has been allocated very few doses of Amphotericin when compared with this number. Of the total patients with black fungus, nearly two-thirds are from Delhi and the rest are from outside the state.”Instances of mucormycosis, commonly known as black fungus, have shot up in the Capital as a complication among some Covid-19 patients, after a surge in Covid-19 cases between mid-April and early May. Over 100 patients with the fungal infection are currently being treated at AIIMS. The premier hospital used to receive only about 12 to 15 cases in a year before the pandemic, according to doctors.Officials said that a patient being treated for black fungus needs at least 50 vials of Amphotericin B every week.“Some need 100 vials as well. It depends on the severity of the infection... Due to the shortage, we are unable to issue all 50 vials [for a patient] in one go, so we give 10 to 20 vials at a time,” said an official at Delhi’s drug control department. The Delhi government has written to the Centre asking for 100,000 doses of the medicine over a two-month period, arguing that Delhi is likely to see around 1,000 cases of the fungal infection at its peak.The state has also set up an expert panel who approve hospitals’ requests for the medicine.“Earlier, patients had to go around the city looking for the medicine. Now, the government ensures that we get it. If someone needs the medicine urgently, we give it from another patient’s quota and replenish it later,” said Dr SCL Gupta, medical superintendent, Batra hospital.However, some patients said they are still running from pillar to post to get the medicine.The brother of a 35-year-old woman suffering from the infection said, “My sister has been given 10 doses of the medicines so far, but doctors said she will need another 50. I have probably been to every big medical store in the city, but I cannot find it.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/black-fungus-cases-grow-but-amphotericin-b-in-short-supply-101622075938258.html
27-05-2021||India||India-US relations one of the major ties in the world today: Jaishankar||India-US ties are one of the major relationships in the world and the challenge before New Delhi and Washington is how to translate their fundamental, societal and geopolitical convergences into actionable policies, External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar said on Wednesday.Emphasising that he has "big agenda" for the US-India relationship going forward, Jaishankar said, "I think our relationship has come a long way. It's today one of the major relationships in the world and my own sense is that in Washington today, there is a real appreciation of the potential of this relationship, what it can do. And it's true of New Delhi as well."During a virtual conversation with former US National Security Adviser General HR McMaster in ‘Battlegrounds’ session on 'India: Opportunities And Challenges For A Strategic Partnership’ presented by the Hoover Institution, Jaishankar said that keeping in mind issues such as impact of the Covid-19 pandemic, rise of different powers, "today we all recognize that it's not a question of one or two or three countries who will decide how the world.""The world is truly much more multipolar and if it is multipolar, then it's all the more important for countries to learn how to work with each other more effectively. And I see a big change in the American mindset in that regard,” Jaishankar said responding to a question on the trajectory of US-India relations."So the United States has not only an enormous ability to reinvent itself, it also has a great ability to assess its situation and re-strategise in a way."Noting that when it comes to the big issues of the day, "maybe because we are pluralistic societies, because we are political democracies, because we are market economies, that we have fundamental convergences."He said these convergences are societal and geopolitical. "I think the challenge before us is how to translate those convergences into actionable policies,” he said, adding that he certainly looks forward to working on these with the Biden administration.Jaishankar, who arrived in New York Sunday and met UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres, travelled to Washington Wednesday where he is expected to meet US Secretary of State Antony Blinken.A State Department spokesperson said Blinken and Jaishankar would discuss a wide range of issues, including Covid-19, efforts to strengthen Indo-Pacific cooperation through the Quad, enhanced UN and multilateral cooperation.In addition to meeting his counterpart, Jaishankar is scheduled to meet US National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan, other senior officials of the Biden Administration, influential lawmakers, think-tanks, leaders of the corporate sector and members of the Indian American community.It is the first visit by a senior Indian minister to the US after President Joe Biden assumed office in January.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/indiaus-relations-one-of-the-major-ties-in-the-world-today-jaishankar-101622075540300.html

There is still no clarity on his condition, said the police.The police added that investigators are exploring multiple angles to ascertain the motive of the crime and the identity of the perpetrators. However, no breakthrough was made until Wednesday evening, they said.The police have picked up some suspects for questioning, but no arrests were made until evening.Hassan lived with his family in Chauhan Bangar and had taken up garments embroidery work at the shop.The incident took place around 6.30pm on Tuesday when Hassan and his friend Soni were at the shop.A case of murder has been registered at the Jafrabad police station, and a hunt for the suspects is underway, the police said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/man-shot-dead-in-jafrabad-hunt-on-for-suspects-101622075280449.html
27-05-2021||India||Centre in UP gives different vaccines in 1st and 2nd jabs||At least 20 people were each administered two separate coronavirus vaccines -- Covishield as their first dose and Covaxin as their second, or booster, dose -- by health workers at an inoculation centre in Uttar Pradesh’s Siddharthnagar district bordering Nepal border, district officials said, terming it a case of negligence.An inquiry has been ordered into the case and a team of the district health department visited the spot to record the statements of villagers and health workers. “Action will be taken against those found guilty,” Dr Sandeep Chaudhary, chief medical officer, Siddharthnagar, said on Wednesday.According to guidelines, each vaccine recipient is supposed to get two doses of the same vaccine about 4 to 16 weeks apart depending on whether it is Covaxin or Covishield.No adverse reactions have been reported among the 20 people, the CMO said, adding that authorities were monitoring their health.The 20 recipients -- all residents of Audahi Kalan village who are in the 45-plus age group -- were first given a dose of Covishield on April 1 at the Barhni primary health centre in the area.However, on May 14, they were accidentally administered Covaxin as their second dose by the health care workers. “When villagers visited the health centre to take the second dose, the health workers did not check the card to find out which vaccine was administered to them earlier,” said Ram Surat, a 64-year-old resident of the village who was among the 20 recipients.The CMO, too, said it appeared the health care workers at the centre did not check the first dose certificate of the 20 people. The certificate states the type of vaccine administered to a person.Dr DS Negi, direct general of the Uttar Pradesh health department, said the state government has sought a report from the CMO. The inquiry has been ordered against health centre in-charge Dr SK Patel, auxillary nurse midwife (ANM) Kamlawati and accredited social health activist (ASHA) Gayatri.Some countries such as Germany and France have allowed two vaccine types (Covishield and Pfizer/Moderna vaccines) to be administered to the same recipient in some cases, but the decision was taken after studies were carried out to check for efficacy and safety. India has not permitted the same for any vaccine so far.“We have no idea of whether Covaxin and Covishield doses can be mixed for immunisation. There have been studies abroad with the AstraZeneca vaccine (named Covishield in India) and Pfizer or Moderna vaccine that show there is no ill effect of mixing the doses and the individuals do get a good immune response. But we do not have a comparative study for Covaxin in India. These cases where the vaccine doses have been mixed due to an error should be identified and their immunological profile should be studied. Such information will be helpful especially when there is a shortage of one vaccine,” said Dr Lalit Kant, former head of the department of epidemiology at the Indian Council of Medical Research.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-in-up-gives-different-vaccines-in-1st-and-2nd-jabs-101622074566400.html
27-05-2021||India||WhatsApp moves High Court against new IT rules||Citing “dangerous invasion of privacy” and threats to free speech of its 400 million users in India, WhatsApp has moved the Delhi high court seeking the squashing of a rule framed by the Union government that obligates social media intermediaries to identify the first originator of a message upon an order by a competent court or executive authority.The petition filed in the high court claims that enforcement of rule 4(2) of the Information Technology (Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code) Rules, 2021, will break WhatsApp’s end-to-end encryption and the privacy principles underlying it, besides impermissibly infringing upon users’ fundamental rights to privacy and freedom of speech.WhatsApp has requested the high court to ensure no criminal liability is imposed on it for not complying with the provision, which, it contends is, “unconstitutional, illegal” and beyond the purview of the Information Technology Act.The Union government in a statement on Wednesday defended the rules and called WhatsApp’s “last minute challenge” a “clear act of defiance meant to keep the guidelines from coming into effect”. The government also stated that while it respects the right to privacy, no fundamental right, including the right to privacy, is absolute.Rule 4(2), which comes into effect from Wednesday, makes it mandatory for social media intermediary providing messaging services to trace the originator of a message if required by a court or a competent authority under Section 69A of the IT Act. While the rules clarify traceability order may only be passed for serious criminal offences, some categories such as “public order” are relatively broad in operation.“Requiring messaging apps to “trace” chats is the equivalent of asking us to keep a fingerprint of every single message sent on WhatsApp, which would break end-to-end encryption and fundamentally undermines people’s right to privacy,” a WhatsApp spokesperson said.“We have consistently joined civil society and experts around the world in opposing requirements that would violate the privacy of our users. In the meantime, we will also continue to engage with the Government of India on practical solutions aimed at keeping people safe, including responding to valid legal requests for the information available to us,” this person addedA person in the company aware of the technicalities involved said the tracing feature sought by the government is unlikely to be practical since people also copy-paste messages, and that bad actors can separately spoof or modify information in a way that could lead to people being framed.In its petition before the high court on the IT rules, WhatsApp has claimed that the new set of guidelines is “unconstitutional”, for it tramples upon privacy of users apart from being “manifestly arbitrary” and in breach of the principle of data minimisation.“This [the traceability feature] would require petitioner to build the ability to identify the first originator of every communication sent in India on its platform, as there is no way to predict which message will be the subject of such an order seeking first originator information. This eliminates the right of the hundreds of millions Indian citizens using WhatsApp to maintain the privacy of their messages, which is antithetical to end-to-end encryption and the core privacy principles underlying it,” the company stated in its petition.It added that since the provision does not require an approval of a court, it is clear that the power is without judicial oversight and hence, there is no “guarantee against arbitrary State action”. If WhatsApp adds these features, the company said, it could put journalists and civil and political activists at risk.Taking another ground to challenge Rule 4(2), WhatsApp has said that the provision was not backed by any statutory power since Section 79 of the IT Act only allows the Union government to prescribe “due diligence” guidelines that intermediaries must observe to maintain their exemption from liability for third-party content.“However, Impugned Rule 4(2) seeks to impose obligations that fall far outside ‘due diligence’, as it forces fundamental alterations to WhatsApp by breaking end-to-end encryption and changing the fundamental nature of the service that people love and use today in India and across more than 100 countries,” it maintained.The petition sought annulment of the rule also on the ground that it ran counter to the intent of the IT Act which sought to promote “uniformity of the law” with other nations with respect to “alternatives to paper-based methods of communications”.Raman Chima, Asia Pacific policy director at Access Now, said WhatsApp needs to do better in its practices to protect and safeguard the interests of its users — including reconsidering its data sharing with Facebook and changes to its privacy policy. “The present legal challenge does reflect [WhatsApp is] prioritising safeguarding its users’ security and privacy from an overbroad, unlawful, and dangerous government mandate. The government’s insistence on ending traceability has to be seen against the broader context of shrinking civic space, where exceptions carved out in laws are weaponised and selectively applied against dissenters and at-risk communities,” he said.A second expert said there are questions over the legality of the rules. “The IT Rules go far beyond the scope of the IT Act. The traceability requirement unreasonably enhances the scope of obligations under the parent legislation. Section 69 of the IT Act provides the power to seek technical assistance for securing access, interception, decryption or monitoring of information stored in computer resource. The IT Rules, however, may require changes to the technical architecture of messaging platforms which would affect the privacy and security of all users across the board,” said Tanmay Singh, associate litigation counsel at the Internet Freedom Foundation.He added that weakening encryption by mandating traceability would undermine the privacy and security of all users and that even if there are ways to enable traceability without breaking end-to-end encryption, it would still amount to weakening the very purpose of encryption.NS Nappinai, Supreme Court lawyer and founder of CyberSaathi, said: “The government seems to have modified its stance. Till now they were categorically saying they were not asking WhatsApp to break encryption. Whereas this press release does not say that.”“WhatsApp is pitching its claim too high by weighing in only on the aspect of breaking encryption. According to me that’s likely to boomerang,” she said, adding that the government too has more to answer for.“Similarly, the government is not clarifying when and how tracing is mandated. That is, at the time the message is sent or when notice is received? This is likely to be the crux of the issue in deciding constitutionality according to me. For, if it’s at the time of sending messages that would not be sustainable at all. If it’s at the time of notice subject to all other due processes being followed, it cannot be said to be unsustainable. Providing this info is anyway contingent on the messages being on WhatsApp servers, which they have claimed will not be available after one month. Then where’s the disproportionality? Or breaking encryption?”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/whatsapp-moves-high-court-against-new-it-rules-101622073962404.html
27-05-2021||India||Yaas fury lashes east coast||Howling winds and waves the height of double-decker buses marooned villages and rendered hundreds of thousands of people homeless in eastern India as Cyclone Yaas swept inland in Odisha on Wednesday, killing four people and triggering torrential rainfall.India Meteorological Department (IMD) officials said “very severe cyclonic storm” Yaas made landfall near Barajadhauli village in Odisha’s Balasore district at 9am, and then moved north-west.Winds gusting at 140 kmph tore through coastal villages and cities in Odisha and West Bengal, crushing homes, uprooting trees and snapping power lines. Yaas coincided with the spring tide as rising waters breached river embankments and flattened mud houses.Chief minister Naveen Patnaik said the districts of Bhadrak and Balasore were worst affected and people in 128 submerged villages will get relief for the next seven days. He said power will be restored in the next 24 hours in 80% of the affected areas.West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee quoted initial estimates to say 10 million people were affected, 300.000 homes were destroyed and 134 embankments breached by Yaas-triggered storm surges.“Extensive damage has been done because the cyclone coincided with the spring tide. The water level will reach its peak, more than 5m, on Thursday morning so we have to stay alert for the next 48 hours,” she added.Yaas also caused widespread rainfall in Jharkhand and Andhra Pradesh and is expected to cause some showers in Bihar, northern West Bengal and northeastern states. “Cyclonic storm Yaas is likely to move further northwestwards and weaken gradually into a deep depression during next three hours over Jharkhand,” IMD said in the evening.In Odisha’s Keonjhar district, an elderly man was crushed to death after a tree was toppled by strong winds. In Balasore town, a young man was killed after a tree fell on him. In Mayurbhanj, an old woman died after the wall of her house collapsed. In West Bengal, a man stepped out from a cyclone relief centre to catch fish and drowned in the storm waters.Yaas is the second powerful cyclone to hit the country in 10 days, after Tauktae pummeled the western coast and killed nearly 100 people. Last year, West Bengal and Odisha were devastated by cyclone Amphan which killed 98 people.Odisha’s special relief commissioner Pradip Jena said the cyclone did not inflict any major damage on electrical and telecom infrastructure as it had considerably weakened from its initial assessment due to vertical wind shear.“Under influence of the cyclone, heavy to very heavy rainfall started in Mayurbhanj and Keonjhar district from Wednesday. The highest rainfall, 304mm, was recorded at Kusumi in Mayurbhanj district. We are also expecting that large number of trees will be uprooted in Mayurbhanj district,” he said.Jena said most roads blocked by fallen trees in Balasore, Bhadrak, Kendrtapara and Jagatsinghpur were cleared by rescue personnel. The National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) has deployed 113 teams for relief and rescue operations.Tidal surges inundated three seaside village in Balasore district marooning 5,000 people and a flash flood in Basudevpur block of Bhadrak district marooned people in 10 villages. People in Basudevpur dig up a road to divert seawater. In Mahalakpada area of Kendrapara district, several villages were flooded by seawater following breaches in saline embankment, officials said.Preliminary assessment in West Bengal estimated that it would take at least three days to assess the actual damage. “I will soon be undertaking an aerial survey of the affected areas in Purba Medinipur, South 24 Parganas and North 24 Parganas districts,” Banerjee said.Rainwater also swamped the Bengal seaside resort of Digha with visuals showing people wading through chest-deep water. Many rivers were in spate owing to the phenomenal rise in water level -- caused by the dual effect of storm surge and the astronomical tide due to the full moon.In Kolkata, too, low-lying areas along the banks of Hooghly and Tolly’s canal such as Chetla, Kalighat and Rashbehari were flooded. The high-profile assembly seat of Nandigram was flooded, as were many villages in the east Midnapore district.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/yaas-fury-lashes-east-coast-101622073533925.html
27-05-2021||India||Centenarian freedom fighter who spoke truth to power||Harohalli Srinivasaiah Doreswamy was 24 years old and just taken up a new job as a schoolteacher when he was first arrested and imprisoned for 17 months for organising strikes against the British government.His second visit to prison was at the age of 57 when he took on then prime minister Indira Gandhi during the emergency.Doreswamy has never held any political position and was the driving force behind several people’s movements in the state of Karnataka, often leading from the front, even at the age of 102.The man, known as the conscience keeper of Karnataka, as someone who always spoke for the people, regardless of the party in power, passed away at the age of 103 on Wednesday following a cardiac arrest, just days after recovering from Covid-19. His mortal remains will be cremated with state honours, said the Karnataka government.Born on April 10, 1918, in Harohalli village in the then princely state of Mysore, Doreswamy was raised by his grandfather and his mother as his father died when he was five years old.He was first drawn towards the radical movement against the British government. With help of a friend, he began planting bombs in government offices and postal boxes. “Our aim was not to harm anyone, but we wanted to disrupt the government machinery,” he told HT during an interview on February 18.His life took a turn in 1936 when Mahatma Gandhi came visiting. Doreswamy met him at Nandi hills where the father of the nation was staying -- a rest cure to recover from a spot of high blood pressure. After the meeting, Doreswamy became a follower of Gandhi.Six years later, he was at the forefront of the Quit India movement in the state. “During the Quit India Movement, I helped organise a strike by all major cloth mills in the city -- Binny Mills, Minerva Mills and Raja Mills, especially since they were stitching parachute cloth, used by the British in the Air Force during the war,” he recounts in his memoir “Nenapina Suruli Teredaga”, which translates as memories unravelled.He was jailed for 17 months between December 1942-May 1944 for this, but for Doreswamy, jail was a learning experience.“I learnt a lot during my time in the jail and it was a university for me. I learnt Hindi and Tamil. I even became good at volleyball during that time. We used to get lectures on politics from great leaders,” he said during the interview.After his release, he became the editor of “Pouravani” newspaper, which was promptly banned by the Mysore government for its forthright editorials, pushing him to publish and distribute it underground.From Vinoba Bhave’s Bhoodan movement in the 1950s to Jayaprakash Narayan’s Sampoorna Kranti movement in the 1970s to the India Against Corruption movement in the 2010s, Doreswamy was part of the several movements that followed. He was even jailed during the Emergency for writing a letter against then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi.“After the Emergency was announced, I wrote a letter to Indira Gandhi, saying she was a dictator. In the letter, I threatened to go from village to village and mobilise the people against her dictatorship. Soon after that, I held the first meeting in Gandhi Bazar (in Bengaluru). I was arrested. But I was in jail only for four months,”he recounted during the interview.In recent years, he was part of the protests against the Kaiga nuclear plant in north Karnataka and also part of the movement to get land rights for landless farmers across the state. A vocal critic of the current Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government, he came out of the streets to protest the Citizenship (Amendment) Act and the new farm laws.He was convinced that things would change.“Nothing is permanent,” he said in the interview when asked about the policies of the current BJP government. “There will be ups and downs. During the freedom struggle there was Gandhi, during the emergency there was JP (Jayaprakash Narayan) and then Anna Hazare also came, even though he was misguided later. If not a leader, there will be a movement that takes on what is wrong in our country.”The centenarian was also a big believer in the young. When asked about the future of the movements he was part of, he had said: “Today’s young people are smart and wise. The young people of the country have always fought for the right causes. They know what should be done and no one can stop them.”It was almost as if he were passing on the baton.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centenarian-freedom-fighter-who-spoke-truth-to-power-101622071967473.html
27-05-2021||India||In June, Delhi may get only 400,000 free shots for 18+||The Capital will get a little over 400,000 doses of Covid-19 vaccines directly from vaccines makers in June, according to estimates shared by the Union government to the Delhi health department, which translates to roughly 40,000 additional shots that can be given to adults above the age of 18 compared to May.The Centre also said it will send 415,810 doses in the first fortnight of the month under its vaccine supply programme, which is meant to be distributed among people aged 45 above. Compared to the first 14 days of May, this number is a drop of around 81,120 doses for this category.These estimates suggest the city is unlikely to receive any significant boost in its supplies and could run out of the free doses meant for the 18-45 age group, which the state government administers after directly procuring it from manufacturers. In the month of May, it was allotted 360,530 doses -- according to an affidavit submitted by Centre in the Supreme Court this month. The city ran out of doses for this age group on May 22.“States were informed that more stocks will be available in June, and a plan has been shared with them. The Centre has to ensure equitable distribution [of vaccine doses], and efforts are being towards that, so that there is no disparity among states,” said a central government official aware of the matter.The Union government caps the amount of doses states can buy directly from vaccine makers in ratios that account for a state’s population, and distributes its share of doses using a mechanism that is based on the severity of the outbreak in a region.It announces the doses it will distribute on a fortnightly basis, while the cap for the direct procurement is announced for the full month’s duration in advance.In a letter written to Delhi’s principal secretary (health), Vikram Dev Dutt on May 17, Manohar Agnani, additional secretary of the Union health ministry, said, “…the Phase 3 of Covid-19 vaccination is ongoing since 1st May, 2021... In this regard for your State/UT the availability of Covishield from M/s Serum Institute of India, under free supply from government of India for the first fortnight of June ’21 is 319,510 doses.”The state can procure 309,220 allocated Covishield doses on its own for the entire period of June.In a separate letter, the Centre said it will provide 96,300 doses of Covaxin during the first two weeks of June, while the state can on its own procure a maximum of 91,960 doses. Private hospitals procure doses separately.The Serum Institute of India (SII), which manufactures Covishield, and Bharat Biotech, which makes Covaxin, can together make around 70-75 million vaccine doses a month, government officials have said in recent days, and this capacity is expected to rise to around 120 million by July -- with some enhancements possible before that.“By next month [June], there will be more doses available, as companies are making all efforts to ramp up production capacity. The vaccine basket will also expand and there will be more choice,” the official added.Experts have said that the weeks ahead will be crucial to ramp up the vaccination drive as cases go down, since inoculations alone can blunt any future wave of infections without the need for more lockdowns.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-june-delhi-may-get-only-400-000-free-shots-for-18-101622067782612.html

27-05-2021||India||Lancet panel lists 8 suggestions for Centre, states to check surge||The Lancet Citizens’ Commission has recommended centralised procurement and distribution of coronavirus disease (Covid-19) vaccines free of cost instead of the current policy of decentralized procurement through state governments, as part of a set of recommendations proposed in response to the alarming resurgence of Covid-19 in India.The eight recommendations made by 21 experts were published in an article in the British medical journal, The Lancet, on Wednesday.“In response to the alarming resurgence of Covid-19 in India, authors drawn from the Commission and its network of fellows have proposed eight urgent recommendations in an article in The Lancet. These recommendations are focused on the immediate steps central and state governments must take to help curtail the loss of life and suffering caused by Covid-19 amid the recent surge in cases,” said the Commission in a press statement.The Lancet Citizens’ Commission on Reimagining India’s Health System was launched in December 2020 with the aim of laying out a road-map to achieve universal health coverage in India over the coming decade.Among other measures suggested by the members of the Commission to manage the situation in India are: district level organisation and financing of essential health services; transparent national pricing policy and caps on the pricing of all essential health services; and wide dissemination of evidence-based information on the management of Covid-19, especially on what not to do.The members also recommended the marshalling of all available human resources, including those in the private sector; an emphasis on community engagement and public participation with no restrictions on civil society organizations to access resources; complete transparency and sharing of government data to enable districts to proactively prepare for future cases ; and urgent investment in genomic sequencing.By early February, the daily new Covid-19 cases dropped to under 10,000, letting everyone believe that the worst was over. However, the numbers touched as high as 400,000 in the first week of May, catching many off-guard, and experts announcing that India was in the midst of a ferocious second Covid-19 wave.Vaccination, which experts hailed as the key to fighting subsequent waves, started going down because of the acute supply crunch that forced many states to stop vaccination in the 18-45 years category. At about 2 million doses a couple of weeks ago, the daily vaccinations dropped to about half of what was in April when the process was at its peak.The article synthesizes and amplifies the suggestions already being made by grass root level workers and experts across the country.“The humanitarian crisis the resurgence (of Covid) has precipitated requires all persons in central and state governments to set aside their political differences and work in solidarity with each other, and with civil society, to implement the eight clearly articulated recommendations in our article,” said Vikram Patel, one of the Commission members, in a statement.Patel is the Pershing Square Professor of Global Health, Harvard Medical School; Professor, Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, Cambridge, USA; and Co-founder, Sangath, Goa, India.Another member, Poonam Muttreja, executive director, New Delhi’s Population Foundation of India, said, “When it comes to Covid-19 vaccines, we are not only talking about centralization but a certain kind of centralization. It is not just about procurement of vaccines, but the Centre should also look at pricing, and equitable distribution.”Finally, the team also recommended that the profound suffering and risk to health caused by loss of livelihoods should be minimised by making provisions for cash transfers by the state to workers in India’s vast informal economy who have lost their jobs and requiring businesses not to lay-off their workers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/lancet-panel-lists-8-suggestions-for-centre-states-to-check-surge-101622066747632.html
27-05-2021||India||Book Ramdev for sedition, IMA writes to PM Modi||The Indian Medical Association (IMA) has written to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, asking that yoga guru Ramdev be booked under sedition charges for allegedly spreading misinformation on vaccination and challenging government protocols for treatment of Covid-19 patients.The letter said that in a viral video, Ramdev was seen claiming that 10,000 doctors have died in the country despite taking both the doses of the vaccine. Such statements were persuading people not to get the Covid-19 vaccines against national interest of overcoming the pandemic, IMA said in its letter. “This in our opinion is a clear-cut case of sedition in addition to causing irreversible damage to the national interest and the poor masses of this country,” read the letter by IMA.The association clarified that the country lost 753 doctors during the first wave of the pandemic when vaccines weren’t available and 513 so far during the second wave of the pandemic. “None in the first wave could receive the vaccine and the majority who had died in the second wave also could not take their vaccine for various reasons,” the letter said.The IMA alleged that this was a ploy to make profits at the expense of several lives. “We opposed certain drugs which were being falsely promoted as “curative” drugs, without any approval from the ministry or competent authorities. Ministry of AYUSH had also issued a Press Release to Patanjali to stop advertising or claiming its drug Coronil as a cure for Covid-19,” the letter said.The IMA also claimed that it was making the task of frontline workers of getting people vaccinated more difficult. “They (frontline workers) are being assaulted and attacked by people who have fallen for such rumours and superstitions. In some cases, it has been reported that people are fleeing the vaccination drives even by jumping into the river,” the letter said.The Uttarakhand chapter of IMA has also sent a ₹1,000-crore defamation notice to the Yoga guru.The Indian Medical Association had previously demanded apology from Ramdev over his remarks on allopathic medicine calling it a “stupid science”. He withdrew his statements after receiving a strong-worded letter from Union health minister Dr Harsh Vardhan, who called his remarks “inappropriate”. However, Ramdev retorted by posing 25 questions to the IMA in an ‘open letter’ on Twitter, asking if allopathy offered permanent relief for ailments such as hypertension and type-1 and 2 diabetes. He went on to list modern-day ailments such as Parkinson’s disease and wondered if allopathy had any painless cure to treat infertility as well as to reverse ageing and increase hemoglobin.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/book-ramdev-for-sedition-ima-writes-to-pm-modi-101622066755079.html
27-05-2021||India||Our planet won't be the same after Covid: Modi||The Covid-19 pandemic is a once-in-a-lifetime crisis that brought tragedy to the doorsteps of many but also resulted in humankind demonstrating its tenacity through the development of vaccines within a year, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on Wednesday.Delivering a keynote address during virtual global Vesak celebrations on the occasion of Buddha Purnima, Modi said nations around the world were witnessing a “mix of continuity and change” a year after the Covid-19 outbreak. “The Covid-19 pandemic has not left us. Several nations, including India, have experienced a second wave. This is the worst crisis humanity faces in decades. We have not seen a pandemic like this for a century,” he said.“This once-in-a-lifetime pandemic has brought tragedy and suffering at the doorstep of many. The pandemic has impacted every nation. The economic impact is huge as well. Our planet will not be the same after Covid-19.“To those who have suffered and lost their near and dear ones, I would like to extend condolences. I grieve with them.”The PM lauded the efforts of first responders, frontline workers, doctors, nurses and volunteers who “selflessly risked their lives every day to serve others in need”, and scientists who worked to develop vaccines.“But over the last year, there have been many noteworthy changes as well. We now have a better understanding of the pandemic, which strengthens our strategy to fight it. Most importantly, we have the vaccine, which is absolutely important to save lives and defeat the pandemic,” he said.“The emergence of a vaccine in a year of the pandemic striking shows the power of human determination and tenacity. India is proud of our scientists who have worked on the Covid-19 vaccines.”Vesak, which celebrates the Buddha’s birth, enlightenment and death, is an occasion to celebrate the life of the Buddha and also reflect on his ideals and sacrifices for the betterment of the planet, Modi noted.Just as the Buddha devoted his life to removing human suffering, individuals and organisations rose to the occasion over the past year and worked to reduce suffering amid the pandemic, he said. Contributions of equipment and materials were made by Buddhist organisations and followers of the religion around the world, and these actions were in line with the Buddha’s teachings of “blessings, compassion and welfare of all”, he said. Amid the fight against Covid-19, people must not lose sight of other challenges such as climate crisis since reckless lifestyles are threatening future generations, Modi said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/our-planet-won-t-be-the-same-after-covid-modi-101622066601068.html
27-05-2021||India||Serum Institute of India begins production of Covovax vaccine||The Serum Institute of India (SII) has begun at risk production of its second Covid-19 vaccine, Covovax, in India, according to people familiar with the development.US biotechnology company Novavax’s protein-based Covid-19 vaccine, NVX-CoV2373, is being locally manufactured by SII under the brand name Covovax.The company is already locally producing the Covishield vaccine developed by Oxford University and AstraZeneca.“The numbers obviously cannot be disclosed but the manufacturing and stockpiling has already begun like it happened for the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine last year; in a small way though,” a person at the industry said on condition of anonymity.The development, however, was not confirmed by the Union health ministry or the national drugs controller’s office.Besides the Covishield vaccine, SII is also committed to sharing Covovax doses with the COVAX facility to be distributed among low and middle income countries.In an interview to CNBC-TV18 last month, SII chief executive officer Adar Poonawalla said that they planned to begin stockpiling soon even though manufacturing was impacted somewhat because of curbs that the US had earlier put on export of raw materials.“…we are starting to stockpile and manufacture Covovax this month itself… Right now, we could have been making twice as much if we had the raw materials; having said that, in the next four to five months, we would have made adequate arrangements from other suppliers outside of the US which is good news, so this is only a temporary problem. We just need it for these three months; after that we will be completely self-reliant,” he said.In March, Poonawalla had informed that Covovax clinical trials had begun in India.Covovax, however, has not received regulatory clearance anywhere so far.“After Novavax gets approvals abroad with efficacy trials, then we can look at maybe launching it in India. Having said that, I still want to complete my trials in India for Covovax to be absolutely sure that this product we made is identical to Novavax, and we want to adhere to those standards before we launch the product in India, so it’s going to take two-three months. But the good news is that if we can start stockpiling enough quantities, it won’t matter because in three or four months, we can then give those doses to India, and other parts of the world. The key issue is that we are going to establish that the quality of the product that we are making and stockpiling here is identical to standard quality compared to Novavax, and that’s going to take a couple of months,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/serum-institute-of-india-begins-production-of-covovax-vaccine-101622063634956.html
27-05-2021||India||Rumblings grow within Karnataka BJP||The clamour for leadership change within the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in Karnataka has grown louder in recent days, people aware of the developments said, fuelling speculation about possible changes in the state for the BJP.While the buzz of a change in leadership has lived through several news cycles ever since BS Yediyurappa seized power in 2019, people aware of the developments said that a decision may be imminent after the second wave of the pandemic ebbs.“We are about 35-40 legislators who are hardcore party workers and have asked for things to be set right,” said a three-time BJP MLA on condition of anonymity.He said that the situation in Karnataka is “shaky” but added that “there was no guarantee” that the central leaders would consult the state legislators over any changes. At least two legislators from Karnataka were in Delhi on Tuesday to meet with the central leadership, people aware of the developments said. One of the legislators, requesting not to be identified, confirmed having gone to Delhi but refrained from divulging more about his visit. “They have had a word with state unit in-charge Arun Singh. But so far, they have not been given time to meet the party president,” a senior party functionary said.Yediyurappa’s relationship with BJP’s central leadership has soured over the last few months, adding to the challenges of the chief minister who was forced to secure his chair, assuage dissent within his own government and party as well as lead the calamity-prone state out of the raging Covid-19 pandemic at the same time; many say his handling of the Covid situation in the state hasn’t been very good. The loss in the recent bypolls in Maski, people aware of the developments said, has also added to the disenchantment of the senior leadership.“It has come to my notice that there are meetings being held in several places. Several ministers are also involved as I have noticed their statements in the media,” R Ashok, the state revenue minister and BJP MLA said on Wednesday. He is close to Yediyurappa.“That they are meeting and going to Delhi has come to my notice. All of this is 100% true, there is no doubt about it. Some people are doing it directly and some indirectly,” Ashok added.One senior leader said that there were murmurs within Karnataka but no direct signal has come from Delhi yet.The “unwritten rule” within the BJP says no person shall hold any administrative post beyond 75 years of age.

He is the first doctor at AIIMS-Patna among 102 medical practitioners in Bihar to have succumbed to the virus during the second wave of the pandemic. Already over 140 doctors have died due to the virus so far in the state, said Dr Ajay Kumar, senior vice-president of the Indian Medical Association (IMA), Bihar. A resident of Sheohar district, who did his MBBS from Patna’s Nalanda Medical College Hospital, Dr Kumar was admitted to AIIMS on April 27 and shifted to the intensive care unit the next day before being put on the ventilator. “Dr Kumar’s father passed away last year and he was the sole bread earner of his family. We request the state government as well as the AIIMS authorities to provide compensation and a job to one of his two brothers since he sacrificed his life in the war against Covid-19,” said Dr Vinay Kumar, president of the Resident Doctors’ Association, AIIMS-Patna. One death and 15 new cases of mucormycosis or black fungus, associated with coronavirus, were reported in Bihar on Wednesday, taking its total cases to 244 and deaths 14. The death was reported at Patna’s Indira Gandhi Institute of Medical Sciences. The state health department on Tuesday evening uploaded patient information on the government of India (GoI) portal, a month after the state reported the first case of mucormycosis. The health department activated its integrated disease surveillance programme (IDSP) and tasked it to upload information on the GoI portal after the Centre made it clear that it would allocate Liposomal Amphotericine-B, a specific drug for mucormycosis, to the state on the basis of the number of patients, as per information uploaded on the GoI portal. The state made mucormycosis a notifiable disease on May 22 but had failed to compile a “line list” of mucormycosis until recently. As such, it did not have exact details on patients dying due to the fungal infection. Repeated efforts to reach Manoj Kumar, executive director, State Health Society, Bihar, proved futile.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/doctor-at-aiims-patna-dies-of-covid-19-15-new-cases-of-black-fungus-in-bihar-101622057835084.html
27-05-2021||India||Chennai civic body starts home vaccination for differently abled||Chennai: After Madras high court’s directive to prioritise vaccination of people with disabilities, the Greater Chennai Corporation (GCC) has begun door-to-door inoculation for the differently abled. Medical officials and nurses visited homes of those suffering from cerebral palsy, multiple sclerosis and mental illness on Wednesday and administered Covid-19 vaccines, officials in know of the development said. The medical team then stayed back for 15 minutes to check for any post-vaccination side effects. Among the differently abled, those who could travel, vaccination was made available in camps and healthcare centres, officials said. The high court had recently directed to prioritise vaccination of people with disabilities at centres so that they don’t have to wait. Chief minister MK Stalin had launched the Covid-19 vaccination for people with disabilities on last Saturday, when 26 people were vaccinated at a wedding hall in Chennai. The government issued two helpline numbers -- 18004250111 and 9700799993 – through which the differently abled can register their names for vaccination. In a statement, GCC said a total of 169 people have registered through helpline numbers, of which 118 have been vaccinated till May 25. As many as 90 people took the vaccine through special camps while 28 at home, the GCC statement said. Meanwhile, organisations working for the differently abled have given a list of people with disabilities to be vaccinated at home to the state commissionerate for the differently abled, who in turn shared it with GCC. “Home vaccination is a relief to all persons with severe disabilities and their parents as it reduces the anxiety of managing the care, transport, safety amidst a pandemic,” said Smitha Sadasivan, an alumna of Vidya Sagar, an organization working for the differently abled, and member of Disability Rights Alliance (DRA). “Persons with disabilities are highly vulnerable due to an inaccessible environment, and some require a high degree of support in maintenance of personal hygiene, transportation and assistance,” Sadasivan added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/chennai-civic-body-starts-home-vaccination-for-differently-abled-101622057414222.html
27-05-2021||India||Rebel YSR Congress MP shifted to AIIMS||Hyderabad: Rebel YSR Congress party MP Kanumuri Raghurama Krishnam Raju, who was granted bail by Supreme Court last week in a sedition case registered by Andhra Pradesh Criminal Investigation Department (CID), was discharged from Military Hospital in Secunderabad and shifted to All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) in New Delhi on Wednesday.“The MP was discharged from the military hospital in the morning as per the doctors’ suggestions. Soon after his discharge, he left for New Delhi,” his lawyer B Adinarayana Rao said. The legislator had complained of police torture, following which the top court had directed that he be medically examined. The legislator is undergoing treatment for pain in legs and hypertension. He had undergone a bypass surgery in December. A bench comprising Justice Vineet Saran and Justice B R Gavai later granted him bail on May 21 on furnishing a personal bond of ₹1 lakh and providing two securities of the like amount before the trial court. On Monday, Raju’s lawyers had filed sureties petition in the CID court in Vijayawada as per the Supreme Court directions but the court had asked for the discharge summary of the legislator. “The doctors said it would take another four days for the discharge of Raju. So, we shall get the discharge summary only after four days,” another lawyer Lakshminarayana said. But on Wednesday, authorities at the Military Hospital discharged Raju after being convinced that his health was stable. “The CID court has given 10 days’ time for him to submit the sureties from the date of discharge from the hospital. Now that we got the discharge summary, we have time to submit the sureties in another 10 days,” Rao said.Raju, who represents Narasapuram parliamentary constituency in West Godavari district, was arrested by the Andhra CID police from his residence in Hyderabad on May 14. He was charged under Sections 124A (sedition), 153A (promoting enmity between different groups), and 505 (conducting public mischief). A statement from the agency said Raju had been indulging in hate speeches against certain communities and promoting disaffection against the government. “It was found that through his speeches on a regular basis, Mr Raju was indulging in systematic, schematic effort to cause tensions and by attacking various government dignitaries in a way which will cause loss of faith in the government which they represent,” the CID said. On the same night, Raju moved a bail petition in the state high court on medical grounds following which the court directed the government to send him to Guntur government hospital and later to a private hospital. The high court, however, rejected his bail plea and asked him to approach the lower court. The state government submitted the medical report by Guntur hospital and opposed his plea to send him to a private hospital. Raju later moved the Supreme Court for bail and also alleged that he was subjected to physical torture by CID police during his stay at the police station. On May 17, the Supreme Court ordered that Raju be admitted to Military Hospital in Secunderabad for medical examination and treatment under the supervision of a judicial officer appointed by Telangana high court. It also asked hospital authorities to submit the medical report to the court in a sealed cover. On May 21, the apex court bench confirmed that Raju had suffered a fracture in his left foot and there were bruises on both legs. Based on the report, the apex court granted him bail.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rebel-ysr-congress-mp-shifted-to-aiims-101622057354194.html
27-05-2021||India||New interface for CoWin app delayed as K’taka awaits Centre’s nod||Bengaluru: The Karnataka government’s efforts to develop a new interface for the CoWIN (Covid Vaccine Intelligence Network) mobile application, to provide state-specific features such as geo-tagging, will be delayed as the project is awaiting nod from the central government, officials aware of the development said. The Centre is currently finalising its plan to allow state governments to integrate their interfaces with the central portal that is used for Covid-19 vaccine registration, they added. Karnataka deputy chief minister Ashwath Narayan said the proposed interface in Karnataka will consist of features like geotagging for geographical limitations on vaccine distribution and details like when a person seeking vaccination last tested positive for Covid-19, among others. “There is a provision to interface it through their open API and we will build an interface on this. However, we are yet to get permission from the government of India,” Narayan told HT. The move to create an interface comes after several techies resorted to coding to secure vaccination slots on the CoWIN app. As the city ran out of slots amid huge demand, these techies targeted slots in rural areas surrounding Bengaluru. Several groups were also available on instant messaging apps through which citizens learned about available slots and managed their booking within minutes. However, people in the rural areas struggled to attain slots due to lack of technical knowledge.Explaining the status of the interface development, a senior bureaucrat in Karnataka said the central government is still working on its API policy. An API (application programming interfaces) is a set of programming code that enables data transmission between one software product and another.“Only after this API policy is finalised will we be able to complete our interface. We are looking at June 1 as a possible rollout date but we can’t be certain about this,” the official said, preferring anonymity. Several Bengaluru residents have complained of having to wait for hours at crowded vaccination centres allowing onsite registration but return home without getting inoculated. They also cited difficulties securing a slot on the CoWIN app, which makes the development of the interface crucial, especially when the state is planning to resume vaccination for the 18-44 age group. The vaccination drive for an estimated 35 million people in the 18-44 age group was initiated but called off at least thrice since May 1, with only a handful of private hospitals which managed to procure vaccines on their own currently administering doses to this age group. In Karnataka, the daily infection count has declined over the past few days but experts believe it is too early to celebrate, pointing at the fatality rate which has consistently remained above 2% in the last three days. The state, like other parts of the country, is relying on vaccination in its battle against the pandemic. On Wednesday, Karnataka reported 26,811 fresh Covid-19 cases, taking the active caseload to 4,09,924. Bengaluru accounted for 6,433 new infections, which pushed its active caseload to 2,07,357. At least 26,929people have died due to Covid-19 in the state so far, including 530 within 24 hours on Tuesday. Bengaluru accounted for 285 new fatalities on Wednesday, according to the health department data.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/new-interface-for-cowin-app-delayed-as-k-taka-awaits-centre-s-nod-101622056874313.html

All the four districts-- Katihar, Araria, Kishanganj and Purnia –known as Seemanchal share their border with Bengal.The step has been initiated following instructions from chief minister Nitish Kumar who on Tuesday instructed officials to conduct Covid-19 tests of passengers coming to the state by trains and buses from Bengal, which has a much higher positivity rate.West Bengal on May 25 reported a positivity rate of 25.7% as against 2.3% reported in Bihar. In Bihar there are 35,130 active cases and 4746 people have so far lost their lives due to the Covid-19 pandemic.The CM instructed the administration after conducting a high-level meeting on the Covid-19 situation with health department officials as well as DMs. He stressed on aggressive testing for the infection in rural areas.All the four district magistrates (DMs) of Seemanchal have been asked to keep strict surveillance on the people coming from West Bengal.“We are testing people at almost all the points adjoining West Bengal including at Dalkhola checkpoint on NH-31,” Purnia DM Rahul Kumar said adding, “Besides, health officials and panchayat representatives have been asked to keep an eye on the people coming from Bengal.”Health officials in Seemanchal districts are deeply concerned as people of two states and their villages hardly make any difference especially along the border areas. “People from Bengal villages often come to the village markets (haats) in Bihar and vice versa for shopping and it is impossible to keep a watch over them,” Ranjit Kumar a social activist based in Kishanganj said fearing the wave in the neighbouring state would badly affect the rural populace in Seemanchal in the coming days.Seemanchal districts which witnessed a record rise in Covid-19 positive cases in the second wave with over 300 deaths, has registered a dip in confirmed cases recently.Purnia civil surgeon Dr S K Verma said, “Our testing teams are visiting all the villages adjacent to West Bengal besides they are testing at various places on the road and train routes to West Bengal.”Katihar DM Udyan Mishra and Kishanganj DM Aditya Prakash have asked testing teams to remain alert on all the routes which lead to West Bengal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bihar-orders-testing-of-all-arriving-from-bengal-vigil-beefed-up-along-border-101622054715185.html
27-05-2021||India||‘No template of apt behaviour after assault’: Experts on Tarun Tejpal verdict||The Mapusa sessions court acquitted journalist Tarun Tejpal, who was being tried for raping a junior colleague, and contended that the survivor’s account “neither demonstrates any kind of normative behaviour on her own part that a prosecutrix of sexual assault on consecutive two nights might plausibly show, nor does it demonstrate any such behaviour on the part of the accused.”In the judgment, a copy of which was made available on Wednesday, Additional Sessions judge Kshama Joshi said that the prosecutrix did not prove herself a sterling witness, and pulled up the Goa police, which was investigating the case, for destroying evidence that was “inconvenient” to the investigation and would have proved Tejpal’s defence.The former editor of Tehelka magazine was accused of raping a junior colleague in an elevator of a five-star hotel in Goa during the THiNK festival in November 2013. The complainant alleged that Tejpal had raped her in a lift in the hotel on November 7 and attempted to assault her again on November 8. Tejpal, who refuted the charges in court, was acquitted by the fast-track court on May 21. The Goa government filed an appeal against the verdict in the Bombay high court on Tuesday.Admitting that the sole testimony of a rape survivor is enough to put an accused behind bars if her deposition is of “sterling quality”, the judge went on to note that the complainant’s behaviour after the purported rape was inconsistent with the charges.“The printouts of photographs clearly proves that the prosecutrix was absolutely in a good mood, happy, normal and smiling at the time she… did not look distressed or traumatized in any manner whatsoever though this was immediately a few minutes after she claims to have been sexually assaulted by the accused putting her in a state of panic and trauma,” the court said.“The circumstances’ plausibility and above all, the requirement of the prosecutrix to prove herself a sterling witness are essential in law before lending absolute credence to her word. Yet, at every stage, anomalies, discrepancies, wild inaccuracies, improvements, omissions, contradictions and sheer impossibilities mark the narrative of the prosecutrix and yet the IO [investigating officer] and the prosecution have turned a blind eye to them at every stage,” the 527-page judgement stated.Experts point out that there is no template of correct behaviour after or even during an incident of sexual assault, rape and harassment. Often survivors feel the need to appear “normal” out of fear of retribution by the assailant, women’s rights activists said.“There is a belief that a woman should react in a certain way to be worthy of justice. However, there cannot be a standard operating procedure of how a woman should behave after sexual assault,” Mumbai-based women’s rights lawyer Veena Gowda said.In an internal email sent in the days following the incident, Tejpal had said: “I apologise unconditionally for the shameful lapse of judgement that led me to attempt a sexual liaison with you on two occasions on 7 November and 8 November 2013, despite your clear reluctance that you did not want such attention from me.”However, the judge said that the email did not constitute an admission of guilt.“If the email titled ‘personal’ is looked at... it will reveal that there is absolutely no admission or confession of any incriminating fact even remotely suggesting sexual assault by the accused on the prosecutrix in the email. the word sexual assault or any of its attributes are neither implicitly nor explicitly stated in the said personal email… Even assuming that the personal email was sent to the prosecutrix, the contention of the accused that the said email had been sent involuntarily and against his wish and therefore would not be admissible against the accused has to be accepted,” the court said.The court further noted that the investigating officer in the case collected the footage from the ground floor, first and second floors of the hotel but failed to produce footage for the first floor which the judge called a “material lapse by the investigation officer”.“It can be said that because the footage of the First Floor would have wholly destroyed the prosecution’s case, the IO sought to keep out the relevant footage for the First Floor and render it unavailable,” the court said.“If the first-floor footage was viewed on 29.11.2013 where did it disappear and there is absolutely no explanation for the same from the prosecution,” the court noted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-template-of-apt-behaviour-after-assault-experts-weigh-in-on-tarun-tejpal-verdict-101622054594179.html
27-05-2021||India||SII begins production of Covovax vaccine||New Delhi The Serum Institute of India (SII) has begun at risk production of its second Covid-19 vaccine, Covovax, in India, according to people familiar with the development.US biotechnology company Novavax’s protein-based Covid-19 vaccine, NVX-CoV2373, is being locally manufactured by SII under the brand name Covovax. The company is already locally producing the Covishield vaccine developed by Oxford University and AstraZeneca.“The numbers obviously cannot be disclosed but the manufacturing and stockpiling has already begun like it happened for the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine last year; in a small way though,” a person at the industry said on condition of anonymity.The development, however, was not confirmed by the Union health ministry or the national drugs controller’s office.Besides the Covishield vaccine, SII is also committed to sharing Covovax doses with the COVAX facility to be distributed among low and middle income countries.In an interview to CNBC-TV18 last month, SII chief executive officer Adar Poonawalla said that they planned to begin stockpiling soon even though manufacturing was impacted somewhat because of curbs that the US had earlier put on export of raw materials.“…we are starting to stockpile and manufacture Covovax this month itself… Right now, we could have been making twice as much if we had the raw materials; having said that, in the next four to five months, we would have made adequate arrangements from other suppliers outside of the US which is good news, so this is only a temporary problem. We just need it for these three months; after that we will be completely self-reliant,” he said.In March, Poonawalla had informed that Covovax clinical trials had begun in India.Covovax, however, has not received regulatory clearance anywhere so far.“After Novavax gets approvals abroad with efficacy trials, then we can look at maybe launching it in India. Having said that, I still want to complete my trials in India for Covovax to be absolutely sure that this product we made is identical to Novavax, and we want to adhere to those standards before we launch the product in India, so it’s going to take two-three months. But the good news is that if we can start stockpiling enough quantities, it won’t matter because in three or four months, we can then give those doses to India, and other parts of the world. The key issue is that we are going to establish that the quality of the product that we are making and stockpiling here is identical to standard quality compared to Novavax, and that’s going to take a couple of months,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sii-begins-production-of-covovax-vaccine-101622054534120.html
27-05-2021||India||Tamil Nadu govt to bring resolution against new farm legislation||Tamil Nadu chief minister M K Stalin on Wednesday said that the government will bring a resolution in the assembly, asking the Centre to withdraw the three farm laws.The statement coincided with various farmer unions holding a ‘black day’ protest across the country to mark six months of their agitation against the three laws: Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, Farmers’ (Empowerment and Protection Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020, and Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020.In this, Tamil Nadu will join several other non-BJP and non-NDA-led states, which have passed assembly resolutions opposing legislations promulgated through ordinances last year during the first wave of the pandemic. These include Punjab, Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh, Delhi, Kerala, and West Bengal, with the eastern state passing the resolution in January, two months before the assembly elections there.A resolution for the rollback of the laws was an election promise of Stalin’s party, the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK). The CM said that six months have passed but the Union government hasn’t tried to have a constructive dialogue with the farmers to resolve the issue or taken steps to revoke the three farm laws that were passed in haste. “This is a matter of concern,” he said.The previous All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK) government, an ally of the BJP, had supported the legislation and continues to back it. “We supported the new laws because they allow the farmers to directly sell their produce through which they can gain more profits,” said AIADMK spokesperson C Vaigaichelvan.But when asked if AIADMK will not back the resolution when it’s tabled in the assembly, Vaigaichelvan said the party will hold a meeting to arrive at a fresh decision.Stalin drops cases against politicians in anti-Sterlite protestsThe Tamil Nadu government on Wednesday announced that it was withdrawing 38 cases against political leaders in connection with the anti-Sterlite protests in Thoothukudi in May 2018 in which 13 people had been killed in police firing. This includes Marumalarchi Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam chief Vaiko, Amma Makkal Munnetra Kazhagam founder T T V Dhinakaran, Communist Party of India leader R Nallakannu, and Desiya Murpokku Dravida Kazhagam treasurer Premalatha Vijayakanth.This was based on the recommendations by the Justice Aruna Jegadeesan commission in an interim report, the government said in a statement.Last week, cases against the protesters were withdrawn, and 93 people were offered compensation.However, cases against other protesters filed by the Central Bureau of Investigation and those pending in the Supreme Court have not been withdrawn.The protesters had been demanding the closure of a copper smelting factory owned by Vedanta when things turned violent on the 100th day, leading to police firing on May 22, 2018. A day later, the then AIADMK government appointed the Justice Jegadeesan committee to investigate the case and shut down the factory for environmental violations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tn-govt-to-bring-resolution-against-new-farm-legislation-101622054414770.html

27-05-2021||India||Share compliance details: Govt to social media firms||The Indian government has written to all social media companies such as Facebook and Twitter to send details of their compliance officer, nodal contact person, resident grievance officer and physical contact address in India, asking them to confirm if they have complied with the new Information Technology Act guidelines after the deadline to do so ended on Tuesday.The guidelines, seen as controversial by the industry as well as activists, put in place a new mechanism for companies to regulate content, appoint officers who will be liable for compliance, and adopt features such as traceability of messages and voluntary user verification.“Government through a separate notification has also prescribed that a social media intermediary having fifty lakh (5 million) registered users in India will be considered a Significant Social Media Intermediary (SSMI),” the ministry of electronics and information technology (Meity) said in its communication to the companies.“Additional set of due diligence for SSMI and are being administered. The additional due diligence required from SSMI have come into effect today, at the conclusion of three additional months given to SSMIs.”The government asked the social media intermediaries to preferably share the details by the end of Wednesday.Most of the prominent companies, including social media giants Facebook and Twitter, instant messaging application WhatsApp, and Google are yet to comply with the new rules, the deadline for which lapsed on May 25.While WhatsApp has a resident grievance officer, it is yet to appoint a compliance officer. Twitter and Facebook too have not appointed anyone yet.Facebook on Tuesday said it aims to comply with the new guidelines but indicated there were unresolved issued.Google has advertised for the post of a compliance officer and in a statement said that it “respects India’s legislative process”. “We respect India’s legislative process and have a long history of responding to government requests to remove content where the content violates the local law or our product policies. We realise that our work in keeping our platforms secure is never done and we will continue to refine our existing approaches, and evolve our policies and be as transparent as possible about how we make decisions,” a Google spokesperson said.The government has further asked social media intermediaries to specify why they may not be considered a significant one by providing the number of registered users on the platform. “The Government reserves the right to seek any additional information, as may be permitted within these Rules and the IT Act,” it wrote.Under part four of the guidelines, the intermediaries are required to appoint compliance officers, “responsible for ensuring compliance with the Act and rules” and be “liable in any proceedings relating to any relevant third-party information, data or communication link made available or hosted by that intermediary where he fails to ensure that such intermediary observes due diligence while discharging its duties under the Act”.Intermediaries are also required to appoint nodal contact persons for 24x7 coordination with law enforcement agencies and resident grievance officers.Koo, the Indian social media app, has announced it had complied with the new requirements and appointed a resident grievance officer, chief compliance officer, and nodal contact officer.HT on Monday reported that officials warned of stern action if the companies did not adhere to the deadline.The new policy also includes bringing digital news publishers under the ambit of Section 69(A) of the Information Technology (IT) Act. The provision empowers the government to order the blocking of access to content that is considered a threat to public order.An officer, who will head an inter-ministerial committee at the apex of the three-tier self-regulatory system, can also issue this order under emergency circumstances where the companies will not be given a chance for explanation. The committee will have to meet within 48 hours to ratify the emergency block. The news media publishers and over the top (or streaming) such as Netflix and Hotstar, will fall under the ambit of the ministry of information and broadcasting.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/share-compliance-details-govt-to-social-media-firms-101622054354208.html
27-05-2021||India||Cyclone Yaas: 4 killed, mass evacuations minimise loss||Mass evacuation of people from the coastal areas of Odisha and West Bengal saved a lot of lives as cyclone Yaas made landfall in Odisha on Wednesday morning, said government officials. Four deaths were reported in the two states till evening.Yaas wasn’t as ferocious as the India Meteorological Department (IMD) had predicted it to be when it hit the Odisha coast. But it still caused the sea to surge up to four metres, inundating coastal villages in Balasore and Bhadrak where it made landfall. The wind speed stayed between 130 and 145 km/hr, less than the predicted speed of 155-165 km/hr, but it was enough to knock down trees and walls, resulting in three deaths.Odisha chief secretary Suresh Mohapatra said they evacuated over 650,000 people, most of them from Balasore, Kendrapara and Bhadrak districts. “The CM wanted no casualties, so we ensured that no person living in kutcha houses near the coast remained there. Many kutcha houses collapsed due to storm surge and high winds, but people living in those houses did not die as they had been evacuated,” Mohapatra said.Professor Santosh Kumar of the National Institute of Disaster Management in Delhi, who has studied the post-disaster response of Odisha in the 1999 super cyclone and the 2019 Fani cyclone, said Odisha has come a long way in minimising the loss of human life in successive disasters by physically removing people to shelters.“Odisha has been able to protect its people. That’s the most important part. In terms of bringing down the number of lives lost and people getting affected, the state has done well. This has never happened in one day. Odisha built multi-purpose cyclone shelters under National Cyclone Risk Mitigation Project and effectively empowered the local communities while building an early warning dissemination system with last-mile connectivity,” said Kumar.Dr Kailash Gupta, director of the India chapter of The International Emergency Management Society, echoed Kumar. “The first rule of any cyclone is to keep people away from its path. Odisha has done wonderfully well in that aspect. Besides, they are using technology intelligently. The huge number of cyclone shelters that have come up in last 20 years is helping the State in no small measure,” Gupta said.But he added that Odisha needs to do a lot to minimise infrastructure damage. “In 2019, when Fani struck, Bhubaneswar was without power for almost 10 days while it took over a month to bring power to Puri, the ground zero of the cyclone. A poor state like Odisha can’t afford such a huge blow to its infrastructure on a regular basis and needs to build infrastructure that is resilient to disaster. The state needs to graduate to the next level,” Gupta said.West Bengal launched the biggest evacuation drive the state has ever undertaken before any calamity. More than 1.5 million people were evacuated since Monday and shifted to 14,000 cyclone shelters and relief camps.When Amphan had hit the state in May 2020, around one million people had been evacuated. Yaas spared it, but the storm surge flooded many areas. One person who was evacuated to a relief shelter was killed when he went out for fishing.“The chief minister stayed back at the control room at the state secretariat on Tuesday. She virtually spoke to the district magistrates and pressed that more people be evacuated and brought to the relief centres,” said a senior state government official requesting anonymity.District officials had been taking steps to evacuate people since May 22. “We had told the villagers to keep their important documents such as marksheets, identity cards and bank passbooks in one polythene bag along with some dry food so that they could be rushed to cyclone shelters without delay,” said an official of North 24 Parganas district.People living in remote islands were evacuated on May 24 because the sea was expected to be rough by May 25. Pregnant women were also evacuated from some remote islands in the Sunderbans at least 48 hours before the cyclone hit.Gupinath Bhandari, associate professor of civil engineering at Jadavpur University, said Yaas cannot be compared to other cyclones such as Amphan and Aila that had directly hit the state, killing many people. “But this time we saw very good coordination at every level. Control rooms were set up right up to the block level and the chief minister was sitting at the secretariat, monitoring and giving instructions. This I think made the difference,” said Bhandari, who has specialisation in disaster management.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cyclone-yaas-4-killed-mass-evacuations-minimise-loss-101622054235423.html
27-05-2021||India||Book Ramdev for sedition, IMA writes to PM||New Delhi: The Indian Medical Association (IMA) has written to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, asking that yoga guru Ramdev be booked under sedition charges for allegedly spreading misinformation on vaccination and challenging government protocols for treatment of Covid-19 patients.The letter said that in a viral video, Ramdev was seen claiming that 10,000 doctors have died in the country despite taking both the doses of the vaccine. Such statements were persuading people not to get the Covid-19 vaccines against national interest of overcoming the pandemic, IMA said in its letter. “This in our opinion is a clear-cut case of sedition in addition to causing irreversible damage to the national interest and the poor masses of this country,” read the letter by IMA. The association clarified that the country lost 753 doctors during the first wave of the pandemic when vaccines weren’t available and 513 so far during the second wave of the pandemic. “None in the first wave could receive the vaccine and the majority who had died in the second wave also could not take their vaccine for various reasons,” the letter said. The IMA alleged that this was a ploy to make profits at the expense of several lives. “We opposed certain drugs which were being falsely promoted as “curative” drugs, without any approval from the ministry or competent authorities. Ministry of AYUSH had also issued a Press Release to Patanjali to stop advertising or claiming its drug Coronil as a cure for Covid-19,” the letter said. The IMA also claimed that it was making the task of frontline workers of getting people vaccinated more difficult. “They (frontline workers) are being assaulted and attacked by people who have fallen for such rumours and superstitions. In some cases, it has been reported that people are fleeing the vaccination drives even by jumping into the river,” the letter said. The Uttarakhand chapter of IMA has also sent a ₹1,000-crore defamation notice to the Yoga guru. The Indian Medical Association had previously demanded apology from Ramdev over his remarks on allopathic medicine calling it a “stupid science”. He withdrew his statements after receiving a strong-worded letter from Union health minister Dr Harsh Vardhan, who called his remarks “inappropriate”. However, Ramdev retorted by posing 25 questions to the IMA in an ‘open letter’ on Twitter, asking if allopathy offered permanent relief for ailments such as hypertension and type-1 and 2 diabetes. He went on to list modern-day ailments such as Parkinson’s disease and wondered if allopathy had any painless cure to treat infertility as well as to reverse ageing and increase hemoglobin.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/book-ramdev-for-sedition-ima-writes-to-pm-101622054234200.html

27-05-2021||India||B.1.617 spread grows in India and overseas||The B.1.617 variant has become the most dominant in the country, Union health minister Harsh Vardhan announced on Monday, confirming growing clues from the global scientific community that show the mutated virus has spread rapidly not just within India but in several other nations.The minister said this variant now accounts for 65% of all variants of concern found in India when researchers carried out whole genome sequencing of samples. This data matches information uploaded to a global database known as the GISAID Initiative, where the variant accounts for over 70% of samples analysed in the most recent 45-day period in India, and has spread to 49 other countries.“When we talk about genome sequencing, over 25,739 samples have been sequenced by INSACOG and 9,508 were found with variants of concern. Out of these, B.1.617 variant was found in almost 65% of the samples making it one of the most common variants,” said Harsh Vardhan, who was speaking at the 27th meeting of the high-level Group of Ministers (GoM) on Covid-19.Also read | Covid-19: What you need to know todayThe INSACOG is a consortium of 10 institutes of the Centre, which is involved in the genome sequencing of the Sars-CoV-2 virus. The health minister also said that state governments have been requested to send the samples regularly for genome sequencing.The B.1.617 is a variant with three sub-lineages – B.1.617.1, B.1.617.2 and B.1.617.3.While the minister did not give frequency data, GISAID data analysed by outbreak.info showed the spread has been rapid: In the last 45 days, B.1.617.1 and B.1.617.2 together account for 70% of all Sars-CoV-2 genomes sampled in India. Of these, B.1.617.2 appears to be particularly gaining prevalence, rising from around 1% prevalence on March 1 to over 70% in the beginning of May.Till Monday, there were 14,737 sequences uploaded from India. Sequences data uploaded to GISAID allows researchers to study the timing and distribution of variants – a level of detail that Indian authorities have not fully disclosed.According to outbreak.info, Maharashtra, Gujarat, Delhi and Bihar may have the highest proportion of cases with B.1.617.2.In the case of B.1.617.1, which is slightly different and appears to have been overtaken by B.1.617.2 in recent days, the states with the highest prevalence are Maharashtra, Haryana, Andhra Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh.To be sure, these are not based on random sampling and prevalence may be biased based on how widely and regularly a state sends samples for whole genome sequencing.Also read: No proof that kids will be affected more in the next wave, say expertsMaharashtra, with 3,250 sample data shared on GISAID, has carried out the most genome sequencing than any other state. In comparison, Uttar Pradesh, with the largest population in the country, has uploaded 34.“Unfortunately, we are still very under sampled in terms of the sequencing data in India so hard to tell what exactly is happening. Specifically, how the B.1.1.7 lineage and B.1.617 lineage and sublineages are competing. Right now, most of our preliminary analyses are coming from the data out of the UK,” said G Karthik, researcher at Scripps Research Institute, which has put together the mutations tracker at outbreak.info.The B.1.617 lineage has triggered alarm in several other countries and has been designated a variant of concern by most health agencies. In the US, federal health officials said late on Sunday they are ramping up their surveillance of the variant as experts warned that under-vaccinated areas could become hot spots as the country opened up.Late on May 22, the UK released preliminary assessments that show vaccines, while still effective, may have a reduced ability to prevent symptomatic disease with the new variant, especially if people have only taken one dose, as compared to how they worked with the old variant.Public Health England, in its latest technical briefing, also found that the variant first seen in India leads to more secondary infections than the B.1.1.7 variant, which was first seen in the UK and was among the first set of mutations that could spread faster than the virus that was originally seen in Wuhan.Another analysis of GISAID data showed 50 countries have together found B.1.617.2 in over 7,500 samples. Of these, 1,200 have been shared from India, which first found the variant in a sample taken on December 10. Since then, India has uploaded 7,476 samples while the UK, which has done the highest amount of sequencing, has shared 331,773 samples since it first found the variant on March 18, according to cov-lineages.org.Cov-lineages.org also showed that there were a large proportion of samples with the lineages recently in Hong Kong, DR Congo, China, Bangladesh and Singapore.India passed 300,000 confirmed coronavirus deaths on Monday, with fatalities remaining high despite the country flattening out the number of new cases in its devastating pandemic wave. Experts have on several occasions called for authorities to do more to improve the rate of genome sequencing in order to catch dangerous variants before they become widespread.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/b1617-spread-grows-in-india-and-overseas-101621898174172.html
