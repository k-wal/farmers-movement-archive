12-05-2021||India||About 22 lakh people waiting for 2nd Covid-19 vaccine dose in Odisha||The Odisha government on Wednesday informed the centre that about 22 lakh people in the state are waiting for the second shot and therefore the state requires at least 25 lakh doses of Covid-19 vaccines.This was stated by Odisha's Health and Family Welfare Minister N K Das, who joined a virtual meeting of Union Health & Family Welfare minister Harsh Vardhan with state health ministers.Das said that the state has been facing an acute shortage of vaccines and people are waiting to get their crucial second dose.He said the state immediately require at least 25 lakh of Covishield vaccines to meet the requirement.The minister also requested the Centre to ensure supply of oxygen cylinders.While daily consumption of liquid medical oxygen (LMO) in Odisha is 52.9 metric tonne (MT), production capacity in the state is 155.51 MT (through cylinders).However, the surplus LMO cant be utilised due to shortage of cylinders. Hence the state urgently needs 15,000 B-type oxygen cylinders and 15,000 D-type oxygen cylinders, Das said.This apart, the health minister also said that the state precently has 89,683 active cases. As patients in the second wave require oxygen and intenstive care treatment, Odisha needs 500 ventilators.Das said keeping in view the surge of new positive cases, Odisha also needs more antigen kits in order to ramp up Covid-19 tests for early detection of the virus.For the safety of health workers and doctors, the state needs 5 lakh PPE kits, 10 lakh gloves and 10 lakh N-95 masks, Das said demanding setting up a a 247 helpline in the national task force for availing timely assistance and information on medicines used for critical patients.Das also further informed the union minister that Odisha's case fatality ratio (CFR) stands at 0.39 per cent due to effective Covid management.The national CFR is 1.08%. Besides, the recovery rate in Odisha is more than 80 per cent , he said.Meanwhikle, the state government informed all the district authorities that the due date for second dose of Covishield vaccine has been revised to 42 days (six weeks) after the first dose of the Covid-19 vaccine.Therefore, beneficiaries visiting vaccination centre for second dose of Covishield between four and six weeks cannot be vaccinated and the Co-WIN portal will not allow the same, Additional Chief Secretary, Health and Family Welfare (H &FW) P K Mohapatra said in a letter to district authorities."The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare has made modification in Co-WIN portal for second dose of Covishield with effect from today. The due date for the second dose has been revised to 42 days (6 weeks) after first dose, which was 28 days (4 weeks) earlier."You are requested to share the same with all officials, supervisor, vaccinators and verifiers," the H & FW department said in the letter.However, there has been no such modification for Covaxin vaccines, sources said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/about-22-lakh-people-waiting-for-2nd-covid-19-vaccine-dose-in-odisha-101620839943131.html

12-05-2021||India||J-K: Union min Jitendra Singh calls for audit of oxygen cylinders, ventilators||Union minister Jitendra Singh on Wednesday called for an audit of oxygen cylinders and ventilators in Jammu and Kashmir for their equitable distribution in time of distress for needy patients.He said even a single death due to alleged unavailability of oxygen causes tremendous social unrest and negates all the other good work, if any."A confidence building message has to go out loud and clear that a premier institution like the Government Medical College (GMC), Jammu will ensure that not a single death occurs on account of oxygen unavailability," said Singh, the minister of state for personnel.Singh, also a Lok Sabha member from J&K's Udhampur, called for the audit of oxygen cylinders and ventilators in the Union territory for equitable distribution in the time of distress for needy patients, according to a Personnel Ministry statement.He made the clarion call during a high-level meeting of administration and medical staff convened by him in view of certain reports emanating from GMC, Jammu with regard to COVID-19 management facilities.The meeting was attended by Advisor to LG, R R Bhatnagar, Financial Commissioner, Atal Dullo, Divisional Commissioner Raghav Langer, DC Jammu Anshul Garg apart from the Principal, GMC, Jammu, Dr Shashi Sudan Sharma and others.Singh said community management is a vital component of optimum COVID-19 management and the GMC as well as the administrative authorities should not feel shy of taking the community into confidence and soliciting their cooperation.He asked about the steps being taken by the administration for augmenting oxygen capacity of the Government Medical College, Jammu and other district hospitals across the UT.In this regard, he was informed that two oxygen plants each of 1,200 lpm capacity have been set up in GMC, Jammu, the statement said.A 1,000 lpm oxygen plant has also been set up in Chest and Diseases Hospital, Jammu, it said.Further, in Government Hospital, Gandhi Nagar another 1,000 lpm plant has been set up, the statement said, adding that two more plants are being set up in GMC, Jammu to augment its oxygen capacity.With regard to the buffer stocks of oxygen cylinders, Singh was informed that presently a stock of 400 cylinders was present in GMC, Jammu, it said.While commending the steps being taken to augment the oxygen capacity of hospitals, the minister called for the audit of oxygen capacity as well as ventilators in the UT so that no lives are lost for the want of critical care.He further expressed his support to the administration and hospital staff for fighting the battle against COVID and saving the lives of people.Singh instructed the divisional commissioner to post one mechanical engineer and one biomedical engineer in the GMC to exclusively look after the upkeep of oxygen supply so that the patient's attendants or nurses do not have to undergo the ordeal of struggling to maintain oxygen supply.He asked for a regular issue of medical bulletin by the authorities and keeping public representatives informed about what is being done by the GMC.Singh also reviewed the situation of ventilators to handle critical patients.In this regard, he was informed that around 60 ventilators and respirators were being provided to GMC, Jammu, the statement said.To overcome the shortage of staff, Singh asked the administration to engage post-graduate students, final year medical students, paramedical and nursing students.He urged the GMC doctors to surrender their private rooms/chambers in Chopra Nursing Home so that they could be converted into COVID chambers.For the patient's relatives, Singh asked for arranging proper SOPs and PPE kits.Instead of being dealt by police force, the patient's relatives should be sensitively counselled with the help of social volunteers and well-meaning NGOs, he said.For this, the minister assigned the responsibility to DC Garg.While taking stock of the vaccination status in Jammu, Singh was informed that around 96 per cent of population of the age-group of 45 plus had been vaccinated in Jammu alone, while the figure was around 60 per cent for the whole UT.He was also informed that the vaccination in the age-group 18-45 years was under process and daily around 200-250 shots in this age group were being provided in Jammu and around 16,438 people had received the first dose.Singh suggested that better information flow to the public should be carried out to facilitate the vaccination process and if a vaccination centre is not operating at a certain time, it should be frankly conveyed to the public.He said that the referral process should be streamlined and only patients that need critical care should be shifted to GMC, Jammu.In this regard, Singh was informed that home kits were being provided to COVID-19 patients and call centres had been engaged for making calls to them on a regular basis so that patients, only in dire need, may visit hospitals.The minister also called for better coordination and synergy between various departments, involvement of civil society groups and NGOs for reaching out to the public to fight the virus and follow COVID-appropriate behaviour.He further said that the Union Government was committed to support the UT administration and to fill in missing gaps, where required, to save lives and improve the health infrastructure.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jk-union-min-jitendra-singh-calls-for-audit-of-oxygen-cylinders-ventilators-101620831670556.html
12-05-2021||India||Oxygen supply now more than 3 times of what it was during first Covid-19 wave: PM Modi told at high-level meeting||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Wednesday chaired a high-level meeting to review the availability and supply of oxygen and medicines to check the spread of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) in the country. The Prime Minister has been holding regular meetings on the Covid-19 situation, suggesting ways to check its spread and proactively taking key decisions to give a boost to health infrastructure in the country.Wednesday's meeting focussed on availability and supply of oxygen and medicines in the wake of various state governments flagging shortages in supply.The Prime Minister took stock of the situation on oxygen availability and supply. The ministers told him that the supply of oxygen is now more than three times the supply during the peak of the first wave.Amid reports of ventilators lying unused in some states, PM Modi said at the meeting that states should be asked to operationalise them in a time-bound manner and resolve technical and training issues with the help of the manufacturers, according to people aware of the developments.He also said that India has a very vibrant pharmaceutical sector and the Centre's continued close coordination with them will ensure proper availability of all medicines, according to people cited above.During the meeting, the ministers told the Prime Minister that the Centre is actively monitoring the supply of drugs being used in the management of Covid as well mucormycosis - a black fungus which has affected many Covid-19 patients. The symptoms of mucormycosis or black fungus include pain and redness around the eyes and/or nose, fever, headache, coughing, shortness of breath, vomits with blood, altered mental status.PM Modi was also informed that government officials are in regular touch with manufacturers of oxygen and medicines to enhance production and extend all kinds of help needed. The ministers said that states are being provided medicines in good quantities.The Prime Minister was also apprised that the production of all drugs including Remdesivir have been ramped up significantly in the last few weeks.The Prime Minister's Office (PMO) said that PM Modi was also briefed about the operations of oxygen rail and sorties by Indian Air Force (IAF) planes besides the status of procurement of oxygen concentrators, oxygen cylinders as well as the status of plants being installed across the country to produce the life-saving gas.Many state governments, including worst-hit Maharashtra and Delhi, have flagged the issue of shortage of vaccines in their respective areas. Maharashtra health minister Rajesh Tope said that the state government has halted the vaccination of those between the ages of 18 and 44, and diverted the vaccines to give a second dose to those above the age of 45.In Delhi, the lawmaker of ruling Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) Atishi said that stocks of Covishield will last only nine days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-reviews-availability-and-supply-of-oxygen-at-high-level-meeting-on-covid19-101620837354264.html
12-05-2021||India||Transmission of Covid-19 through water is not a concern: Experts||Experts on Wednesday said transmission of coronavirus through water is not a concern, after bodies of suspected Covid-19 patients were fished out of the Ganga and Yamuna.Satish Tare, professor at IIT-Kanpur, said dumping of dead bodies in the Ganga or its tributaries or sub-tributaries is a serious matter, particularly at a time when the country is grappling with the Covid-19 crisis.The Ganga and Yamuna are key sources of drinking water for many villages, local bodies along the rivers.The professor, however, stressed that dumping of bodies will not have a significant effect on transmission.Tare said dumping bodies in the Ganga or its tributaries is not new, but it has come down significantly in the last 10-15 years.Dumping of bodies primarily leads to pollution of rivers, he said."Even if the bodies of suspected Covid-19 patients were fished out, there is a lot of dilution that happens (during the flow of water). The effect may not be significant," he said."If the water is passed for water supply, then it passes through the water supply system. Normal treatment takes care of it,” said Tare, who teaches environmental engineering, water quality and wastewater treatment.He, however, added that there are patches where people draw water directly from the river. But even during this people do exercise caution.Tare is also associated with the National Mission for Clean Ganga, the apex body under the Jal Shakti Ministry that deals with the cleaning of Ganga, its tributaries and sub-tributaries.On Tuesday, the Bihar government fished out 71 bodies from the Ganges in Buxar district, where these were found floating in the river, triggering suspicion that the abandoned corpses could be those of Covid-19 patients.According to Ballia residents in Uttar Pradesh, at least 45 bodies were seen floating at the Ujiyar, Kulhadia and Bharauli ghats in the Narahi area. However, the district authorities did not tell the exact number of bodies found there.On Monday, residents in Hamirpur district spotted five bodies floating in the Yamuna, creating a scare that these were of Covid patients. The bodies were later fished out and cremated.This also led to panic among people of the riparian districts.K Therie, former finance minister of Nagaland, took to social media and said other states should avoid using the water of the river."Ganga is contaminated, with coronavirus death bodies. States living below UP and Bangladesh should avoid Ganga water (sic)," Therie tweeted.The Centre on Tuesday had asked states along the Ganga to ensure strict vigilance and check future incidences of people dumping bodies in Ganga and its tributaries after 71 corpses were fished out of the river body in Bihar.In a letter to the District Ganga Committees which are chaired by district magistrates/ collectors, the National Mission for Clean Ganga also asked the authorities to dispose of unidentified dead bodies of suspected Covid-19 victims in accordance with safety protocols."Ensure strict vigilance along length of the river within territorial jurisdiction of the district to prevent and check such future incidences of people dumping dead bodies in Ganga and its tributaries and of any other activities hazardous for river Ganga and health and hygiene of the area," the NMCG Director General Rajiv Ranjan Mishra said in a letter to the chairpersons of the District Ganga Committees.It has also asked to submit an action-taken report (ATR) to the NMCG in the next 14 days, the letter said.Responding to a question on this in a briefing on May 7, V K Paul, Member (Health), Niti Aayog had said, "Spread of transmission through water is not a concern. Not to worry."In the same media briefing, Principal Scientific Adviser K VijayRaghavan said there is no worry about transmission through such mediums."Primary transmission happens when people speak, or when two people are in close proximity and if the droplets drop on any surface come in contact with the other person then it can spread through water,” he had said."But mostly it spreads through aerosol. It also depends on airflow. There is no need to worry. It dilutes in the water to an extent that there is little danger of transmission," Raghavan added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/transmission-of-covid-19-through-water-is-not-a-concern-experts-101620835653619.html
12-05-2021||India||CPWD puts up boards banning photography, curbs public entry at Central Vista site||The construction arm of the government Central Public Works Department has installed boards prohibiting photography or video recording and restricted the entry of public at the construction site for the Central Vista, which includes most of the Rajpath stretch.The boards installed on the site also include the name of construction firm Shapoorji Pallonji. Last week, citizens and activists shared pictures on social media of the dug-up Rajpath stretch lamenting the imminent loss of the heritage jamun trees, some around 100 years old.The boards came up over the weekend.A CPWD spokesperson, responding to a query on why the boards were installed said his organiation “will not comment on the matter.” The ministry of housing and urban affairs but did not respond to queries seeking comment. A spokesperson for Shapoorji Pallonji declined comment.Hindustan Times, on May 7 reported that the list of trees that will be removed for the project will include at least 20 Jamun trees that are nearly 100 years old that were planted as part of the original plan of Lutyens’ Delhi in the 1920s.Environment activists said they think the boards came up on the barricades of the India Gate lawns around the weekend. It was not just the prohibitory signage but on Wednesday, security personnel were also seen stopping people from even standing across the barricades for more than a few minutes, citing “security protocol”.To be sure, many construction sites do prohibit entry of people indiscriminately, especially because of safety concerns. However, the bit about the “security protocol” is unclear because the Central government told the Delhi High Court on 11 May, that the ongoing work in and around Rajpath and India Gate “is not what is colloquially referred to as “the Central Vista project” (which includes Parliament, refurbishment of North Block, South Block, construction of new offices for central government i.e Common Central Secretariat, Central conference facilities, etc)...but limited to the redevelopment of the Central Vista Avenue (i.e, both sides of Rajpath, where Republic Day celebrations are held annually.” It wasnt on to add that the scope of work was “providing public ameneties like toilet blocks, paths, parking...”, “pedestrian underpasses’, and “improvement of canals, bridges, lawns, lights....”Environment activist Rajeev Suri, who was a petitioner in at least five cases highlighting the lapses and violations in the Central Vista project, said that the signage has only reiterated the “government’s brazenness to carry on with the project while the country was battling a pandemic”.“They (the government) will carry on with this project, no matter the cost. This only shows that while the nation is battling a pandemic, where bodies are floating in rivers, your priority is to build the Central Vista. To make things worse you have also left no transparency in the entire process,” said Suri.Addressing concerns over the project union housing and urban affairs minister Hardeep Puri In a series of Tweets on May 8 said: “Do not believe in fake photos & canards about ongoing work at Central Vista Avenue. No jamun trees have been removed. Only few trees will be transplanted in entire project. Overall green cover will increase. Defining elements of built heritage like lamp posts etc will be restored.”He added that the transformed Central Vista will be a “world class” public space in the heart of national capital. “The project is progressing on schedule. With more public space, landscaping & modern amenities, it will eventually be something every Indian will be proud of,” he tweeted.The Shapoorji Pallonji Group in January emerged as the lowest bidder for the Centre’s tender for the redevelopment and restructuring of the Central Vista Avenue after it quoted a financial bid of ₹477 crore, nearly 5% lower than the estimated cost of the project pegged at ₹502 crore. This is the second phase of redevelopment after Tata Projects Limited was tasked with the construction of the new Parliament complex on September 29, 2020.The tender for the redevelopment of the Central Vista avenue also mandates the firms to maintain it for five years from completion, and requires that the project be completed within 300 days. Work will also need to be carried out in sections to minimise the portion of the avenue that is cordoned off at any given time. “The contractor may have to execute the work in three shifts with large manpower of workers, supervisors and professional engineers,” according to the project tender document.Work on the project continues apace despite the pandemic and the ongoing lockdown in Delhi; the work has been categorised an essential activity.HT on May 4 reported The Vice President’s, and Prime Minister’s new residences are scheduled to be completed by May and December 2022, respectively, according to Central Public Works Department (CPWD), the nodal agency for the Central Vista Project, as the environment ministry’s expert appraisal committee (EAC) has granted the necessary clearance for the rest of the buildings under the plan.The plan, being handled by the Union ministry of housing and urban affairs, involves having a new Parliament building in place by India’s 75th Independence Day in 2022, while the project, which includes constructing 11 administrative buildings to house all the government ministries, is slated to be finished by 2024.Under the Central Vista project, the Prime Minister’s residence will be shifted behind the existing South Block, while the V-P’s residence is proposed to be relocated behind North Block.The plan also includes razing buildings such as Shastri Bhawan, Udyog Bhawan and Krishi Bhawan that house important government ministries to build a common secretariat for roughly 70,000 central government employees who are currently located across 30 buildings.Amid criticism for continuing the Central Vista project during the pandemic Puri on Friday attacked the Congress calling the discourse “bizzare.” The minister’s retaliation came hours after Congress MP Rahul Gandhi criticised the Modi government for executing the project, terming it a “criminal wastage”, while asking the dispensation to focus on people’s lives during the Covid-19 pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cpwd-puts-up-boards-banning-photography-curbs-public-entry-at-central-vista-site-101620836624361.html
12-05-2021||India||India’s new Covid-19 cases have peaked, Cambridge School tracker shows||The number of new coronavirus infections in India has peaked, according to a new tracker developed by researchers at Cambridge Judge Business School and the National Institute of Economic and Social Research.“But there is substantial variation among states and union territories in their trajectories, with cases continuing to increase over the next two weeks in areas such as Assam, Himachal Pradesh, Tamil Nadu and Tripura,” the researchers wrote.The projections are based on reported numbers and are in line with those from some other experts, including Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s advisers. India reported a record 414,188 new cases on May 7 -- about 32% higher than the world’s previous peak reported by the U.S. last year but with just a fraction of the testing and vast undercounting -- and official data suggest daily deaths could continue near the unprecedented 4,000-level.Health services remain overwhelmed and several hospitals face a shortage in oxygen supplies. With the state being criticized for failing to ensure critical needs including oxygen and medicines, businesses are suspending operations and offering employees time off “to heal.”A variant of the virus first identified in India appears to have higher rates of transmission and preliminary evidence suggests potentially reduced effectiveness of certain antibodies, the World Health Organization said in its latest report.The nation has reported more than 300,000 new infections for more than 20 straight days. The numbers are probably vastly undercounted, experts say.“A recent risk assessment of the situation in India conducted by WHO found that resurgence and acceleration of COVID-19 transmission in India had several potential contributing factors, including increase in the proportion of cases of SARS-CoV-2 variants with potentially increased transmissibility; several religious and political mass gathering events which increased social mixing; and, underuse of and reduced adherence to public health and social measures,” it said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/indias-new-covid-19-cases-have-peaked-cambridge-school-tracker-shows-101620836106912.html

Yadav claimed that the ambulances had been purchased from funds made available from the Member of Parliament Local Area Development scheme.Former health minister and RJD chief Lalu Prasad’s elder son Tej Pratap Yadav took to Twitter to criticise the JAP leader’s arrest, saying that Bihar appeared to treat thieves well but put away people who caught the thieves. Former minister Shyam Rajak said it was clear that the government could not tolerate anyone who criticised it.Leaders of the Congress and the CPI (ML) have also been unsparing in their criticism over the timing of the arrest and demanded his early release.Leaders of two NDA constituents in Bihar, Hindustani Awam Morcha-Secular (HAM-S) and Vikassheel Insaan Party (VIP) - they have four MLAs each in the assembly - have also flayed the government for arresting Yadav after he exposed what his supporters say were flaws in the state’s Covid management.Former chief minister and HAM-S leader Jitan Ram Manchi tweeted that the action against a leader, who had been working for people’s welfare day in and day out during the pandemic, was dangerous for humanity. “There should be a judicial inquiry of the case in which Yadav has been arrested,” said Manjhi on Twitter.VIP chief and minister Mukesh Sahni said he had no intention to interfere with the judicial process “but this is not the time to settle political scores”. All parties should unite and fight the pandemic for saving humanity,” said Sahni, adding that the government should also inquire into causes that led to unauthorised parking of ambulances at Rudy’s residences.BJP MLC Rajnish Kumar also described the JAP leader’s arrest as unfortunate and demanded his immediate release. JDU leader and former minister Monazir Hassan slammed the government. “Yadav was helping people to fight Covid by arranging medicines and oxygen to critical patients,” said Hassan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pappu-yadav-s-arrest-in-32-yr-old-case-lights-up-a-huge-political-row-in-bihar-101620833983717.html
12-05-2021||India||Army Base Hospital commandant’s sudden transfer triggers speculation||The commandant of the army’s Base Hospital in Delhi, Major General Vasu Vardhan, has been transferred out of the premier hospital, triggering speculation in some military circles about the reason behind the sudden move that came barely three months before the military doctor’s retirement, people familiar with the development said on Wednesday. But senior officials in the Army Headquarters said it was a routine transfer after the completion of the usual 18-month tenure. Vardhan has been posted at the Delhi-based Army Hospital (Research and Referral) as an additional officer and is being replaced by Major General SK Singh, deputy commandant of the Army Medical Corps Centre and College, Lucknow. The Directorate General of Medical Services (Army) issued the transfer order on May 10. The change of guard at the Base Hospital comes at a crucial juncture when its infrastructure has been stretched by a deluge of coronavirus (Covid-19) cases among serving soldiers, veterans and their dependents. “The commandant has completed more than 18 months in his current appointment. It is a routine posting carried out as part of a larger plan of HR management within the Armed Forces Medical Services (AFMS),” a senior official in the Army Headquarters said. The Base Hospital was converted into an all-Covid-19 facility for soldiers, veterans and their dependents in April after a second wave of infections tightened its grip on the country. “It is unusual for a hospital commandant to be moved out like this three months before retirement. I think there’s more to this than meets the eye,” said a former director general of the AFMS, asking not to be named. Vardhan refused to comment on his transfer. “Nothing from my side on this,” he said. The Base Hospital currently has 650 beds, but its capacity will be increased to 900 oxygenated beds by mid-June to cater to the rising patient load. More than 5,000 soldiers from the three services are currently undergoing Covid-19 treatment in military hospitals across the country, almost a five-fold jump in hospital admissions in three weeks after the second wave erupted, as reported by Hindustan Times on Wednesday. The cases under hospitalisation in the military increased from 1,067 on April 18 to 5,134 on May 10, reflecting in some measure the wider national trend of a surge in coronavirus infections. The 1.5-million strong armed forces have done a better job than others in checking the transmission of the virus and keeping the mortality rate exceptionally low by adhering to strict Covid-19 protocols --- 133 deaths of serving soldiers have been reported since the pandemic broke out last year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/army-base-hospital-commandant-s-sudden-transfer-triggers-speculation-101620833503994.html

The CM alleged that the governor is "steadily ignoring" this advice.At least 16 people, mainly from the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the Trinamool Congress (TMC), have been killed in post-poll violence in West Bengal. Political clashes also left a number of people injured in the state since the results of the assembly elections were announced on May 2.Dhankhar will also visit camps in Assam on May 14 after his visit to affected places in Cooch Behar, a statement from Raj Bhavan said.

They also asked PM Modi to halt the Central Vista project and instead divert the money to buy oxygen and vaccines.In the letter, the leaders argued that they have “repeatedly in the past” drawn the PM’s attention to the measures, they think, are “absolutely imperative” for the Central government to undertake and implement.” “Unfortunately, your government has either ignored or refused all these suggestions. This only compounded the situation to reach such an apocalyptic human tragedy,” the letter read. The letter, signed by former PM HD Deve Gowda, Maharashtra CM Uddhav Thackeray, Tamil Nadu CM MK Stalin, Jharkhand CM Hemant Soren, CPIM general secretary Sitaram Yechury and others, said, “Procure vaccines centrally from all available sources - global and domestic” and “immediately begin a free, universal mass vaccination campaign across the country. Invoke compulsory licensing to expand domestic vaccine production. Spend budgetary allocation of Rs. 35,000 crores for the vaccines.” It asked for stopping the Central Vista construction and demanded that all money held in the unaccounted private trust fund, PM Cares must be released to buy more vaccines, Oxygen and medical equipment required. The letter reiterated that all jobless people should be given at least ₹6000 per month and there must be free distribution of food grains to the needy as over one crore tonnes of food grains are currently rotting in central godowns. The letter, however, also invoked the farm law issues and reiterated that the three farm laws have to be repealed to “protect lakhs of our annadatas becoming victims of the pandemic so that they can continue to produce food to feed the Indian people.” The letter has also been signed by NCP leader Sharad Pawar, JKPA leader Farooq Abdullah, SP’s Akhilesh Yadav, CPI’s D Raja and Tejaswi Yadav of RJD. All these demands have been repeatedly raised by the Opposition parties in the last few months. The government, however, recently defended the Central Vista project and argued that its expenses would be carried out over a few years.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/12-opposition-leaders-write-to-pm-modi-blame-govt-for-apocalyptic-human-tragedy-101620831163606.html

The Telangana police sealed all the inter-state borders and only ambulance services carrying critically-ill patients from neighbouring states to Hyderabad were allowed, according to the directions of the state high court. Director-General of Police M Mahendar Reddy said all other vehicles from neighbouring states would be allowed only after showing e-passes given by their governments for emergency travel. Those from Telangana, travelling to other states should also obtain an e-pass issued by the police department, he said. For those who have to travel to other districts within the state and also for those travelling from one place to another within the limits of Hyderabad, Cyberabad and Rachakonda police commissionerates during the lockdown, e-passes are available online. “Passengers travelling by flights and trains are also allowed to travel, provided they carry valid tickets,” he said. With the Telangana government suspending operation of inter-state bus services and other transport services, including those by private operators, all state-run Road Transport Corporation buses were cancelled. Many people, who were not aware of the orders, rushed to bus and railway stations to leave for their native places but had to return disappointed. The DGP said all arrangements had been made across the state to implement the 20-hour lockdown. Instructions had been issued to all commissioners and superintendents of police to ensure strict enforcement of lockdown. “Stringent punishment will be given to those who violate lockdown rules,” he said. In Hyderabad and all the major towns in Telangana, the police strictly made all shops and business establishments shut down before the restrictions came into force. At the historic Charminar, which witnessed crowds ahead of Eid-ul-Fitr (Ramzan) till Tuesday night, roads wore a deserted look within minutes of the lockdown coming into force from 10 am. Since it was the first day of the lockdown, the police allowed people to rush back to their homes after buying essentials for 15-20 minutes after the lockdown came into force. The police personnel conducted a flag march to enforce the restrictions. Hyderabad Police Commissioner Anjani Kumar, who supervised the implementation of the lockdown at Charminar, told reporters that 180 check posts were set up in the city to check the movement of vehicles. Cyberabad Police Commissioner V C Sajjanar and Rachakonda Police Commissioner Mahesh Bahgwath also monitored the situation in their respective police commissionerates. Earlier in the day, there were traffic jams in several areas, as people came out on the roads in large numbers to purchase essential commodities. There were long queues at supermarkets, vegetable markets, and medical shops and even at wine shops as early as 6.30 am. Restaurants remained closed, and some roadside eateries and mobile canteens did brisk business.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/10day-lockdown-begins-in-telangana-inter-state-borders-sealed-to-curb-covid-19-spread-101620829670337.html

However, the case may now get deferred to some other date because of justice Chandrachud's indisposition.Besides, as per a circular issued by the Supreme Court, Thursday may get declared a holiday if Eid is to be celebrated on Thursday, depending on the sighting of the moon. All the cases will be heard on Friday if Thursday is declared a holiday.Also read: Supreme Court pulls up Central govt over differential Covid-19 vaccine pricingIt is still not clear if the other two judges on the suo motu bench will resume hearing the case on Friday in the absence of justice Chandrachud. Chief justice of India NV Ramana, who is the master of roster, also has the option of constituting another bench with some other senior judge to head it.The Supreme Court on Monday had said that the matter will be heard on May 13 as the virtual proceedings were encountering technical glitches and the deferment will give judges more time to go through the government affidavit which was filed late last night.The three-judge bench said, “Our server is down today. We judges had discussion among ourselves and have decided to take up the matter on Thursday”.Taking stock of the grim situation, another bench led by justice Chandrachud on May 8 said the central government’s policy on allocating medical oxygen supplies to states needed a “complete revamp”, highlighting what it said were the “most obvious points” of considerations overlooked by the expert committee.Observing that it was inclined to set up a committee to review the Centre’s policy, the bench of justices Chandrachud and MR Shah found fault with the Centre’s formula to link allocation of oxygen to only the number of beds in the hospitals of a state and its active cases.Also read | ‘We also hear cries’: Supreme Court asks govt to overhaul Covid plan“Your formula requires a complete revamp. Now, we tell you the practical problem is that when you prepared this formula, not everyone required oxygen or bed but many patients today require oxygen even at home. Your formula takes into account number of beds in hospitals but not those who will require it at home because there are no beds available anywhere,” it told solicitor general Tushar Mehta, who represented the Union government.The court added that the formula, which computed total requirement of a state on the basis that 50% of the non-ICU beds required 10 litres of oxygen per minute, while 100% percent of the ICU beds required 24 litres per minute, also failed to take note of oxygen requirements for ambulances and Covid care facilities, besides the logistical issues regarding its transportation, turnaround time etc.On the grim oxygen crisis in the country resulting in deaths of Covid-19 patients, the Supreme Court on May 8 set up a National Task Force for an effective and transparent mechanism for allocating medical oxygen in view of a surge in Covid-19 cases.The Apex Court bench, headed by Justice DY Chandrachud, constituted National Task Force (NTF) to assess and recommend the need and distribution of oxygen in the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/supreme-court-judge-justice-dy-chandrachud-tests-positive-for-covid19-101620824168055.html

12-05-2021||India||Cases of Covid-linked mucormycosis reported across India||Hospitals across India have been reporting cases of Covid-linked mucormycosis or black fungus, a rare infection, with deaths of it reported from Jabalpur in Madhya Pradesh and Thane in Maharashtra.On Monday, Odisha reported its first case of mucormycosis while Delhi, Gujarat and Uttar Pradesh, and Rajasthan have also detected its cases. New Delhi’s All India Institute of Medical Sciences has created a separate ward to treat black fungus patients.Mucormycosis affects the sinuses, the brain, and the lungs and can be life-threatening in diabetic or severely immune-compromised individuals such as cancer patients or people with HIV/AIDS. Symptoms of mucormycosis include headache, fever, pain under the eyes, nasal or sinus congestion, and partial loss of vision. Some may even experience coughing, shortness of breath, bloody vomits, and altered mental status, doctors said.Doctors believe mucormycosis, which has an overall mortality rate of 50%, maybe being triggered by the use of steroids, which are life-saving drugs for severe and critically ill Covid-19 patients.Steroids reduce inflammation in the lungs in Covid-19 cases and appear to help stop some of the damage that can happen when the body’s immune system goes into overdrive to fight off coronavirus. But they also reduce immunity and push up blood sugar levels in both diabetics and non-diabetic Covid-19 patients. The reduction in immunity can cause mucormycosis, doctors said.In Jabalpur, three deaths of mucormycosis have been reported since May 1. About 10 people have lost vision while 40 others are undergoing treatment in Bhopal, Indore, Khandwa, Jabalpur, and Gwalior, said a state health official.State medical education minister Vishwas Sarang announced that separate wards will be set up for the patients infected with black fungus. “Mucormycosis units will be set up at medical colleges in Bhopal and Jabalpur for surgery of infected patients,” Sarang said.On Wednesday, Thane district in Maharashtra reported two more deaths caused by the black fungus. Six other patients in Thane are undergoing treatment for the infection, officials said.Health minister Rajesh Tope said that the state could have as many as 2,000 cases of mucormycosis and the government has decided to use hospitals attached to medical colleges such as King Edward Memorial (KEM), Parel and BYL Nair Hospital, Mumbai Central as treatment centres for the disease.As many as 14 cases of black fungus have been reported from Jaipur in Rajasthan. . Mohnish Grover, head of the ENT department at Sawai Madho Singh (SMS) hospital, said last year from August to December around 24 cases were reported of black fungus.“Before Covid-19, one or two cases were reported in a year. But during the second wave of Corona, the cases are exploding; now 2-3 cases are coming daily at SMS,” he said, adding that earlier the mortality rate was 30%-50%, which has now come down to 10%. He added in the present wave more people are losing their vision.At least 70 cases of mucormycosis have been detected in Hyderabad in the last month and at least six patients died of it in the last few weeks. In Apollo Hospitals, around 50 such cases were reported and the remaining at two other corporate hospitals. “At present, there are 10 cases being treated at Apollo Hospitals and all of them are in critical condition,” said Dr K Subba Reddy, head of critical care, Apollo Hospitals. The patients have been isolated and given treatment with extreme care, he said.Doctors at SLG Hospitals, Hyderabad, on Wednesday claimed to have saved the lives of three patients suffering from black fungus. “Three patients, aged 25, 42, and 63 years, who recently recovered from Covid-19, reported nasal obstruction and eye-sight related complaints. Large traces of mucormycosis were found in their nasal cavity and it required a surgical procedure to treat them,” said Dr Bhargaw Ilapakurty, consultant head and neck surgeon at the hospital.In Odisha, the throat swab of a 71-year-old man taken on April 18 came positive for the infection on Monday. On May 8, his eyes swelled, and he reported blackish discharge from his nose. After nasal endoscopy, it was found he has some black deposits on the turbinate.“The patient’s sample suggested fungal hyphae and the culture showed Rhizopus (mucorale). The infection was during the Covid home isolation,” a government official said. He added the man had uncontrolled diabetes.Chhattisgarh health department officials said 15 cases of black fungus infection have been reported in the state and all patients are admitted to AIIMS (Raipur). “Most of these black fungus infection cases are because of an overdose of steroids. The early treatment is advisable because, in later stages, it hits the eyes of the patients,” said a health official.In the past month or so, as many as 100 cases of black fungus have been reported from Gujarat, after which the state government has set up separate wards in hospitals for such patients. Officials said in some cases people have lost their vision also.Also Read | Floating bodies trigger panic in MP villagesAs the cases have increased, the union health ministry has decided to increase the production of anti-fungal injection Amphotericin B used to treat patients suffering from mucormycosis.Supply of the medicine is expected to improve with extra imports and an increase in domestic production, the ministry has said in the advisory. The ministry has asked states to create awareness about black fungus.“The hospitals have been asked to use filtered water in an oxy-flow meter. Similarly, ICUs should be sanitised properly. With discharge papers, the hospitals should provide a pamphlet of mucormycosis related to symptoms, cure, and preventive measures,” the health ministry said in its advisory.Maharashtra health department has requested the National Pharmaceutical Pricing Authority to put a cap on the prices of Amphotericin B that costs between ₹5,000 and ₹8,000. A tender has been floated for the procurement of 10,00,00 doses of the antifungal injection, Tope said.On Friday, Niti Aayog Member (Health) V K Paul said mucormycosis cases were being found in coronavirus patients and cases have been reported from several states. He said that states have been advised to create awareness about the fungal infection.(With inputs from state bureaus and agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cases-of-covid-linked-mucormycosis-reported-across-india-101620823722866.html

The order will be pronounced on Thursday.The oxygen concentrators, required by Covid-19 patients, were seized from his upscale restaurants.Additional Session Judge Sandeep Garg reserved the order on the pre-arrest bail for Thursday at 10 am after hearing the arguments of both the prosecution and defense at length.Kalra has been on the run since the recovery of 524 oxygen concentrators from three of his restaurants - Khan Chacha, Town Hall and Nege & Ju between Wednesday and Friday, according to investigators. He could not be tracked despite raids being conducted in Delhi and in adjoining states such as Uttarakhand, the police said.Investigators said that they have evidence which shows the oxygen concentrators were bought for ₹14,000-15,000 and sold at ₹70,000-75,000.During the proceedings, public prosecutor Atul Shrivastava opposed the pre-arrest bail plea and told the court that Kalra's custodial interrogation is required and that bail should not be granted as he is an influential person.“His intention was to cheat the public at large and wrongfully gain. Had Delhi Police not busted the racket, many people would have been cheated,” the public prosecutor said.Kalra started the business of oxygen concentrators “out of greed”, Srivastava said, adding that anticipatory or regular bail should not be granted in such white collar crimes.Senior advocate Vikas Pahwa, representing the accused, asked the court how his client can be accused of selling the oxygen concentrators at exorbitant prices, if there is no ceiling price fixed by the government.The senior advocate emphasised that selective leaks are made by the Delhi Police against Kalra and that he is being made a scapegoat to divert the attention from the "core issues".The application was first being heard by Additional Sessions Judge Sumit Dass but was then transferred to Additional Sessions Judge Sandeep Garg on Wednesday due to change in jurisdiction after the case was transferred to the Crime branch of the Delhi Police.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/oxygen-concentrator-cases-delhi-court-reserves-order-on-navneet-kalra-s-anticipatory-bail-plea-101620822195591.html

Yadav attached the video shot by news agency Reuters in his tweet, and added a jibe."Should we laugh about it or cry," Yadav said in his tweet.अब इस पर हँसे या रोएं... pic.twitter.com/NJIbiXmSoXMany doctors have warned against using cow dung to ward off Covid-19 by confirming that its properties do not give any protection against the viral infection, and could cause other infections like black fungus or mucormycosis, which can be fatal.In the video shared by the Samajwadi Party leader, a small group of people in a cow shelter run by Shree Swaminarayan Gurukul Vishwavidya Prathisthanam (SGVP) vouch for cow-dung therapy, believing that it increases immunity against Covid-19.The shelter houses over 200 cows. For the last one month, around 15 people visit it every Sunday to apply cow dung and cow urine on the body. It is then washed off with cow milk, news agency PTI reported quoting the SGVP official.Doctors, however, do not vouch for its efficacy."I don't know if this therapy would really help people. I have never come across any research which suggested that application of cow dung on the body would increase immunity against coronavirus," Dr Dileep Mavlankar, Director of the Indian Institute of Public Health, Gandhinagar, told PTI."Cow dung is nothing but body waste. Applying cow dung and urine can never boost immunity or protect you from coronavirus. People should consult doctors and stay away from such therapies," said Dr Mona Desai, chairperson of the women's wing of the Indian Medical Association (IMA) said, reported PTI.Dr Desai said that instead of proving helpful, cow dung can pave way for other infections, including mucormycosis."Since cow dung also carries several fungi, they may enter into the body and infect you. I urge people to be little aware and not put their lives in danger," Dr Desai said.The coronavirus pandemic has wrought devastation in its second wave in India after the country posted record rise in deaths from Covid-19 over the last 24 hours, pushing its total fatalities past the 250,000 mark.Deaths from Covid-19 swelled by 4,205, while daily coronavirus cases rose by 348,421, with India's overall caseload now surging past 23 million, according to health ministry data.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/should-we-laugh-or-cry-akhilesh-yadav-asks-as-men-apply-cow-dung-to-fight-covid19-101620818617163.html

But the NCSC claims to have been receiving letters and complaints of atrocities against Dalits after the election results were announced on May 2.The Commission is a constitutional body established to check the exploitation of Scheduled Castes.According to a person aware of the details, the NCSC conveyed to the West Bengal government its plan to visit the state on May 13 and 14 and inquire into the cases of atrocities in East Burdwan and 24 Paraganas districts. The NCSC also sought a meeting with the chief secretary and the director-general of police.In a letter to the NCSC, dated May 11, the chief secretary asked the Commission to forward the complaints it has received to the director-general. “The letter from the state government has informed the NCSC that a five-member bench of the high court... heard the matter on May 10. The solicitor general has made a submission before the bench that a number of complaints have been received by, inter alia, the National Commission for Scheduled Castes. And that the high court has observed that in case any such complaints have been received by the commission with reference to violence during the polls or post-poll, the same may be forwarded to the director-general... so as to enable him to transfer the same to the concerned police station for appropriate action,” said the person aware of the details.Also Read | Uncertainty prevails over Class 10 board exams in Bengal after Covid surgeWhen the Commission wrote back saying that it was part of its mandate to conduct spot visits, the government wrote a second letter, also dated May 11, pointing out the NSCN should reconsider its decision during the pandemic. “The West Bengal government said there are many containment restrictions arising out of the current disaster management... which the NCSC is aware of,” said the person quoted above.“Even the hotel that was booked for the team has called to say that it cannot accommodate the visitors, citing excuses. The Commission will take it up with the state government.”When asked about the exact number of cases of atrocities and violence, the person said it will have to be provided by the state.NCSC chairperson Vijay Sampla declined to comment on the WB government’s letters but confirmed that he was scheduled to travel to the state on Wednesday.“It is the mandate of the commission to conduct spot visits. If there are cases of violence against Dalits anywhere in the country, we are entitled to set up an inquiry, seek reports, and even summon the state officials. There will be a problem if the state does not cooperate with the Commission or stops us from visiting three spots we have identified,” Sampla said.HT tried to contact West Bengal chief secretary Alapan Bandopadhyay twice on Wednesday afternoon. His office staff said he was busy in a meeting and would not be able to take calls.After the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) alleged that its workers are being attacked in the state allegedly by the ruling Trinamool Congress cadre, a series of inquiries have been initiated.Governor Jagdeep Dhankar will visit families of those affected by post-poll violence in the state.The Union home ministry has sanctioned security to all 77 BJP lawmakers following an assessment of the threat to them.The BJP has claimed some of the women cadre as well as family members of their workers have also been attacked.A team of National Commission for Women headed by chairperson Rekha Sharma also visited the state last week.The panel has set up a three-member committee to look into post-poll violence against women.

The system is aimed at optimising consumption of oxygen based on the SpO2 reading of the patient and thus, effectively increasing the utility of the oxygen cylinders.The system comes in two variants: Manual, and automatic. As many as 100,000 manual and 50,000 automatic oxygen systems will be procured along with non-rebreather (NRB) masks. Non-rebreather masks are the face masks connected to a reservoir bag which allow a patient to inhale only pure oxygen. A patient using an NRB is unable to inhale anything he or she exhales. A non-rebreather mask typically delivers 70 to 100% oxygen and increases the consumption from a single cylinder by 30 to 40%.DRDO said that this will lessen the workload of hospital staff by a large extent as it will eliminate the need of routine measurements and manual adjustments of oxygen flow. “The threshold SpO2 value for initiating flow from the system can be adjusted once and a display will then continuously keep monitoring the SpO2 levels of the patient” DRDO said.Also Read | PM, Union ministers thank nursing staff for their contribution against Covid-19It added that the technology has been transferred to multiple industries in India which will be producing the systems which will be later paid for by the PM-CARES fund.

The procurement will be done at a cost of ₹322.5 crore under the PM-Cares fund to help the Covid-19 patients.After the approval, the government will procure 1,00,000 manual and 50,000 automatic 'Oxycare' systems along with non-rebreather masks.'Oxycare' is a SpO2-based oxygen supply system which regulates the oxygen being administered to patients based on the sensed SpO2 levels. It prevents the person from sinking into a state of hypoxia which can be fatal.The 'Oxycare' system was originally developed for soldiers posted at extreme high-altitude areas. The indigenously developed system is robust and can be effectively used to treat Covid-19 patients.There are two variants of the DRDO system. The basic version consists of a 10-litre oxygen cylinder, a pressure regulator-cum-flow controller, a humidifier and a nasal cannula. In this model, the oxygen flow is regulated manually based on the SpO2 readings.

12-05-2021||India||In the India-Pakistan detente, the role of UAE and Saudi Arabia||New Delhi has maintained a stony silence in the face of growing signs of mediation by the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Saudi Arabia to nudge India and Pakistan towards putting their strained relations on an even keel.As Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan concluded a visit to the kingdom this week, Saudi foreign minister Prince Faisal bin Farhan Al-Saud said his country could play a role in reducing India-Pakistan tensions.In an interview with Pakistan Television, Prince Faisal lauded the calming of bilateral tensions through the recommitment to the 2003 truce on the Line of Control (LoC). “This is an excellent step in the right direction and we will only work to encourage that process and to make sure that tensions continue to be reduced between both nations,” he said.Prince Faisal made a pointed reference to Saudi Arabia’s “growing good relationship with India” and said his country hopes to “help everybody to work towards reduction in tension”.The Saudi leader’s comments came weeks after the UAE envoy to the US, Yousef Al Otaiba, publicly acknowledged the role the emirates played in bringing India and Pakistan together for talks aimed at calming tensions over Kashmir and getting bilateral ties “back to a healthy level”.In normal circumstances, the external affairs ministry would have swatted away such comments by reiterating New Delhi’s oft-stated position that there is no role for third party mediation in India-Pakistan issues. However, the ministry’s silence has only fuelled speculation about the exact role played by the two West Asian countries in supporting back-channels contacts that have now been extensively reported on by the media in India and other countries.Also Read | International travellers will now have to quarantine after entering Saudi ArabiaAccording to people familiar with developments, who spoke on condition of anonymity, these back-channel contacts have included a meeting of the intelligence chiefs of India and Pakistan in Dubai in January. Pakistan Army chief Gen Qamar Bajwa and senior military officials, during a seven-hour interaction with leading TV anchors and reporters last month, referred to how this meeting had contributed to the decision by both sides to recommit themselves to the LoC ceasefire.Reports of senior Indian and Pakistani security and intelligence officials holding meetings in the United Kingdom (UK) comes at a time when the British government has been positioning itself as a mediator between Pakistan and Afghanistan. The British side has played a role in helping arrange meetings between Bajwa and senior Afghan officials in Kabul on May 10 ,and in Bahrain on March 9, at which the UK chief of defence staff General Nicholas Carter was also present.Also Read | Covid-19: Over 5 lakh Favipiravir tablets from UAE arrive in IndiaPerhaps more than any part of the world, the Indian government has, in recent years, focused a lot of attention on reworking ties with West Asian states, which are home to about nine million expatriates and the source of billions of dollars in remittances. This push has coincided with several other factors that worked to India’s advantage — the deterioration of the ties of Saudi Arabia and the UAE with Pakistan, and the Abraham Accords that helped normalise Israel’s relations with several Arab nations.The gains made by India —such as the first ever visit to Saudi Arabia and the UAE by the Indian Army chief last December — wouldn’t have gone unnoticed in Pakistan, especially at a time when Pakistan’s relations with both West Asian states have been under strain. Saudi Arabia had sought the early repayment of a loan to Pakistan and the UAE came close to taking similar action before extending the repayment of a $2 billion loan last month.Following the normalisation of its ties with Israel, there are signs that the UAE wants to position itself as a bigger player in the region. Both Saudi Arabia and the UAE also realise their growing business and energy ties with India would get a further boost if the subcontinent remains peaceful, and experts believe this is a factor in efforts by both countries to mediate between India and Pakistan.With Pakistan now reportedly looking at India to take the next step — possibly an announcement regarding further normalisation of the situation in Jammu and Kashmir — to take forward the back-channel contacts, it remains to be seen what role Saudi Arabia and the UAE will play in this process.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-the-india-pakistan-detente-the-role-of-uae-and-saudi-arabia-101620811471366.html

This is the first time Prashant Kishor took to social media after the results of five state elections were declared on May 2."In the face of a grieving nation and tragedies unfolding all around us, the continued attempt to push FALSEHOOD and PROPAGANDA in the name of spreading POSITIVITY is disgusting!

A few days ago, the government organised a workshop titled Effective Communications to "create a positive image of the government", and manage "perception through effectively highlighting positive stories and achievements" — a first such workshop of government officials. Around 300 officials, including joint secretaries (media) of each department, attended the workshop.The Rashtriya Swamsevak Sangh has started a series of online lectures titled 'Positivity Unlimited' between May 11 and May 15, with an aim to spread confidence and positivity among people amid the ongoing pandemic. The lecture series is being organised by RSS's Covid Response Team. RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat, Wipro group chairman Azim Premji, spiritual leader Jaggi Vasudev are among the key speakers.In April, Prashant Kishor got embroiled in a controversy after a part of his audio char in 'Club House room' got leaked. In that conversation, Prashant Kishor was heard talking about PM Modi's popularity in Bengal. The I-PAC fohas also been vocal on social media against the governmet's Covid-19 management, vaccine policy etc.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/for-being-positive-we-don-t-have-to-prashant-kishor-s-fresh-jibe-at-govt-101620808975083.html
12-05-2021||India||BJP lawmaker hits out at Goa health minister over Covid mismanagement||Ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) lawmaker Atanasio Babush Monserrate has hit out at Goa health minister Vishwajit Rane for failing to put in place adequate facilities in anticipation of the second Covid-19 wave and said he would demand a Central Bureau of Investigation inquiry into the affairs of his department. “People are dying... and these people [Rane] have no remorse whatsoever. Did one statement come from the health minister that ‘I am sorry for the deaths’...”Monserrate asked chief minister Pramod Sawant to take charge of the health ministry. “I am upset because our people are dying. And we cannot do anything.”Monserrate said many BJP lawmakers share his views but were afraid to speak out because of Rane’s “vindictive nature”. He added he has written to Sawant and asked him to call a meeting of lawmakers to take Rane to task there. “..I also want to know the views of all the other MLAs [members of legislative assembly]. This fellow [Rane] has...a vindictive attitude.”Also Read | India’s active Covid-19 caseload declines for 2nd consecutive day: 10 pointsRane said he is answerable to Sawant. “If he [Monserrate] wants to make any allegations I do not want to respond to that. I have no comment to offer,” Rane said.Rane told CNN on May 7 that it was an error of judgement to not impose a lockdown in Goa sooner before the state’s positivity rate shot up. “This [lockdown] should have come much earlier... I had suggested we should go through a stringent lockdown more than 15 days back and even 15 days back was too late, we needed it perhaps a month back... sometimes administratively we need to take decisions that have a balance and many times administrators holding positions sometimes make errors in judgement and I think this is one of those cases where we have made some error in judgement and the cases have spread,” Rane said.“We had thousands of people coming in January and had very less restrictions in place at that time. We had the whole of India coming into Goa at that time in the month of December, January and February… The opening of tourism in December has led to the situation in Goa and we are reporting the highest positivity rate in the country.”Sawant maintained lockdowns do more harm than good before finally announcing a curfew for two weeks. He gave the charge of oxygen supply to collectors from the health department. Sawant blamed those at the helm of the Goa Medical College [and Hospital] for mismanagement in oxygen supply and for not doing enough to ensure regular supply or to apprise him of the situation.“We will streamline the process of ensuring that the supply is adequate. We will allocate the work properly.”Rane has called for a probe into the deaths of 26 patients at the hospital amid reports of oxygen shortages on Monday.On Wednesday, Goa recorded 75 deaths, the highest since the pandemic began, taking the toll to 1,804. The state has 32,836 active cases.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjplawmaker-hits-out-at-goa-health-minister-over-covid-mismanagement-101620810811188.html

12-05-2021||India||WHO has not termed B.1.617 as Indian variant, says Centre||Amid reports claiming that the World Health Organization has said that the Indian Covid-19 variant has been found in 44 countries, the Centre on Wednesday said that WHO has not classified this variant as "Indian". "In fact, the word 'Indian' has not been used in its report on the matter," the Centre said. WHO also clarified that it recognises variants by their scientific names, not by the names of the countries where they originated from. WHO has classified B.1.617 as a variant of global concern, but many reports termed the mutant as "Indian variant", which is unfounded and without any basis, the Centre said.This variant is the fourth "variant of concern" after those detected in Britain, Brazil and South Africa. It was added to the list as it "appears to be transmitting more easily than the original virus", it said.B.1.617 variant of concern at global level: WHOThis variant, also known as the double mutant, leads to loss of neutralisation of antibodies. The emergence of this variant is being seen as a factor behind the sudden surge in the number of cases. According to reports, the variant has been detected in more than 4,500 samples from 44 countries in six WHO regions.But in its document, WHO has not termed this double mutant strain as an Indian variant, the Centre said.WHO does not identify viruses or variants with names of countries they are first reported from. We refer to them by their scientific names and request all to do the same for consistency. @PTI_News @PIB_India @ANI @timesofindia @htTweets @IndianExpress @the_hindu @MoHFW_INDIAThe double mutant virus was first detected on October 5, 2020, as was not so much widespread in India. But on April 1, this strain accounted for 80 per cent of all analysed genome sequences of mutant variants. The Centre did not establish a link between this variant and the surge of the cases in India during March-April but said it might be one of the reasons. Variants are natural in a virus and some variants are more potent than others, it said.Both Covishield and Covaxin, the two vaccines available in India, are effective against this strain, the Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology said.These variants are often reported along with the name of the country where it was first reported. But officially, WHO has not mentioned the double mutant strain as 'Indian variant'. For that matter, it does not officially identify any strain as UK, South African, Brazil etc.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/who-has-not-termed-b-1-617-as-indian-variant-says-centre-101620805913031.html

12-05-2021||India||Supreme Court dismisses Gautam Navlakha’s bail plea||The Supreme Court on Wednesday rejected the bail plea of activist Gautam Navlakha in the case related to the violence that erupted in Maharashtra’s Bhima Koregaon village in January 2018 during the bicentennial celebrations of a British-era war commemorated by Dalits.Navlakha, who is among 15 prominent activists, academics, and lawyers arrested in the case, had sought default bail claiming that the National Investigation Agency (NIA) probing the case against him had failed to file the charge sheet within the stipulated 90-day period.In his plea, Navlakha urged the court to include the 34 days he spent under house arrest in 2018 to the 90-day period. He moved the top court after the Bombay high court rejected his bail on February 8.A Supreme Court bench of Justices UU Lalit and KM Joseph read out the operative portion of their judgment dismissing Navlakha’s appeal. It found no ground to entertain his request of including the duration of house arrest to the 90-day period for his default bail under Section 167(2) of the Code of Criminal Procedure.The Section provides that no magistrate “shall authorise the detention of an accused person in custody for a period exceeding 90 days where investigation relates to an offence punishable with death, imprisonment for life or imprisonment for a term of not less than 10 years.” If the investigation is not completed within this period, the accused is entitled to default bail under this provision.Navlakha has been booked under the stringent Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act for his alleged links with Maoist insurgents. He faces life imprisonment if convicted.Additional Solicitor General SV Raju, who appeared for the NIA in the case, submitted no order of a magistrate was obtained in the case of Navlakha’s house arrest and hence it cannot be treated as legal custody.Navlakha was first arrested in connection with this case in August 2018 when the Maharashtra police were probing the case. Navlakha surrendered to the NIA in April last year when the federal agency took over the probe into the case in 2020.The Delhi high court set aside the order placing him under house arrest and subsequently he was released on bail. He enjoyed protection from arrest under orders passed by the Bombay high court and Supreme Court till the NIA took over the case. The Supreme Court directed Navlakha to surrender in April 2020.Navlakha’s lawyer, Kapil Sibal, argued the 34-day period was crucial for the determination of default bail as any kind of detention of an accused must be reckoned with the offence. He added here the offence for which the accused was under house arrest and later in judicial custody was the same. Sibal said Navlakha was under 11-day police custody from April 14, 2020, to April 25, 2020, and 46-day judicial custody (April 25, 2020, to June 10, 2020).The Bombay high court in February granted bail to Telugu poet and activist P Varavara Rao, 80, who was among those arrested in the case, for six months on health grounds, nearly two-and-a-half years after he was arrested.The activists attended a meeting (Elgar Parishad) on December 31, 2017, to commemorate the 200th anniversary of the Bhima-Koregaon battle, where a Dalit regiment of the British army is believed to have defeated the Marathas. The Bhima-Koregaon battle is celebrated as a symbol of Dalit empowerment. The Elgar Parishad preceded widespread violence on January 1, 2018. Rao, Navlakha, and other activists are accused of inciting violence at the meeting by creating communal disharmony.Activist Rona Wilson moved the Bombay high court in February seeking the quashing of criminal proceedings against him for allegedly the fomenting violence in Bhima Korega after an American digital forensics consulting company concluded that fabricated evidence was planted including in a laptop and thumb drive seized from his residence.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/supreme-court-dismisses-gautam-navlakha-s-bail-plea-101620804750908.html

Jammu and Kashmir Lt Governor Manoj Sinha is learnt to have stepped in to caution the district administration that any missteps at this stage could lead to a surge in Covid cases.Srinagar deputy commissioner Aijaz Asad, who ordered the curfew in the city on April 29 to break the chain of Covid transmission, had later permitted some activities such as the opening of grocery stores, and even bakery shops from 8 am to 12 pm. The relaxation, however, saw a huge rush in markets especially outside bakeries, banks, meat shops. At some places, traffic jams were also reported.The large crowds triggered concern that Srinagar, which has the highest number of active Covid cases in the union territory, could end up frittering away any gains made due to the curfew. Srinagar has reported less than 1,000 cases for four days At a meeting on Tuesday to review the spread of the Covid pandemic, Lt Governor Manoj Sinha took a dim view of the lax implementation of the restrictions in Srinagar and even upbraided the officials concerned.Aijaz Asad withdrew the relaxation soon after. “The provision of exemption for partially permissible activities from 8 am to 12 pm is hereby withdrawn till further orders,” the deputy commissioner’s order on Tuesday evening said.He also asked people to stay indoors.“DDMA Srinagar asked for Testing of all Bakery workers. Out of 99 lifted samples, 8 have tested positive on RT-PCR. Mostly from renowned Bakery shops. Let’s stay indoors. #coronavirus has the unique art of locating the right person,” tweeted DC Srinagar.On Wednesday morning, a large number of security personnel were deployed across the Valley and strict restrictions were enforced to prevent the movement of the public.Government officials have also been told to get curfew passes to go to work.“Movement of government officials shall be facilitated through a Pass system from tomorrow. All HODs are requested to kindly place requisition for passes immediately,” a spokesman of Srinagar district said.Dr Muzaffar Maqbool, associate professor at Srinagar’s government medical college alluded to the crowds on streets in his tweet that spoke about how he had hoped the restrictions would lead to a decline in cases. “Had pinned a hope that expected “Lockdown Effect” is round the corner. But we have a habit of throwing it away. Hope the damage isn’t beyond repair.”Other people also worried that the crowds in the markets could lead to a fresh surge in cases.“This was a very untimely decision especially when our positivity rate is still high. Lets pray that things will remain under control,” said Tanveer Ahmad, a city resident.Srinagar, which reported a peak of 1,311 infections on May 4, was able to pull down the number of cases being reported from the city over the last few days. On Saturday, the city reported 853 cases, 920 on Sunday and 701 on Monday, the lowest in the past two weeks. On Tuesday, the recorded cases were 846.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-curfew-relaxations-scrapped-in-srinagar-after-large-scale-violations-101620802591130.html

However, some states are lagging behind in inoculating the population against viral infection. To address the issue, Union health minister Harsh Vardhan will be meeting with the health ministers of Jammu and Kashmir, Uttarakhand, Haryana, Punjab, Bihar, Jharkhand, Odisha and Telangana on Wednesday, news agency ANI reported.The central government launched its liberalised and accelerated phase 3 strategy to vaccinate everyone in the age bracket 18-44 years on May 1. More than 180 million Covid-19 vaccine doses have been administered so far as of May 11, as per the data provided by the Union health ministry.Also read: Ten states gear up to import vaccines; bottlenecks remainUttarakhand, Haryana, Bihar and Jharkhand are noted to be emerging as Covid-19 hotspots in the country with the highest active Covid-19 caseload and deaths related to the disease. Vaccination, which is an integral component in the five-point strategy of the Centre for containment and management of the pandemic (including test, track, treat and Covid appropriate behaviour), thus needs to be boosted in these states.Uttarakhand, which reported the highest mortality rate of 33 deaths per lakh population on Monday, asked the government if the state can directly import the vaccines from abroad. State chief secretary Om Prakash said that the state needs one lakh vaccine doses per day, reported ANI.Jammu and Kashmir has so far consumed over 27.5 lakh vaccine doses, Uttarakhand has consumed over 23.9 lakh vaccine doses, Haryana consumed more than 44.29 lakh vaccine doses and have over 3.72 lakh doses available in balance, while 150,000 vaccine doses are in pipeline, Punjab has consumed a total over 41.47 lakh doses, Bihar has consumed over 82.39 lakh doses and has a balance of over 5.27 lakh, Jharkhand has consumed nearly 34 lakh vaccine doses, has over 400,000 in balance and 100,000 in the pipeline, Odisha has consumed over 62 lakh vaccine doses and Telangana has consumed over 52.82 lakh vaccine doses, as of Tuesday, according to the ministry's data. The total consumption also includes wastage. Haryana on Tuesday reported the highest vaccine wastage followed by Assam and Rajasthan.India on Wednesday reported more than 348,000 Covid-19 infections and over 4,200 fatalities in the last 24 hours, as per the ministry's Covid-19 dashboard.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/harsh-vardhan-to-meet-health-ministers-of-states-lagging-in-covid-19-vaccination-101620795945714.html

The Centre actually does not have vaccines, he told me. So, he also thinks that there is no other way. We have to divert the doses meant for 18+ people to those 45+. For the 18-44 age group vaccination, we have to go slow because vaccines are not available. We want to purchase vaccines from abroad also, but vaccines are not there," Rajesh Tope said.The minister said the government will be diverting three lakh vials of Covaxin, originally meant for the 18+ population to 45+ people. According to data, more than five lakh 45+ in Maharashtra are awaiting their second dose of vaccine.The Centre on Tuesday asked states to prioritise the administration of the second dose of the vaccine, but the Centre clarified it didn't suggest the Maharashtra government repurpose vaccines allotted for citizens aged between 18 to 44 years in the state for those aged 45 and above.Though the number of fresh cases in Maharashtra is coming down amid the strict restrictions imposed in the city, the state continues to report the highest number of daily cases. As the state is also reporting the highest number of people receiving vaccination per day, its vaccine stock is getting over soon. In the third phase of vaccination, which began from May 1, the Centre allowed states to also procure vaccines directly from the vaccine makers. The health minister said Maharashtra needs two crore vaccine doses every month to inoculate the entire population of the state in the next six months, but no supplier can make so many vials.

For Covishield, the wastage is 1.7% and 3.7% for Covaxin.A health department official said vaccine wastage usually occurs when the expected number of beneficiaries do not turn up for vaccination as per doses allotted to each centre. “Covaxin wastage appears to be higher because the vaccine came in 20 dose vials till recently, whereas Covishield stocks come in 10 dose vials. So, the difference in doses per vial has been a problem,” the official said. He added Covaxin doses remain unused as the turnout of beneficiaries for them is lesser compared to Covishield.Also Read | Bihar farmers crush their produce to protest against low tomato pricesOfficials said the wastage also occurs due to problems in the transportation of vaccines.State health society executive director Manoj Kumar: “We are trying to bring down the vaccine wastage percentage in overall terms in the state. Steps are being taken in that direction.” He said wherever there has been low vaccination, it has led to wastage because Covaxin came in 20 dose vials. “Now, Covaxin has started coming in 10 dose vials, which would help in reducing wastage.”Bihar until May 11 administered over 8.4 million vaccine doses. Officials said Covishield has been widely used. The ratio of allotment for Bihar has been 90:10 for Covishield and Covaxin. The government has placed a fresh order over 1.1 million doses of Covishield and 414,000 Covaxin.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/495-of-covid-19-vaccine-doses-wasted-in-bihar-state-health-ministry-101620796110546.html

12-05-2021||India||Scientists race to study Covid-19 variants in India as cases explode||A potentially worrisome variant of the coronavirus detected in India may spread more easily. But the country is behind in doing the kind of testing needed to track it and understand it better.On Monday, the World Health Organization designated the new version of the virus a “variant of concern" based on preliminary research, alongside those that were first detected in Britain, South Africa and Brazil but have spread to other countries.“We need much more information about this virus variant," said Maria Van Kerkhove, WHO's technical lead for Covid-19. "We need more sequencing, targeted sequencing to be done and to be shared in India and elsewhere so that we know how much of this virus is circulating.”Viruses mutate constantly, and the surge in infections here has resulted in more opportunities for new versions to emerge.But India was slow to start the genetic monitoring needed to see if those changes were happening and if they were making the coronavirus more infectious or deadly.Such variants also need to be monitored to see if mutations help the virus escape the immune system, potentially leading to reinfections or making vaccines less effective. For now, the WHO stressed that Covid-19 vaccines are effective at preventing disease and death in people infected with the variant.Indian scientists say their work has been hindered by bureaucratic obstacles and the government’s reluctance to share vital data. India is sequencing around 1% of its total cases, and not all of the results are uploaded to the global database of coronavirus genomes.When there isn't enough sequencing, there will be blind spots and more worrisome mutations could go undetected until they're widespread, said Alina Chan, a postdoctoral researcher at Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard who is tracking global sequencing efforts.Ravindra Gupta, a professor of clinical microbiology at the University of Cambridge, said: “It has all the hallmarks of the virus that we should be worried about.”First detected in the coastal Maharashtra state last year, the new variant has now been found in samples in 19 of the 27 states surveyed. Meanwhile a variant first detected in Britain has declined in India in the past 45 days.Indian health officials have cautioned that it is too soon to attribute the nation's surge solely to such variants. Experts point out that the spread was catalyzed by government decisions to not pause religious gatherings and crowded election rallies.Dr. Gagandeep Kang, who studies microorganisms at Christian Medical College at Vellore in southern India, said researchers need to figure out if the variant is capable of infecting those who previously had Covid-19 and, if so, whether it could result in severe disease.“I don’t get why people don’t see this as important,” she said.Sequencing efforts in India have been haphazard. The country uploads 0.49 sequences per 1,000 cases to GISAID, a global data sharing effort, Chan said. The U.S., which had its own troubles with genetic monitoring, uploads about 10 in 1,000, while the U.K. does so for about 82 per 1,000 cases.Late last year, Indian government institutions were ordered to buy domestic raw materials wherever possible, in keeping with Prime Minister Narendra Modi's goal of turning India “self-reliant.” This proved impossible, since all materials for sequencing were imported, resulting in more paperwork, said Anurag Agarwal, the director of the Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology. The obstacles were most pronounced between September and December, he said, but his lab was able to find workarounds and continued sequencing.Other labs didn't, and scientists said that should have been when India ramped up its sequencing, because cases were declining at the time.Even after a federal effort started in Jan. 18, bringing together 10 labs that can sequence 7,500 samples weekly, the actual work didn't start until mid-February due to other logistical issues, said Dr. Shahid Jameel, a virologist who chairs the scientific advisory group advising the consortium.By then, India's cases had begun spiking.Jameel said India has sequenced around 20,000 samples, but only 15,000 were publicly reported because some were missing vital data. Until late last month, a third of the samples sent by states were unusable, he said.And now, the raging virus has infected many of the staff in the labs doing the work.“Many of our labs are facing this problem,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/scientists-race-to-study-covid-19-variants-in-india-as-cases-explode-101620794620370.html

The yet-to-be peer-reviewed article uploaded on biorxiv shows that immune evasion of the “double mutant” variant is less than variants with E484K that caused ten-fold reduction in neutralisation as compared to the variant that was in circulation last year.“What we found was a reduction in the ability of the antibodies to neutralise this variant, but they weren’t ineffective.

Of the 33 healthcare workers who got the infection, almost half were caused by B.1.617 variant.“The dominance of B.1.617 could be explained by prevalence of this lineage in community infection or simply reflect transmission between healthcare workers. The data nonetheless raise the possibility of a transmission advantage of B.1.617 in vaccinated individuals,” the article said.In addition, the mutation P681R – also found on the spike protein of the virus that attaches with the human receptors to infect a person – makes the virus more infective.“The P681R mutation increases the formation of syncytium (a single cell with several nuclei) makes the virus better equipped to enter the human cell, replicate for longer, and lead to a higher viral load. Basically, the viral cells fuse together, creating a larger space for the virus to replicate and making it difficult for the antibodies to destroy them. So, if 10 copies of the neutralising antibodies were needed to destroy the previous virus, the body may need to create 15 copies for this. This also means that the virus will stay in the body longer and transmit to others,” said Dr Rajesh Pandey, senior scientist at IGIB.The researchers conducted the experiments using a pseudovirus with the key mutations of the Sars-CoV-2 and sera from people who had received the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/vaccines-not-totally-ineffective-on-indian-variant-study-101620792750461.html

It also tasked ministers to monitor the situation in districts. In other important decisions, committees were set up to create 100,000 government jobs and waive off micro finance loans taken by women groups.Newly appointed health minister Keshab Mahanta said Covid-19 scenario in the state was discussed threadbare in the meeting and details of the fresh pandemic containment guidelines will be released on Wednesday.“No decision has been taken on imposing total lockdown. Details of the new guidelines will be announced by the chief secretary and the DGP [director general of police] on Wednesday. The new measures will come into effect from Thursday,” he said.At present, all offices, shops and business establishments in Assam are shut down at 2:00pm and a night curfew is imposed from 6:00pm to 5:00am. Mahanta said if the new guidelines have to be extended beyond 15 days, the cabinet will decide on an economic package to mitigate losses.“The cabinet decided to allot 2-3 districts to each minister who will extensively tour these places, discuss the Covid-19 situation there and submit a status report in three days,” Mahanta said.On Tuesday, Assam recorded 6,258 new positive cases and 85 deaths—highest ever daily figures in both categories. The state has nearly 40,000 active Covid-19 cases.In other decisions, Mahanta said a committee has been constituted under finance minister Ajanta Neog to fulfil the promise of creating 100,000 government jobs. The committee will submit its report within a month.Another committee has been constituted under chairmanship of urban development minister Ashok Singhal on ways to waive-off microfinance loans taken by women/women groups. It will also submit its report in a month, he added.Industries minister Chandra Mohan Patowary said the government has also decided to increase its stake in Numaligarh Refinery Limited (NRL) from 12.35% to 26% by investing a sum of ₹2,187 crore.“This will be the biggest such investment till date. We had earlier invested ₹90.80 crore for 12.35% stake and got nearly ₹1,200 crore in dividends. With the fresh investment, the state is expected to earn around ₹900 crore annually. We have already invested ₹500 crore of the proposed ₹2187 crore,” said Patowary.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/assams-new-cabinet-decides-against-total-lockdown-to-tackle-covid19-101620792030347.html

The 45-year-old activist was jailed in December 2019 for allegedly stoking violence during the anti-Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) protests with the aim to destabilise the country. “As per the court’s ruling, Gogoi will be escorted by police from Guwahati Medical College Hospital (GMCH), where he is lodged now, to the state assembly and brought back after the oath taking ceremony,” said Santanu Borthakur, Gogoi’s lawyer. Gogoi was hospitalised last year for treatment of Covid-19 and is currently under treatment for other ailments.Gogoi defeated Surabhi Rajkonwari of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) for the Sibsagar seat without campaigning himself. His 84 year old mother Priyada Gogoi campaigned on his behalf. Gogoi was arrested in December 2019 after a case was filed against him in Dibrugarh. The case was later transferred to NIA and a charge sheet was filed in June last year which alleged Gogoi had led the anti-CAA movement which turned violent and led to arson and attacks on police personnel. It also alleged that he hatched a conspiracy to target a particular community in order to disturb unity and integrity of the country. Last month, the Gauhati high court upheld NIA court’s decision to grant bail to Gogoi in one of the cases. He continues in custody as he is yet to get bail in another case lodged against him by the investigative agency. Raijor Dal was formed in October last year and Gogoi was later named its president. Raijor Dal tied up with Assam Jatiya Parishad (AJP), another newly formed outfit, in the assembly elections but the alliance failed to win any other seat.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/assam-nia-court-allows-akhil-gogoi-to-take-oath-as-mla-of-new-assembly-101620790050298.html

The fresh exchange of barb on social media started after Congress interim president Sonia Gandhi slammed the government's failure in managing the pandemic. BJP chief JP Nadda wrote to Sonia Gandhi, slamming Congress leaders' role for indulging in "wrong politics" over the Covic-19 vaccine, which "does not belong to any political party or leader".As India is at the peak of the second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic, grappling with rising cases, deaths and depleting medical resources, the blame-game has become intense. Union health minister Dr Harsh Vardhan recently slammed Jharkhand chief minister Hemant Soren for criticising PM Modi's role in the management of the pandemic.On Tuesday, the war of words escalated with Hardeep Singh Puri singling a few Congress leaders out for doubting the vaccines. "When the vaccine rollout began, instead of asking all eligible people to get vaccinated, Congress leader Rashid Alvi continued with petty politics, doubting vaccine efficacy & fuelling hesitancy," Puri tweeted sharing a video in which Rashid can be seen claiming that opposition leaders may fear the misuse of the vaccine.Silence? My dear @HardeepSPuri, what a pity you don't read my tweets before you misrepresent them! See these: https://t.co/s4z8gwIz8m &https://t.co/7EsWISAYSR & this:https://t.co/5JGjXRQrHq [which i'm sure you will agree is the clincher!] Will you take back your words? https://t.co/pRrpIbTttsEarlier on 2 Jan 2021 he made an utterly weird & comical statement saying “There is no danger to the common people from COVID vaccine but there will be apprehension among opposition leaders". pic.twitter.com/JYm5ise23fAnother member of Congress ‘Inner Circle’ Jairam Ramesh said “Bharat Biotech is a first-rate enterprise, but it is puzzling that internationally-accepted protocols relating to Ph-3 trials are being modified for Covaxin”Now Rahul Gandhi wants the same vaccine free for everyone! pic.twitter.com/qUBGYdY1Nu"Another member of Congress ‘Inner Circle’ Jairam Ramesh said 'Bharat Biotech is a first-rate enterprise, but it is puzzling that internationally-accepted protocols relating to Ph-3 trials are being modified for Covaxin'.Now Rahul Gandhi wants the same vaccine free for everyone!" Puri said targetting Jairam Ramesh.Replying to Puri's accusation, Shashi Tharoor shared the links of his tweets where he congratulated Bharat Biotech for its Covaxin after it was found effective against the B.1.617 variant too. "Will you take back your words?" Tharoor said.After JP Nadda's letter to Sonia Gandhi, Congress spokesperson Ajay Maken said the BJP is trying to make Covid a political issue to hide its failures. Citing The Lancet, he said it is not only Congress which is attacking the government, many experts and journals have also criticised it."India’s fight against COVID-19 continues undaunted. Just a gentle reminder to those fuelling hesitancy & panic. More than 18 cr vaccine doses administered so far. Advance orders for May, June & July 2021 have been placed with the two manufacturers & payments have been made," Puri said adding that the Centre has placed advance orders of Covishield for 5.60 crore vaccines through PM-cares and 11 crore doses on April 22 and 10 crore doses on May 10 by the health ministry. As far as Covaxin is concerned, the government has placed advance orders for 1 crore vaccines through PM-cares and 5 crore doses on April 22 and 2 crore doses on May 10 through the ministry.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/masters-of-doublespeak-minister-slams-cong-over-covid-19-vaccine-tharoor-replies-101620787735923.html

12-05-2021||India||Unauthorised vaccination site at Assam govt hospital busted, probe ordered||A group of health workers is being probed for allegedly running a parallel Covid-19 vaccination centre at Silchar civil hospital in Assam without following the due process and charging as much as ₹2000 for each dose. They also didn’t keep any record of at least 80 persons who they administered a shot of Covishield, officials said on Tuesday.Assam health department authorities claimed they found that around ten vials of vaccine were issued in the name of Urban Health Center but were instead used to vaccinate people out of turn at a parallel vaccination centre being run at the Silchar hospital. As per initial investigations, health worker Swarnajit Paul and senior nurse Sarbani Roy were found supervising the unofficial vaccination site. More than 100 used syringes and some empty vials of Covishield vaccine were found there.The whole operation came under scanner on Tuesday afternoon when a motley crowd’s presence inside a room at the hospital raised suspicion, leading to some staff members of district’s additional chief medical & health office raising questions. Sarbani Roy and Swarnajit Paul then admitted to administering Covid-19 vaccines to unregistered beneficiaries without keeping any record. However, they claimed to be acting under orders from some senior officials.Sarbani Roy said she had recently joined the civil hospital at Silchar and was “ordered” to vaccinate people without any verification. “We vaccinated around 50 people on Monday and 30 people today. I received vaccine vials from a health worker but I don’t know his name. I am a single mother and I have to feed my family with this job. I don’t know if this is legal or not.”Swarnajit Paul claimed they were utilising vaccines likely to go waste as per the waste management scheme guidelines. “At least 10% of vaccines get wasted during the process of vaccination, we are allowed to vaccinate people from the half-used vials of vaccine. We started this process on Saturday under waste management but later some new vials were used.” He claimed he had received a list of people to be vaccinated from a very senior official.Additional deputy commissioner (health), Cachar district, Sumit Sattavan has ordered an investigation into vaccine mismanagement. “Action will be taken against the officials involved in this case within 24 hours,” Sattavan said.A 55-year-old resident of Silchar town who got a jab of the vaccine without registration said he paid ₹2000 for a dose. “I have vaccinated myself with the first dose but now [I am] a bit concerned about the second dose.”According to a union health ministry report, at 5.92 %, wastage of vaccine doses is second highest in Assam after Haryana at 6.49%.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/unauthorised-vaccination-site-at-assam-govt-hospital-busted-probe-ordered-101620787830020.html

Without dismissing the probable contribution of variants, he said, "We have found that younger people are getting slightly more involved because suddenly they have gone out and there are variants also prevalent in the nation which may be affecting the younger people as well."During the press briefing of the health ministry on Tuesday, Dr Bhargava was asked whether the Centre is taking any step to initiate vaccination of the children who are said to be the target of the third wave of the pandemic. Dr Bhargava said there is not much difference in age between the first and the second wave. "We have been analysing the date since August. People above the age of 45 years are more vulnerable to any adverse outcome and the hospitalised mortality is around 9.6 to 9.7 per cent," he said.Positivity rate in 42% of total districts higher than national average: ICMRThough more and more young people are reporting the infection on the ongoing wave, which started around March, the Centre in April refuted the reports of the shift in age groups.

12-05-2021||India||ED books Deshmukh in money laundering case||The Enforcement Directorate (ED) has booked Anil Deshmukh under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) in connection with former Mumbai Police chief Param Bir Singh’s allegations that the former Maharashtra home minister allegedly ran an extortion racket, officials familiar with the matter said on Tuesday.The fresh case against Deshmukh is based on the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) First Information Report (FIR) registered against him last month. The officials said ED was likely to summon Deshmukh and his personal staff soon. Unlike CBI, ED, the federal anti-money laundering agency, can record statements of any person in a case under PMLA’s Section 50 and it is admissible as evidence in court. The fresh case has been filed days after the CBI on April 24 said it has established “prima facie evidence” against Deshmukh, a leader of Nationalist Congress Party (NCP), and booked him for corruption and criminal conspiracy.CBI’s case came a month after Singh accused Deshmukh of using the Mumbai Police for extortion from bars, hotels, and restaurants. CBI is probing Singh’s allegations as well as Deshmukh’s handing over of important cases to then assistant police inspector, Sachin Vaze, and influencing transfers and postings.In a letter to Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray in March, Singh alleged Deshmukh asked Vaze to collect ₹100 crore monthly from bars, restaurants, hotels, and other sources in Mumbai. The letter was written after Singh was transferred for allegedly mismanaging the bomb scare outside industrialist Mukesh Ambani’s house in February. The National Investigation Agency has arrested Vaze in connection with the discovery of the explosives-laden car outside and businessman Mansukh Hiran’s alleged murder. Hiran was linked to the vehicle.Four CBI teams on April 24 carried out raids for 12 hours from 6am at Deshmukh’s residences in Nagpur and Mumbai as well as at his personal assistant Sanjeev Palande’s premises and seized digital devices.Meanwhile, NCP spokesperson Nawab Malik dismissed ED’s case as politically motivated. “Whether it is the case registered by ED or allegations levelled by Param Bir Singh, [there is] an attempt to defame the MVA [Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi] government by using power.” Malik accused the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led central government of using central agencies CBI, ED for political reasons. Malik reiterated Deshmukh will cooperate with the probe.Congress leader Sachin Sawant said the action against Deshmukh has been initiated to cover up the Centre’s failure in tackling the second Covid-19 wave.BJP leader Atul Bhatkhalkar hit back and asked the ruling parties why they were scared of the probe if there was no involvement of Deshmukh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ed-books-deshmukh-in-money-laundering-case-101620775857418.html
12-05-2021||India||‘Election Commission has always been neutral and impartial’: CEC Sushil Chandra||Fresh off assembly elections in five regions amid a spurt in Covid-19 cases, India’s chief election commissioner Sushil Chandra spoke to Smriti Kak Ramachandran about conducting polls in the midst of a pandemic, the challenges in implementing protocols, the West Bengal and Madras high court controversies, and future electoral reforms. Edited excerpts:What are the key learnings from elections conducted during the pandemic?Whenever we conduct elections, we take inputs from all stakeholders. We speak to all the political parties; take inputs from the ministry of home affairs, and health ministry, and from the states. On that basis, we decide how the election will be conducted. Last year, before the Bihar election, the most important thing for us was how to conduct the elections in the middle of the pandemic. But we issued strict guidelines and reduced the people per polling station from 1,500 to 1,000 for social distancing. About 30,000 polling stations were added. We issued guidelines for political rallies. Ultimately, the election was held very successfully... and the voter turnout was also more than the previous polls.This gave us confidence that we could deliver and hold election in four states and one Union territory. In spite of the fact that in the month of January-February, when the pandemic was receding, we decided against lowering the guard as far as the guidelines are concerned. We followed strict guidelines whether it was about presence of people in polling stations or increasing the stations; about 80,000 new polling booths were added.In light of Covid, do you see drastic changes in the way elections will be held in the future?In these elections, if you look at the polling percentage, West Bengal recorded 82%, Assam 83%, and Tamil Nadu 74%. It shows a system of establishing polling stations and a conducive atmosphere encouraging voters to participate in the polling process works. That is the ultimate aim of the election commission — that no voter should be left behind... Our personnel went to homes of the elderly to ensure that they could cast a vote; as a result, the total number of postal ballots went up from 2.9 lakh in 2016 to 13.6 lakh in 2021. Going forward, we will have meetings with the CEOs (chief electoral officers) of the states that went to the polls to understand what difficulties they faced, and what can be done for future elections. We will also consult all political parties to understand how campaigns can be held in the future...When the assembly polls were scheduled, the second wave had not set in. But subsequently it became clear that numbers were going up. Did the commission not consider deferring polls?It is the constitutional mandate of the ECI to conduct elections before the tenure of the assembly ends. We are happy to have been able to conduct elections, and are thankful to the voters, the state police, the central forces, and the 13 lakh election functionaries... Some of them overcame personal tragedies, but chose not to go on leave — that is the commitment of the election commission. We had consultations with states and disaster management authorities, and none of them suggested there was a need for deferring elections.But there was little adherence to the guidelines on the ground. There was no crowd control at rallies.The election commission was always ahead of the curve. During the pandemic, it is the duty of SDMA to take action. We wrote to them continuously... We also took steps not to conduct bigger rallies, and to maintain social distancing. Ultimately, it is a decision SDMAs need to take. By the time polling concluded on April 6, the second wave was not visible to this extent. In West Bengal, we put restrictive measures in place since April 16. During these elections, neither did the SDMA issue any additional instructions on lockdown, nor did it inform EC about the need for any specific curbs. On no occasion did we get any feedback in this regard...Did you flag any concerns with them and the state administration?We were continuously in touch with the chief secretary, and said strict action should be taken against violators. On April 16, we again issued a letter to all rally organisers that it is their personal responsibility to issue masks and ensure safety of the public. On April 22, we had an interaction with political parties where we told them that you are responsible and you will have to take the guidelines seriously. We showed anguish also and said no padyatra, no cycle rally or a big rally will be permissible. During the last three phases in Bengal, we increased the silent period from 48 hours to 72 hours. We communicated it to the state authorities and the chief secretaries to book people; to cancel rallies if they are not complying with the rules; but ultimately it is their role. The EC can issue the direction and tell them and that they should take action, but ECI cannot take on the role of SDMA. They are responsible for taking action on the ground. And at no stage did they tell us that there is any surge in the pandemic. If at any stage SDMA has not taken a proactive role for controlling this, then EC cannot be held responsible.What was the opposition to clubbing the last phases in WB, where the elections happened in eight phases, since it was legally tenable?There is a lot of preparation that is done much in advance. When the demand came, we had to consider the implications of what would happen if we clubbed elections. It would have been logistically difficult; there would be problems in transporting EVMs and the central armed forces...The Madras high court was scathing in its observations that ECI was responsible for allowing rallies with little or no Covid protocol and that its officials should probably be booked for murder.The Supreme Court ultimately has very clearly said that the [HC] remarks are very harsh and the metaphor inappropriate.EC has been in the midst of a controversy after election commissioner Rajiv Kumar sought to file a separate affidavit with the Madras HC on the panel’s role in conducting polls during the second wave, but it was later not filed. The EC also suggested a gag order on the media on reporting court observations.There is no controversy at all. As for the media gag, the aim was only to expunge the off-the-cuff remarks of the high court. A media gag was never an intention, and we have clarified it. We have high regard for the media.The Opposition, particularly in Bengal, has alleged that EC follows the cues of the Union government. The Trinamool Congress called it an “extension” of the BJP.We strongly refute these allegations. The election commission has always been neutral and impartial. It is a narrative, but the EC has been impartial.There is a bunch of suggestions from the EC pending with the law ministry for bringing about reforms. What is the status of these suggestions?Reforms are a continuous an ongoing process. We have proposed an amendment to section 40 (b) of the Representation of People Act that instead of having to wait for an entire year to enrol as voters, those who turn 18 can be enrolled the same year. We can carry out the enrolment three or four times a year.The second proposal is to link Aadhar with the electoral rolls for ensuring no duplication in the rolls. This will also make is easier for people to transfer their votes when they shift to a new place. This will also require an amendment to the law. We have also proposed that paid news should be a corrupt practice.The use of money in polls is a worrying trend. Some have even argued that funding of political parties is still not transparent.The EC is very concerned about this, and during these elections, we decided that we want an inducement-free election. We appointed five special expenditure observers who are retired from the income tax department. More than ₹1,000 crore of cash, liquor, and narcotics were seized, which is 4.5 times higher than the previous elections and this was possible because of the vigil by these officers. We have also set up a committee headed by Harish Kumar, an ex-IRS official who will submit a report on how we can further look at the expenditure limits who these can be controlled and monitored in a scientific manner. There is a demand from political parties to increase the limit; all this will be decided by the committee.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/election-commission-has-always-been-neutral-and-impartial-cec-sushil-chandra-101620774017227.html
12-05-2021||India||PIL against Central Vista bid to stall project: Centre||The Centre has told the Delhi high court that a public interest litigation (PIL) seeking a stay on construction at Central Vista amid the Covid-19 pandemic is just another attempt at stalling the project that has been facing such attempts from the beginning on different grounds.The “intentions and motive” behind filing of the plea are evident from the fact that the Central Vista project has been singled out by the petitioners despite several other agencies, including the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation, carrying out construction activities across the national capital, the Centre said in an affidavit filed before the court on Tuesday.The project, being handled by the Union ministry of housing and urban affairs, involves building a new Parliament building by India’s 75th Independence Day in 2022, while the overall project, which includes constructing 11 administrative buildings to house all the government ministries, is slated to be finished by 2024.The Centre accused the petitioners, Anya Malhotra, who works as a translator, and Sohail Hashmi, a historian and documentary filmmaker, of deliberately suppressing facts in filing the plea to stop the construction work.The Union government said that construction is limited to redevelopment of the Central Vista Avenue which includes both sides of Rajpath where Republic Day celebration are held.“This is a very important public space and most widely visited by the common public and tourists in Delhi. It may be noted that the scope of work is as follows--Providing public amenities like toilet blocks, paths, parking space, vendor zone, making four pedestrian underpasses below Janpath and C-Hexagon Road, improvement of canals, bridges, lawns, lights etc,” the government said.Since the affidavit was not yet on record, a bench of chief justice DN Patel and justice Jasmeet Singh listed the matter for hearing on Wednesday.The petitioners moved the Supreme Court against a May 4 high court order that adjourned their plea to May 17, saying it first wants to study the apex court’s January 5 judgment giving a go-ahead to the Central Vista project.In the appeal before the Supreme Court, the petitioners contended the project was not an essential activity, and can be put on hold during the pandemic.The apex court declined to interfere in the matter as the issue was pending before the high court. It, however, asked the petitioners to seek an early hearing before the high court. Subsequently, they moved an application to advance the matter.The ₹13,450 crore Central Vista project has faced criticism from various quarters and political parties, with Congress leader Rahul Gandhi last week calling it a “criminal wastage” as he asked the government to focus on saving people’s lives during the pandemic.Last Friday, Union minister for housing and urban affairs Hardeep Singh Puri attacked the Congress, terming the opposition’s objections “bizzare.”“Congress’s discourse on Central Vista is bizarre. Cost of Central Vista is about ₹20,000 crore, over several years. GoI has allocated nearly twice that amount for vaccination! India’s healthcare budget for just this year was over ₹3 lakh crore. We know our priorities. There are hundreds of projects being executed by various depts. Governance hasn’t come to a standstill, unlike the Congress’s times of policy paralysis,” Puri tweeted.“They (Congress) want to distract people from monumental governance failures in their states by spreading lies. So they indulge in cheap politics despite knowing this project creates direct & indirect employment for thousands of skilled, semi-skilled & unskilled workers in these times. Congress doesn’t stop at hypocrisy,” he added.In its affidavit, the central government has said that the Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) has permitted redevelopment of the Central Vista avenue — the stretch of Rajpath from India Gate to Rashtrapati Bhawan -- during the prevailing curfew, with the labourers residing on-site.The petitioners have also filed an application seeking the appointment of a commissioner to verify the Centre’s claims in an affidavit that workers engaged in the construction of the project are staying on-site and have been provided with all necessary health care equipment.The Centre, in its affidavit, said a Covid-19 compliant facility was installed at the site to accommodate 250 workers, who had chosen to stay there and continue the work. It also said that there was strict adherence to Covid-19 protocols. “It is unequivocally stated that the workers working on the project as of now, are residing at the work-site, following social distancing norms as well as other Covid-19 protocols,” the Centre said.Citing media reports, the petitioners asked the Centre why permission was sought for the movement of 180 vehicles. “Nowhere in the affidavit is there a disclosure, or response to the averments of the 500 subcontracted workers engaged in the construction of the Central Vista before the curfew who were formerly transported in four buses and were then ferried in a reduced number of such vehicles,” they said in the application.In its response, the Centre said: “The workers are staying on the site and, therefore, the notification relied upon by the petitioner is fully complied with. The petitioner is fully aware about this fact and he has deliberately suppressed it in the petition”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pil-against-central-vista-bid-to-stall-project-centre-101620772581202.html
12-05-2021||India||Covid-19: What you need to know today||I have referred to the Nomura India Business Resumption Index previously in this column – a measure of the extent to which business activities in the country have resumed, with 100 indicating the pre-pandemic (when was that?) level.In February, it was almost there. Now, around three months since, it is back to levels seen last June, after the hard lockdown ended but many of the restrictions on movement and activities remained. In numerical terms, the index is at 64.5. That isn’t surprising.The lockdowns that most states have declared have put a damper on movement, consumption, and business activities. It was clear many months ago that while countries could use a mix of economic measures to alleviate the financial distress caused by the coronavirus disease pandemic, the only sustainable way to address the larger economic challenge was to simply focus on the health aspect. Put otherwise, crush the pandemic, and the economy will find its feet (with a little help). That is exactly what we are beginning to see in the US and the UK (despite cash handouts skewing the labour market in the former).Also read | Ten states gear up to import vaccines; bottlenecks remainGiven what’s happening in India, it is becoming clear that 2021-22 (or at least the first half of the financial year, and that’s in the best-case scenario) will not be the year of the great bounce-back everyone (including this columnist) expected.Back when those projections of double-digit economic growth in the year were made, the pandemic was under control (just around 10,000 cases on average across India), and the country had started vaccinating people (it launched its drive as early as January). But carelessness, complacency, poor science, wrong priorities, and a botched vaccine drive (compounded by stubbornness in correcting the course) have resulted in things spiralling out of control. It was almost as if Edward Murphy Jr (of the famous law) was writing the script.HT reported on Tuesday that around 80% of India’s population is living under some form of lockdown. That is likely to continue till at least the end of the month – and there is a high probability that more than half the country’s population continues to live that way till the middle of June. The first quarter then, is pretty much a washout, although the base effect (the economy contracted by almost a fourth in the first quarter of 2020-21) may mean it still ends up showing some growth.Through April, economists and analysts refused to revisit their projections of double-digit growth in India, but they will have to acknowledge the reality on the ground sometime soon (some have already begun doing so).India is definitely not going to show the 25%-plus growth in the April-June quarter that the Reserve Bank of India predicted not too long back.Also read | States can procure only 20 million Covid-19 jabs for 18+ in MayWill the second quarter be any better? It will likely be. With the learnings of the second wave behind them, state governments will insist on the continuation of non-pharmaceutical interventions such as the wearing of masks and social distancing, and they are also unlikely to allow large events. But things will not return to normal unless the majority of the population has been vaccinated. And that, given the country’s current vaccine strategy (there doesn’t seem to be one), the pace of vaccinations (over 1.9 million on average every day over the past week), and the supply situation (India will be short of vaccines for at least a few months, perhaps even longer), could take till early 2022.Until then, as I recently wrote in this space, states will have to be open to declaring statewide or more localised lockdowns every time there is a flare-up, which will be ever so often, especially given the emergence of more infectious variants of the Sars-CoV-2 virus that causes Covid-19.They will also have to place restrictions on movement and activities that will not bode well for business. I’m tempted to channel Burns via Wodehouse and speak about the best laid plans “gang aft agley”, only, in this case, there doesn’t seem to have been one – a plan, that is.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid19-what-you-need-to-know-today-101620769680965.html
12-05-2021||India||India may cross China as most populous sooner than thought||China’s population is growing at its slowest pace in decades, latest census data released on Tuesday showed, with the country adding only 72 million people in the past decade. The average annual growth rate was 0.53% over the last 10 years, down from 0.57% between 2000 and 2010, taking the population to 1.41 billion. The total population on the mainland stood at 1.41178 billion on November 1.The latest data puts China on course to be overtaken by India as the most populous country, which is expected to happen by the year 2025. India’s population last year was estimated by the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs at 1.38 billion, or 1.5% behind China.India has maintained a fertility rate of around 2.3, which indicates that its population may surpass China’s by 2023 or 2024, He Yafu, an independent demographer, told Chinese state media on Tuesday, earlier than the latest UN prediction.The population growth rate in China is the slowest since 1953, when the first census was carried out. The slump in the growth rate – despite Beijing withdrawing the one-child policy in 2016 after it was in force since the late 1970s – will add pressure on Beijing to incentivise childbearing as the most populous country deals with a rapidly ageing population and the resultant economic burden.The fresh census results showed that China’s “…population is not just declining but also its demographic structure is deteriorating with a growing aging population, will serve as an important reference for China’s population and economic policy adjustment as well as plans to put off retirement, which may come in the next year or two”, a state media report said.Ning Jizhe, head of China’s National Bureau of Statistics (NBS), said 12 million babies were born last year – a significant decrease from the 18 million in 2016 and 14.65 million in 2019.Ning, however, added that it was “still a considerable number”. Ning said a lower fertility rate is a natural result of China’s social and economic development.Also read | India shouldn’t copy China’s birth-control policies, say expertsThe median age of the Chinese population stood at 38.8 in 2020 compared to 38 in the US. By 2050, this gap is set to increase with China’s median age rising to 55-56 and the US’s to 44-45. The current median age of the Indian population is 29 years and it is expected to increase to 38 by 2050, giving the country a significant demographic advantage.China’s demographic situation is similar to that of Japan, South Korea, and some other developed countries that are facing the problem of an ageing and a dependent population. But it will have to deal with the reality that, unlike developed countries, China has not yet been able to generate similar levels of household wealth.The census found there has been a rapid shrinking of China’s labour force in the past decade while the ageing population continued to increase. The proportion of people aged between 15 and 59 was 894 million, down by 6.79 percentage points from the 2010 census.“The number of people aged 60 and above grew to 264 million, up from 177.6 million in the 2010 census, and the number of people aged 65 and above grew to 190 million, up from 118.8 million in the 2010 census,” the state-run tabloid Global Times reported, quoting the new data.Huang Wenzheng, a demography expert at the Beijing-based think tank Centre for China and Globalisation, said: “That (the census data) means the official number of the births every year for the past 10 years were mostly accurate. It also means the downward trend is more significant than what we expected in the recent years.”The two-child policy, which was implemented in 2016, has failed to make an impact on the low birth rates. “From the trend of population development in recent years, the population growth will continue to slow in the future,” NBS head Ning said, adding that China’s total population will remain at more than 1.4 billion in the near future.He Yafu, an independent demographer, told the Global Times that there is no doubt that China will “fully lift birth restrictions in the near future…likely to remove its family planning policy as early as this autumn during the sixth plenary session of the 19th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC)”.Fully lifting birth restrictions may not be enough to avert a fall in total population, or prevent China from becoming another Japan, demographers said, noting that Beijing should come up with more measures to encourage childbirth, such as subsidising couples who choose to have more than one baby.China conducted national censuses in 2010, 2000, 1990, 1982, 1964, and 1953.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-may-cross-china-as-most-populous-sooner-than-thought-101620769047136.html
12-05-2021||India||Covid-19 wave ebbing in 9 regions, shows data||The second national wave of the Covid-19 outbreak continues to take a toll on India, but its trajectory appears to be receding in at least six regions – Delhi, Maharashtra, Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh, Telangana and Uttar Pradesh – with cases and positivity rates seeing a steady drop in the past few weeks.Meanwhile, another three states – Bihar, Gujarat and Jharkhand – are exhibiting early signs of a plateau, according to data analysed by HT.To be sure, despite the relative recovery, several of these states remain among the worst-hit regions as districts there continue to report high volume of cases with respect to their populations.Districts in states such as Kerala, Karnataka, Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Delhi, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, and Uttarakhand are still seeing the highest rate of addition of new Covid-19 cases, and are likely facing most pressure on available resources, the data suggests.To analyse the outbreak, HT analysed data from the past month (between April 11 and May 10) in India’s 20 most populous states and Union territories, looking at two factors — new infections of Covid-19, and positivity rates. It also looked at district data compiled by How India Lives to narrow down on regions in the country where the virus remains most active.The analysis shows that while the national wave may be yet to peak, and that daily cases continue to grow in most states, some regions have started turning the corner in their battle against the onslaught of India’s second Covid-19 wave with clearer results set to be visible in the coming weeks if these trends persist.Experts say positivity rate is a crucial metric as it shows how widespread the virus is in the community. When coupled with increasing new cases, it indicates that the virus is spreading fast within the community.Maharashtra and Chhattisgarh, the two states that were the earliest epicentres of the second wave, are both the only states that have seen their weekly average positivity rate decline over the past month.In Maharashtra, the figure went from 25.3% for the week ending April 11 to 20.8% for the week ending May 10 – a drop of 4.6 percentage points, the highest in the country.In Chhattisgarh, the figure went from 23.4% to 22.1% in the same time period. While this number did not improve over an entire month in Delhi, Madhya Pradesh, Telangana and Uttar Pradesh, it has started dropping.Also read | States can procure only 20 million Covid-19 jabs for 18+ in MayIn Delhi, for instance, the average positivity rate has dropped 9.2 percentage points from a peak of 32.9%. In MP, it fell by 6.3 percentage points from a peak of 24%, while it fell 5.3 percentage points in UP from a peak of 16.8% and 1.7 percentage points in Telangana.However, the national average of weekly positivity rate has shown only a minor improvement – it fell from 22.8% from 22.5% in the past month.During the Union health ministry’s weekly briefing on Tuesday, senior officials listed states where cases have shown a plateauing or declining trend – a majority of these states overlapped with HT’s findings.“A very recent trend has emerged where we can see marginal improvement in the country’s Covid-19 numbers in the past few days. We have noted a decline in new infections and deaths in the country in the past two-three days… and while this is too early to establish a clear trend, it is important that we analyse this and continue with our Covid management strategies on state and district levels to make sure numbers continue to go down,” said Lav Agarwal, joint secretary in the health ministry.Delhi has reported the most progress in terms of average weekly new cases per million population – average new cases dropped from a peak of 1,277 infections per million residents a day to 888. However, despite the improvement, the Capital remains among the regions reporting the most cases in the country when the population is factored in.Kerala (1,079 new cases per million in the last week) is the only region among those analysed that is seeing more infections in the last week. In Maharashtra, there have been 430 new cases per million in the past week, down from a peak of 536 cases per million around two weeks ago (week ending April 24). In Chhattisgarh, the recovery is particularly evident -- average cases fell from 543 new infections per million a day to 86 in the past two weeks.Watch | Covid update: WHO classifies ‘variant of concern’; Delhi runs out of Covaxin?﻿In UP, the cases have halved on this metric, from 155 cases per million (week ending April 27) to 76 in the past week. In MP, average cases have dropped from a peak of 159 infections per million a day to 86, while in Telanagana the figure fell from a peak of 216 case per million to 117 in the last 10 days.On average, there have been 291 new cases per million residents in the country for the week ending Monday. This number has only marginally shifted from peak levels (294 cases per million on Sunday). Population estimates for the analysis were based on 2020 projections by the Census of India.Three other regions have started exhibiting signs of recovery. In Bihar, the positivity rate fell from a peak of 15.3% to 12.9% in the past week, while average new cases fell from a peak of 119 cases per million to 93. In Jharkhand, the corresponding figures changed from 16.8% to 5.6% and from 169 per million to 111. In Gujarat, these numbers were 9.2% and 4.8%, and 211 per million and 118. In these three states, however, the changes were all around the past week, so it may be too early to say the numbers are on a consistent decline.At the district level, when looking at the number of new cases added on average per million population in the past week , of the 631 districts in the 2011 census (after merging Delhi and Goa districts), 19 reported over 1,000 cases per million per day on average in the week ending May 9, the latest date for which district-level data has been compiled by How India Lives.Forty districts – 23 of them in Kerala (7 districts), Maharashtra (7), Karnataka (5), and Haryana (4) – reported 700 to 1,000 cases per million every day on average in the week ending May 9. Another 87 districts – over half of them in Maharashtra (13), Karnataka (12), Chhattisgarh (9), Andhra Pradesh (9), and Himachal Pradesh (7) – reported 400 to 700 cases per million.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid19-wave-ebbing-in-9-regions-shows-data-101620762974889.html
12-05-2021||India||Allow more pharma firms to make vaccines: Delhi CM Kejriwal to Centre||The shortage in Delhi at present is not of Intensive Care Unit (ICU) beds or oxygen supply but of coronavirus vaccines, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal said on Tuesday, urging the Centre to engage more pharmaceutical companies to ramp up production.Kejriwal called for a national scheme to vaccinate the entire population of the country in the next few months and said that “unless every Indian is vaccinated, we cannot win the war against Covid-19”.“Some states are struggling to widen the vaccine drive because of this shortage. Vaccine shortage is a major challenge now,” he said at a press briefing.According to the chief minister, the two companies producing vaccines in India are capable of manufacturing 60-70 million doses a month, and at this rate, it would take over two years to vaccinate the country’s entire population. “Such a long span is likely to witness multiple waves, which would lead to more deaths. So, it is important to take up vaccine production on a war footing.”In an affidavit filed in the Supreme Court, the Union government over the weekend said it expects 85 million doses to be manufactured by Serum Institute of India and Bharat Biotech, the makers of the two doses approved in India in January. Both these firms are expected to take their cumulative capacities to over 150 million by July.Kejriwal separately wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi and called for ensuring the mass production of vaccines.Also read | States can procure only 20 million Covid-19 jabs for 18+ in May“The second wave of Covid is very fatal and the disease has reached the villages with many lives lost… There is a need to vaccinate all the citizens as soon as possible... Presently only two companies are manufacturing vaccines in India. Providing vaccines to the whole country through two companies only is not possible,” said Kejriwal in his letter to Modi, a copy of which HT has seen.“Every company in the country that has the capacity of safe production should manufacture the vaccines… The government can terminate the monopoly on vaccine production through the Patent law…”In its health bulletin on Tuesday, the Delhi government said around 4.02 million vaccine doses were administered till Monday -- of which 3.11 million were first doses.Pune-based Serum Institute of India produces Covishield and Hyderabad-based Bharat Biotech Covaxin.At the briefing, Kejriwal said the Centre should take the vaccine formula from the two companies and give it to the other companies which are capable of producing safe vaccines. “In such tough times, the Centre has the powers to take such decisions…,” said Kejriwal.Kejriwal said the vaccination turnout is high and all arrangements are in place and that they were currently administering 125,000 doses per day. “...we want to scale this up to 300,000 doses per day. Our aim is to ensure that the entire adult population of Delhi is vaccinated in three months. But, in Delhi, we have only a few days stock of vaccines left.”He cited the shortage of Personal Protection Equipment (PPE) kits during the first wave of the pandemic in India. “Imagine if only two companies had the right to produce PPE kits, we would have faced a major shortage of PPE kits too...”Kejriwal said India has top pharma companies and the best scientists. “I am sure that they will cooperate in vaccine production. A fraction of the profit made by the other companies could be given to the original two companies as royalty...”In a tweet, former Union health secretary Sujatha Rao asked why the government was not invoking its powers to speed up production. “Provision of compulsory licensing was exactly for these conditions. Imposing it can help us and increase production. Why is the health of the pharma industry more important than of the people, someone explain?”Compulsory licensing allows the government to grant permission to other manufacturers to start making a patented product without permission from the company holding the patent, although pharma company executives said that intellectual property issues are not the main hurdle with vaccine production -- companies need to transfer technology, source the adequate raw material and include training that is consistent with the production of a particular vaccine||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/allow-more-pharma-firms-to-make-vaccines-delhi-cm-kejriwal-to-centre-101620761169256.html
12-05-2021||India||States can procure only 20 million Covid-19 jabs for 18+ in May||State governments across India will altogether be given 20 million doses to inoculate their 18-44 age group population from the roughly 85 million vaccines doses expected to be produced this month, according to a formula shared by the Union government with the Supreme Court, in which the Centre said it has fixed quotas even for doses that states need to directly procure from vaccine makers.The Union government has said that these 20 million doses will be sent to states based on how many people they have in the 18-44 age group in order to ensure doses are distributed in an equitable manner, but some states have complained that their allocation is inadequate.“It is submitted that though the states are procuring vaccines from the manufacturers, the central government has, in consultation with the vaccine manufacturers, determined the pro-rata population of each state in the age group of 18-44 (years) and each state will procure only that quantity so that there is no disparity in availability of vaccines between the states inter-se, either based upon difference in their bargaining power or otherwise,” said the Centre’s response to the Supreme Court filed over the weekend.The affidavit listed the allocation for the month of May, and added that this supply pertained only to the doses states were directly procuring, with a separate formula is in place for how the Centre distributes the doses it acquires from the vaccine makers.India’s coronavirus vaccination drive follows two tracks: the Union government offers free doses meant for those 45 years of age and above; then there is the acquisition by state governments and private hospitals to give doses for any group they choose to cater to.Also read | More than 5,000 soldiers battle Covid-19 in hospitals, 5-fold jump in 3 weeksThe Union government has made it mandatory for vaccine makers in India – at present, the two shots being used widely are both made in India – to keep 50% of their doses for the central supply, while the remaining will be evenly split between private procurers and state governments.The 20 million doses allocated this month for direct acquisition by state governments are the only ones to be offered for free for those under the age of 45. The rest, ostensibly another 20 million, will be shots that will be paid for. India has roughly 595 million people between the ages of 18 and 44, according to the government’s Technical Group of Population Projections.Out of the 50% quota allotted to each state, the division is made evenly. In other words, from out of the 50% allotted to the state, half will go to the state’s public channel [calculated on pro-rata basis based upon the population of age group of 18-44 years] and the balance will go to the private sector based upon the contracts between private sector and vaccine manufacturers, according to the Centre’s affidavit, which was in compliance with a Supreme Court order to spell out the vaccination policy.“In vaccinating the 18-44 category, the central government’s role is to ensure equitable vaccine distribution among states; it should not be the case that a bulk of doses reaches only a particular state, and another one that needs more is left waiting. Since all states need vaccines, we have to see to it that all states get it, and to ensure that the Centre regularly discusses with states and advises accordingly,” said Lav Agarwal, joint secretary, Union health ministry. Agarwal did not clarify how the pro-rata population estimate was calculated.According to a government official aware of the matter, population projections are likely be based on data sets that includes report on population projections by National Commission on Population.The Union government’s affidavit said that it expects vaccine production to go up in the next couple of months, with Bharat Biotech producing up to 55 million doses by July and Sputnik V’s manufacturers contributing 12 million by the same month. While the government did not give a figure for the scale-up in Covishield’s production by SII, the company’s CEO said during media interviews that the monthly capacity was set to go up to 100 million by July.In recent days, several states have raised concerns over the shortage of vaccines. Maharashtra health minister Rajesh Tope said on Tuesday the state will need to suspend the drive for those under the age of 45 and divert some of the doses from this category for the older age groups in order to meet the second dose demand.Watch | Covid update: WHO classifies ‘variant of concern’; Delhi runs out of Covaxin?﻿In Delhi, Aam Aadmi Party MLA Atishi said 125 centres where Covaxin was being given to the under-45 age group will be shut since the city has run out of doses. Later, at a press conference, Delhi’s deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia accused the Centre of creating a shortage and “forcing” state governments to invite global tenders.At least nine states have said they will float global tenders for Covid-19 vaccines.According to data compiled by science analytics company Airfinity, several vaccine makers have already committed supplies equalling or exceeding their projected production for the year. Among the prominent vaccine makers that still have capacity are Pfizer-BioNTech (800 million doses), Novavax (300 million doses) and Gamaleya Institute (1.43 billion doses).Moderna, Johnson & Johnson and AstraZeneca appear to have already done deals for more than what they are expected to produce through the year.Union health ministry officials said the focus of the vaccination drive from its perspective remained on the over-45 group since they were most vulnerable to Covid-19. States have been urged to “ensure all beneficiaries who have taken the first dose are prioritised for the second doses”, the ministry said on Tuesday following a meeting with states.The Centre’s affidavit also identified expected vaccine production numbers for May: Serum Institute of India, which makes Covishield, was expected to produce 65 million doses, and Bharat Biotech, which makes Covaxin, is expected to churn out 20 million doses.At an aggregate level, this number appears to be inadequate if India were to regain its peak vaccination rate of around 4 million doses a day seen in mid-April. In the most recent seven-day period, however, as supplies ran short and a resurgent wave of infections forced people indoors, this number has come down to about 2 million.Also read | Amplify govt message on Covid-19: Centre tells statesAt specific levels, too, the allotments made by the Union government suggested states will not be able to sustain the pace of vaccinations in the 18-44 age group. According to the Delhi government, in the 10 days since the drive began, 365,262 people in the younger age group have been given doses (including those by private hospitals).The Centre’s allotment for Delhi government for the month of May stood at 360,530. Even if an equal number was to be augmented by private hospitals, as per the rate seen till May 10, the shots for those in the 18-44 group for the month may run out by the third week, and overall vaccination throughout May is likely to fall short of the projected 1 million doses.According to the Co-WIN dashboard, 173.7 million doses of coronavirus vaccines have been administered to people in India, of which 136.5 million are first doses. Among these, 18.9 million have been given to people younger than the age of 45.“Even though effectiveness of vaccines in disrupting transmission cycle is still not fully known, we do know that it reduces disease severity, and that will eventually also help in breaking the transmission cycle. The more vaccine, especially make in India ones, are available, better it is for the Covid-19 vaccination programme,” said Dr K Srinath Reddy, founder, Public Health Foundation of India||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/states-can-procure-only-20-million-covid-19-jabs-for-18-in-may-101620760611347.html

Now, it has been instructed to float the tender and to complete the process within 7 days,” Narayan added.The order comes at a time when the state is facing shortages of vaccines that has added to the mounting challenges of the BS Yediyurappa-led administration in containing the surge of Covid-19 infections.Karnataka recorded 39,510 new infections in the 24 hours on Tuesday that takes the total number of active cases to 587,452.The positivity rate stood at 33.99%, according to the daily bulletin of the state health department.Bengaluru reported 15,879 new infections, showing a decline for the third straight day and increasing hopes that the spike is likely showing signs of halting.The state reported 480 new fatalities of which 259 were in Bengaluru.Narayan added that the state will procure 1,00,000 pulse oximeters and these will be distributed to all the districts and taluks. He added that 1million of Ivermectin, the tablet which is required to treat the infected has been procured and the supply of this begins on May 14. It has been also asked to further procure 2.5 million tablets and it should be made available in all hospitals across the state. 3.5 million zinc tablets and 10 million colchicine tablets will be procured and will be made available in all district hospitals, taluk hospitals, PHCs, and community health centers, Narayan said.He added that there were 1.5 million RAT kits are in stocks that would last for another week and directed to procure 3.7 million more such kits. However, Karnataka has seen a sharp decline in testing over the last few days, which goes against the measures to contain the surge in the south Indian state. The Yediyurappa-led administration has announced lockdown-like measures across the state that came into effect on May 10 and will remain in force till at least May 24.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ktaka-to-float-global-tender-for-20mn-vaccine-doses-101620760587740.html

All the Muslim employees were suspended but reinstated later.One of the call operators, on the condition of anonymity, said callers were more keen on knowing their names before narrating their troubles. “It is only after we share our names that they continue with the calls. It is really unfair to those minorities (Muslims) who have been working as hard as we are,” the operator said. Likewise, volunteers are also living under fear ever since the events at the south war room.“The communalisation of civic work was done very blatantly. The MP targeted Muslim employees at the centre and has refused to tender an apology. The volunteer group that I work with has several Muslim members and it is a matter of concern for us. We have several members who help bury and cremate bodies across religious lines. We have concerns over these developments,”a volunteer at the war room, who did not wish to be named, said.Another volunteer shared an incident in which he was denied a refill of the oxygen cylinder after he refused to identify himself. “I cannot be sure if they did not let me refill because of my identity. The reason they gave was that only government agencies were allowed refills from there, which was not true. We didn’t have time to fight since we had to provide oxygen urgently,” the volunteer said, preferring anonymity.Officials in the war room were not available for a comment at the time of filing this report.Meanwhile, a complaint was filed with HSR layout police station was filed against a Muslim data operator, Babu Sadiq, for alleged negligence that resulted in the death of a Covid-19 patients. In his complaint on May 5, a day after MP Surya courted controversy, Dr Mahesh Kumar, who was in charge of Anekal taluk war room in the outskirts of Bengaluru city, alleged that Sadiq allotted two regular beds and an HDU (high dependency unit) bed in three different hospitals while the patient had sought an ICU (intensive care unit) bed. While Sadiq was suspended from duty, police claimed that the employee at the war room had not committed any crime and had acted in the interest of the deceased’s family. “We didn’t find anything criminal in what he did. In fact, he acted in the best interest of the family. He told the family that the ICU was not available, and the family insisted they were ready to take the regular bed, saying they would convince the hospital to provide them with an ICU one (later),” an HSR Layout police officer said, preferring anonymity.As per investigation, the family repeatedly called the employee, seeking a normal bed in another hospital where they could try for an ICU later. “Even there, they didn’t get any bed. Finally, he was able to find an HDU bed but the patient had passed away by then. These details could have been verified had the war room called the patient. However, after the incident at the south war room (suspension of 17 Muslim employees), the war room officials didn’t want to take a chance,” the officer added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/insecurity-fear-grip-muslim-volunteers-after-surya-s-remarks-101620760467679.html
12-05-2021||India||10-day lockdown in Telangana from today||The Telangana government on Tuesday announced imposition of a 10-day lockdown across the state, beginning Wednesday, to contain the spread of Covid-19. A decision to this effect was taken at an emergency cabinet meeting convened by chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao in the afternoon. The decision was immediately conveyed to the state high court, which has been hearing a batch of petitions over the pandemic in the state. The decision comes within a week after the chief minister declared that there was no question of imposition of lockdown in the state on the ground that it would lead to collapse of the state’s economy and severely hamper the state’s attempt to procure paddy this season. According to an official release from the chief minister’s office, the decision to impose lockdown was taken following suggestions from sections of people in view of the intensity of the pandemic. The lockdown would be in force from 10 am on May 12 to 6 am on May 22. There would be relaxation in the lockdown for four hours every day – from 6 am to 10 am -- to enable the people to buy essential commodities. “All the shops and business establishments would be open during this four-hour period. For the remaining 20 hours, the lockdown would be strictly implemented. Only essential services would be allowed during the lockdown,” the official release said. The state cabinet will meet again on May 20 to review the situation and take a call on whether or not the lockdown should be extended. The cabinet decided to give exemption to certain activities from the lockdown. Works related to agriculture production and allied sectors, agriculture machinery, maintenance of rice mills, transport of paddy, supply to Food Corporation of India (FCI) warehouses, fertiliser and seed shops, and seed making units will continue during the lockdown period. The cabinet also decided to continue paddy procurement without hurdles during the lockdown in the interests of farmers. Permission would be given to pharmaceutical companies, medical equipment-manufacturing units, medical distributors, medical shops, all types of medical and health services and government and private hospitals to run their activity during the lockdown. Employees and labourers working in these units would be given special passes for attending to their duties. There would be no restrictions on essential services, such as drinking water supply, sanitation in rural and urban areas, power generation, distribution and their allied services, transportation of goods on national highways, petrol and diesel pumps on national highways, warehousing and cold storage activities, and print and electronic media. Exemption would also be given to employment guarantee scheme works. State government offices would run with 33 per cent staff. Banks and ATM centres would run without restrictions. The cabinet decided to allow marriages with prior permission, subject to the maximum attendance of 40 members. For funerals, a maximum of 20 persons would be allowed. The cabinet decided to set up checkposts on the borders of Telangana. Public transport, such as RTC buses and metro trains, would be available from 6 am to 10 am. Ration shops would be allowed to run during this four-hour period. Supply of LPG cylinders would continue as usual. The cabinet decided to close down cinema halls, swimming pools, clubs, gyms, amusement parks and sports stadia during the lockdown period. “The director general of police has been instructed to strictly implement the lockdown following the Covid guidelines,” the official release said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/10day-lockdown-in-telangana-from-today-101620760408830.html
12-05-2021||India||HC pulls up govt over 2nd dose of vaccines, asks state to come up with a road map||Bengaluru: The Karnataka high court on Tuesday pulled up the state and Central government on its plans to provide the second dose of vaccines to those above 45 years of age.The HC bench comprising Chief Justice Abhay Oka and Justice Aravind Kumar subsequently ordered the state to come out with a road map for completing the vaccinations. “We hope and trust that if both the governments don’t take serious note of the desperate situation of vaccination and if a greater number of vaccines are not procured, the very object of vaccination will be frustrated. It may have a cascading effect,” the order said. During the proceedings, the Karnataka government informed the court that it is stopping the first dose, to provide second doses to those above the age of 45 years. However, the court quoting numbers questioned the availability of the vaccines. “Only 9,00,000 doses available. 1.6 million people need a second dose immediately. Forget about the 18-44 age group. They can’t even give a second dose. For people above 45 years, how will state give the second dose,” the bench pointed out. The Bench further added that the second dose of Covaxin should be taken within four weeks while asking about the implications of the delay in giving the second dose. “As per the target of 10.7million, 7.2 million have been given the first dose and over 1.1 million have been given the second dose. Hence, it is obvious that if the present scenario continues, the first dose cannot be given to front-line workers and 18-44 years…If the present scenario continues, the entire vaccination drive will be completely ineffective,” the bench said. Talking about the availability of oxygen, the court also pointed out that despite the Centre telling the court that the state’s oxygen quota is being increased from 965 MT to 1200 MT, no document has been placed on record to prove this said allocation. “The court, therefore, proceeded to direct the state government to place on record its daily requirement of oxygen from May 5 till May 11 and quantum of oxygen actually procured. The state government should also place on record projected requirement of state for at least for 1 week from tomorrow (Wednesday),” the HC directed. The court also made an observation about the incidents of the police excesses that were reported on the first day of the second lockdown. “Police excesses should be avoided, and people must co-operate with the government. If people are not cooperating, take them to the nearest police station,” the bench said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hc-pulls-up-govt-over-2nd-dose-of-vaccines-asks-state-to-come-up-with-a-road-map-101620760348215.html
12-05-2021||India||Junior doctors threaten strike in Telangana over pay hike||Hyderabad: Junior resident doctors in various Telangana government hospitals have threatened to go on a strike if their demand for a 15 per cent hike in salaries, among others, are not met within two weeks.A notice to this effect was served by Telangana Junior Doctors Association (TJUDA) to the state medical and health department on Monday. The threat to observe a strike also comes at a time when several hospitals are struggling to tackle the Covid-19 surge. “We have given two weeks’ time to the government to fulfil our demands which have been pending for over a year. We shall go on a strike after May 25 and boycott all services, including emergency medical services,” TJUDA president Vasari Naveen Reddy told HT. According to Reddy, junior resident doctors are paid a monthly salary of ₹44,000 in the first year, ₹46,000 in the second and ₹48,000 in the third year of service in various teaching hospitals. “As per the contract, we have to get a 15 per cent hike in salary every year. The last time we got a hike was in 2019 and it was due for revision in January 2020. During last year’s coronavirus pandemic, the government agreed for the pay revision and the file was approved at all levels. It is awaiting clearance from chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao since the last five months,” Reddy said.A similar increase of 15 per cent in salary for senior resident doctors is also pending with the chief minister. “We ran from pillar to post to get the file approved but there has been no response from the government. Hence, as a last resort, we have decided to suspend work after duly giving a two-week notice to the government,” Reddy added. TJUDA also demanded the immediate payment of a 10 per cent incentive as promised by the chief minister to all healthcare workers during the pandemic last year. Another demand put forth by TJUDA is to give priority in treatment to healthcare workers and their family members who are affected by Covid-19.“In several government hospitals, healthcare workers and their family members are not able to get a bed for treatment. The Nizam’s Institute of Medical Sciences (NIMS) is always occupied with limited beds and we have urged the government to increase the bed capacity. We want the government to issue a circular for free treatment of healthcare workers and their family members,” the association president said. The association also demanded insurance be provided to medical students up to the level of post-graduates, in accordance with an earlier order. “An ex-gratia of ₹50 lakh for doctors and ₹25 lakh for nurse and supporting staff who died on duty that was announced (in September last year by the chief minister) has not been implemented so far,” he added. Reddy admitted that suspending work at this hour of crisis was not appropriate. “But there is no option left for us as the government has turned a deaf ear to our problems despite repeated reminders. Anyway, we have not resorted to any lightning strike, but have given a two-week notice to the government. If it is concerned for the people, it can solve our demands in the next two weeks,” he said.Director of Medical Education Dr Ramesh Reddy could not be reached for a comment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/junior-doctors-threaten-strike-in-telangana-over-pay-hike-101620760288320.html
12-05-2021||India||Andhra CM writes to Modi, forms panel to check oxygen supply||Hyderabad: Taking serious note of the death of 11 Covid-19 patients due to disruption in oxygen supply at a government hospital in Chittoor district, Andhra Pradesh chief minister Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy on Tuesday constituted a three-member committee of IAS officers to ensure uninterrupted procurement of the live-saving gas for the state.Besides this, in a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi later in the day, the chief minister requested the Centre to increase its allocation of liquid medical oxygen (LMO) for the state. On Monday night, 11 Covid-19 patients died of asphyxiation after the oxygen supply was disrupted due to a brief delay in arrival of tankers from Sriperumbudur in Tamil Nadu to state-run Sri Venkata Ramnarayan Ruia Hospital in Tirupati, Chittoor district, officials said. The chief minister, who held a high-level meeting on Monday to review the incident and take stock of the oxygen situation, said Andhra Pradesh was procuring the gas from Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and Odisha to meet its needs.Reddy announced the constitution of a panel of three senior IAS officers – special chief secretary (industries and commerce) Karikal Valaven, principal secretary (skill development and training) G Ananta Ramu and chairman of AP Pollution Control Board A K Parida – to look into the supply of oxygen from these states. “Valaven will take care of oxygen supplies from Tamil Nadu, Anata Ramu from Karnataka and Parida from Odisha. They will focus on enhancing the supply of oxygen from these states and ensure there is no time lag in its distribution to all government hospitals in the state. The committee will function from Wednesday,” an official release quoted the chief minister as saying.In his letter to Modi, Reddy urged the Centre to increase the allocation of LMO from the present 590 tonnes to 910 tonnes, besides 20 LMO tankers to meet the growing demand of hospitals in the state amid a massive surge in cases. The chief minister said out of the present allocation, 210 tonnes of LMO was allotted from Orissa which was around 1,400 km from Rayalaseema region, resulting in delay in supply. Besides, the state was currently drawing 35 tonnes from St Gobain, Chennai and 25 MT from INOX, Sriperumbudur in Tamil Nadu.“The delay in supply from Sriperumbudur led to the tragic incident in Tirupati hospital,” Jagan said. The chief minister announced an ex gratia of ₹10 lakh each for the kin of the 11 Covid-19 patients who died on Monday. “We shall reach out to each of these families and extend all possible help to them,” he said. The deceased were identified as S Fazulullah (41) from Kalikiri, Mohd Basha (47) from Tirupati, Devender Reddy (58) from Yerravaripalem, P Ghouse Basha (37) from Punganur, Venkata Subbaiah (28) from Rajampet, Tanuja Rani (48) from Gajula Manyam, K Babu (55) from Mangalam, D Shahith (27) from Varadayapalem, Bhuvaneshwar Babu (36) from Chittoor, Rajamma (71) from Vallamedu in Nellore and S Mohammad (72) from Tirupati. While the chief minister has already ordered a probe into the incident, no case has been registered so far.During the review meeting, Reddy directed that war rooms be created in every district to monitor the oxygen supply to various hospitals. “Whenever there is an SOS from any hospital, authorities should immediately respond and inform about the same to higher officials. The entire exercise should be closely monitored by district collectors,” he said. Jagan also asked officials to see whether there were any oxygen storage facilities in the districts, including in industries. “We have already taken the help of various agencies, including the Navy, to ensure timely supply of oxygen tankers to the districts. Sufficient care should be taken to ensure oxygen supply even in Covid Care Centres,” he said. The chief minister said the state medical and health department has already started the purchase of oxygen concentrators which would be supplied to all hospitals shortly. He asked hospital authorities to maintain oxygen supply pipes from time to time with the help of technical staff to ensure proper supply at the regulated pressure.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/andhra-cm-writes-to-modi-forms-panel-to-check-oxygen-supply-101620760228174.html

However, fatality rates remain high as India’s IT capital accounted for 259 out of the total 480 deaths reported across the state. Karnataka and its capital Bengaluru are among the worst impacted regions in the country. On Tuesday, the state reported 39,510 infections, taking the active caseload to 587452.Bengaluru, which attracts migrants from across the state and country, has seen a significant number of them return to their home towns during last year’s lockdown. Although some of them returned late last year, the imminent restrictions over the second wave and accompanying restrictions has cast a cloud of uncertainty over them.To make matters worse, Bengaluru has been reeling under acute shortages of hospital beds, oxygen, life-saving medicines and even space in crematoriums due to the surge.The state government issued notices to Pharmaceutical majors, Cipla and Jubilant to immediately fulfil the supply obligation of Remdesivir vials as allotted by the centre.The two companies have been given a day to supply the quantity commitments of Remdesivir as allotted by the Centre.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/free-meals-for-poor-at-indira-canteens-in-b-luru-till-may-24-yediyurappa-101620760227674.html
12-05-2021||India||K’taka Covid surge raging since May 1||Bengaluru Since May 1, Karnataka has recorded 490,051 new covid-19 infections that accounts for over 83% of the active caseload of 587452 which indicates the rapid spread of the virus in the southern state that is among the worst impacted by the pandemic.The spiralling surge threatens to put Karnataka as the most impacted region in the country if the same growth rate continues, data shows, which could add to the mounting troubles of the state and administration who are yet to get a grip on the deteriorating health crisis.Karnataka has the highest positivity rate in the country over the last one week at an average of 30.9% as against 23.8% in Delhi and 20.8% in Maharashtra. The national average during the same period is 22.3%, according to data compiled by the Hindustan Times.Karnataka has the second highest change in active cases since May 1 at 26%, just behind Tamil Nadu which recorded 51% but higher than Delhi at 38% and Maharashtra that has shown a degrowth of -16%, data shows.From the beginning of the month (May 1), Karnataka has seen at least 4333 deaths with fatality rates averaging over 1%, which is just 0.1% below the national average. Most of the surge in Karnataka has come from its biggest city and power centre, Bengaluru, that has accounted for 226,779 new infections since the beginning of the month. Bengaluru has the highest number of active cases in the country, even though there are indications of plateauing of cases in India’s IT capital, if data from the last few days is anything to go by.The sudden surge has sent the health crisis in Karnataka into a downward spiral, beating any estimates or preparedness--or the lack of it--as several people continue to lose their lives either due to the severity of the disease, or worse, shortage of oxygen or life-saving medicines and worse still, inability to find hospital beds for treatment.Karnataka chief minister BS Yediyurappa on Monday directed officials to increase preparedness for the imminent third wave. But his administration’s inability to contain the surge despite warnings in November by the government-appointed technical advisory committee (TAC) has come under severe criticism from all quarters.On Tuesday, Yediyurappa said that there were over 840 persons who have remained in hospitals for over 20 days which had blocked beds for more serious patients.“This way they are staying here (hospital) unncessarily and instead of going home and taking treatment, they remain at hospitals and serious patients are not getting the opportunity to get beds,” Yediyurappa told reporters in Bengaluru.He said that the total number of beds have increased from 3000 on April 1 to around 12299 currently.But the situation in Bengaluru is slightly more complicated. Several individuals and other volunteer groups have been helping covid-19 infected persons secure beds, medicine, oxygen and even cremations as the covid infrastructure in the state collapses.Bengaluru, also known as India’s IT capital, has recorded at least 2199 deaths in May alone, that has flooded crematoriums, forcing the state to even look at erstwhile landfill sites to cremate those who have lost the battle to the virus.The state’s vaccination drive has also not gone according to plan, data shows, indicating that it was falling short of its own target of 300,000 inoculations every day by over 50% at least.There was a marginal uptick in the daily vaccinations as 126806 persons got their shots on Tuesday till 3.30 pm.The state has so far vaccinated 10759572 persons. However, only 2222325 have got both doses which accounts for 3.4% of the total population of the state, estimated around 6.5 crores.While almost all the focus remains on Bengaluru, the situation in other districts of the state, where healthcare infrastructure is far more inadequate, increases and adds to concerts if these regions will also witness its local systems collapse.Tumakuru, Mysuru, Ballari, Dakshina Kannada, Uttara Kannada, Shivamogga and Udupi are among the worst affected districts in the state, data shows.These districts are reporting higher fatalities as well.“Fatality rates are high in some districts and we are finding out reasons for this. Early detection and treatment is the key to recovery and preventing casualties. The positivity rate in the state is 33.09% and our aim is to bring it down to 5%,” K Sudhakar, Karnataka’s health, family welfare and medical education minister said on Tuesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ktaka-covid-surge-raging-since-may-1-101620760168723.html
12-05-2021||India||Positivity rate in 42% of total districts higher than national average: ICMR||As high as 42% of the country’s 733 districts are reporting a Covid-19 test positivity rate of more than the national average of about 21%, officials said on Tuesday, underscoring the need for containment efforts to be further tightened across the country.At least 26 states are showing a case positivity rate of 15% and above; six states are reporting between 5 and 15%, and only four states currently have a positivity rate of 5% or less,lower than the World Health Organisation-defined threshold for an outbreak to be considered as under control. The positivity rate is the proportion of positive samples among those tested in a day.“India is facing a massive surge of Covid-19 cases… and the national positivity rate is around 20-21%. And about 42% of the districts, which is about 310, are reporting more than the national average,” said Dr Balram Bhargava, director general, Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), during the Covid-19 media briefing on Tuesday.“If you look at the India numbers, then we find high case positivity rate of 25% and above in 9 states, and about 10 states have the case positivity rate between 20 and 25%. Government of India is in constant touch with these states to look at effective ways through which disease transmission can be curtailed,” said Lav Agarwal, joint secretary, Union health ministry.Among the top 5 states in terms of high case positivity rate are Goa (49.6%), Puducherry (42.8%), West Bengal (34.4%), Haryana (34.3%), and Karnataka (32.4%).Also read | States can procure only 20 million Covid-19 jabs for 18+ in MayAccording to experts in the government, early testing, isolation, and home-based care is the key to break the disease transmission cycle.The country’s RT-PCR testing—the gold standard to detect Covid-19— capacity is 1.6 million per day, and rapid antigen testing capacity is around 1.7 million tests per day, the official added. There are about 2,520 laboratories across the country doing Covid-19 testing.“The laboratories have been working literally 24x7 to meet the testing demand. Despite infection among lab staff, test performance is still being maintained. In April-May we are doing on an average of about 16-20 lakh RT-PCR and Rapid Antigen Test (RAT) combined. We have recently come out with a revised Covid-19 testing advisory. Sometimes we have to wait for the results so that is a bit of a problem, and that is why we have come out with the revised advisory, and given it to all the states also,” said Dr Bhargava.The official said the ICMR has done three things to cope with the current wave: rationalise RT-PCR testing to meet the excessive demand; Covid-19 tests approved by reputed global agencies have been accorded marketing permission by Drugs Controller General of India, VG Somani; and RAT (rapid antigen) testing has been increased for early detection, isolation and home care.Bhargava also mentioned that ICMR was exploring home based testing solutions to detect Covid-19.Experts say that RAT is good at detecting positive cases, and can be deployed to test symptomatic individuals for Covid-19.“During high case load that we are seeing now, RAT can be deployed to get faster results, which is what is the need of the hour. We cannot afford to wait for days for a test report to arrive. So, sooner a positive person is isolated, the better it is in curtailing the chain of transmission. In fact, those who get symptoms should simply isolate themselves, and not wait for the test report to come,” said Jugal Kishore, head, community medicine department, Safdarjung Hospital.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/positivity-rate-in-42-of-total-districts-higher-than-national-average-icmr-101620760168195.html
12-05-2021||India||SC to hear Centre’s Char Dham road project plea tomorrow||The Supreme Court on Tuesday showed urgency to decide the fate of the Char Dham road expansion project after the Centre cited “national security” concerns to complete the project involving three strategic roads leading to the international border with China.A vacation bench of Justices Vineet Saran and Dinesh Maheshwari agreed to hear the matter on Thursday and asked Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, appearing for the Centre, to submit a compilation of all relevant government notifications and court orders needed to decide the case.In September last year, the Supreme Court had directed the width of the road to be 5.5 metre based on a minority report of a 26-member High Powered Committee (HPC). This width was fixed as per a 2018 notification issued by the Ministry of Road, Transport and Highways (MoRTH). Later, the ministry amended its notification and filed an application in the top court against its September 8, 2020 order.The Ministry of Defence too had filed a separate application in December last year supporting the MoRTH. It requested the court to allow the road width to be increased to 7 metre (or 7.5 metre where there is a raised kerb) to facilitate movement of heavy vehicles carrying troops, self-propelled artillery and various machinery on each carriageway of the roads. The Char Dham expansion projects involved three strategic roads: 281-kilometre long Rishikesh to Mana (NH-58), 231-km Rishikesh to Gangotri (NH-94, 108) and 162-km Tanakpur to Pithoragarh (NH-125). The Centre had come prepared to argue the case on Tuesday but a request for adjournment was moved by NGO Citizens for Green Doon, which has opposed the road expansion by raising environmental concerns. Appearing for the NGO, senior advocate Colin Gonsalves submitted to the court that several persons in his office and in the NGO assisting him in the case were infected with Covid-19 and requested the matter to be heard after three weeks.Attorney General KK Venugopal, also appearing for the Centre, did not oppose the adjournment but informed the court about the urgency of the matter as heavy trucks and army vehicles use these roads to reach Chinese border.SG Mehta vehemently opposed the petitioner’s request for adjournment, saying, “This is a question of national security. These are roads on Indo-China border and work cannot stop.”The bench appreciated the urgency expressed by the Centre and refused to adjourn the matter by three weeks. Instead, the court said, “It’s about the border roads. Attorney General has already made a statement. We will hear it (on Thursday).” However, the bench wished to know if there was a stay operating against further work involving the project.Gonsalves told the court that the road expansion work had progressed despite the September 2020 order. Meanwhile, the Supreme Court had in December 2020 asked the HPC to consider the latest applications filed by MoRTH and Ministry of Defence and submit a report. This report prepared by HPC on December 31, 2020 gave approval for the Char Dham project roads to have a double-lane carriageway width of 7 metres, as desired by the Centre and army.However, the HPC chairman in February this year wrote to the Supreme Court that the recent disaster in the Rishiganga Valley exposed the “vulnerability and disaster proneness of the region”. This is bound to increase with extensive disturbances such as deforestation, slope cutting, blasting, tunneling, damming of rivers associated with the road expansion work. Several chronic landslide-prone locations and stretches where the slope stability is precarious exist on the three Char Dham highway roads, the letter further stated. The Centre, however, denied any link between the Rishiganga Valley disaster with the ongoing Char Dham road expansion project.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-to-hear-centre-s-char-dham-road-project-plea-tomorrow-101620760049873.html
12-05-2021||India||Centre to disburse next instalment of PM Kisan to over 90mn on May 14||The Union government will disburse the next instalment of PM Kisan, the federal cash transfer scheme for farmers, on May 14, a tranche that will see a few financial and political milestones.Prime Minister Narendra Modi picked May 14 as the release date to coincide with Eid, an official with knowledge of the matter said. The last instalment of PM-Kisan was paid on Christmas i.e. December 25, 2020.In a turnaround, the Mamata Banerjee-led West Bengal government, which resisted implementing the scheme so far, has joined the cash transfer scheme for the first time, the official said. This was reported over the weekend.In the upcoming tranche, about 90.5 million farmers have qualified to receive cash directly in their accounts, around ₹19,000 crore in all, the highest single tranche to be paid so far, according to the official cited above.The last instalment on December 25, 2020 was worth ₹18,000 crore, although total payouts for that period ended up being higher due to additional farmers being validated.The payouts slated for May 14 will be the first instalment of PM Kisan for financial year 2021-22.Under PM-KISAN, the government provides income support of ₹6,000 a year to farmers with a valid enrolment, paid in three equal cash transfers of ₹2,000. It is paid once every four months: December to March, April to July and August to November. It was launched on 24 February 2019, when the first instalment was paid.Although the government may choose any date between April and July to pay the financial year’s first instalment, last year, most beneficiaries were paid by April 20. States faced considerable hurdles, such as manpower shortage, in compilation and uploading of farmers’ data for the due instalment due to a crippling second wave of Covid-19 infections.“The Centre gave states extra time to complete their part of the process such as opening and closing of lots (which refers to farmers’ data),” the official said.States have to upload data to a centralized public finance management system, a platform that auto verifies bank accounts and checks biometric Aadhaar details of beneficiaries sent by states. These are then sent back to states for physical signatures.The Trinamool Congress-led West Bengal government signed on to the scheme on May 4. Nearly 700,000 farmers from the state are set to be paid ₹2000 each as direct cash transfer for the first time.“The farmers’ data from West Bengal have been validated and sent back to the state for final signatures. Farmers there will receive cash payouts on May 14,” the official said.West Bengal’s inclusion – or onboarding – in PM Kisan happened on May 4, a day after Union agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar wrote to chief minister Mamata Banerjee, urging her to send farmers’ data for the scheme.“Chief minister Mamata Banerjee agreed to the state’s inclusion in the scheme quite sometime back. In fact she had written to the Centre. It’s the implementation that will now happen,” a Trinamool Congress spokesperson said.A Union government official aware of the developments said West Bengal asked for its share of the cash to be transferred to the state government. The Union agriculture ministry declined the request, saying PM-Kisan was a direct cash transfer scheme, which gets paid into farmers’ bank accounts.To be sure, the Modi government’s cash-for-farmers scheme still faces implementation hurdles, such as glitches in Aadhaar-based enrolment, slow internet connections in many rural centres and messy land records, the farm ministry had told a parliamentary panel last year.Eligible farmer families are identified on the basis of operational land holding data according to the agricultural Census Data 2015-16, which is then extrapolated to 2018-19, an official said. It’s the job of state governments to provide accurate beneficiary data and payments are continuously updated.“The Centre has to simultaneously work with state governments to clean up a lot of spurious data because right-to-information queries in the past have shown that ineligible individuals had been paid under PM-Kisan,” said RS Mani, a former economist with the Tamil Nadu Agricultural University.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-to-disburse-next-instalment-of-pm-kisan-to-over-90mn-on-may-14-101620760048652.html

This would have been Modi’s second foreign visit this year, after a trip to Bangladesh in March to attend celebrations marking the 50th anniversary of the neighbouring country’s independence.“While appreciating the invitation to the Prime Minister by UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson to attend the G7 Summit as a special invitee, given the prevailing Covid situation, it has been decided that the Prime Minister will not attend the G7 Summit in person,” external affairs ministry spokesperson Arindam Bagchi said.The move came days after Modi called off a planned visit to the Portuguese city of Porto to participate in the India-EU Summit on May 8. The meeting was subsequently held in a virtual format.External affairs minister S Jaishankar visited the UK to attend the G7 foreign ministers meeting in London during May 3-5, but he and his delegation had to go into self-isolation after two members tested positive for Covid-19.The pandemic has also affected the schedule for bilateral visits between India and the UK this year. Johnson called off plans to visit India twice – he cancelled a trip that was to begin on April 25 following a surge in infections in India, and in January, he cancelled a trip in order to focus on his government’s response to a new coronavirus variant that was spreading rapidly in the UK.Modi and Johnson held a virtual summit on May 4, during which they launched an Enhanced Trade Partnership and a Mobility and Migration Partnership, and unveiled a roadmap to boost bilateral ties over the next decade.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/modi-calls-off-uk-visit-for-g7-summit-as-pandemic-rages-101620759988229.html
12-05-2021||India||Cong panels to look into poll results, Covid relief||Congress president Sonia Gandhi on Tuesday formed two committees to look into the poor showing of the party in the recent assembly elections, and to coordinate Covid-19 relief activities, a move that underlined efforts to woo key members of the so-called “G23 group” of letter writers who demanded sweeping changes in the organisation last year.The panel to “evaluate the results of recently concluded assembly elections” includes Ashok Chavan, Salman Khurshid, Manish Tewari, Vincent Pala and Jothi Mani. The group, chaired by Chavan, has been asked to submit its report within two weeks. The Congress was decimated in West Bengal, failed to capture power in Kerala and Assam, lost power in Puducherry before the elections and failed to regain it, and is a junior partner in the ruling coalition in Tamil Nadu.The other panel is headed by former Union health minister Ghulam Nabi Azad, one of the most prominent faces of the group that wrote the letter The 13-member body also includes Ambika Soni, Mukul Wasnik, Pawan Bansal, Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, KC Venugopal, Jairam Ramesh, Randeep Surjewala, Manish Chatrath, Ajoy Kumar, Pawan Khera, Gurdeep Singh Sappal and Indian Youth Congress president BV Srinivas, who has been playing a crucial role in the Covid-19 relief operations.While the two committees have tasks cut out for them, party leaders were quick to point out the significance of the presence of Azad and Tewari in the panels. A senior leader said that this was the first time after Azad retired from the Rajya Sabha as the Leader of Opposition that the party formally appointed him for an assignment. The leader, who spoke on condition of anonymity, added that in a Congress Working Committee meeting on April 17, Priyanka Gandhi Vadra had suggested that Azad be involved in matters related to the Covid-19 pandemic.Party insiders feel Tewari has also been included in the panel to analyse poll results for his organisational experience in Youth Congress as well as his understanding of parliamentary politics.Tewari, who campaigned for the party in the recently concluded assembly polls, has also found a position for another key assignment. The presence of Azad, Tewari and Mukul Wasnik also underlines the Congress’s efforts to bring back as many members of the “G23” as possible into key affairs. Some prominent collaborators of that letter have, however, remained out of favour.While the plan to set up a panel to oversee relief operations was discussed last week, Sonia Gandhi announced in the CWC meet on Monday that a committee would be formed to analyse the election results.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cong-panels-to-look-into-poll-results-covid-relief-101620759867718.html
12-05-2021||India||ED attaches ₹77cr of Chinese firms in fraud case||The Enforcement Directorate (ED) has attached ₹76.67 crore, lying in various bank accounts and payment gateways pertaining to Chinese loan app companies and their Indian associates, agency said in a statement said.The central anti-money laundering probe agency had launched a probe against China backed fintech lenders in January this year on the basis of various FIRs registered by CID, Bengaluru based on the complaints received from various customers, who had availed loan and faced harassment from the recovery agent of these money lending companies.In a statement, ED said “the amount attached by it pertains to seven companies out of which three are fintech companies namely Mad Elephant Network Technology Private Limited, Baryonyx Technology Private Limited and Cloud Atlas Future Technology Private Limited which are controlled by the Chinese nationals and three NBFCs (Non-Banking Financial Companies) registered with RBI (Reserve Bank of India) namely - X10 Financial Services Private Limited, Track Fin-ed Private Limited and Jamnadas Morarjee Finance Private Limited.”“The Fintech companies have agreement with respective NBFCs for disbursement of loans through digital lending apps. The amount attached by ED also include amount of fee charged by a leading Bengaluru based fintech payment company to the extent of ₹86.44 lakhs for not conducting due diligence in case of one company enrolled with it for disbursement and collection of loans,” agency said.The ED said its money laundering investigation revealed that these Chinese loan apps offered loans to individuals and levied usurious rate of interest and processing fees.“The loan apps through their recovery agents resorted to systematic abuse, harassment and threatening to the defaulters through the call centres for coercive recovery of the loans by obtaining sensitive data of the user stored on mobile such as contacts, photographs and using them to defame or blackmail to the borrower. They even threatened the borrowers by sending fake legal notices to their relatives and family members,” agency statement added.“Investigation further revealed that the money lending business has been indeed being run by these fintech companies for which they are not authorized to do under any law and these NBFCs knowingly let these fintech companies to use their names for the sake of getting commission without being careful about the conduct of these fintech companies in dealing with the customers who are vulnerable section of the society and are in dire need of funds due to prevailing pandemic situation. The same is also violation of the Fair Practices Code of RBI,” it said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ed-attaches-77cr-of-chinese-firms-in-fraud-case-101620759807700.html

12-05-2021||India||US looking at joint production of Johnson & Johnson vaccine in India||The US is looking at the joint production of the Johnson & Johnson Covid-19 vaccine in India and ways to help Indian manufacturers such as the Serum Institute of India (SII) ramp up production to meet vaccine needs around the globe, a senior American diplomat said on Tuesday.US chargé d’affaires Daniel Smith said the US stockpile of AstraZeneca vaccines –currently believed to be 10 million doses – can’t be shared with other countries till the jabs are certified as safe and effective by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) because of problems associated with the plant that manufactured them.Smith, a career diplomat who served as acting secretary of state, was named the acting head of the US mission in New Delhi last month to help oversee the Biden administration’s efforts to help India cope with a devastating second wave of the pandemic that has seen daily infection rates surge well past the 350,000-mark for several days.He told a virtual news briefing the US administration is working on the Indian government’s list of raw materials and other supplies urgently needed to manufacture vaccines but cautioned this wouldn’t be an easy task because of disruptions to global supply chains.“We are now working closely with them to go through this list to decide what is available, what we can provide and how quickly we can provide that. I just want to say this is not an easy task, that is, there are global challenges in the global supply chain right now when it comes to precursors and raw materials necessary for these vaccines,” Smith said.In addition to working with SII and other Indian vaccine manufacturers on ways to boost production, the US is looking into the joint production of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine in India and encouraging private sector discussions to ramp up manufacturing.“I know [the US International] Development Finance Corporation (DFC) is looking at how we can invest so that we can help produce the Johnson & Johnson vaccine here in India,” Smith said.Following the maiden summit of the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue or Quad in March, the group announced that the DFC will assist India’s Biological E to produce a billion doses of Covid-19 vaccines to be rolled out by the end of 2022 under a new vaccine partnership for the Indo-Pacific region. The initiative was aimed at creating additional manufacturing capacities in India to make doses developed in the US, including the Johnson & Johnson candidate, with financing from the US and Japan.“I think we are watching carefully the production levels at the SII and elsewhere. We’ve been in close touch with the SII to try to determine what raw materials we could provide, and assistance that we can provide to help boost production. But that’s an issue with vaccines across the board, it’s not simply with the AstraZeneca vaccine in that regard,” Smith said in response to a question from HT about what India and the US are doing to ramp up production to help other countries through the Quad.Smith said the US has also diverted enough AstraZeneca manufacturing supplies from its own pre-existing orders to produce more than 20 million doses in India.SII CEO Adar Poonawalla has said in recent days that the raw materials needed from the US – whose supply was held up after the Biden administration invoked the Defense Production Act – are required for making Covovax, the vaccine developed by Novavax.At a time when India and other countries are hoping the US will begin shipping doses from its stockpile of some 10 million doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine, Smith said this wouldn’t be possible till the FDA certifies the safety and efficacy of the vaccines made at a plant outside Baltimore.The FDA is investigating an error at the Baltimore plant that led to ingredients of the AstraZeneca shot contaminating a batch of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine, which were being made at the same facility.“I know that there are a number of doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine that were made in the plant outside of Baltimore, but there were problems with this plant. So far, the FDA hasn’t certified that these vaccines are available for anyone’s use, for export or not. So I can’t say when that will happen or what will be done exactly as we go forward,” Smith said.The Biden administration, he added, decided not to use the AstraZeneca jabs as it has sufficient stocks of three other vaccines, and is “eager to supply these to the world but we won’t do so before we’re assured that they are safe and effective”.The US is determined to do all it can to help boost India’s vaccine production because Washington recognises New Delhi’s critical role in helping the world counter the pandemic. “Our global partnership with India, when it comes to vaccines and vaccine production, is essential for the world’s emergence from this pandemic. We recognise that in helping India, we’re helping a lot more than just India,” Smith said.Smith also cautioned that a proposal by India and South Africa for waiver of patent protections for Covid-19 vaccines at the World Trade Organization (WTO) would be a long and complex process despite support extended by the Biden administration.“The WTO is a consensus-based organisation. So, we’re going to have to negotiate this with our partners in the WTO as we go forward...We’re not just waiting for that to take place, what we’re also doing is ramping up all of our efforts across the board, in partnership with India and other countries, to increase production of Covid-19 vaccines and increase availability,” he said.“We are concerned obviously with the current course of the pandemic in India, not simply because of the humanitarian catastrophe but the fact that it has global implications...India’s role as the supplier for not just what was envisioned by the Quad but for much of the world when it comes to vaccines is critical,” he added.As the world’s largest manufacturer of vaccines, India exported more than 65 million doses of Covid-19 vaccines under its “Vaccine Maitri” initiative but supplies have slowed to a trickle since March as domestic infection rates surged.Smith said the US plans to work with European partners and other countries that have additional AstraZeneca doses to help countries in the region whose vaccine supplies were affected once India began focusing on its second wave. “The challenge is nobody has studied the viability of using a different vaccine for the second dose...Some countries may even resort to starting over with the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine but obviously if we could solve this by providing a second dose of the AstraZeneca vaccine, that would be the simplest and best solution,” he said.He outlined the aid worth more than $100 million that the US has provided to India, mainly oxygen-related equipment and medical supplies, and said the US side is working closely with the Indian government on the use of this official assistance. “I think we have very good visibility to where that assistance is gone,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/us-looking-at-joint-production-of-j-j-vaccine-in-india-101620759507668.html
12-05-2021||India||Over 80 bodies found in Ganga in UP, Bihar||Local administration fished at least 70 corpses out of the Ganga in Bihar’s Buxar district on Tuesday and residents spotted 12 dead bodies floating in the same river upstream in neighbouring Uttar Pradesh’s Ghazipur district, triggering probes in both states and speculation that the bodies belonged to Covid patients.Buxar district magistrate (DM) Aman Samir said 71 bodies were recovered over the past 24 hours at Mahadeva ghat in Chausa village, a day after 30 corpses were seen floating in the river at the same spot.Samir said he proposed conducting autopsy of the bodies but that was not possible. “The doctors refused as the dead bodies are in highly decomposed condition and seem to be five to six days old,” he said. District administration officials said that some bodies were covered with shrouds. Such bodies are generally wrapped in plastic sheets.Roughly 40 km upstream from Chausa, at least 12 bodies were found floating in Bara and Gahmar areas of Ghazipur district of Uttar Pradesh. The local administration initiated a probe into the matter.“Our officials are present on the spot and an investigation is underway. We are trying to find out from where these bodies came,” Ghazipur district magistrate MP Singh said. Bara town shares a boundary with Buxar. Gahmar is two kilometres away.Also read | After Bihar, bodies found abandoned in Ganga in UPThe recovery of decomposed corpses in the Ganga has set off alarm bells in the administration and among residents in Bihar and Uttar Pradesh, especially because the river acts as a source of drinking water and livelihood. Local activists have alleged that the bodies belong to Covid patients who couldn’t be given a proper funeral due to shortages and fear of the virus in rural areas. The administration in both states have ordered probes and said many bodies were far too decomposed to conduct tests.On Tuesday, Union minister of Jal Shakti, Gajendra Singh Shekhawat, termed the incidents as “unfortunate” and asked concerned states to take immediate cognizance.“The incident of corpses found floating in the Ganga in Buxar region of Bihar is unfortunate. This is definitely a matter of investigation. The Modi government is committed to the cleanliness ‘mother’ Ganga. This incident is unexpected. The concerned states should take immediate cognizance in this regard,” Shekhawat tweeted.In Buxar, the district administration said the DNA of corpses will be preserved. “Here at Buxar and also in Bihar there is a custom to burn the dead bodies but when a team was sent to Ghazipur district of Uttar Pradesh to find the truth, it was found that some people believe in the custom to throw the dead bodies in river rather than to burn it,” Samir said.The administration is also performing the last rites of bodies. “The religion of dead bodies is not known, and the dead bodies are in decomposed condition, so it has been decided to bury all the bodies. For this, large pits have been dug,” the DM said. At the time of filling this report, Chausa circle officer (CO) Nawalkant (only one name) said that 71 dead bodies have been recovered and the process to dispose of them is continuing.Senior police officials in Bihar said there was little doubt that the bodies had floated down from upstream states -- a charge denied by Uttar Pradesh.In Ghazipur, local residents said they sounded alarm on Tuesday morning. “I received information that two bodies were floating in the Ganga in Bara area of Ghazipur. I along with my team reached the spot...this is a matter of grave concern,” said Ramesh Kumar Maurya, sub divisional magistrate of Sevrai division.Mubarakpur village chief, Shyamnarayan Singh, said some families had dumped the bodies in the river because they couldn’t afford cremations. “In rural pocket, this has been taking place for the last one week,” said former village chief of Gahmar, Durga Chaurasia.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/over-80-bodies-found-in-ganga-in-up-bihar-101620759387610.html
12-05-2021||India||Vedic science, Vaastu in MP’s new vocational curriculum||Vedic knowledge is at the core of the new vocational education syllabus being framed by the Madhya Pradesh higher education department, officials said.The new curriculum will have special focus on Vedic Karmkand (rituals), Jyotishi (astrology), Vedic science and Vastu Shastra (a mix of architecture and spirituality). This is apart from other vocational courses such hotel management, dietary science and physical training.“Two vocational subjects will be mandatory for students. One will be generic and other specialised,” said a state education department official who asked not to be named.Confirming the changes being made, another officer of the department said that in generic subjects, students will learn about the rich ancient knowledge of India along with basics of subjects such as physics, chemistry, math and biology.“By reading from many ancient books and the vedas, students will realise that Indian saints were intelligent and discovered so many things centuries ago,” the second officer added, asking not to be named.The specialized subjects will include Vedic Karmakand, Vedic science and astrology, yoga, hotel management and dietary science, the first officer said.The curriculum framing committee has also decided that the state government will promote new Indian writers and remove Shakespeare and other foreign writers from the syllabus, first officer said.“There are so many Indian writers who have contributed to English literature. Why should we force students to read Shakespeare,” a third officer of the department said, adding that students would also be taught about the history and culture of Madhya Pradesh. This officer, who didn’t want to be named didn’t specify the Indian writers whose work will now be included.Educationists said the Bharatiya Janata Party-led state government is pushing the agenda of its ideological parent, the RSS.Bhopal based educationist GL Dubey wondered about the purpose of new curriculum. “Does the government want to provide new job opportunities to youth or push their agenda in name of rich culture of India? ”Devi Ahilya Vishwavidhyalaya’s former vice-chancellor Narendra Dhakad said, “There is so much focus on coding and other technologies skills and the government wants to introduce Vedic Karmkand in higher education. For such courses, Sanskrit universities and colleges are already there so what is need of introducing it as a vocational course.”The principal secretary of the state’s higher education department Anupam Rajan disagreed: “ 1,500 subject experts in 79 boards are preparing a syllabus which will be different from syllabus of traditional courses.

12-05-2021||India||Over 5k soldiers infected as 2nd wave hits armed forces||More than 5,000 soldiers from the three services are currently undergoing treatment for the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) in military hospitals across the country, almost a fivefold jump in hospital admissions in the three weeks since a second wave of infections tightened its grip on the country, according to official figures accessed by HT.The cases under hospitalisation in the military increased from 1,067 on April 18 to 5,134 on May 10, reflecting in some measure the wider national trend of a surge in coronavirus infections.To be sure, the 1.5-million strong armed forces have largely managed to check the transmission of the virus and keeping the mortality rate low by adhering to strict Covid protocols -- 133 deaths of serving soldiers have been reported since the pandemic broke out last year (including 17 in the three-week period cited above).The figures show that the cumulative number of soldiers discharged from military hospitals after being treated for the disease after the first outbreak in 2020 stands at 45,413 (as of May 10, 2021). Almost all soldiers in the armed forces have been fully vaccinated against the coronavirus.Veterans suffering from Covid also account for a considerable load at military hospitals. A total of 1,814 ex-servicemen are currently being treated at these hospitals, compared to 356 three weeks ago. At 1,027, the cumulative veteran deaths outnumber the serving fatalities -- 44 veterans died on May 9 alone.Military hospitals have discharged 5,242 veterans after treatment since last year. There are more than 3.2 million ex-servicemen in the country.Dependents of serving soldiers and ex-servicemen are also battling the coronavirus in military hospitals. A total of 3,662 dependents of serving soldiers and 1,439 dependents of veterans were undergoing treatment in military hospitals as of May 10, compared to corresponding April 18 figures of 667 and 166.The cumulative number of dependents in both categories discharged after treatment since last year stands at 11,820. Dependent deaths add up to 2,094.Dependents include spouses, sons (till the age of 25 or when they start earning, whichever is earlier), unmarried/divorced daughters, parents with monthly income of less than ₹9,000 and special children for life. The number of military dependents in India is around 2.3 million.Taken together, 12,049 soldiers, ex-servicemen and dependents are currently in military hospitals for treatment, with the cumulative death figure since last year being 2,611.In all, military hospitals admitted a total of 77,135 soldiers, veterans and their dependents over the last 14 months and discharged 63,631 patients. Civilians are also being treated at military hospitals and currently account for 448 admissions, up from 71 three weeks ago. The hospitals have recorded 177 civilian deaths since last year.While catering to the health needs of serving soldiers, veterans and their dependents, the military is also operating in full battle mode for national Covid relief and foresees a bigger role for itself in the coming weeks and months to help civilian authorities tackle the pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/over-5k-soldiers-infected-as-2nd-wave-hits-armed-forces-101620757888697.html
12-05-2021||India||Ten states gear up to import vaccines; bottlenecks remain||At-least 10 states have decided to float global tenders to buy Covid-19 vaccines from international manufacturers even though officials said that there is no clarity by when these manufacturers will be able to supply the vaccines, because most vaccine supplies have been mopped up by countries -- some of which have ordered enough to vaccinate their population twice or thrice over.There is another procedural problem -- India’s drug regulator has to approve the vaccine for its import. Thus far, it has approved only three, Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin; Serum Institute’s Covishield, and Russia’s Sputnik V.The Centre allowed the states to procure vaccines from manufacturers to carry out Covid vaccination for those in 18 to 44 age group and decided to continue supplying vaccines to states for older people and front line workers.On Tuesday, the governments of Karnataka, Uttarakhand, Delhi and Telangana decided to float global tenders to buy vaccines as Indian manufacturers Serum Institute of India and Bharat Biotech are unable to meet the demand of the states to provide vaccination to all adults. Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan and Odisha have previously announced plans to import vaccines.The Karnataka government on Tuesday said that it has decided to launch a short-term global tender for 20 million doses of covid-19 vaccines.Also read | States can procure only 20 million Covid-19 jabs for 18+ in May“In order to meet the increased demand and to facilitate vaccination of the age group of 18-44 years, 20 million Covid vaccines will be procured through global tender,” CN Ashwath Narayan, Deputy Chief Minister and state Covid task force head, said in a statement on Tuesday. This tender woill be in addition to 30 million vaccines ordered by the state government from Bharat Biotech and SII.The two companies are expected to manufacture 85 million doses in May and June, of which states will be entitled to around 20 million (the Centre will get half, and private hospitals another 20 million). That’s no where close to what states need although the situation is expected to improve by July by when Bharat Biotech hopes to increase its capacity to 55 million doses a month and SII, 100 million.Neighbouring Telangana also decided to float global tenders to procure vaccine. Chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao has asked the officials to work out the details in the next few days, an official note from the CMO said.The Uttarakhand government on Tuesday decided to float global tenders for procurement of COVID vaccines including Covishield, Covaxin and Sputnik and formed a committee of officials to work out the modalities. Yugal Kishore, additional secretary in Uttarakhand government, said the global tender will be floated within this week. “We will decide tomorrow on how much stock of vaccines needs to be imported.”Officials and political functionaries in several states said that there was no clarity on by when the international vaccine manufacturers would be able to provide vaccines.Maharashtra health minister Rajesh Tope said the state government has written to Russian Direct Investment Fund for the import of Sputnik V asking about the quantity available and the time schedule of delivery. “There was no response to the enquiry,” he said. A Rajasthan government officials said that international manufacturers were not responding to queries on availability of vaccines with them. Sputnik V is being distributed in India by Dr Reddy’s Laboratories.Earlier, the Maharashtra government had announced a global tender for procurement of the vaccines manufactured by international firms such as Pfizer, Johnson and Johnson.“We want the Centre to give the approvals to other vaccines like they have given it to Sputnik V. Central authorities should act on this fast for the approvals to other vaccines so that the state can directly procure them through global tendering,” said Tope said.Maharashtra has set titself the target of vaccinating 57.1 million people in the age group of 18-44 years in six months by procuring 120 million doses of vaccines.The Uttar Pradesh government on May 5 decided to float a global e-tender to procure 40 million doses of vaccines (the last day of online submission is May 21). Chief minister Yogi Adityanath announced on April 29 that state government would float global tenders to procure 40-50 million doses.The state government previously placed orders for the supply of 10 million Covid vaccine doses —50 lakh vaccine doses each from Bharat Biotech and Serum Institute of India (SII) . Additional Chief Secretary, Health and Family Welfare, Amit Mohan Prasad said the state government has received 3.50 lakh doses of Covishield from SII and three lakh doses of Covaxin from Bharat Biotech till Sunday.In Andhra Pradesh, too, chief minister Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy on Monday decided to go global in search of vaccines, but the process is yet to commence. Director of Odisha Health services Bijay Mohapatra on Tuesday said the state government would soon fix the modalities for the global tender. “We have not decided on a timeline as to when the vaccines from global companies would be available. But we expect to get them quickly.”Rajasthan government on Sunday decided to import vaccines and has sought clarification on imports from the Drug Controller of India. “Only those vaccines approved by Drug Controller can be imported. Only Covaxin, Covishield and Sputnik are approved by Drug Controller,” said a Rajasthan government official, who asked not to be named.Several states have either slowed or suspended vaccinations for people in the 18-44 age group people because of shortage of vaccines . Maharashtra and Rajasthan are vaccinating only those above 45 and Odisha has closed half of its vaccination centres. The pace of vaccination has reduced in several states due to dose crunch. “Earlier, we used to administer 2.80 lakh doses a day, but now the figure has drastically come down to 40,000-50,000 per day,” Mahopatra said.However, several states such as Bihar, Punjab, Goa and Himachal Pradesh are yet to decide on floating global tenders. Officials in these states said they were getting adequate vaccines from the Indian manufacturers. According to Punjab’s Principal Secretary, Health and Family Welfare, Hussan Lal, there is no plan to purchase Covid vaccines from the global market.(With inputs from state bureaus)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ten-states-gear-up-to-import-vaccines-bottlenecks-remain-101620757827529.html
12-05-2021||India||Antilia security threat case: Sachin Vaze dismissed from Mumbai Police||Former Mumbai crime branch police officer Sachin Vaze, under arrest for his suspected role in planting explosives outside the home of industrialist Mukesh Ambani and the death of a businessman, was summarily dismissed from service on Tuesday.The newly appointed Mumbai police commissioner (CP) Hemant Nagrale dismissed Vaze, who was arrested by the National Investigation Agency (NIA) on March 13.The 49-year-old assistant inspector of police headed the Crime Intelligence Unit of the crime branch before he was placed under suspension for his suspected role in planting 20 loose gelatin sticks in a Scorpio vehicle outside Antilia, in south Mumbai, on the intervening night of February 24-25. Vaze was also named as the prime suspect in the death of Thane trader Mansukh Hiran, who was in possession of the SUV and whose body washed up ashore a creek on March 5.Nagrale issued an order under Article 311(2)(B) of the Constitution which empowers appointing authorities to summarily dismiss from service a member of civil service without holding a departmental inquiry, where the authority is satisfied that it is not reasonably practicable to hold such an inquiry.The CP cited several findings of the NIA probe into the two connected cases against Vaze as grounds for dismissal. This included Vaze’s alleged attempts at destruction of evidence in the explosives case, Hiran’s murder purportedly committed to destroy evidence and stall investigation, the booking of a room at a South Mumbai five star hotel using a fake identity card, as well as the possession of 62 unaccounted live ammunition and suspected unauthorised use of 25 rounds of his service pistol.Nagrale also cited suspected acts of impersonation, forgery, and floating of companies that conducted financial transactions running into crores of rupees as reasons for Vaze to be summarily dismissed.“For the reasons recorded above, that the holding of a regular departmental enquiry against API Sachin Hindurao Vaze, will not be reasonably practicable,” the order stated. “Thus, he is dismissed from service with immediate effect,” it added.Officials at state police headquarters said a similar proposal for the summary dismissal of another Mumbai police officer arrested in the case, Vaze’s former colleague at the criminal intelligence unit of the Mumbai crime branch, API Riyazuddin Kazi, is under process.Nagrale’s predecessor Param Bir Singh was transferred to head the Maharashtra Home Guards on March 17, following Vaze’s arrest.Vaze was originally in charge of investigation of the bomb scare case, but was removed after reports emerged of his links with Hiran, who had reported the SUV stolen on February 17, 2021. After Hiran’s body was found on March 5, it emerged that Vaze had borrowed the Scorpio from Hiran in November and had returned it on February 5.The NIA took over the explosives case on March 8 and the murder case on March 24. Vaze was named the main accused in both, and was arrested by NIA on March 13.The NIA has arrested two more Mumbai police officers -- Kazi and police inspector Sunil Mane -- for their alleged involvement in both cases. A bookie, Naresh Gor and a former constable, Vinayak Shinde, have also been arrested for their suspected role in Hiran’s death.Vaze was suspended from service in 2004, and resigned in 2007 after the state initiated a case against him for his role in the custodial death of a blast accused. He was reinstated by the former Mumbai police commissioner, Singh, in 2020.Vaze is also being prosecuted for custodial death of Khawaja Yunus, an accused in Ghatkopar bomb blast case of 2002.Yunus, an engineer, was arrested by the Mumbai crime branch in connection with the bomb blast case, and later reportedly died in police custody. The state Crime Investigation Department (CID) had, in March 2004 charged Vaze and three other police personnel -- Rajendra Tiwari, Rajaram Nikam and Sunil Desai -- with murder and destruction of evidence. Following this, Vaze was placed under suspension.Vaze, who was inducted in police service as sub-inspector on June 20, 1990 and who was promoted to the post of API in June 2003, eventually resigned from service on November 30, 2007. The following year, he joined the Shiv Sena. Though the trial in Yunus’ custodial death case is yet to be concluded, Vaze was reinstated in service on June 6, 2020. So were the three other policemen who had been booked for their alleged involvement in Yunus’s custodial death.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/antilia-security-threat-case-sachin-vaze-dismissed-from-mumbai-police-101620756987459.html
12-05-2021||India||In national politics, where does the BJP stand||Had the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) managed to win the West Bengal elections, it would have got its first government on India’s eastern coast. Having lost the high stake battle to the All India Trinamool Congress (TMC), it will remain formidable — as a party which controls most of India’s Hindi speaking and northeastern states along with its traditional bastion of Gujarat and the politically turbulent southern state of Karnataka — but short of its goal.As of now, the BJP and its allies have governments in 18 out of the 30 states and union territories (UTs) in India where a legislative assembly currently exists (Jammu and Kashmir is a UT with legislature where no assembly exists as of now). The only major state, which has a non-BJP National Democratic Alliance (NDA) chief minister, is Bihar.Of the seven major states — excluding all northeastern states except Assam, the hill states of Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand and the western state of Goa — where the BJP or its allies are in power, Uttar Pradesh and Gujarat will go to polls in 2022. In both these states, the BJP will be under pressure to not just win but also win big.In Karnataka and Madhya Pradesh, where BJP chief ministers are currently in office, the party did not form a government after the assembly elections and it has captured power riding on defections from the Congress party. While it has consolidated its position in Madhya Pradesh, its Karnataka chief minister BS Yediyurappa, continues to battle inner party problems, something which has plagued both the BJP and the Congress in the state.Also Read | Centre brings all 77 BJP MLAs in West Bengal under VIP security coverIn Haryana, the only state apart from Assam and Bihar where the BJP managed to come back to power, with the help of the Jananayak Janata Party, after the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, there could be strong headwinds against the BJP due to the ongoing farm protests, the effects of which could also manifest itself in western Uttar Pradesh, when polls are held in early 2022. The same issue could give the otherwise nationally beleaguered Congress a decisive edge in the state of Punjab.To be sure, the BJP is also the main Opposition party in seven out of the 12 states where it is not in power currently. Of these, in West Bengal and Odisha, it has captured opposition space for the first time in the latest elections. In Telangana, where assembly elections were held before schedule in 2018, the BJP has performed better than the Congress in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections. States on India’s eastern coast still hold the promise of future gains for the BJP. Of the four eastern coast states (Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, West Bengal, and Odisha), only the TMC has been opposing the BJP on a consistent basis when it comes to the BJP’s legislative agenda in the parliament.The only region, where the BJP seems to be in complete control at the moment is the north-eastern region beyond the Chicken’s Neck. That the party has bestowed the chief minister’s post on Himanta Biswa Sarma by removing the incumbent Sadananda Sonwal shows that Sarma has emerged as a regional heavyweight not just in Assam, but the entire north-eastern region.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-national-politics-where-does-the-bjp-stand-101620730226956.html
12-05-2021||India||Cong misleading people on Covid-19, JP Nadda tells Sonia Gandhi||Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) president JP Nadda on Tuesday wrote a letter to his Congress counterpart, Sonia Gandhi, asking her and the party including its chief ministers to stop “misleading people, creating false panic” over the Covid-19 pandemic and contradictory stands on the vaccination policy.The letter came a day after the Congress Working Committee on Monday passed a resolution calling the second Covid-19 wave a “grave calamity and direct consequence of the Modi government’s indifference, insensitivity, and incompetence.”Nadda, in his four-page response to Gandhi, accused Congress leaders of contributing to vaccine hesitancy. “Vaccine that is made in India should be a matter of national pride. Instead, Congress leaders tried to ridicule it and create doubts in the minds of people. Even the chief ministers belonging to your party indulged in such antics. In a nation that has almost no recent history of vaccine hesitancy, your party has the dubious record of trying to actively create [it], that too, in the middle of a once-in-a-century pandemic,” the letter said. “The Congress Working Committee talks about the Modi government ‘abdicating’ its responsibility on vaccination. Is there so much of a communication gap between the Congress party and the states it shares powers in? In April itself, topmost Congress leaders were calling for decentralisation of vaccination.”The drug regulator’s approval of Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin came in for criticism from various quarters because it was done without even interim data being made available. The data, available several months on, did show the vaccine to be highly effective.Nadda defended the vaccination policy and said it had already ensured considerable coverage in priority groups by providing at least 160 million vaccines to states in the first two phases.Also read | States can procure only 20 million Covid-19 jabs for 18+ in MayThere has been a slew of complaints from states about the deficiencies in the vaccination programme, the lack of vaccines, and their differential pricing for those above 18. It has also become clear that India does not have enough vaccines to meet the demand, even by the Union government’s own admission. Several states are now looking to buy vaccines directly from global manufacturers. However, most manufacturers have already committed supplies for several months .Nadda said that BJP ruled states have announced their resolve to help the poor and underprivileged by providing vaccines for free. “I am sure that Congress governments in various states also feel strongly for the poor, can they also come out with a similar decision to provide vaccines for free?” Punjab , Rajasthan, and Chattisgarh, all governed by Congress administrations have announced that they will provide vaccines free to anyone in the 18-44 years age group. Those over the age of 45 are already covered by the Union government’s Phase 2. Maharashtra, where the Congress is part of the ruling MVA alliance has also announced free vaccines for those in the 18-44 years age group. However, most states (including BJP ruled ones) have been scrambling to source vaccines on account of inadequate supply. According to the Union government’s latest policy, half the capacity of domestic vaccine makers will be dedicated for the Union government and the other half, equally shared between states (on the basis of their population), and the private sector.Nadda accused the Congress of politicising the pandemic and the vaccination policy. He added that in this fight against the pandemic, the conduct of the topmost Congress leaders, including Rahul Gandhi, will be remembered for “duplicity and pettiness.”“Your party, under your leadership, is doing no favours to itself by opposing lockdowns and then demanding for the same, ignoring the Centre’s advisories on the second wave of Covid and then saying they did not get any information, holding massive election rallies in Kerala causing a spike in Covid cases while grandstanding about the election rallies elsewhere, supporting protests but speaking about following Covid guidelines,” the letter said. Nadda also cited a surge in Covid-19 cases in Congress-ruled state such as Punjab.Also read | Covid-19 wave ebbing in 9 regions, shows dataOn the Congress’s opposition to the Central Vista, Nadda said the need for a new Parliament was raised during the Congress-led United Progressive Alliance rule. He added the then speaker Meira Kumar underscored the need for a new parliament building. Nadda added Congress’s Chhattisgarh government was also going ahead with its plans of building a new assembly complex.The Congress hit back at Nadda over the letter, with party general secretary Ajay Maken saying: “When the Congress is trying to play the role of a responsible opposition, the ruling party president writes a letter that smacks of usual arrogance. This is shameful.”Congress MP Shashi Tharoor quoted German philosopher Hannah Arendt that “one of the greatest advantages of the totalitarian elites of the 1920s &1930s was to turn any statement of fact into a question of motive”. “Of course @JPNadda wasn’t born when Arendt wrote those words, but his BJP apologists resort routinely to this old technique!” he tweeted.Interacting with the media, Maken said that whatever Congress leaders such as Rahul and Sonia Gandhi have been repeatedly saying about the Modi government’s handling of the pandemic, the Indian Medical Association, and international journals The Lancet and Nature have also echoed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nadda-writes-to-sonia-gandhi-asks-her-to-stop-misleading-people-over-covid-101620714625342.html
12-05-2021||India||KR Gouri, architect of land reforms in Kerala, dies aged 102; tributes pour in||KR Gouri Amma, 102, the architect of land reforms in Kerala, its first woman minister and one of the longest-serving legislators, died at a private hospital in Thiruvananthapuram due to age-related ailments, her family said on Tuesday.She helmed the key revenue ministry and drafted the Kerala Agrarian Relations Act for ownership of land to peasants who tilled it after the first democratically elected Communist government assumed power in Kerala in 1957. Amma and T V Thomas became the first couple in a government when the two ministers in chief minister EMS Namboodiripad’s ministry got married the same year.She was a founding member of the Communist Party of India (Marxist), or CPI (M), when the Communist Party of India (CPI) split in 1964 over ideological differences. Thomas remained with the CPI. The CPI(M) is said to have built a wall in the couple’s house before ideological differences had the couple part ways. Thomas died of cancer in 1977.Known as the “stormy petrel” of Kerala politics, Amma was a six-time minister, who was elected to the state assembly 12 times. Ahead of the 1987 election, the CPI (M) projected Amma as the chief ministerial candidate and coined a slogan in Malayalam that meant “she is set to rule Kerala”. But after the election, the party named E K Nayanar as the chief minister. A sidelined Amma fell out with CPI (M) general secretary Namboodiripad and she was expelled from the party in 1994. Amma later floated Janadhipathya Samrakshana Samithi and allied with Congress-led United Democratic Front (UDF). Amma was a minister in K Karunakaran, AK Antony, and Oommen Chandy-led UDF governments before she returned to the Left Democratic Front in 2016.Also Read | Practically impossible to provide oxygen to other states: Kerala CMIn the 1980s, she served as the industry minister in the EK Nayanar government and was instrumental in setting up the country’s first Information Technology Park (Tehnopark) with the help of technocrat KPP Nambiar.Amma, who was known for her fiery orator, was born in Alappuzha’s Pattanakad village in 1919. She was the first law graduate from the backward Ezhava community. Amma enrolled as a lawyer at a court in Cherthala before joining CPI in 1947. She was associated with the labour movement and was jailed and suffered torture when the party was banned.Tributes poured in after the news of Amma’s death broke. Kerala chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan called Amma a brave fighter, who dedicated her life to end exploitation and build an egalitarian society. “She made seminal contributions in building the Communist movement & as an administrator. Let’s show respects, by pledging to build a more progressive society. Red Salute!,” he tweeted.Former defence minister AK Antony and Governor Arif Mohammad Khan were among others who condoled Amma’s death.In his condolence message, the Kerala Governor said Gowri Amma, with her extraordinary courage and inspiring leadership, was a perfect symbol of women empowerment. “K R Gowri’s struggles to ensure social justice and her contributions to land reforms and industrial growth in Kerala will always be gratefully remembered. May her soul attain Mukti.”Congress leader Rahul Gandhi tweeted, “My heartfelt condolences to the family of K R Gowri Amma ji. A tall presence in Kerala's politics, she remains a source of inspiration to many.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cpi-m-founding-member-kr-gouri-passes-away-101620709284954.html
