The TMC bagged 213 seats against the Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP) 77. Polls were held in 292 of the state’s 294 assembly seats as two candidates of two seats in Murshidabad district died of Covid-19. Polls in these constituencies will be held again later.Chief minister Mamata Banerjee said on Friday that 16 people were killed since May 2 and announced a compensation of ₹2 lakh for each of the affected families.The Calcutta high court on Friday set up a five-judge bench headed by acting chief justice Rajesh Bindal to hear a public interest litigation related to post-poll violence. The petition was filed by advocate Anindya Sundar Das. The state has been directed to file an affidavit on Monday, specifying areas where violence took place and steps taken by the government.The MHA team arrived in Kolkata on Thursday and met the home secretary and also called on Governor Jagdeep Dhankhar at Raj Bhawan on Friday.Dhankhar had been speaking against the violence since May 2 and tweeting every day.On Sunday, when the state observed the 160th birth anniversary of Rabindranath Tagore without any public celebration, Dhankhar raised the issue even while paying homage to the Nobel laureate.“Tribute to composer of NATIONAL ANTHEM, great philosopher & writer, Nobel Laureate, Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore on his birth anniversary. Unleashing of violence @MamataOfficial on those who exercised right to vote was not his dream. Let’s resolve to realize his dream,” he tweeted.The governor also tweeted that BJP leader Suvendu Adhikari, who defeated Banerjee at Nandigram in East Midnapore district, called on him.“Senior leader @SuvenduWB called on me at Raj Bhawan & expressed deep concern at alarming law and order @MamataOfficial and exodus of people even outside state. He asserted gruesome killings and rampant & unchecked destruction of property by ruling party members was planned,” wrote the governor, tagging the chief minister.CPI(M)’s youth front leader Minakshi Mukherjee, who contested the Nandigram seat, led a peace procession in the constituency on Sunday. “We are appealing to supporters of all political parties to maintain peace and tranquility,” she said.BJP leader Swapan Dasgupta, who lost from Tarakeswar in Hooghly district, lodged a police complaint on Sunday saying 260 people have been injured in political violence and many have fled from their homes. Dasgupta also alleged that ration shops were being given lists of BJP workers so that they are deprived of free ration till they join the TMC.“Having suffered such a heavy loss, BJP leaders are making fictitious allegations across the state,” said TMC Lok Sabha member Saugata Roy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bengal-sees-sharp-dip-in-post-poll-violence-mha-team-visits-districts-101620584175002.html
09-05-2021||India||WB Governor accords sanction against 3 sitting MLAs of TMC in Narada sting||West Bengal Governor Jagdeep Dhankar on Friday accorded prosecution sanction to the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) against three current MLAs - Madan Mitra, Subrata Mukherjee and Firhad Hakim, and one former party leader Suvon Chatterjee, in the Narada sting operation case, a development which will empower the central agency to file a chargesheet against them, people familiar with the development told HT. Subrata Mukherjee and Firhad Hakim are set to take oath as ministers in Mamata Banerjee’s cabinet on Monday. Madan Mitra won the election last week from Kamarhati seat in Bengal. Apart from the sanction granted by the Bengal governor on Friday against three TMC MLAs and disgruntled Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader Suvon Chatterjee, the ministry of home affairs (MHA) has also granted sanction against a 2004 batch promotee IPS officer – SMH Mirza in the Narada case. Mirza was arrested by CBI in September 2019 in the case. When contacted about the West Bengal governor giving sanction against three TMC MLAs, party’s Member of Parliament Saugata Roy said – “I cannot comment on it. It’s a legal matter”. Officers cited above said CBI had sent a request against the four state leaders in January this year after completion of investigation. A statement issued by Raj Bhavan, Kolkata, said “Governor of West Bengal accorded sanction for prosecution in respect of Firhad Hakim, Subrata Mukherjee, Madan Mitra and Suvon Chatterjee, for the reason that all of them at the relevant time of commission of crime were holding the position of ministers in the government of West Bengal.” The Governor’s office added that he is the competent authority to accord prosecution sanction against ministers in the state. “The impression generated in some quarters of the media that sanction has come to be accorded because these persons at the relevant time were members of the West Bengal Legislative Assembly is factually untenable. The premise of the sanction as indicated is that these persons at the relevant point of time of commission of crime were holding the position of ministers in the government of West Bengal,” added the Raj Bhavan statement. The case pertains to about a dozen TMC politicians and West Bengal bureaucrats allegedly caught on tape accepting money from a journalist posing as a representative of a private company ahead of the assembly election in 2016. CBI had registered a First Information Report (FIR) in April 2017 in the matter against 12 TMC leaders on the orders of the Calcutta High Court. Governor Jagdeep Dhankar’s sanction to prosecute three TMC MLAs and Suvon Chatterjee comes at a time when CBI’s request to prosecute three Trinamool MPs - Saugata Roy, Prasun Banerjee, and Kakoli Ghosh Dastidar and former TMC parliamentarian - Suvendu Adhikari, who joined BJP and fought and won the Nandigram seat against Mamata Banerjee, is pending with the Lok Sabha speaker since April 2019. According to section 19 of the Prevention of Corruption Act, prosecution sanction is mandatory before filing a chargesheet against a public servant else courts won’t take cognizance of the charges.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/wb-governor-accords-sanction-against-3-sitting-mlas-of-tmc-in-narada-sting-101620583094889.html

09-05-2021||India||Amit Mitra to be Bengal finance minister for 3rd time, new cabinet to have mix of seniors, debutants||He did not contest the recently concluded Bengal polls, yet economist Amit Mitra will be sworn in as state finance minister for the third time on Monday alongside many senior leaders and a few debutants as part of chief minister Mamata Banerjee’s new cabinet. Trinamool Congress (TMC) leaders said that till Sunday evening, Banerjee had prepared a list of 24 cabinet ministers and 19 ministers of state. Though she did not declare their portfolios, Mitra, party leaders said, would be in charge of the finance department. Among the senior leaders who will make it to the cabinet again are Subrata Mukherjee, Partha Chatterjee, Firhad Hakim, Sovandeb Chattopadhyay, Bratya Basu, Soumen Mahapatra, Javed Khan and Moloy Ghatak. There are speculations in the TMC that Subrata Mukherjee, who served as panchayat minister, may be given a different portfolio that focuses on urban affairs. TMC leaders said Birbaha Hansda, the Santhali movie actress who won the Jhargram seat and Becharam Manna, who won the Singur seat, are likely to be made ministers of state. Another prospective minister is former Indian cricketer Manoj Tiwary who bagged the Shibpur seat in Howrah district. Mitra, a former Secretary General of the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FICCI), was a lawmaker from the Khardah assembly seat in North 24 Parganas for two consecutive terms but did not contest the recently concluded polls in which the Trinamool Congress bagged 213 seats against the Bharatiya Janata Party’s 77. Polls were held in 292 of the state’s 294 assembly seats as two candidates at two seats in Murshidabad district died of Covid-19. Polls in these constituencies will be held again later. Incidentally, the Khardah seat fell vacant even before the poll results were announced on May 2. TMC’s Kajal Sinha, who won the seat, died of Covid-19 days after the election. “With the party winning 213 seats, Mitra can contest and emerge as a winner from any seat, including Khardah which he earlier held. Mamata Banerjee, too, has to contest again as she lost from Nandigram in East Midnapore district. Finding two seats for them is not a big issue,” a top TMC leader told HT on condition of anonymity. Since two ministers in the last government joined the BJP prior to the polls there are departments such as forest, that Rajib Banerjee held, or Transport, held by Suvendu Adhikari, for which Banerjee has to find ministers with experience, TMC leaders said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/amit-mitra-to-be-bengal-finance-minister-for-3rd-time-new-cabinet-to-have-mix-of-seniors-debutants-101620579374560.html

The health infrastructure is crumbling in many states. Hospitals and crematoriums are running out of space. Shortage of essential drugs is reported from many cities," Pathak said in his petition.Kerala, Puducherry, Tamil Nadu, Assam and West Bengal Assembly elections were held. The respondent number, 4, the ECI, had not been able to enforce the Covid-19 Rules and regulations during the political rallies and campaigning, Pathak said in his petition.The Union Home Minister, the Chief Ministers of respective states and host of star campaigners could be seen flouting the COVID-19 norms, Pathak said in his petition.As India witnesses its highest surge in Covid-19, since the onset of the Covid pandemic, but visuals had surfaced of lakhs of devotees crowding in Haridwar, Uttarakhand, for Kumbh Mela and in the election rallies in States, ignoring the most basic of Covid-19 protocols, Pathak added.Even though the disease is currently spreading at breakneck speed across the country, the Indian railways had organised 25 special trains to facilitate congregation and to link Haridwar Kumbh Mela to various locations for the pilgrims as per certain media report, the plea read further.The Union health minister blamed the heightened spread of Covid-19 on ordinary citizens, saying that they "became very careless" and were no longer following social distancing norms, Pathak claimed in his petition, filed before the Supreme Court.On the one hand, poor people on the street are often punished and treated violently by the police and executive authorities for individual violations of Covid-19 rules and regulations in the name of strict enforcement, on the other hand, the authorities are not only permitting but facilitating and promoting congregation of people in the events like Kumbh-2021 and Election rallies, Pathak in his petition said.It is visibly clear that two separate and mutually inconsistent standards are being adopted by the authorities in dealing with the citizens of India, Pathak said in his petition.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/supreme-court-to-hear-plea-on-covid-19-protocol-violation-in-kumbh-mela-assembly-elections-101620575957358.html

She has been booked under the stringent Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act.The activist has been lodged in Tihar Jail here.“Mahavir Narwal was not able to speak to his daughter who is in jail. His son, Aakash, who is also Covid-19 positive, was there with him in Rohtak,” sources close to the family said.Left activists and civil society groups had recently demanded that “political prisoners” be released from jails in view of the surge in coronavirus cases.“Extend my deep condolences to Natasha and her brother Aakash. The terrible injustice of the system in which a daughter wrongly locked up for a year unable to see her father even for a final farewell,” CPI(M) politburo member Brinda Karat said.Women’s rights activist and CPIML politburo member Kavita Krishnan also lashed out at the government and said it was “torture” forcing “feminists” to be in prison while their loved ones die of Covid-19.“This is so bloody cruel & sadistic: it's a form of torture to keep political prisoners jailed during a pandemic, forced to suffer not only prison, but the pain of being away from loved ones who are dying. Natasha's brother also has Covid-19,” she said on Twitter.Activist Harsh Mander too condoled Mahavir Narwal’s death."Where there's suffering, my daughter will be there. I'm proud of her". This hero, Mahavir Narwal, father of Natasha in jail for the CAA protests, supports her, with courage hard to find. "I hope she' not in jail so long she doesn't see my face".

09-05-2021||India||CM Mamata seeks GST waiver on Covid-19 equipment, already done tweets Sitharaman||With coronavirus infections in Bengal continuing to surge on Sunday, Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman told chief minister Mamata Banerjee through 16 tweets that the goods and services tax (GST) exemption the CM sought on donated medical equipment and medicines already exists. Banerjee wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday that “a large number of organisations, individuals and benevolent agencies” were ready to donate oxygen concentrators, cylinders, cryogenic storage tanks, tankers, tank containers and Covid-19 related drugs but have approached the state government seeking exemption from customs duty and GST on these items. Responding to this, Sitharaman took to Twitter on Sunday afternoon. “A list of items for Covid-19 relief granted exemption from IGST for imports was issued on 3rd May’21. These were given exemption from Customs Duty/health cess even earlier. Hon. CM @MamataOfficial may notice that items in your list are covered,” the finance minister wrote. “Full exemption from Customs duties, including IGST, is already available to ALL COVID-19 relief material (not confined to a list) imported by @IndianRedCross for free distribution in the country. With effect from 3 May, 2021, full exemption from all duties has been provided to Remdesivir injections, Remdesivir API, and for a chemical for the manufacture of this drug. Also to Medical Oxygen, equipment used for the manufacture, storage and transportation of oxygen, equipment used for providing oxygen therapy to Covid-19 patients such as Oxygen Concentrators, ventilators, non-invasive oxygen masks etc. Also to Inflammatory diagnostic kits and reagents for Covid-19 testing and Covid-19 vaccines. ” Sitharaman wrote in subsequent tweets.“This exemption applies to all above mentioned goods when imported free of cost for free distribution in the country by any entity, state govt, relief agency or autonomous body on the basis of a certificate issued by a state government. In order to augment the availability of these items, government has also provided full exemption from basic customs duty and health cess to their commercial imports,” Sitharaman tweeted. She pointed out that GST applies to domestic supplies and commercial imports. “GST at rates varying from 5% (on vaccines), 12% (COVID drugs, oxygen concentrators) is applicable to domestic supplies and commercial import of these items. If IGST ₹100 is collected on an item, ₹50 accrues to the Centre and the States each as CGST and SGST respectively. Further 41% of the CGST revenue is devolved to states. So out of a collection of ₹100, as much as ₹70.50 is the states’ share,” she wrote. “If full exemption from GST were given, the domestic producers of these items would be unable to offset taxes paid on their inputs and input services and would pass these on to the end consumers by increasing their price. Covid-19 vaccines are being provided free of cost by the GoI to those who are 45 years of age & above and to all frontline workers. On government supplies, GST is also paid by the government. From the GST collected on vaccine, half is earned by the Centre and the other half by the states. Further, 41% of Centre’s collections also get devolved to the states,” the tweets said.“So states end up receiving almost 70% of the total revenue collected from vaccines. In fact, a nominal 5% GST is in the interest of the domestic manufacturer of vaccine and in the interest of the citizens. If full exemption from GST is given, vaccine manufacturers would not be able to offset their input taxes and would pass them on to the end consumer/citizen by increasing the price. A 5% GST rate ensures that the manufacturer is able to utilise ITC and in case of overflow of ITC, claim refund. Hence exemption to vaccine from GST would be counterproductive without benefiting the consumer,” Sitharaman wrote. As Bengal recorded 19,441 new cases and 124 deaths on Sunday, the 160th birth anniversary of Rabindranath Tagore was observed in Bengal on Sunday without any celebration, the traditional live performances and mass gathering. PM Modi paid homage to the bard by writing tweets in Bengali and English. “On Tagore Jayanti, I bow to the great Gurudev Tagore. May his exemplary ideals keep giving us strength and inspiration to build the India he dreamt of,” wrote the Prime Minister. Banerjee held a brief official event at Rabindra Sadan in Kolkata where Tagore’s photograph was garlanded. The chief minister joined some of her ministers who sang a couple of songs Tagore composed. Brief events were held at Visva Bharati University that Tagore founded in Birbhum district, his ancestral house at Jorasanko in north Kolkata and at Rabindra Bharati University.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cm-mamata-seeks-gst-waiver-on-covid-19-equipment-already-done-tweets-sitharaman-101620574875710.html

The farmers are taking care of themselves by consuming 'kaadha' (a traditional Indian hot beverage mixed with herbs and spices to boost immunity) and multi-vitamins. The situation at the border area is normal, as it was earlier. There is nothing to worry about," said Sukhwinder Singh, a farmer.Farmer leader Kulwant Singh, who hails from Punjab, said a vaccination centre is being operated at a hospital at the Singhu border."One of our leaders tested positive for the Covid-19. He has recovered and is now doing well. Those who are showing symptoms are getting tested for the virus. The farmers at the border are taking a healthy diet. The vaccination process is underway at a hospital near the border. I got my first jab in Punjab. To get the next dose, I will go back to the state," Kulwant said.At Tikri and Ghazipur, the protestors said they have demanded for a vaccination facility but the government has not responded to their appeal yet. They added they are firmly resolved to stay put at Delhi's borders, and are making arrangements to ensure Covid-appropriate behaviour among crowds."We demanded the authorities to install a vaccination centre at Tikri border so that we could get the vaccine but nothing has happened so far," another farmer leader Buta Singh said, claiming the situation at Tikri "is normal".At Ghazipur on Delhi-Uttar Pradesh border, not more than three farmers stay in bigger camps now which used to house many more before the second wave of coronavirus began.The Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU), which is leading the charge there, recently arranged around 500 cots to ensure social distancing among the farmers when they sleep.Farmer leader Rakesh Tikait, who has got the first dose of vaccine, is also on the ground at Ghazipur leading his supporters, with all of them consuming 'kaadha' three to four times a day and lemonade too, BKU media in-charge Dharmendra Malik said."Thankfully, there has been no Covid positive case here till now. Some people had some health issues and they have got medication. Protestors are drinking 'kaadha' and 'nimbu paani' to improve immunity, several are taking multi-vitamins and zinc pills too," he told PTI.He said, "If you come to Ghazipur, you will see how amazingly normal the situation here is" despite the situation in Delhi, Ghaziabad and Noida looking so grim because of the deadly second wave.Malik said the BKU is also helping the oxygen langars, which provide oxygen cylinders to needy Covid patients, with whatever support the farmers union can extend."We are dealing with the situation and hoping the government would soon make some arrangement to get all farmers vaccinated," he said, but added, "that does not mean we are going away without the Centre accepting our demands."Hundreds of farmers have been camping at Delhi's borders since November 2020 with their demands that the Farmers' Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, Farmers' (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020 and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020 be rolled back and a new law made to guarantee minimum support price for crops.However, the government, which has held multiple rounds of formal dialogue with the protestors, has maintained that the laws are pro-farmer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/protest-farmers-work-on-immunity-seek-covid-vaccination-organise-oxygen-langars-101620569700643.html

The third phase began on April 1 for all above 45 years of age, while people aging above 18 to 45 became eligible for inoculation in the next phase which commenced on May 1.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covaxin-approved-for-children-above-12-years-fake-says-centre-101620572804060.html

Unlike previous lockdown, imposed since April this year, this lockdown will be enforced to tackle Covid-19 fiercely and bring the cases down further.Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Sunday singled out extra measures the government will take in the next phase of lockdown and said that this will be a stricter lockdown with suspension of Metro train services and prohibition of wedding ceremonies at public places.Stating that even though Covid-19 cases and positivity rate have come down in the last few days, Kejriwal said any leniency at this stage would squander the gains achieved so far in the current wave of the pandemic.In a revamped and stricter lockdown, marriages in Delhi will be held at home or in courts with not more than 20 people, according to an order issued by the Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA).The government has ordered a complete prohibition on marriage ceremonies at public places, banquet halls, hotels and similar places during the period.Service providers or owners of hotels, banquets, marriage halls, sound system, DJ, catering will have to return the advance payments for marriages during the lockdown or will have to mutually agree on a later date for the ceremonies, the order by the Delhi government said.The Delhi government had been forced to impose lockdown amid a steep rise in Covid-19 cases on April 19. Although the cases have come down and positivity rate has reduced from the high of 35 per cent on April 26 to 21.67 per cent now, but strictness is needed, Kejriwal said.Authorities including local administration, police, civic bodies and Mandis will be responsible for ensuring Covid-19-appropriate behaviour at inter-state bus terminals, railway stations, wholesale vegetable and fruit markets and shops providing essential goods, it said.In order to break the chain further and reducing footfall in public spaces, the services of Delhi Metro will also be suspended during the lockdown. The Metro trains were so far operating with 50 per cent seating capacity and ban on standing commuters."The restrictions need to be upheld for some time more. Otherwise, we will lose whatever we have achieved till now. As I have mentioned earlier, this is an extremely difficult period, the second wave is quite deadly, with many losing lives. First and foremost, we have to save lives.”The lockdown scheduled to end at 5 am on Monday will now be extended up to May 17 morning.Movement on the roads will also be closely monitored during the lockdown.Police authorities will ensure effective checking of persons and vehicles on the roads by putting adequate number of pickets with the objective to prevent unnecessary movement of people on roads during curfew, the DDMA said."Delhi Police will also ensure that movement of individuals and vehicles should be allowed strictly as per the guidelines/ protocols prescribed in the curfew order."Kejriwal cited feedback from many stakeholders and said that the opinion was in favour of extending lockdown for another week."We must remember Jaan Hai Toh, Jahan Hai...this time, the lockdown will be stricter and the Delhi Metro will not ply from tomorrow," he said in an online briefing.Lockdown was imposed on April 20 amid rise in Covid-19 cases. Positivity rate touched 35 per cent but with cooperation of the people, it now stands at around 21 per cent, he said.Delhi on Sunday recorded 13,336 fresh cases of coronavirus disease, pushing the cumulative tally to 1,323,567. The national capital's daily death count also fell below 300 on Sunday after 273 fatalities were recorded, the health bulletin showed. A total of 19,344 people have succumbed to the viral disease so far, the bulletin stated.The positivity rate - the proportion of samples that turn positive among all tests conducted - also dipped to 21.67 per cent on Sunday, a sharp decline from 35 per cent recorded last month, indicating reduced spread of the disease among people in Delhi. The national capital's positivity rate rose to its highest at over 35% two weeks back on April 26 but has gradually come down afterward.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-metro-20-people-in-weddings-delhi-to-see-stricter-lockdown-till-may-17-101620565968248.html

The death toll in the last 24 hours increased by 572; the overall toll now stands at 75,849. This marks a decline from the 53,605 Covid cases and 864 deaths recorded on Saturday and is due to the lesser number of samples tested.According to state government's health bulletin, 2,47,466 samples were tested in the last 24 hours, as against 2,60,751 samples on Saturday and 2,68,912 on Friday. A total of 2,94,38,797 samples have been tested for Covid-19 till date, the health bulletin showed.Financial hub Mumbai recorded 2,395 new cases of Covid-19 on Sunday, witnessing a decline from the 2,664 cases the city had recorded a day before. The capital city did, however, record a slightly higher death toll on Sunday, after 68 people succumbed to the virus as compared to 62 deaths recorded on Saturday. The death toll in Mumbai now stands at 13,781.

Thackeray also said that experts have opined a third wave of Covid-19 has the potential to affect children and keeping this mind the government has started to set up a paediatric task force.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/maharashtra-records-48-401-new-covid-19-cases-572-deaths-in-the-last-24-hours-mumbai-cases-dip-further-to-2395-101620570472408.html
09-05-2021||India||Nirav Modi's appeal against extradition awaits UK High Court judge decision||Fugitive diamond merchant Nirav Modi, whose extradition to India was ordered last month by UK Home Secretary Priti Patel in the estimated USD 2-billion Punjab National Bank (PNB) scam case, has filed an application for permission to appeal against the order in the High Court in London.The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) confirmed an appeal has been lodged but a High Court judge who will make a decision on the matter is yet to be assigned.“The matter has not been sent to a judge for consideration on the papers,” the Administrative Division of the Royal Courts of Justice in London said this week.In the first instance, a High Court judge will make a decision “on the papers” submitted for the appeal and determine if there are any grounds for an appeal against the Home Secretary’s decision or the Westminster Magistrates Court February ruling in favour of Modi’s extradition to India to face charges of fraud and money laundering.Following that decision, there is scope for the defence team to seek an oral hearing to plead their case. There are no certain time-frames for the legal processes involved, which could take months.“We are waiting to see if they do apply for permission to appeal. If they are allowed to appeal then we would contest any appeal proceedings on behalf of the GOI (government of India),” a CPS spokesperson had said earlier.Meanwhile, 50-year-old Modi remains behind bars at Wandsworth Prison in south-west London since his arrest over two years ago on March 19, 2019.In his ruling in February, District Judge Sam Goozee said that the diamond merchant has a case to answer before the Indian courts and that the bars to extradition under UK law do not apply in his case.As part of a very comprehensive judgment, the judge concluded that he was satisfied that there is evidence upon which Modi could be convicted in relation to the conspiracy to defraud the PNB.“A prima facie case is established,” he said, in relation to all counts of charges brought by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) and Enforcement Directorate (ED) -- including money laundering, intimidation of witnesses and disappearance of evidence.The court had also accepted that while Modi's mental health had deteriorated due to the lengthy incarceration in a London prison, exacerbated by the Covid-19 pandemic, his risk of suicide did not meet the high threshold to conclude that it would be "unjust or oppressive" to extradite him.Modi is the subject of two sets of criminal proceedings, with the CBI case relating to a large-scale fraud upon PNB through the fraudulent obtaining of letters of undertaking (LoUs) or loan agreements, and the ED case relating to the laundering of the proceeds of that fraud. He also faces two additional charges of "causing the disappearance of evidence" and intimidating witnesses or “criminal intimidation to cause death”, which were added on to the CBI case.As witnessed in the extradition case of former Kingfisher Airlines chief Vijay Mallya -- who remains on bail in the UK while a “confidential” matter, believed to be related to an asylum request, is resolved -- there is still some way to go before Modi can be moved from Wandsworth Prison in London to Barrack 12 Arthur Road Jail in Mumbai and face trial in India.

09-05-2021||India||Covid-appropriate behaviour, vaccination main shields against all mutants, future waves: Experts||With the second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic ravaging the country and concerns being raised about a possible third wave, experts caution that the next wave could be less severe if people keep following Covid-appropriate behaviour and a large portion of the population is vaccinated.According to the Union Health Ministry data released on Sunday morning, India recorded 4,03,738 fresh Covid-19 cases in the last 24 hours, pushing the country's cumulative tally to 2,22,96,414, while the death toll climbed to 2,42,362 with 4,092 daily deaths.There has been a sharp surge in infections over the past couple of months, making the second wave much worse than the first one that began in early 2020 and peaked in the last quarter of that year before the tally hit a trough in the first quarter of 2021.Several experts believe that a casual approach that followed the trough of the first wave could be a possible reason for the pandemic raising its head again, though others are also putting the blame on the new mutants and variants of the virus being more virulent.K VijayRaghavan, Principal Scientific Adviser, had said on Wednesday last week that the third wave was inevitable and it was necessary to be prepared for new waves, but clarified two days later that the "insidious asymptomatic transmission" can be stopped if prescribed guidelines about precautions, surveillance, containment, treatment and testing are followed."If we take strong measures, the third wave may not happen in all places or indeed anywhere at all. It depends on much how effectively guidance is implemented at the local level in the states, districts and cities everywhere," he said.According to experts, in a few months when the immunity people have developed naturally or with the help of vaccination fades, the virus strikes again and the only thing that can stop the virus from bouncing back is how people are guarding themselves."Early this year, as the new cases receded, people started interacting as if there was no virus. The immunity had already started declining. They organised mass gatherings, they stopped wearing masks, giving the opportunity to the virus to strike again," said Dr Anurag Agarwal, director, Institute of Genomics and Integral Biology, New Delhi."While we anticipate a third wave, we cannot say when exactly it will come or how severe it will be. But if people keep following Covid-appropriate behaviour in coming months and we are able to vaccinate a large number of people, the third wave could be less severe," Dr Agarwal added.While the sudden surge in the number of cases during the second wave has led to panic among people, what is adding to their fear is the constant threat of new mutants of the virus and how these mutants could potentially harm them.Some experts, however, believe that mutations are a common phenomenon, and the mutations do not generally affect the prevention, treatment, or vaccination.'Every virus, while replicating in the host's body, mutates. The virus is a prolific multiplier, but its replication is error-prone and so every copy it makes of itself may not be its exact replica."Any change, minor or major, that occurs in its structure is known as a mutation. A virus undergoes hundreds and thousands of such mutations," said Dr Saumitra Das, Director, National Institute of Biomedical Genomics (NIBMG ), Kalyani, and professor, Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore.Experts also said that every mutation cannot be a cause of concern and genome sequencing of a virus is done to keep a track of any mutation that can make a virus more dangerous."What concerns us is whether a mutation is making it more transmissible, or virulent; whether a mutation has the potential to make the existing medicines or vaccines ineffective against the virus. If so, the mutant is classified as a variant of concern (VoC)," said Dr Das.Mutations shown so far in the novel coronavirus have not warranted any change in the required treatment or vaccines, but experts believe it is technologically possible to tweak the medicine or a vaccine quickly to fight a mutant that poses a threat to their efficacy."But in the case of Covid-19, since its spread has been so rapid, it is not giving our scientists enough time to identify all the mutants. And so, the role of Covid-appropriate behaviour is as critical as ever in controlling its spread," said Dr Arun Sharma, a community medicine expert and director of NIIRNCD (ICMR), Jodhpur.He said a virus mutant can escape the body's immunity and undo the efforts to developing an effective vaccine or medicine against it, but chances of it escaping the shield called Covid-appropriate behaviour are low."A three-ply mask, frequent hand washing or sanitising, maintaining physical distance, avoiding crowd, especially indoors, are still most effective in controlling the spread of Covid-19 virus," Dr Sharma added.He said any virus starts a chain of transmission by infecting the most vulnerable population and it keeps infecting till the time everyone susceptible is infected and then it starts dying out."We treat the patients with antiviral drugs, and we protect the population through vaccination. These measures help us break the virus's chain of transmission," he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covidappropriate-behaviour-vaccination-main-shields-against-all-mutants-future-waves-experts-101620565464044.html
09-05-2021||India||'Need 83 lakh Covid doses every month': Kejriwal explains 3-month plan to Centre||Aiming to vaccinate citizens of the national capital by July this year, Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Sunday sought an increase in vaccine doses supplied to the city-state in a letter to Union health minister Harsh Vardhan.CM Kejriwal also asked the Union health minister to allow states to develop apps or separate mechanisms to facilitate vaccination drives in the wake of glitches being reported from Co-WIN app, an online platform used for registering people seeking vaccination doses."Delhi has around 92 lakh people in 18-45 age group. I urge you to direct Serum Institute of India and Bharat Biotech to increase their monthly supplies to Delhi to 60 lakh doses per month during May to July 2021," Kejriwal wrote in the letter.Also read: Received 71% of SC-approved oxygen on Saturday, says Delhi's oxygen bulletinThe CM said that Delhi will need 83 lakh doses every month for both the age group of 18-45 and above 45 so that vaccination can be completed in the next three months.Explaining the demography in the divided age groups in numbers, Kejriwal said "45+ age group has about 57 lakh persons. They would need 1.14 crore doses, out of which we have received 43 lakh doses. We need additional 71 lakh doses to cover this group.""To complete it in three months, we would need 23 lakh doses per month from the GoI channel during the three months of May to July, 2021," Kejriwal said in his letter to health minister.Highlighting a potential threat, Kejriwal said that as the third wave of Covid-19 is also anticipated soon, the Delhi government would want to complete vaccination of all people within three months."We are now using one lakh vaccines every day, which is going to be increased to three lakhs. Therefore, we will have the capacity to apply 90 lakh vaccines per month," the CM said.In his letter, Kejriwal also sought equal pricing of the vaccine distribution among private and state buyers. He stated that the price of vaccine should be the same - whether sold to the state government or a private hospital. In the current situation, Kejriwal said that the vaccine makers will give the jabs to private hospitals first because it has more benefit (private hospital gets expensive dose).Also read: Does Covid-19 increase risk of heart attack?

Venkaiah Naidu stating his concern about the deadly second wave of coronavirus infections and urged them to convene an all-party meeting to strategically plan how to curb the rapid spread of the virus.“Parliament had allocated Rs. 35000 crore in the Union Budget to ensure free vaccine for all, despite which the Union government has allowed private companies to set differential prices for the vaccine,” wrote Kharge in his letter to the Prime Minister. He further emphasised on waiving off GST on life saving products and to increase the working hours to 200 under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act of 2005.The senior Congress leader wrote about the vaccine drive which began on May 1 for people above 18 years of age. “The Union government must leverage compulsory licensing to increase production of vaccines,” he wrote in his letter. He requested the Union government to “proactively disburse relief material, allocate it fairly to all states and disclose the when and where of the shipped material.” He urged the Prime Minister to leverage collective strengths by governing inclusively.Kharge’s letter to Rajya Sabha Chairman M. Venkaiah Naidu focussed on “bringing to the notice of the Chairman the 123rd Report of the Department Related Standing Committee on Health and Family Welfare, which made vital recommendations vis-à-vis coping with the Covid-19 pandemic,” and requested him to take cognisance of the report and secure the action taken report on it as deemed fit. He urged him to convene virtual meetings of the Standing Committees as they would ensure accountability, and allow all stakeholders to collectively explore solutions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/congress-leader-mallikarjun-kharge-writes-to-pm-modi-offers-suggestions-to-curb-covid-19-surge-101620564493869.html
09-05-2021||India||GST exemption on Covid-19 drugs to make them costlier: FM Sitharaman||Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Sunday said GST exemption to domestic supplies and commercial import of Coviddrugs, vaccines and oxygen concentrators would make these items costlier for consumers as manufacturers would not be able to offset the taxes paid on inputs. Currently, domestic supplies and commercial imports of vaccines attract a 5 per cent Goods and Services Tax (GST), while it is 12 per cent in case of Covid drugs and oxygen concentrators. "If full exemption from GST is given, vaccine manufacturers would not be able to offset their input taxes and would pass them on to the end consumer/citizen by increasing the price. A 5 per cent GST rate ensures that the manufacturer is able to utilise ITC and in case of overflow of ITC, claim refund. Hence exemption to vaccine from GST would be counterproductive without benefiting the consumer," Sitharaman tweeted. She further said that if Integrated GST (IGST) ₹100 is collected on an item, ₹50 accrues to the Centre and the States each as Central GST and State GST respectively. Further 41 per cent of the CGST revenue is devolved to States. So out of a collection of ₹100, as much as ₹70.50 is the share of the states. From the GST collected on vaccine, half is earned by the Centre and the other half by the States. Further, 41 per cent of Centre's collections also get devolved to the States. So states end up receiving almost 70 per cent of the total revenue collected from vaccines. "In fact, a nominal 5 per cent GST is in the interest of the domestic manufacturer of vaccine and in the interest of the citizens," Sitharaman said. West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee earlier in the day wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi seeking exemption from GST and customs duty any donations of oxygen concentrators, cylinders, cryogenic storage tanks and Covid related drugs from organisations or agencies. The Finance Minister tweeted her response to the Chief Minister's letter, saying these items are already exempted from customs duty and health cess. Besides, Integrated GST (IGST) is also exempted on all Covid relief material imported by the Indian Red Cross for free distribution in the country. Also IGST exemption has been given in case of goods when imported free of cost for free distribution in the country by any entity, state government, relief agency or autonomous body on the basis of a certificate issued by a state government. "In order to augment the availability of these items, government has also provided full exemption from basic customs duty and health cess to their commercial imports," Sitharaman said. The government has already exempted from customs duty import of a host of Covid-related relief materials, including Remdesivir injection and its APIs, Inflammatory diagnostic (markers) kits, medical grade oxygen, oxygen therapy related equipment such as oxygen concentrators, cryogenic transport tanks, etc, and Covid vaccines. Besides, effective May 3, the government exempted IGST on import of Covid-relief material received as donation for free distribution in the country, a move which helped speed up customs clearances of such imports. This exemption would be subject to nodal authorities, appointed by the state governments, authorising any entity, relief agency or statutory body, for free distribution of such relief material. The said goods can be imported free of cost by a state government or, any entity/ relief agency/ statutory body, authorized in this regard for free distribution anywhere in India.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/gst-exemption-on-covid-19-drugs-to-make-them-costlier-fm-sitharaman-101620564132250.html

It has put in place an extensive vaccination programme.Earlier in the day, the Odisha government decided to give priority to vaccination of 18 to 44 age group people in five municipal corporations where the positivity rate of Covid-19 infection is relatively high."The state has started the process of procurement of Covid-19 vaccine for vaccination of I8 to 44 years age group from state's own funds. At present, as the manufacturers are able to supply a small quantity of vaccines, we are starting vaccination of 18 to 44 years age group only in five municipal corporations," wrote additional chief secretary PK Mohapatra in a letter to all district collectors on Saturday.Odisha registered 10,635 new Covid-19 cases on Saturday, the state health department said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/odisha-govt-allocates-rs-60-lakh-to-feed-stray-animals-during-covid-19-lockdown-101620559935125.html

The defence ministry passed an order on Saturday to allow the AFMS to recruit these doctors who were released from service between 2017 and 2019. “The order says fixed monthly lump sum amount will be admissible by deducting the basic pension from the salary drawn at the time of retirement plus specialist pay wherever applicable. The amount would remain unchanged for the term of the contract and no other allowances would be paid,” said a defence ministry statement on Sunday. The armed forces are operating in full battle mode for Covid-19 relief and foresee a bigger role for themselves in the coming weeks and months to help tackle the devastating second wave of the pandemic even as they cater to the health needs of serving soldiers, veterans and their dependents, as reported by HT on May 6. The armed forces are in the vanguard of the fight against the deadly disease --- from helping meet the exploding demand for oxygen to setting up dedicated Covid-19 hospitals and opening doors of military hospitals to civilians to transporting critical medical stores.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/military-set-to-employ-400-retired-doctors-to-strengthen-covid-19-fight-101620562993786.html

Top doctor lists out warning signs||Eminent cardiologist Dr. Naresh Trehan in an exclusive interview to Hindustan Times's Kumkum Chadha spoke on warning signs and preventive steps that heart patients should look at when the second wave of coronavirus disease (Covid-19) is infecting people of all age at a rapid pace. Dr. Trehan cited instances of heart attacks in many patients without any pre-existing history of any heart-related ailment. Here’s what he said:HEART PATIENTS AT RISKAt least 15-20% of patients are getting affected by the virus in their heart, the cardiologist noted. While patients with a history of heart-related illness or those who had stents installed in their hearts or have undergone a bypass surgery are found to be seeking medical help for enhanced symptoms after they contracted coronavirus disease, what is worrying is that in some cases patients with no pre-existing history of cardiac ailment reportedly got an attack, Dr. Trehan said, adding that in most cases patients complained of chest pain and could be rescued but in some instances, the attacks so quick and acute and they could not be revived. "Their heart function goes to 10-15%, exposing them to the severe risk of fatality", the doctor said.YOUNG PATIENTS WITH NO PRE-EXISTING HEART AILMENT GETTING ATTACKS“What are we seeing this time as opposed to the last time (the first wave of Covid-19) is that younger people are getting more affected than older people with a known history of heart ailment,” Dr. Trehan said. He cited alarming instances where young patients suddenly develop pulmonary edema — fluid accumulation in the tissue and air spaces of the lungs, leading to impaired breathing and eventually respiratory failure — and almost 70% of them get acute myocarditis (inflammation of the heart muscle), making the chance of their revival thin.“This viral wave is different from the first one which is fatally affecting young people as low as 33 years old with no earlier signs of a heart disease,” he said.TIMELY MEDICAL INTERVENTION CAN SAVE LIVESThe doctor said in most cases, by the time when such patients are referred to a speciality hospital it becomes too late. “Only if such patients are taken to a hospital on time and put on ECMO support that the patients can be supported for a couple of weeks with the hope that they will recover.”He warned that the caution that young people will have to adopt during the pandemic is the same as those in the older and vulnerable group need to.ANXIETY HAS A ROLEPLAY. DE-STRESSDr. Trehan further said anxiety plays an important role in patients infected by coronavirus infection. He said anxiety makes the body’s adrenaline go up, thus spiking the blood pressure and in the process increasing the heart rate, which can be detrimental for a patient infected with the virus.ALSO READ: Why Covid-19 cases exploding in India? WHO top scientist answersThe doctor suggested the people follow a three-step process to get relief from anxiety. “One, you must exercise to keep your immunity up; two, you must do de-stressing techniques daily no matter whether you are infected or not; and the third is to maintain a healthy nutrition by consuming at least 30-40 grams of protein every day.”He also suggested the people try yoga and breathing exercise to keep their body at ease.WARNING SIGNS TO LOOK FORThe noted cardiologists also spoke on warning signs that every heart patient must look out for.He suggested those with pre-existing heart ailments watch out for heaviness or shortness of breath and simultaneously check their oxygen saturation on a pulse oximeter before consulting a cardiologist for guidance.“You must not take these situations lightly,” he said, further warning people against copying prescriptions of patients with similar symptoms.VACCINES SAFE FOR HEART PATIENTSDr. Trehan also stressed that the vaccines against coronavirus are safe for patients with heart ailments. He, however, advised the people who take blood thinners to inform the vaccinators about it. “Although the medicine does not need to be adjusted most of the time, the vaccinators are trained to administer the doses in a specific manner on a person if they inform the medical staff if they on blood thinners. The vaccinator will put constant pressure for three minutes or so on the site of the injection.”ALSO READ: Top doctors discuss Covid-19 second wave, explain why vaccine is importantThe cardiologist said communication between patients and their doctors need to be intense during this time to mitigate any inherent risk.DON’T RUSH TO HOSPITALSThe doctor appealed to the people not to rush to the hospital unless the situation calls for it. “There is no such thing as preventive care. Constant monitoring is what is needed.Dr. Trehan had earlier, too, said most patients suffering from the coronavirus will recover from home if they start their medication on time. “As soon as your RT-PCR report comes positive, my advice would be to consult your local doctor. All doctors nowadays know the protocol and will begin your treatment accordingly,” Dr Trehan had said last month.The interview comes at a time when healthcare centres across the country are overwhelmed to cater to an exponential rise in the number of critical patients infected with the coronavirus disease amid shortages of oxygen and essential drugs.The country is struggling to produce and distribute enough doses of Covid-19 vaccines to stem Covid-19 as a long list of states are complaining of shortages, leading to the delay in immunisation drive.India on Sunday recorded 403,738 new cases of Covid-19 infection and 4,092 related deaths in a single day, according to data updated by the Union ministry of health and family welfare. With the latest addition, the total Covid-19 caseload has now soared to 22,296,414.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/does-covid-19-increase-risk-of-heart-attack-top-doctor-lists-out-warning-signs-101620561101530.html

The second wave of the pandemic has pushed the death toll in the country over 200,000 and starved hospitals of life-saving medical oxygen and beds.The issue of negligence is slated to be heard in the Supreme Court on Monday after a Public Interest Litigation has been filed by Noida-based Advocate-on-Record (AOR), Sanjai Kumar Pathak, seeking directions for strict enforcement of Covid-19 pandemic guidelines and for action against all those who had allegedly violated protocols during assembly elections in several states and the Kumbh Mela.A three-judge bench of the apex court, headed by Justice Dr Dhananjaya Y Chandrachud, and also comprising justices Nageshwar Rao and Ravindra Bhat will hear the petition filed by the advocate Pathak who filed the plea on April 16.India is caught in the highest surge of Covid-19 since the onset of the Covid pandemic, but visuals had surfaced of lakhs of devotees crowding in Haridwar, Uttarakhand, for Kumbh Mela and in the election rallies in states, ignoring the most basic of Covid-19 protocols, Pathak said in his petition.Even though the disease is currently spreading at breakneck speed across the country, the Indian railways had organised 25 special trains to facilitate congregation and to link Haridwar Kumbh Mela to various locations for the pilgrims as per certain media report, the plea read further.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-reviews-covid-19-situation-in-uttarakhand-speaks-to-cm-rawat-101620558546530.html

It is choking our health care system," Patil, who is the state's water resources minister, tweeted on Saturday night.The NCP shares power in Maharashtra with the Shiv Sena and Congress.Since GST related decisions are within the purview of the GST council, copy of the letter has been sent to all state finance ministers so that the matter is addressed expeditiously, the ASSOCHAM letter said.It said to meet the huge and sudden demand of medicinal drugs and devices, hospitals are installing PSA plants, and states, corporates, individuals and donors are buying oxygen concentrators, cylinders, cryogenic storage tanks, tankers and containers, the industry body said.These measures are imperative for the country to ensure there are no supply constraints with respect to these life saving items to meet not only the current surge, but also prepare for the impending third wave of the pandemic, it said in the letter.India recorded 4,03,738 fresh Covid-19 cases in a day, which pushed the tally to 2,22,96,414, according to the Union health ministry data updated on Sunday.The death toll climbed to 2,42,362 with 4,092 daily deaths, the data updated at 8 am showed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid19-ncp-demands-gst-waiver-on-oxygen-equipment-essential-medicines-101620551781815.html

His certificate of vaccination dated May 5, issued at the Government Doon Medical Hospital in Dehradun, was also shared on social media, following stinging criticism from the Congress party and the AAP. “The episode has completely exposed the government’s... Covid-19 management. On one hand, when [the] common man is dying due to lack of basic medical facilities, BJP MLA Champion is getting his 25-year-old son vaccinated,” said Congress state vice president Suryakant Dhasmana. “It’s a joke on the common man... that the VIP syndrome prevails unapologetically even in a pandemic,” Dhasmana added. AAP state president SS Kaler said it was an “insult of [the] common man”. “On the one hand, youth are dying on roads lacking treatment in hospitals but BJP’s privileged people like Champion are able to get their hands on the vaccines for their ineligible kin.”After receiving one lakh doses of vaccine on Saturday evening, the state health department has announced that the inoculation drive for people in the 18-45 years age bracket will start from May 10. Responding to the controversy, state health secretary Amit Negi said, “The department would find out how Champion’s 25-year-old son received the jab.”Pranav Singh, meanwhile, claimed his son was a “frontline warrior” in the fight against Covid-19 pandemic and was thus eligible to receive the vaccine as per government’s policy. He also shared photographs of his son distributing masks to police personnel in his constituency.“I don’t know what it is with the media that anything related to me is turned into a controversy unnecessarily. Media always antagonises me like in this case when my son has done nothing wrong. He has been distributing Covid-19 relief material along with me as a frontline warrior, hence he got the jab,” said Champion.He further claimed that in his constituency residents in the 18-44 age group were being vaccinated since April 30. “I would like to invite members of the Congress and the AAP in the age group to get inoculated in my constituency,” he said.Meanwhile, a staff at Doon Government Hospital said the BJP MLA came to the hospital to get his wife vaccinated on May 5 and “asked the nurses on duty to vaccinate his son too.”“He came to the vaccination centre with his armed guards. And considering his controversial background, the nurses there didn’t dare to oppose his demand and gave the jab to his son, “said the hospital staff who didn’t wish to be named.Pranav Singh Champion is known for controversies including for an incident where he was seen dancing while brandishing guns with liquor lying nearby. In another instance, he used derogatory remarks for another BJP MLA from scheduled caste category, following which he was thrown out of the party before being reinstated last year by the BJP state leadership.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/uttarakhand-bjp-mla-champion-gets-25-year-old-son-vaccinated-out-of-turn-slammed-101620556873338.html

09-05-2021||India||ISRO develops 3 cost-effective ventilators, oxygen concentrator||The Indian Space Research Organisation’s Vikram Sarabhai Space Centre (VSSC) in Thiruvananthapuram, said it has developed three different types of ventilators and an oxygen concentrator at a time when a shortage of these critical medical equipment resulted in deaths of many Covid-19 patients across the country.Technology transfer will be done for the commercial production of these three ventilators and the one oxygen concentrator by this month itself, said VSSC director S Somanath. Likely to be priced around ₹1 lakh, the ventilators developed by the ISRO were cost effective and easy to handle compared to the mini conventional ventilators that are currently priced around ₹5 lakh.“Based on designs, features and specifications, we have named them, Prana, VaU and Svasta. All three are user-friendly, fully automated and with touch-screen specifications, meeting all safety standards,” the director said, adding doctors and other experts have checked its efficacy and confirmed it meets international standards.In fact the VSSC started working on these ventilators during the first wave in March 2020 but the work slowed down with the threat diminishing late last year. However, the institute was asked to expedite work after the second wave of the disease stunned the country’s healthcare system, causing several deaths due to lack of ventilators, oxygen and Covid-19 medicines such as Remdesivir.While Prana is meant to deliver respiratory gas to the patient by automated compression of an Ambu bag, Svasta is designed to work without electric power, and the VaU is a low-cost ventilator equivalent to commercially available high-end ventilators.“The system is envisaged as a dual-mode ventilator that can work with either medical air/oxygen from the hospital or with ambient air,” director S Somanath said.The VSSC has also developed a portable medical oxygen concentrator called Shwaas. “It is capable of supplying 10 litre enriched oxygen per minute, adequate for two patients at a time,” he said. It enhances the oxygen gas content by selectively separating the nitrogen gas from ambient air through Pressure Swing Adsorption (PSA) which is commonly used for production of oxygen from air, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/isros-vikram-sarabhai-centre-develops-3-cost-effective-ventilators-oxygen-concentrator-101620552673162.html

To a large extent, it is happening to people who have diabetes. It is very uncommon in those who are not diabetic. There is no big outbreak and we are monitoring it," he had said.According to Dr Paul, mucor attacks people with uncontrolled sugar.If a diabetes patient is taking immuno-suppressive medicines, steroids, or has cancer, then the impact of mucormycosis is more on him/her.The chances of getting this disease increase in such patients if they have been exposed to wet surfaces, he had said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mucormycosis-gujarat-sets-up-special-wards-in-hospitals-procures-anti-fungal-drug-vials-101620550693969.html

We helped many countries during the first wave of Covid-19, resulting, today most of the countries are standing with us due to his efforts. Many leaders including Prime Ministers of several countries have extended their support to India."The Union Minister further asserted that "if Rahul Gandhi wants to do politics at this time of crisis, he can go ahead."The Congress leader has been constantly attacking the Central government over the worsening condition of coronavirus situation across the country.Talking about the oxygen status in Hamirpur parliamentary constituency, the Minister said that it will get three oxygen plants soon."We have started installing oxygen plants in Hamirpur parliamentary constituency and in the next 10-15 days they will start functioning. In a record time of 1-month, we will deliver three oxygen plants to the constituency," Thakur told ANI.The Union Minister further said that last year in 2020, when the coronavirus hit the country we then needed masks, PPE kits and other related things but this time the demand for oxygen has increased rapidly."Apart from the three plants, other oxygen plants also being established by the PM CARE funds. We are going to provide masks, PPE kits, Oxygen cylinders, Oxygen concentrators and other facilities in each district in Himachal Pradesh in seven days," he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/due-to-pm-modi-s-efforts-india-getting-foreign-support-amid-covid-19-says-anurag-thakur-101620549916741.html
09-05-2021||India||Himanta Biswa Sarma chosen Assam’s new chief minister; will replace Sonowal||Himanta Biswa Sarma was named the next chief minister of Assam on Sunday and he will replace incumbent Sarbananda Sonowal to the top post. Sarma’s name as BJP’s legislature party leader was announced by union agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar who was appointed a central observer for the meeting along with party’s national general secretary Arun Singh. Sarma’s name was formally confirmed at the first legislature party meeting of the 60 newly elected MLAs of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), held at the state assembly, after days of backroom lobbying in Guwahati and official meetings in Delhi following the announcement of assembly election results on May 2. Sarma’s name for the post was proposed by Sonowal and seconded by BJP state president Ranjeet Kumar Dass. It was also supported by newly elected MLA from Halflong, Nandita Gorlosa. “I asked other MLAs if they had any other names in mind. No other name was suggested. Since the name of Sarma, a senior minister in our state government was the only one that was proposed, he is unanimously chosen as the legislature party leader,” Tomar said after the meeting. On Saturday, two main claimants to the top post, Sonowal and Sarma were summoned by the party leadership to Delhi where they had several rounds of meetings with BJP national president JP Nadda and others. Both leaders returned to Guwahati late on Saturday night in the same flight. BJP office bearers in the know of the developments said the leadership decided in Sarma’s favour after the discussions. Sonowal, who was part of the first Narendra Modi government at Centre, is likely to be accommodated in the Union cabinet again at a later date. The formality of announcing Sarma (52) as the next CM took place in the presence of Tomar and Singh. Another national general secretary BL Santosh and party in-charge for Assam, Baijayant Jay Panda, were also present. Earlier on Sunday morning, Sonowal submitted his resignation to governor Jagdish Mukhi before proceeding with Sarma in the same vehicle to take part in the meeting of newly elected legislators. Sarma is expected to take oath of office on Sunday at Srimanta Sankardev Kalakshetra in Guwahati with a small cabinet, which will be expanded in the next few days. Sunday’s development marks a major landmark in Sarma’s sharp rise within BJP, a party which he joined in 2015 after parting ways with then Congress chief minister Tarun Gogoi, in whose cabinet he was a minister for three consecutive terms since 2001. Sarma played a crucial role in BJP forming its first government in Assam in 2016 and was allotted finance, health, education and public works department (PWD) portfolios in the Sonowal cabinet. As convenor of North East Democratic Alliance (NEDA), the conglomeration of anti-Congress regional parties in northeast, Sarma was also responsible for BJP forming governments in Arunachal Pradesh, Manipur and Tripura and becoming part of the ruling coalition in Nagaland and Meghalaya in the past few years. Despite criticism from some, Sarma earned mass support with the way he handled the Covid-19 crisis visiting patients in hospitals, overseeing the setting up of Covid care centres and ensuring proper care for those infected. He carried forward that goodwill during the assembly election campaign addressing rallies in all parts of the state and conducting roadshows where thousands turned up to watch him. Sarma also influenced the selection of candidates and actively campaigned to ensure another term for the BJP. Party leaders say he enjoys support of at least 40 of the new MLAs, tilting the balance in his favour. The delay in announcement of a CM’s name and formation of the next government despite a clear mandate at a time when the state is witnessing a rapid rise in new Covid-19 cases and deaths had led to criticism of the BJP by opposition parties and experts. Assam assembly has a total of 126 seats. While the BJP won 60, its allies Asom Gana Parishad and United People’s Party Liberal (UPPL) won 9 and 6 seats respectively, taking the alliance’s total to 75 seats.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/himanta-biswa-sarma-chosen-assam-s-new-chief-minister-will-replace-sonowal-101620549972843.html

09-05-2021||India||Chhattisgarh begins online booking and home delivery of liquor amid criticism||Chhattisgarh on Sunday allowed online sale and home delivery of liquor in the state claiming it will help prevent its black marketing during the ongoing lockdown. The opposition parties have criticised the move as “insensitive” and “irresponsible” and said the government should instead be focusing on mitigating the shortage of essential medical supplies including oxygen and vaccines, hampering the fight against Covid-19 across the state. Government officials on Sunday said the home delivery of liquor beginning May 10 will help curb its illegal manufacturing, sale, transportation and possession during the lockdown, when liquor shops are closed.“The timing for the home delivery has been fixed from 9 am till 8 pm. The district administration can change the timings as per the local situation. Chhattisgarh State Marketing Corporation Limited (CSMCL) will decide which wine shops will provide home delivery service and customers will have to make payment in advance...,” an order issued by the state excise department stated. It said up to 5 litres of liquor could be booked per person on the CSMCL website or its app with an additional charge of ₹100 for home delivery, available within 15 kms of the concerned wine shop. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the Janata Congress Chhattisgarh (JCC) said the government’s move was insensitive. “...In [the] present condition, the state needs[s] davaa (medicines) not daaru (liquor ), but the government is shameless... This is the most apathetic decision of the state government and not in the benefit of people. The government is worried about... commission of liquor not about the common man,” BJP leader and spokesperson Gauri Shankar Srivas said citing the shortage of medicines and injections in parts of the state. Chhattisgarh on Saturday reported 12,239 Covid-19 cases and 223 deaths, taking the infection count to 8,42,356 and the toll to 10,381, a health official said.Excise minister Kawasi Lakhma backed the decision saying it was taken to prevent liquor smuggling from other states. “As the state is under Covid-19 curfew for about the last two months, liquor shops have also been shut. This has paved the way for the illegal smuggling of liquor from surrounding states. Our police force is working hard to stop this. Secondly, there have been numerous incidents of death due to poisoned, local and syrup consumption as liquor shops are closed,” Lakma said and pointed out to a recent incident when nine persons died in Bilaspur after consuming syrup in place of liquor.JCC chief Amit Jogi claimed that the incumbent government’s priorities had changed. “This is the same government which got a mandate for prohibition of liquor in the state and now is delivering it to homes when people need vaccination.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/chhattisgarh-begins-online-booking-and-home-delivery-of-liquor-amid-criticism-101620546432575.html

09-05-2021||India||Why Covid-19 cases exploding in India? WHO top scientist answers||A Covid-19 variant spreading in India is more contagious and may be dodging vaccine protections, contributing to the country's explosive outbreak, the World Health Organization's chief scientist said Saturday.In an interview with AFP, Soumya Swaminathan warned that "the epidemiological features that we see in India today do indicate that it's an extremely rapidly spreading variant".India on Saturday for the first time registered more than 4,000 Covid-19 deaths in just 24 hours, and more than 400,000 new infections.New Delhi has struggled to contain the outbreak, which has overwhelmed its healthcare system, and many experts suspect the official death and case numbers are a gross underestimate.Swaminathan, an Indian paediatrician and clinical scientist, said the B.1.617 variant of Covid-19, which was first detected in India last October, was clearly a contributing factor to the catastrophe unfolding in her homeland."There have been many accelerators that are fed into this," the 62-year-old said, stressing that "a more rapidly spreading virus is one of them".The WHO recently listed B.1.617 -- which counts several sub-lineages with slightly different mutations and characteristics -- as a "variant of interest".Resistant to antibodies?But so far it has stopped short of adding it to its short list of "variant of concern" -- a label indicating it is more dangerous than the original version of the virus by being more transmissible, deadly or able to get past vaccine protections.Several national health authorities, including in the United States and Britain, have meanwhile said they consider B.1.617 a variant of concern, and Swaminathan said she expected the WHO to soon follow suit."B 1.617 is likely to be a variant of concern because it has some mutations which increase transmission, and which also potentially could make (it) resistant to antibodies that are generated by vaccination or by natural infection," she said.But she insisted that the variant alone could not be blamed for the dramatic surge in cases and deaths seen in India, lamenting that the country appeared to have let down its guard down, with "huge social mixing and large gatherings".Mass election rallies held by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and other politicians have for instance partly been blamed for the staggering rise in infections.But even as many in India felt the crisis was over, dropping mask-wearing and other protection measures, the virus was quietly spreading.'Taking off vertically' "In a large country like India, you could have transmission at low levels, which is what happened for many months," Swaminathan said."It was endemic (and) probably gradually increasing," she said, decrying that "those early signs were missed until it reached the point at which it was taking off vertically.""At that point it's very hard to suppress, because it's then involving tens of thousands of people and it's multiplying at a rate at which it's very difficult to stop."While India is now trying to scale up vaccination to rein in the outbreak, Swaminathan warned that the jabs alone would not be enough to gain control of the situation.She pointed out that India, the world's largest vaccine-making nation, had only fully vaccinated around two percent of the 1.3 billion-plus population."It's going to take many months if not years to get to the point of 70 to 80 percent coverage," she said.With that prospect, Swaminathan stressed that "for the foreseeable future, we need to depend on our tried and tested public health and social measures" to bring down transmission.The surge in India is frightening not only due to the horrifying number of people who are sick and dying there, but also because the exploding infection numbers dramatically increase the chances of new and more dangerous variants emerging."The more the virus is replicating and spreading and transmitting, the more chances are that... mutations will develop and adapt," Swaminathan said."Variants which accumulate a lot of mutations may ultimately become resistant to the current vaccines that we have," she warned."That's going to be a problem for the whole world."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/why-covid-19-cases-exploding-in-india-who-top-scientist-answers-101620540381685.html
09-05-2021||India||Why Facebook blocked famous poet K Satchidanandan's account: All you need to know||The social media giant, Facebook on Saturday temporarily suspended the official account of a famous Malayali poet K Satchidanandan who is also a former secretary of Sahitya Akademi. The account was suspended after he shared a short video mocking Bharatiya Janata Party’s loss in the recently-concluded West Bengal and Kerala assembly elections, according to a statement by Satchidanandan."I did not post anything abusive as pointed out by the social media giant. I received a message on WhatsApp that showed Adolf Hitler scolding his Nazi followers in his finals days and the audio accompanied it suggested that BJP leader Amit Shah was pulling up party leaders in Kerala in Malayalam over the party’s poor performance in assembly elections," he said in Thrissur.Satchidanandan was restricted from posting, liking, commenting and sharing posts for 24-hours. However, he was able to see other people's posts during the suspension period. Meanwhile, the restriction on the 'Facebook Live' option will continue for 30 days.Later on Saturday, Satchidanandan said, "Twelve years of poetry and protest on FB can hardly be erased by twenty-four hours of silence," in reaction to the suspension. "If the choice is between being on Facebook and being a democrat and a human rights defender, I have no doubt where I should stand," he wrote in another post on Facebook.In the recently-held Kerala assembly elections, BJP failed to win a single seat in the 140-member Assembly. It also lost its lone assembly seat while the vote share dropped 3 per cent. Left Democratic Front (LDF) won a clear majority, bagging 99 seats.'Attack on speech and expression'The temporary suspension of Satchidanandan's Facebook account has drawn sharp reactions from other political leaders and writers with many slamming the central government for alleged "censorship." "Deplorable that Facebook has suspended the account of one of Kerala's greatest living poets, Satchidanandan (K. Satchidanandan, former Secy of the Sahitya Akademi), for posting a video about BJP's defeat in the Kerala Assembly elections. We must not allow censorship into our politics!" Congress leader Shashi Tharoor wrote on Twitter.Deplorable that @Facebook has suspended the account of one of Kerala's greatest living poets, @Satchida (K. Satchidanandan, former Secy of the SahityaAkademi), for posting a video about BJP's defeat in the Kerala Assembly elections. We must not allow censorship into our politics!While Communist Party of India (Marxist) leader MV Jayarajan said, "In a democratic country like India it should not have happened. It is an attack on speech and expression."Former Kerala finance minister TM Thomas Issac also extended solidarity with the writer. “It is a most deplorable act. We all stand with Satchidanandan,” tweeted Issac.Government censorship?This comes at a time when the Centre is battling with major criticism over its handling of the ongoing coronavirus crisis. In April last week, social media companies including Facebook and Twitter removed at least 100 posts and URLs that were critical of the government over its management of the medical crisis.After massive outrage on social media, Twitter said that it was done in response to a legal request from the Indian government.On April 25, the Union Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY) said, "the government welcomes criticism and genuine requests for help amid the Covid-19 pandemic, but it is necessary to take action against users who misuse social media to spread panic and misinformation," news agency ANI reported.The government also said that social media platforms had been asked to remove around 100 posts or URLs due to misuse and spread of fake or misleading information regarding the pandemic, as per the ANI report.Recently, several users also pointed out that Facebook blocked posts containing the #ResignModi hashtag.

The power consumption in the entire month of May last year was 102.08 BU.On the other hand, peak power demand met, which is the highest supply in a day, during the first week of this month remained well above the highest record of 166.22 GW in May 2020 except on May 2, when it was 161.14 GW.During the first week of May this year, peak power demand met or the highest supply in a day touched the highest level of 168.78 GW (on May 6, 2021) and recorded a growth of nearly 22 per cent over 138.6 GW (peak met) recorded in the same period in 2020 (on May 7, 2020).The power consumption in April grew 41 per cent to 119.27 BU..Power consumption in April 2020 had dropped to 84.55 BU from 110.11 BU in the same month in 2019, mainly because of fewer economic activities following the imposition of lockdown by the government in the last week of March 2020 to contain the spread of deadly COVID-19.The power consumption also fell in May 2020 to 102.08 BU from 120.02 BU in May 2019.Similarly, peak power demand met or the highest power supply in a day also slumped to 132.73 GW in April last year from 176.81 GW in the same month in 2019, showing the impact of lockdown on economic activities.The fewer economic activities also resulted in a fall of peak power demand met in May 2020 to 166.22 GW from 182.53 GW in May 2019.Experts are of the view that high growth in power consumption as well as demand in May this year is mainly due to base effect but the data shows recovery so far even as the second strong wave of COVID-19 forced authorities to impose local lockdowns to contain deadly virus across the country.They have cautioned that local lockdowns may derail recovery in commercial and industrial power consumption and demand.After a gap of six months, power consumption had recorded a 4.6 per cent year-on-year growth in September 2020 and 11.6 per cent in October 2020. In November 2020, the power consumption growth slowed to 3.12 per cent, mainly due to the early onset of winters. In December 2020, power consumption grew by 4.5 per cent while it was up 4.4 per cent in January 2021.Power consumption in February this year recorded at 103.25 BU compared to 103.81 BU last year. But 2020 was a leap year.In March this year, the power consumption grew nearly 22 per cent to 120.63 BU compared to 98.95 BU in the same month of 2020.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/indias-power-consumption-up-nearly-25-in-first-week-of-may-from-last-year-101620537032498.html

He says the social media giant told him he had breached the company’s “community standards”.“I did not post anything abusive as pointed out by the social media giant. I received a message on WhatsApp that showed Adolf Hitler scolding his Nazi followers in his finals days and the audio accompanied it suggested that BJP leader Amit Shah was pulling up party leaders in Kerala in Malayalam over the party’s poor performance in assembly elections,” he said, without explaining if he used the meme with the reference to the Nazi leader to criticise the BJP in his FB post deemed objectionable.The BJP lost its lone assembly seat in Kerala in the recently concluded assembly elections and its vote share dipped by 3% despite aggressive campaigning.Satchidanandan said FB had warned him earlier too for criticising Prime Minister Narendra Modi. “This is nothing but a suppression of freedom of expression. It seems the government has increased its surveillance over social media to remove posts critical of it. It is an encroachment on freedom of expression,” he said.Facebook’s community standards refer to a set of guidelines defining what is and is not allowed on Facebook. It says its policies are based on feedback from their communities and the advice of experts in fields such as technology, public safety and human rights. FB’s community standard policy claims it encourages people to talk openly about the issues that matter to them, even if some may disagree or find them objectionable unless it qualifies as hate speech or some other offenses listed in its policy.Satchidanandan said he was first intimated on the night of May 7 that the restrictions on his account will stay for 24-hours, followed by another message next day that he can’t post, share or comment on anything for 24 hours. Later, he was told he can’t make any live presentation for 30 days.“It seems there is a feeling in the government that more and more people are turning against it. It is obvious from the recent polls. I may face many such restrictions but I can’t be silenced like this,” he said in Thrissur.BJP spokesman Sandip Warrier ruled out the party’s role in the episode and hit out at the alleged double standards of the government’s critics.“We have nothing to do with it. When Donald Trump and actor Kangana Ranaut’s accounts were suspended, these forces hailed it. There can’t be two standards; so no point in shedding crocodile tears. FB must have taken action as per its policy standard,” said party spokesman Sandip Warrier.Many have expressed solidarity with the writer and slammed Facebook. “It is the most deplorable act. We all stand with Satchidanandan,” tweeted former state finance minister T M Thomas Iassac. “In a democratic country like India, it should not have happened. It is an attack on [freedom of] speech and expression,” said CPI(M) leader M V Jayarajan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/facebook-censures-poet-satchidanandan-over-posts-criticising-bjp-101620536232107.html

Those who work in any company or the government sector are getting their salary on time but the labourers are hit badly in this period. The government should think about it and make some way so that they also should earn their living," Shahzad said.He further mentioned that the people like him have been facing similar problems for the last few years."Earlier, when there was the restriction during abrogation of Article 370 period in the Valley, we had faced a similar issue. Later the first wave of coronavirus came and now due to the second wave we are at the same stage. I urge the government to give a solution," he said.While another driver Majeem said that the government has to think that we have also our basic expenditure. "How can we run our houses without money? I request it to provide some relaxation in the lockdown period," he said."There are around 200-250 taxis standing idle at Lal Chowk taxi stand. The owners of these have to pay their EMI. The bank will not waive off the EMIs. How can I manage to do that in this period," he added.However, essential services were exempted from the lockdown in the Valley, where 602 people have been fined and over 100 others have been arrested for violating Covid curfew and other guidelines in the last 24 hours on Saturday, as per an official statement.A slew of measures, including the imposition of Section 144 have been put in place to contain the spread of the virus.Jammu and Kashmir currently have 44,307 active Covid-19 cases, as per the union health ministry. A total of 1,60,035 recoveries and 2,612 deaths have been reported so far.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/taxi-drivers-adversely-affected-in-j-k-s-srinagar-amid-covid-19-lockdown-101620535379194.html
09-05-2021||India||Himanta Biswa Sarma is likely to be next Assam chief minister||Himanta Biswa Sarma is likely to be named Assam’s next chief minister and the incumbent to the post, Sarbanand Sonowal, may be brought to Delhi at a later stage, Hindustan Times has learnt following late night developments on Saturday.A Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader in the know of the matter said Sarma’s name was expected to be announced around noon on Sunday after a late night nod from the party headquarters in Delhi. On Saturday, current CM Sarbananda Sonowal and Himanta Biswa Sarma met Union home minister Amit Shah, BJP president JP Nadda and party general secretary BL Santhosh. The meetings, held at Nadda’s residence, were conducted in two rounds, the leader said. Both Sonowal and Sarma landed in Guwahati in a special flight late last night after the meetings.The leader added that while Sarma was the clear frontrunner at the moment, "the situation was still fluid and may change", as the legislative party meet to pick its leader was yet to take place. However, Sarma's supporters believe the meeting to be a formality now and have already declared his name as the next head of the government on social media. Union minister NS Tomar and party general secretary Arun Singh were expected to be the Central observers for the meeting, the leader quoted above said.In the results announced for the 126-member Assam assembly on May 2, the BJP won 60 seats while its alliance partners Asom Gana Parishad (AGP) and United People’s Party Liberal (UPPL) won nine and six seats, respectively.Sonowal, who belongs to Assam’s indigenous Sonowal-Kachari tribals, and Sarma, an Assamese Brahmin, who is the convenor of the North East Democratic Alliance, were the two contenders for the top post in the Assam government.Sarma joined the BJP ahead of the 2014 general elections and is now known as the party’s chief trouble shooter in the northeastern region. In an interview to HT last month, when asked whether he was positioning for the CM’s job, Sarma said the final decision rests with Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the Union home minister.‘There were two considerations,’ said a senior leader in Delhi, “One, whoever is chosen, the other cannot stay back in Assam. Second, the party had to decide who will be more suitable to lead into the general elections three years from now.’||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/himanta-biswa-sarma-is-likely-to-be-next-assam-chief-minister-101620533052039.html

On Sunday, the nation added 403,738 to its tally as the national capital Delhi and other metro cities continue to report fresh infections, according to the Union ministry of health family welfare's daily bulletin. It is the fourth consecutive day when the number of daily infections is hovering above the 400,000 mark after recording a slight dip in daily cases.The daily fatalities remained above 4,000 as 4,092 people died due to the viral infection, pushing the death toll to 242,362. With the latest addition, the total Covid-19 caseload has now soared to 22,296,414.Click here for complete Covid-19 coverageThe number of active cases jumped to 3,736,648 and 18,317,404 people have recovered with 386,444 were discharged in a span of 24 hours, figures updated at 8am on the health ministry’s dashboard showed.The country as tested a total of 30,22,75,471 samples as of May 8. Out of this, 18,65,428 samples were tested for Covid-19 in the last 24 hours, the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) said on Twitter.Hospitals around the country have been overwhelmed by the fresh wave of infections with oxygen supplies running short in medical facilities due to the sudden surge in demand. People are running from pillar to post to secure even basic medicines.On Saturday, Tamil Nadu joined a growing list of states with restrictions and announced a complete lockdown to curb the spread and ease pressure on the health system. The other states that are functioning under similar restrictions include Delhi, Maharashtra, Karnataka, Kerala, Rajasthan, Bihar among others.On the vaccination front as well, the country is struggling to produce and distribute enough doses to stem Covid-19 as a long list of states are complaining of shortages, leading to the delay in immunisation drive. India is the world's biggest vaccine maker and it is currently using Covishield, developed by Oxford University and AstraZeneca and being manufactured by the Serum Institute of India, and Bharat Biotech's Covaxin for the inoculation drive.On Saturday, the Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI) gave emergency approval to an anti-Covid oral drug called 2-deoxy-D-glucose, developed by the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) in joint cooperation with Hyderabad-based Dr Reddy's Laboratories Ltd.According to the third phase of the clinical trial results, the drug helps in the faster recovery of hospitalised patients. It also reduced dependence on supplemental oxygen.The country has administered over 167 million vaccine doses but its rate of inoculation has fallen in recent days and only around 2% of its 1.4 billion people have received the two doses needed to be fully immunised.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/indias-single-day-covid-19-tally-rises-to-403-738-death-toll-above-4000-101620532559607.html

The Naval warships are also involved in providing medical support to its Island territories in Lakshwadweep and Andaman and Nicobar Islands.ALSO READ: Navy chief lists initiatives against Covid-19 during PM meet; to open up its hospitals for civiliansThe nuclear powered attack submarines will give Indian Navy the much needed long legs for deterrent patrols and access denial in the Indo-Pacific without giving away its position. "The future not only lies in the Indo-Pacific but also the arctic route that will open up due to receding snow fields," said a serving admiral.The SSNs only need to surface for food supplies and other logistics and can go for long distance patrols with conventional weapons and missiles on board. As of now, India has one Akula class SSN, which is on lease from Russia, and one indigenously build ballistic missile submarine (SSBN) with another joining the strategic forces command next year.While the Navy is still to approach the Union ministry of defence for acceptance of necessity, a term for need to buy, the national security planners are concerned about China adding 12 SSNs to its fleet apart from seven ballistic missile submarines to its strike force.It is not for any other reason that French SSNs base at Toulon and French SSBN base at Brest was on the agenda of Prime Minister Narendra Modi during his now cancelled visit to France around the May 8 India-EU summit at Lisbon. While the India-EU summit was reduced to virtual summit, the physical bilateral visit to France was postponed to a later date.ALSO READ: ‘Flag follows trade,’ Navy chief on China operating in Indian OceanAlthough the Indian Navy has no preferences, the national security planners are looking at France, the UK, the US and Russia as possible partners for joint development of SSNs in India under Atmanirbhar Bharat programme.The French Naval Group is one of the key contenders for the SSN project as France is one of the most trusted allies of India since post 1998 nuclear tests sanction days. Unlike the US, France does not have any regulatory regime that can stall the on-going program using international traffic in arms regulations (ITAR). Finally, France has offered to jointly develop the SSN with India with full transfer of technology. It is already building six diesel attack submarines (called Kalvari class) for India which will be retrofitted with air independent propulsion technology developed by the Defence Research and Development Organization (DRDO).Earlier this week, Admiral Singh called on Prime Minister Modi and briefed him about various initiatives being taken by the Indian Navy to assist the people of the country during the pandemic.The Admiral said the Navy has reached out to all state administrations and have offered help to set up hospital beds, transportation and conduct of vaccination drives and deploying its ships to ferry oxygen containers and essential medical supplies from various countries.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/indopacific-in-mind-navy-pitches-for-six-nuclear-attack-submarines-101620527543449.html

The additional chief secretary of health, PK Mohapatra, briefed district collectors, municipal commissioners and chief district medical officers among others in this regard underlining that prioritisation was being done due to low supply of vaccines. One lakh doses of Covishield was received by the state on Saturday.Cuttack, Bhubaneswar and Sambalpur have TPR of around 25%; Rourkela in Sundargarh has over 50%, while Berhampur has over 15% TPR. Currently, the 18-44 age group is being vaccinated only in Bhubaneswar Municipal Corporation area, where 42,660 have received Covaxin shots since May 1. When the vaccine supply improves, this group will be vaccinated in other districts of the state too, Mohapatra said.Till Saturday, Odisha has administered 6,148,532 doses of Covid vaccine including 51 lakh doses to those older than 45 years and over 10 lakh to healthcare and frontline workers. Residents in the 18-44 years age group are being vaccinated at government centres between 8 AM to 1 PM at Bhubaneswar while those above 45 years have been slotted between 3 PM and 6 PM.Odisha has decided to vaccinate over 1.93 crore people in the age group of 18-44 years free of cost with a proposed expenditure of over ₹2,000 crores. Private hospitals can take ₹100 per dose as service charge but it will be completely free at govt vaccination centres.To speed up the vaccination drive and decongest existing inoculation centres, the state government on Friday started ‘Drive in Vaccination’ in Bhubaneswar where 400 people in the age group of 45+ years were jabbed at the parking area of a mall. The government also plans to start vaccination in stadiums to ensure social distancing, maintaining which is currently a challenge at the existing vaccination centres.On Friday, Odisha reported 12,238 new Covid cases, its highest single-day surge ever amid a high TPR of over 24.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/odisha-to-vaccinate-18-44-age-group-1st-in-5-cities-with-high-covid-tpr-101620528191721.html

The message that Covid-19 was essentially over also slowed the start of India’s Covid-19 vaccination campaign, which has vaccinated less than 2% of the population. At the federal level, India’s vaccination plan soon fell apart,” the editorial said.Also read | 'Self-inflicted national catastrophe': Cong uses Lancet report to attack BJPIt added the government also ignored “several” warnings about the dangers of a second wave. “Before the second wave of cases began to mount in early March, Indian Minister of Health Harsh Vardhan declared that India was in the “endgame” of the epidemic. The impression from the government was that India had beaten Covid-19 after several months of low case counts, despite repeated warnings of the dangers of a second wave and the emergence of new strains. Modelling suggested falsely that India had reached herd immunity, encouraging complacency and insufficient preparation,” the editorial said.Dr Lalit Kant, former head of epidemiology division at the ICMR, said he agreed with the editorial. “The government should take responsibility for the situation we are in.”HT reached out to officials from the Union ministry of health but they were not immediately available for a comment.The editorial comes as India continued to report over 400,000 daily new cases of the viral infection for the fifth consecutive day. On Sunday, the total cases reached 22,289,452, with 403,196 new cases. The death toll has reached 242,273.Dr SK Sarin, director of Institute of Liver and Biliary Sciences and head of the Delhi’s first committee on control and management of Covid, said, “I agree that the vaccination drive needs to be sped up; vaccine hesitancy is no longer there but we need to ensure availability of the vaccines.”Mounting an attack on the government, Congress leader Ajay Maken said: “The Lancet says very clearly that this isn’t a natural disaster but a man-made one. The government should own up to its mistakes.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/lancet-blames-centre-for-covid-19-crisis-says-it-ignored-warnings-101620510762555.html

Around 3.70% of the Covid-19 patients were on oxygen support, the government’s data has revealed.In his virtual address at the 25th meeting of the Group of Ministers (GoM) to discuss the pandemic situation, the minister said nearly 500,000 patients have been admitted to intensive care units, with over 170,000 on ventilator support, while 900,000 people are currently on oxygen support.The country has reported over 400,000 daily new cases of the viral infection for four days now.Also read | SC task force to audit oxygen usage nationwideThe health minister also informed that the country has ramped up Covid-19 testing to 250,000 tests from 150,000 tests a day as on April 9. “Our testing capacity from 15 lakh per day (last meeting on April 9) has been increased to 25 lakh per day right now,” he said.He also highlighted that there was a “glaring gap” in the number of people who have received the first dose and those who have received the second dose of the vaccine against Covid-19.“We can see the glaring gap between those who got their first dose and those who got their second dose. The government has been pursuing this very aggressively with the states and also trying to publicly motivate everyone to get the second dose. We have asked the states to utilise the vaccines given by the Centre in the ratio of 70:30 for second dose,” he said.At the meeting, road transport and highways secretary said that the domestic production of oxygen has been ramped up to 9,400 MT a day. The domestic production capacity was only 5,700MT in August last year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/900k-on-o2-support-says-harsh-vardhan-101620508058783.html
09-05-2021||India||SC task force to audit oxygen usage nationwide||The Supreme Court has set up a 12-member national task force to revamp the Centre’s formula for allocating medical oxygen to states while also ordering an immediate oxygen utilisation audit in Delhi, which has to get 700 metric tonne (MT) of the life-saving gas every day under the apex court’s orders despite the Union government’s reluctance to give it that much.As India battles its worst wave of Covid-19 infections that have overwhelmed health care facilities across the country, demand for medical oxygen has soared, and several states have sought more oxygen from the Centre, which is in charge of allocating what has become the most precious medical commodity right now.A bench of justices Dhananjaya Y Chandrachud and MR Shah emphasised that the existing deficiencies in the oxygen allocation formula required to be rectified by devising a new method on “scientific, rational and equitable basis”.The task force must take up the “pressing issue of determining the modalities for oxygen expeditiously within a week”, the order passed on May 6 said. It was released on Saturday evening.The task force, which has a term of six months initially and will include 10 medical experts from across the country for devising a “public health response” mechanism, has been requested to come up with a new formula of oxygen allocation; recommendations for augmentation of oxygen; measures necessary for ensuring the availability of essential drugs; best practices for management and treatment of Covid-19; measures to ensure adequate health care professionals; and outreach of expert medical care to rural areas.Also read | ‘Covid-19 situation critical,’ says Kerala CM Pinarayi Vijayan as TPR climbs to 28.25%The task force will submit its recommendations to the Supreme Court and to the Centre, which will have to then take appropriate decisions. The apex court may also pass suitable orders based on these recommendations.The order said the task force should also facilitate audits to be conducted by sub-groups within each state and Union Territory to scrutinise whether the allocated quantity of oxygen reached states as well as to pin accountability on states regarding its utilisation and distribution to hospitals.About Delhi, the court reiterated its direction to the Centre to “strictly” keep supplying 700MT oxygen per day pending further orders but at the same time, accepted solicitor general Tushar Mehta’s request for carrying out an audit immediately to ensure that the oxygen was being distributed by the Delhi government in an efficient and transparent manner.During the proceedings on Friday, while the S-G maintained that Delhi’s requirement was between 500 and 600MT per day and that the deficit in hospitals, if any, was due to the inefficiency and systemic failure on the part of the Delhi government, senior advocate Rahul Mehra, representing the city-state’s government, objected to any such audit for the national capital.However, the bench has now set up a committee comprising Dr Randeep Guleria (director, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Delhi), Dr Sandeep Budhiraja (director, Max Healthcare) and one joint secretary-level officer each from the Centre and Delhi government “to ensure a measure of accountability for the proper distribution of oxygen supplies” made available to the city government.“The purpose of conducting audits is to ensure accountability in respect of the supplies of oxygen provided to every State/UT. The purpose is to ensure that the supplies which have been allocated are reaching their destination; that they are being made available through the distribution network to the hospitals or, as the case may be, the end users efficiently and on a transparent basis; and to identify bottlenecks or issues in regard to the utilization of oxygen,” said the court, adding that the decisions made in good faith by doctors while treating their patients will not be questioned.Watch | Covid update: Decongesting jails; DRDO's new oral drug; task force for oxygen﻿The court, which on Friday pointed out flaws with the Centre’s formula to link allocation of oxygen to only the number of beds in the hospitals of a state and its active cases without paying heed to its requirements for patients at homes and other Covid Care Centres, underscored that the task force should start its exercise regarding oxygen allocation “immediately”.“It is necessary that an effective and transparent mechanism is set up within the Union government for the purpose of allocating medical oxygen to all States and UTs for being used during the Covid-19 pandemic. This task force would be tasked inter alia with formulating a methodology for the scientific allocation of oxygen to the states and UTs,” said the bench in its order.The rationale for constituting a task force at a national level, the court said, is “to facilitate a public health response to the pandemic based on scientific and specialised domain knowledge” and to enable the decision makers to have inputs from leading experts for formulation of scientific strategies to deal with an unprecedented human crisis not only for the present problems but by also taking into account the likely future course of the pandemic.“Estimating projected needs is crucial to ensure that the country remains prepared to meet future eventualities, which will cause a demand for oxygen, medicines, infrastructure, manpower and logistics. The establishment of the task force will provide the Union government with inputs and strategies for meeting the challenges of the pandemic on a transparent and professional basis, in the present and in future,” held the bench.It asked the Centre, states, agencies as well as private hospitals to render all cooperation to the task force, besides providing complete and real-time data for facilitating its work.The task force will include Dr Bhabatosh Biswas (former vice-chancellor, West Bengal University of Health Sciences, Kolkata), Dr Devender Singh Rana (chairperson, Sir Ganga Ram Hospital, Delhi), Dr Devi Prasad Shetty (chairperson and executive director, Narayana Healthcare, Bengaluru), Dr Gagandeep Kang (professor, Christian Medical College, Vellore), Dr JV Peter (director, Christian Medical College, Vellore), Dr Naresh Trehan (chairperson and managing director, Medanta Hospital, Gurugram), Dr Rahul Pandit (director, Critical Care Medicine and ICU, Fortis Hospital, Mumbai), Dr Saumitra Rawat (chairman & head, Department of Surgical Gastroenterology and Liver Transplant, Sir Ganga Ram Hospital, Delhi), Dr Shiv Kumar Sarin (head of department of Hepatology, Institute of Liver and Biliary Sciences, Delhi), and Dr Zarir F Udwadia (consultant chest physician, Hinduja Hospital Mumbai).The cabinet secretary will be the convener and a member of the task force apart from secretary in the ministry of health and family welfare, who will also be a member.Also read | Delhi records slight dip in daily Covid-19 casesThe bench added that the task force will be at liberty to draw upon the human resources of various ministries, departments and institutions of the central government for consultation and information and may also constitute one or more sub-groups on specialised areas such as infectious disease modelling, epidemiology, virology and critical care, for assisting it before finalising the recommendations.The court’s order come on an appeal by the central government against initiation of contempt proceedings against it by the Delhi high court on May 4 over deficit in supply of medical oxygen to Delhi.The bench will take up the matter next on May 17.Delhi government officials did not respond to requests for comment.“I think it is good that the SC has stepped in, the pandemic has become a political one-upmanship. All the parties should have been brought together to help people. There is a government that is favouring one state over the other, complete data is not being provided. It is all a disheartening mess. The logistics should be looked at but there shouldn’t be any restrictions on the use of essentials like oxygen,” said Dr T Jacob John, former head of the department of virology at Christian Medical College, Vellore.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-task-force-to-audit-oxygen-usage-nationwide-101620501398712.html
09-05-2021||India||Iconic Darjeeling eatery offers to set up isolation centre for Covid-19 patients free of cost||Glenary’s - the iconic restaurant, bakery and confectionary in Darjeeling - has offered to set up an isolation centre on its top floor to treat Covid-19 patients free of cost. The isolation centre is expected to take off from Sunday and is awaiting permission from the chief medical officer of Darjeeling district. Located a stone’s throw away from the mall, Glenary’s is a three-storey building, the top floor of which used to house the restaurant. The restaurant and the pub on the ground floor are now closed. The bakery on the first floor is, however, open with only take away facilities. Ajoy Edwards the owner of Glenary’s and the head of Edwards Foundation said: “As the number of Covid-19 patients is on the rise and Darjeeling has limited infrastructure to house them, we decided to come forward and lend a helping hand in this war-like situation.” The oldest confectionery in town-- Glenary’s is one of the main attractions for tourists and locals alike. It has a rich history and dates back around 130 years. Though Darjeeling district hospital has allocated 65 beds for Covid-19 patients, the number of patients is far more. “Many Covid 19 patients are forced to go down to Siliguri to private nursing homes and spend lakhs of rupees,” said Edwards. Darjeeling and Kalimpong hills have limited infrastructure and facilities to deal with the Covid-19 crisis. Though in Kalimpong district, the Gorkhaland Territorial Administration has a dedicated 150-bed Covid-19 hospital at Tribeni near the confluence of River Teesta and River Ranjit; it lacks ICU and other super-specialty facilities. Some social organisations have set up a few safe homes in the hills. Glenary’s Covid-19 isolation centre, if it becomes operational, would be a welcome facility for the people of the hills as it would be free. In Siliguri, the nearest biggest town in the region, a private safe home for those Covid-19 patients whose reports are now negative is charging ₹1500 per room and ₹500 for food daily. A room can accommodate two persons. Edwards said, “We have written to health officials, offering the restaurant section of the building, to be converted into an isolation ward, with basic oxygen support. The entrance to the restaurant is separate from the pub and the bakery and will be completely barred from them.” With the restaurant already closed, the bakery at present is only offering takeaways and home delivery. “We are doing this with the Darjeeling Initiative and Edward’s Foundation, with medical support to be provided by Planter’s Nursing Home,” Edwards said. Praloy Acharya, chief medical officer of Darjeeling district said, “Our team will visit the place before deciding on the permission.” The isolation centre will initially have 20 beds which can be later increased to 40.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/iconic-darjeeling-eatery-offers-to-set-up-isolation-centre-for-covid-19-patients-free-of-cost-101620499390116.html
09-05-2021||India||Centre may probe oxygen hoarding in Delhi||The government may institute a probe against hoarding and black marketing of medical oxygen amid reports of its diversion, and also audit the demand and supply situation in Delhi as inordinate delays in unloading oxygen in the Capital are affecting the national supply chain, two people with knowledge of matters related to an inter-ministerial empowered group (EG2) said.Undue delays – 24 hours to 54 hours -- have been reported in decanting of oxygen tankers or containers in Delhi, which is suspicious and also a matter of concern, they said on condition of anonymity. It required proper auditing as unreasonable delays in the turnaround time are affecting the entire supply chain, they added.EG2, chaired by the industry secretary, is responsible for the availability of essential medical supplies including medical oxygen to affected states. The group consists of senior officers from various ministries and departments including the ministry of health and family welfare (MoHFW).“The matter will also be flagged to the proposed National Task Force (NTF),” one of the people quoted above said. The Supreme Court on Saturday formed a 12-member task force to devise an effective and transparent mechanism for allocating medical oxygen across the country. The cabinet secretary will be the convener of the task force.Also read | SC task force to audit oxygen usage nationwideThe entire supply chain is affected because Delhi is unable to quickly unload oxygen from tankers, the second person said. “Thus, empty tankers are unable to return to their respective production centres as per their schedule, disrupting the entire chain. It is reported that some of the oxygen is being diverted by unscrupulous elements,” he said.“The turnaround time for oxygen filled tankers arriving from Mundra to Delhi through special Oxygen Express trains is taking 54.15 hours. Tankers arriving from Jamnagar are taking 26.10 hours to 27.30 hours, which is intriguing as the country is facing acute shortage of tankers for transporting medical oxygen,” he said. Normally, it should not take more than 6-7 hours’ time, he added.The second official said delay in turnaround time for tankers in Delhi is impacting the oxygen supply in other states such as Rajasthan, Uttarakhand, Punjab, Jammu & Kashmir and Himachal Pradesh.“The turnaround time can be reduced significantly after proper scrutiny of demand and supply. Hopefully, after the apex court’s direction, an audit of medical oxygen requirement in Delhi, its distribution system and consumption pattern would be possible,” the first official said. According to a PTI report, the top court on Saturday also named a sub-group for carrying out the audit exercise for Delhi’s health infrastructure and allocation of oxygen.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-may-probe-oxygen-hoarding-in-delhi-101620499029147.html
09-05-2021||India||India surviving on systems set up by Nehru-Gandhi family: Sena||Taking a dig at its former ally BJP, the Shiv Sena said on Saturday that systems created over 70 years by previous prime ministers such as Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru, Indira Gandhi and Manmohan Singh helped India survive through the tough times being faced today while the present government was not even ready to suspend work on the Central Vista amid a devastating pandemic.The Sena said that even as the world is battling a second wave of Covid-19, experts have predicted that the third wave will be more severe; but the ruling BJP is doing all it can to corner Mamata Banerjee in West Bengal even after the election result.“The UN has expressed fear that there is a threat to the world from India due to the pace at which the coronavirus is spreading in the country. It has also made an appeal that the maximum number of countries should help India in the fight against Covid-19. Bangladesh has sent 10,000 remdesivir vials, while Bhutan has sent medical oxygen. Nepal, Myanmar and Sri Lanka have also offered help to Aatmanirbhar (self-reliant) India,” the Sena said in an editorial in its mouthpiece Saamana.Also read | PM Modi hails Maharashtra Covid-19 handling, says CMO“In clear terms, India is surviving on the systems created by the Nehru-Gandhi family. Many poor countries are offering help to India. Earlier, countries like Pakistan, Rwanda and Congo used to get help from others. But due to the wrong policies of today’s rulers, India is going through that situation now,” it said.But while poor countries were helping India in their own way, Prime Minister Narendra Modi was not ready to stop the ambitious Central Vista project worth ₹20,000 crore, the Sena added.The redevelopment project of the Central Vista envisages a new Parliament building with a higher seating capacity, a common Central Secretariat and a revamp of the 3km Rajpath stretch from Rashtrapati Bhavan to India Gate and new residences for the prime minister and the vice president.“A sensitive and a nationalist government would not have thought about the political pros and cons and set up a national panel of all main political parties to discuss ways to defeat the pandemic,” the Uddhav Thackeray-led party said.BJP MP Subramanian Swamy has demanded that Union minister Nitin Gadkari be given the charge of the health ministry and this is proof that the current health ministry has been a complete failure, it added.“The country is surviving thanks to the development work, projects set up by and the confidence given by the previous governments of Pandit Nehru, (Lal Bahadur) Shastri, Indira Gandhi, Rajiv Gandhi, PV Narasimha Rao, and Manmohan Singh,” it said.The prime minister will have to do a lot of hard work and think of non-political nationalism to help the country come out of the pandemic, it said.Earlier, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi attacked the Union government over the Central Vista project, terming it “criminal wastage” and asked the ruling party to focus on people’s lives.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-surviving-on-systems-set-up-by-nehru-gandhi-familysena-101620498969192.html
09-05-2021||India||Delhi given large part of foreign aid: Data||The national capital received a large part of the Covid-19-related aid donated by foreign countries in an otherwise equitable distribution of relief goods, according to the government data. The collection and distribution of such materials till May 7 also showcases a fast delivery system as almost all items have been already earmarked and disbursed.More than 14 nations have so far sent aid to India, and Delhi received materials from nearly all these countries. The national capital got at least 1,432 out of the 2,933 oxygen concentrators distributed so far. It also got eight out of 13 oxygen generation plants gifted to India, according to the data.An empowered committee headed by NITI CEO Amitabh Kant handles the distribution of material aid received from abroad. Kant said: “We have built the best foreign aid delivery system on ground. Everything is online. Process is digital. There are no delay. Everything has been transported or has been delivered for installation.”The delivery of a large number of oxygen-related equipment to Delhi underlines the shortage of medical grade oxygen in the national capital. Patients have died in Delhi hospitals amid the oxygen shortage and courts took cognisance of the oxygen crisis.Also read | Need 26 million more Covid-19 vaccine doses for Delhi: Arvind KejriwalThe national capital also got 1,040 Bi pap/C pap, 334 ventilators, 687 oxygen cylinders, 24,200 gowns, 978,000 masks and 25,586 shots of remdesivir from different nations.These allotments include those to the state, hospitals such as AIIMS, Safdarjung, Lady Hardinge and Ram Manohar Lohia, the DRDO’s facility and other Delhi-based institutions.“The bulk of the foreign aid has been given to the AIIMS in Delhi and elsewhere. There is a reason for this. AIIMS are also in the states and they are the key regional centres for tackling Covid. The locals go there,” said Kant.Foreign relief materials have been also disbursed to Maharashtra, another state with high Covid-19 cases. The government data shows that AIIMS Nagpur got 60 oxygen concentrators gifted by Mauritius, while the state got more than 24,000 remdesivir doses and 150 oxygen concentrators donated by USAID, among other things.Delhi received 160 pulse oximeters, 225 bedside monitors, more than 87,000 favipiravir, 70,300 antigen kits and 15,000 coveralls, among other things.The government data shows that between May 6 and 7, only oxygen materials such as concentrators or plants and ventilators were distributed to states.India started receiving foreign aid from April 27. The distribution is based on a methodology to ensure their optimal use, primarily to the states with high caseloads and regional medical hubs, according to a top government official directly involved in channelling this aid.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhi-given-large-part-of-foreign-aid-data-101620498909719.html
09-05-2021||India||India, EU to hold talks on three trade pacts||India and the European Union (EU) on Saturday announced the resumption of negotiations on three balanced and comprehensive trade-related agreements but were unable to reach common ground on New Delhi’s call for a waiver of patent protections for Covid-19 vaccines.During a virtual summit between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and leaders of the 27 EU member states, the two sides also unveiled an ambitious connectivity partnership to foster public and private investments in connectivity projects and take up joint projects in Africa, Central Asia and the Indo-Pacific. This is only the EU’s second such partnership after a similar arrangement with Japan.The two sides didn’t specify any timeframe for negotiations on the agreements on trade, investment protection and geographical indications, saying a high-level mechanism led by India’s commerce minister and the EU trade commissioner would steer the negotiations and decide timelines.Also read | Unsure Covid-19 vaccine waiver will help, some EU leaders call for more exportsThe agreement on resumption of trade negotiations, which were started in 2007 and suspended in 2013 after major differences on issues such as market access and mobility of Indian professionals, was described by secretary (West) Vikas Swarup of the external affairs ministry as the “most important outcome” of the summit. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said all three pacts will be negotiated “in parallel at the same time so that we move forward rapidly”.“Both sides have worked intensively over the last few months to arrive at a common understanding. The decisions are a result of the political desire on both sides to harness the full potential of our economic engagement and work towards an early post-Covid-19 recovery,” Swarup said.At a news briefing in Porto after the summit, Von der Leyen and European Council President Charles Michel were lukewarm towards the proposal by India and South Africa for relaxing norms of the WTO Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) for vaccines. They expressed doubts as to whether such a move will help global access to vaccines and instead called on countries currently manufacturing doses to ramp up production and delivery.Swarup told a separate news briefing in New Delhi that Modi had requested the EU’s support for a TRIPS waiver on vaccine-related patents to ensure equitable access for the entire world, especially after the US had backed the move recently.“The EU’s support at WTO for this waiver will ensure that we can scale up the vaccine production for equitable and global access and save lives,” Swarup said. “We will be watching the evolving EU position on this particular issue.”Both Michel and Von der Leyen expressed solidarity and support for India to counter a devastating second wave of Covid-19 infections, which has seen daily cases crossing the 400,000 mark in recent days, but made it clear the EU didn’t think a waiver of patents will produce significant and immediate results. The EU, they said, would back any effort that can lead to an increase in vaccine production and delivery in the short term.“Nevertheless, in the short term, many of us think that this may not be the magic solution. That’s why we want to keep a close eye [on it] and keep discussing this issue,” Michel said, acknowledging the only way out of the Covid-19 crisis is to immunise the global population.Von der Leyen noted the EU is open to discussions on waiver of patent protections but said: “These are important topics to discuss but we should be aware of the fact that these are topics for the long term. It’s not a topic for the short term or medium term, and therefore, we should not lose sight of the main urgencies now, which is ramping up vaccine production as quickly as possible and ensuring that they are fairly and evenly distributed.”Watch | India, EU to re-launch free trade talks: What PM Modi, EU leaders discussed﻿She instead suggested other vaccine-producing countries should follow the EU’s example of exporting 50% of its total production of 400 million doses to 90 countries. Other countries should also support the WHO-backed COVAX facility and invest in global vaccine manufacturing capacities.In this regard, Von der Leyen said EU member states were investing in scaling up vaccine manufacturing capacities in Africa, and even thinking of deploying container-based vaccine laboratories that can train the workforce in African countries and transfer knowledge for providing safe and effective vaccines.The EU leaders stressed they had assured the Indian prime minister of solidarity and support, and pointed to the oxygen-related gear, medicines and other equipment worth 100 million euros donated by 17 member states.In his initial remarks at the summit, Modi explained the rationale for a stronger relationship with the EU and all its member states and described the strategic partnership between the two sides as a “force multiplier for the global good”.On the economic front, the two sides agreed to have dedicated dialogues on WTO issues, regulatory cooperation, market access issues and supply chain resilience. The high-level trade and investment dialogue will monitor progress on these decisions.The two sides also discussed how technology should be used for the welfare of the people while being rooted in democratic values. They also emphasised the need for secure networks and agreed to cooperate on global standards in new and emerging technologies such as 5G.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-eu-to-hold-talks-on-three-trade-pacts-101620498849133.html
09-05-2021||India||Covid-19 positive report not must for hospitalisation: Centre||People with Covid-19 symptoms will not need a positive test report, an identity card or an address proof to get admission to hospitals, health centres, or Covid care centres, an admission policy released by the Union health ministry said on Saturday.While there was no Covid admission policy of the central government previously, hospitals required a Covid-19 test report before admitting patients for treatment of the infectious disease. A patient with “steady” symptoms of Covid-19 does not need an RT-PCR test report to get admitted at a hospital in Delhi, the city-state’s government recently told the high court.As per the central government’s policy release on Saturday: “Requirement of a positive test for COVID-19 virus is not mandatory for admission to a COVID health facility.” Patients without a test report can be admitted to wards meant for suspected Covid-19 cases.The Union health ministry’s discharge policy, which details the level of care patients need, mentions a “confirmed Covid-19 case” with mild symptoms can be taken care of at Covid care centre established in hostels, hotels, stadiums, etc., and those with moderate symptoms are to be admitted for oxygen beds, wit severe cases requiring proper hospital care.Also read | Need 26 million more Covid-19 vaccine doses for Delhi: Arvind KejriwalFaced with a big surge in Covid-19 cases and delays in getting RT-PCR reports, Delhi earlier directed its hospitals not to refuse admissions for the want of a report if a person had Covid-19-like symptoms.The new policy by the Centre also directs all hospitals to ensure that patients with the viral infection are not refused oxygen or other essential medicines just because they belong to a state other than the one the facility is located in. “No patient shall be refused admission on the ground that he/she is not able to produce a valid identity card that does not belong to the city where the hospital is located,” the policy said.The new policy also states that the admission should only be based on need. “It should be ensured that beds are not occupied by persons who do not need hospitalisation.” It reiterates that patients with moderate disease must be discharged 10 days after the onset if they are symptom-free or three days after resolution of symptoms and the ability to maintain oxygen saturation for three consecutive days. The patients with severe disease can be discharged only after clinical recovery and a negative RT-PCR test.At a meeting of a high-level group of ministers on Saturday, Union health minister Harsh Vardhan said that 1.34% of the Covid-19 patients were in intensive care units, with 0.39% on ventilators. Around 3.70% of the Covid-19 patients were on oxygen support, according to the government’s data.“With the surge in cases, people might not be able to get their RT-PCR reports for three to four days. So, this admission policy is important for ensuring that their treatment is not delayed. If a person has low oxygen saturation, high-grade fever, and is not able to breathe properly, it is a sign that they have Covid-19 and they should receive treatment as such. And, in the middle of a pandemic, not everyone needs to be tested, they are presumed to have the infection,” said Dr Lalit Kant, former head of the department of epidemiology at the Indian Council of Medical Research.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-ve-report-not-must-for-hospitalisation-centre-101620498789155.html

The meetings, held at Nadda’s residence, were conducted in two rounds.“A decision is likely after the legislative party meeting scheduled on Sunday in Guwahati. The decision will then be ratified by the parliamentary board,” said a person aware of the development.Union minister NS Tomar and party general secretary Arun Singh were expected to reach Assam later on Saturday night as central observers for the meeting, the person said. “There is speculation that a deputy CM’s position could be carved out to accommodate both leaders in the state,” a functionary said.In the results announced for the 126-member Assam assembly on May 2, the BJP won 60 seats while its alliance partners AGP and UPPL won nine and six seats, respectively. The BJP, however, is yet to announce a chief ministerial candidate.Also read | 'Self-inflicted national catastrophe': Cong uses Lancet report to attack BJPSonowal, who belongs to Assam’s indigenous Sonowal-Kachari tribals, and Sarma, an Assamese Brahmin who is the convenor of the North East Democratic Alliance, are contenders for the top post of the Assam government.While party leaders in the Capital are tight lipped, a section of MLAs has been supporting Sarma, who also held the portfolio of finance, for the CM’s post.“There is a section of MLAs who have indicated their preference. But the final decision will be taken by the central command. There is also speculation that either one of them could be in a new role in Delhi,” said a functionary who spoke on the condition of anonymity. Sarma, who joined the BJP ahead of the 2014 general elections, and is now known as the BJP’s troubleshooter in the northeastern region. In an interview to HT last month, when asked whether he is positioning for the CM’s job, Sarma said that the final decision rests with Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the home minister.Sonowal, for his part, has not made any comments about whether he is inclined to retain the job. “He keeps a low profile. He did not canvass for the position when the BJP won for the first time in 2016 and even now he has kept his cards close to his chest,” said a second functionary. Meanwhile, Shah and Nadda met later on Saturday to decide the party’s choice for the leader of opposition post in West Bengal assembly, according to a person aware of the development.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/suspense-over-assam-cm-sonowal-sarma-meet-party-brass-in-capital-101620498669121.html
09-05-2021||India||Maharashtra to set up panel to study SC order on Maratha reservation||The Maharashtra government on Saturday announced to appoint a committee under two retired high court judges to review the recent Supreme Court judgment on Maratha reservation and suggest the way forward in the quota issue.The committee, comprising of five to six other members including laws officers, is expected to submit its report in two weeks to the state government, a person aware of the development said.The government also asked chief secretary Sitaram Kunte to take a review of the recruitments that have been affected due to the verdict.According to government officials, more than 3,000 people from the Maratha community were recruited in two years between November 2018 and September 2020. The decision to accord them permanent recruitment is still pending.“There are hundreds of employees who were recruited on the basis of the reservation given in 2014, but currently are out of job because it was struck down by the Bombay high court. The review needs to be taken about them too. Chief secretary Sitaram Kunte has been asked to take a call on them with deliberation from the secretaries from other departments,” said an official from the general administration department.Marathas were given 12% and 13% quota in education and government jobs, respectively, under the Socially and Educationally Backward Classes (SEBC) Act, 2018.Also read | Maratha quota setback in Supreme Court may hurt Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi govtThe Supreme Court on Wednesday quashed it, saying people from the community can’t be declared educationally and socially backward just to bring them in the reserved category. The five-judge bench also refused to refer the judgment in 1992 Indra Sawhney case, popularly known as Mandal Commission case, setting a 50% cap on reservation, to a larger bench for reconsideration.The state cabinet sub-committee on Maratha reservation headed by public works department minister Ashok Chavan and comprising of other senior ministers, held a meeting on Saturday to take a call on future course of action.“The committee under retired judges will study the SC verdict minutely and give their observations and available legal remedy on the reservation. The state government will take its decision after the report was submitted in two weeks. The decision over filing the review petition before the 5-judge bench will also be taken based on the report,” Chavan told reporters in Mumbai.The state government is also tapping the option of requesting the central government to intervene as the judgment has stated that the right to accord the reservation was with Centre after the 102nd constitutional amendment.“Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray will write to president and prime minister requesting them to take required steps for the reservation. The Centre has time and again clarified that the powers of the states have not been nullified even after the amendment, though the SC order has stated otherwise,” Chavan said.Urban development department minister and member of the cabinet sub-committee Eknath Shinde said the government was committed to continue the benefits to the Marathas. “We have already rolled out sops to the community in terms of scholarship, freeships, hostel facilities, financial assistance for entrepreneurship. They will further be streamlined,” Shinde said.Meanwhile, legal experts have opined that the state government has very limited options left on the reservation.“Review petition before the same bench would not help as there should be some other ground than the ones exhausted. Even if the state requests the Centre for the reservation, the ratification of the backwardness of the Marathas would be a task before the state as the quantifiable data submitted by the state backward class commission has not been accepted by the top court. The state can think of entirely new law by weeding out the lacunae in the SEBC Act 2018, but it too will be subject to legal scrutiny,” an official from Mantralaya said, requesting anonymity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/maha-to-set-up-panel-to-study-sc-order-on-maratha-reservation-101620498549199.html
09-05-2021||India||10 killed in explosion at limestone quarry in Andhra||Ten labourers were killed in a massive explosion while unloading detonators from a vehicle at a limestone quarry in Andhra Pradesh’s Kadapa district on Saturday morning, police said. The incident happened at Tirumalakonda hillocks on the outskirts of Mamillapalli village of Kalasapadu block at around 10 am.“The explosion occurred when the workers were unloading bundles of detonators from a vehicle for using them for limestone mining,” Kadapa superintendent of police KKN Anburajan told Hindustan Times. Police said the driver of the vehicle was among the 10 who died in the explosion.The explosion was so intense that the bodies were damaged beyond recognition. “With great difficulty, we could identify the victims based on their body parts,” the SP, who visited the spot in the afternoon, said.Police have identified the deceased as Prasad (35) from Gangayapalle village, Subba Reddy (40) from Gondipalli, Bala Gangulu (35), Venkata Ramana (25) and Lakshmi Reddy (60) from E Kothapalli, Venkateshu (25) from Bakannagaripalle, Eshwaraiah (45) from Bechaiagaripalle, Gangi Reddy (50) from Ramgoripalle, Abdul (30), the driver of the vehicle, from Badwel and Korivi Prasad (40).Chief minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy expressed shock over the death of labourers in the explosion. While he is yet to announce any compensation for the families of the deceased, the CM has ordered an inquiry into the incident. He expressed his condolences to the families of the blast victims.According to Porumamilla police inspector K Mohan Reddy said all nine labourers who were unloading the explosives and the driver of the vehicle died on the spot, adding that no one was injured in the explosion. “There were two other labourers standing at a distance and they managed to escape without any injuries,” Reddy told HT.A revenue official in Kalasapadu said the explosion was so intense that it created tremors in adjacent villages, leading to panic among the people.Soon after the incident, inspector Reddy along with sub-inspectors of Kalasapadu and Porumamilla police stations rushed to the spot, police said.The jeep that carried the explosive material from Badwel to Kalasapadu was also severely damaged in the explosion. “As per the preliminary investigation based on the available documents, the quarry owner has the licence to procure and use detonators for quarrying limestone in the area. Yet, complete details would be known only after investigation,” the SP said.He, however, refused to divulge further details about the company and its owners. “We cannot reveal further details unless the investigation is done,” Anburajan said.Andhra Pradesh Governor Biswa Bhusan Harichandan expressed anguish and grief over the death of 10 labourers in the explosion. He enquired with district officials about the cause of accident and conveyed his condolences to members of the bereaved families.Telugu Desam Party president and former CM N Chandrababu Naidu also expressed deep shock and grief. He demanded that the government extend all help and announce ex gratia to the kin of the deceased.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/10-killed-in-explosion-at-limestone-quarry-in-andhra-101620498429089.html
