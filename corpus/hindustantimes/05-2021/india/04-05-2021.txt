04-05-2021||India||India-UK virtual summit: Massive push to enhancing bilateral trade, bolstering defence ties||India and the UK on Tuesday launched an Enhanced Trade Partnership that envisages facilitating market access in specific sectors, and unveiled plans to finalise an interim trade deal by mid-2022 as a precursor to a free trade agreement.At a virtual summit between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his UK counterpart Boris Johnson, the two sides also set a target for doubling bilateral trade by 2030 and adopted the Roadmap 2030 to elevate ties to a comprehensive strategic partnership over the next decade.The Enhanced Trade Partnership, part of the UK’s efforts to ramp up trade ties with countries around the world following its exit from the European Union (EU), will see Britain open up its fisheries sector to more Indian players, facilitate more opportunities for nurses, recognise Indian seafarers’ certificates and enter into a joint dialogue on a social security agreement. In return, India lifted restrictions to enable British fruit producers to export their produce to the country and improved access to medical devices through the acceptance of the “UK Certificates of Free Sale”. The two sides will also work towards reciprocal opening up of legal services. These actions are likely to generate some 25,000 new direct and indirect jobs in India, Sandeep Chakravorty, joint secretary (Europe West) in the external affairs ministry, told a news briefing.The virtual summit was held after Johnson cancelled a state visit to New Delhi twice because of the Covid-19 situation – first in January to focus on an outbreak in the UK and in April due to the second wave of infections in India. Ahead of the summit, Johnson announced a trade and investment package with India worth £1 billion, including a £240 million investment by the Serum Institute of India (SII) in the UK.Johnson informed Modi about SII’s investment and manufacture of vaccines in the UK, especially research on nasal vaccines, Chakravorty said. He noted SII is a multi-national company that has a presence in the Netherlands and plans to manufacture vaccines in other countries.Following the launch of the Enhanced Trade Partnership, the two sides agreed to frame a roadmap for pre-free trade agreement (FTA) talks by end of this year, finalise an interim trade deal by early or mid-2022, and conclude talks for an FTA “at an early date”, Chakravorty said.Chakravorty described the launch of Roadmap 2030 as a “big deliverable” of the summit that is in line with the vision of the two leaders to elevate India-UK ties into a comprehensive strategic partnership. The roadmap lists several activities and initiatives to be pursued by the two sides in five key areas – trade and economy, defence and security, climate action, health and people-to-people contacts – over the next decade.The two countries also signed eight agreements, including a memorandum of understanding (MoU) on a migration and mobility partnership that will facilitate the legal movement of students and professionals and strengthen cooperation in combating illegal migration. The MoU creates a new scheme under which up to 3,000 young Indian professionals can every year avail of employment opportunities in the UK for two years without being subject to a labour market test.The other agreements covered emerging technologies, digital infrastructure and data policies, cooperation in telecommunications and ICT, customs cooperation, and cooperation on medical products regulation.Modi and Johnson agreed to advance defence ties to a new level, with a focus on maritime and industrial collaboration. They agreed to new cooperation on maritime domain awareness, including new agreements on maritime information-sharing. The UK was invited to join India’s naval information fusion centre and an exercise programme that includes tri-lateral exercises.India and the UK are also working to conclude a Logistics Memorandum of Understanding between their armed forces. They will build on existing collaboration on India’s future combat air engine requirement by working together on the indigenous development of the Light Combat Aircraft Mark 2.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/indiauk-virtual-summit-massive-push-to-enhancing-bilateral-trade-bolstering-defence-ties-101620152299223.html

04-05-2021||India||At virtual India-UK Summit, PM seeks speedy extradition of Nirav Modi, Mallya||Prime Minister Narendra Modi sought the speedy extradition of economic offenders Nirav Modi and Vijay Mallya from the UK during a virtual summit with his British counterpart Boris Johnson on Tuesday, the ministry of external affairs said.“They discussed the extradition of economic offenders and Prime Minister [Modi] said that the economic offenders should be sent back to India at the earliest for trial,” Sandeep Chakravorty, joint secretary (Europe West) in the external affairs ministry, told a news briefing. Last month, UK home secretary Priti Patel approved the extradition of fugitive businessman Nirav Modi after a British court found him guilty of fraud and money laundering in the Punjab National Bank scam. Nirav Modi is the second high-profile economic offender after former liquor baron Vijay Mallya whose extradition has been cleared by a trial court in the UK. Mallya lost his appeal against extradition in April 2020 and an opportunity to approach the UK Supreme Court the next month but the British government has claimed his extradition is being held up by a “confidential legal issue”. Officials familiar with Mallya’s case say he has sought asylum in the UK and it is unclear how much time the British authorities will take to decide on his application. “Prime Minister Johnson said that he faced some legal hurdles because of the nature of the criminal justice system in the UK, but he was aware of it and they will do whatever possible to make sure that these people are extradited at the earliest,” Chakravorty said, without giving details.Nirav Modi has been held in Wandsworth prison, on the outskirts of London, since March 2019, when he was arrested based on India’s extradition request. As in the case of Mallya, officials from CBI and Enforcement Directorate are confident the UK high court will reject Nirav Modi’s plea against his extradition as there is irrefutable evidence of fraud and money laundering against him.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/at-virtual-india-uk-summit-pm-seeks-speedy-extradition-of-nirav-modi-mallya-101620150978706.html

04-05-2021||India||‘No Covid-19 vaccine for flying crew, will stop work’: Air India pilots warn management||In a letter, the Air India Airbus pilot’s union has warned the management that they will stop work if Air India fails to set up Covid-19 vaccination camps on a national level for the flying crew in the 18-44 age group on priority, HT has learnt. The letter read, “It is disheartening to witness the top management make a mockery of pilots discharging their duties in a risky environment. We were hoping that Air India would not let down the crew and their families who stand by the nation during this pandemic... We feel let down by the self-serving approach of the management, which sees no injustice in organising vaccine camps at few bases but excludes pilots.”The Indian Commercial Pilots Association (ICPA), in its letter to the director of operations on Tuesday, raised their concern about their flying crew not being vaccinated against Covid-19. Pointing out that many crew members have tested positive for Covid-19, the ICPA said the flying crew has been risking its life during this pandemic.They said those on desk jobs or those who could opt for working from home can get vaccinated, but not the flying crew, leaving them vulnerable.The ICPA pilots said that it is due to their unwavering support that the Vande Bharat Mission (VBM) and relief operations have continued to run smoothly even in the face of a resurgence of even deadlier strains of Covid-19; only to get a discriminatory pay cut in return.The association said it is not in the position to risk the lives of pilots flying without vaccination as there is no healthcare support, no insurance, and a ‘massive opportunistic’ pay cut.“If Air India fails to set up vaccination camps on a Pan-India basis for the flying crew above the age of 18 years on priority, we will “STOP WORK (sic),” the letter warned.“Our finances are already spread thin covering our bedridden colleagues and provisioning for families lest we inadvertently infect them with the deadly virus that is an ever-present occupational hazard for us,” the letter concluded.In an email response, the airline spokesperson’s said, “Air India is aware of an official communique from one of its unions sent to the management. This is an entirely internal issue that is meant to be sorted out within the organisation. While we appreciate your keen interest in each and every issue related to Air India, we will not like to make any comment on an issue that, in any case, has no reason to be discussed in the external public domain.” The airline’s Boeing pilots, the Indian Pilots Guild (IPG), who were the first to write to the airline management on April 28, had stated that it was disappointing to see inadequate efforts been made to protect pilot’s well being.The IPG letter read, “Despite the second wave choking the nation’s medical resources, not a single pilot has refused any flight sighting risk of infection as a reason. Several of our colleagues are being hospitalised at an alarming rate and are in critical need of oxygen... it is in the nature of our duty to be at risk of exposure to the virus. At the very least, our company should leave no stone unturned to keep us safe.” The IPG too had warned the management to keep the aircrew on top priority, and that they would have to decide in the interests of their pilots and their familiesThe airline however replied to the pilots on April 30, assuring them to conduct the vaccination drive from May 1. The letter accessed by the paper read, “...The operations department, in coordination with the medical department, will initiate the process of vaccinating all operations staff. This includes operations ground staff, dispatchers, crew, both cockpit and cabin, above the age of 18 years. The logistics of venues and processes are being worked upon across the country as of now and the same will be communicated as soon as they are finalised...”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-covid-19-vaccine-for-flying-crew-will-stop-work-air-india-pilots-warn-management-101620149718890.html

04-05-2021||India||100 million-year-old bones of sauropod dinosaurs discovered in Meghalaya||Researchers have identified fossil bone fragments of sauropod dinosaurs dating back to about 100 million years from an area around West Khasi Hills District in Meghalaya.The yet-to-be-published findings were made during a recent field trip by researchers from the Geological Survey of India's Palaeontology division in North-East.The GSI researchers noted that this is the first record of sauropods of probable Titanosaurian origin discovered in the region.Sauropods had very long necks, long tails, small heads relative to the rest of their body, and four thick, pillar-like legs. They are notable for the enormous sizes attained by some species, and the group includes the largest animals to have ever lived on land.The finding makes Meghalaya the fifth state in India after Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, and Tamil Nadu and the only state in the North-East to report Sauropod bones having titanosaurian affinity, they said.Titanosaurs were a diverse group of sauropod dinosaurs, including genera from Africa, Asia, South America, North America, Europe, Australia and Antarctica."Dinosaur bones from Meghalaya were reported by GSI in 2001 but they were too fragmentary and ill-preserved to understand its taxonomic identification," said Arindam Roy, Senior Geologist, Palaeontology Division, GSI."The present find of bones is during fieldwork in 2019-2020 and 2020-21. The last visit of the team was in February 2021. The fossils are presumably of Late Cretaceous, about 100 million years ago," Roy told PTI.He noted that the best-preserved fossils are limb bones, adding the type of curvature, development of lateral and proximal margins of the partially preserved bone are indicative of it being a humerus bone.He, however, noted that the conclusions are drawn from preliminary studies and detailed work is going on.The bone fragments were collected from poorly sorted, purplish to greenish very coarse-grained arkosic sandstone interlaid with pebbly beds.More than twenty-five disarticulated, mostly fragmentary bone specimens were recovered, which are of different sizes and occur as isolated specimens but some of them were found in close proximity to each other, the researchers said.Taxonomic identification up to genus level is difficult due to poorly preserved, incomplete, fragmentary nature of the bones and most of the recovered bones are partially petrified and partially replaced, they said.Therefore, only three of the best-preserved ones could be studied. The largest one is a partially preserved limb bone of 55 centimetres (cm) long. It is comparable with the average humerus length of titanosaurids.Robustness of the bone, the difference in curvature in the lateral margins and the proximal border being relatively straight, are some of the morphological characters that hint at the titanosaurid affinity, according to the researchers.Another incomplete limb bone measuring 45cm in length is also comparable with the limb bones of titanosauriform clade, they said.“The abundance of bones recovered during the present work and especially the finding of few limb bones and vertebrae having taxonomic characters of titanosauriform clade are unique,” Roy said.“The record of the sauropod assemblage of probable titanosaurian affinity from Meghalaya extends the distribution and diversity of vertebrates in the Late Cretaceous of India,” he noted.An incomplete chevron of caudal vertebrae and also cervical vertebra have also been reconstructed from a few recovered bone specimens.The other fragmentary specimens though partially preserved might probably be parts of limb bones of a sauropod dinosaur.Titanosaurian sauropod dinosaurs were the most diverse and abundant large-bodied terrestrial herbivores in the Southern Hemisphere landmasses during the Cretaceous Period but they were not endemic to the Gondwanan landmasses, the researchers said.Gondwanaland is the southern half of the Pangaean supercontinent that existed some 300 million years ago and is composed of the major continental blocks of South America, Africa, Arabia, Madagascar, Sri Lanka, India, Antarctica, and Australia.In India, the Late Cretaceous sauropod dinosaur generally belong to the titanosaurian clade and has been reported from the Lameta Formation of Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra and Kallamedu Formation of Tamil Nadu, the researchers said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/100-million-year-old-bones-of-sauropod-dinosaurs-discovered-in-meghalaya-101620123476721.html

The ministry of defence on Tuesday announced that the five medical oxygen plants will be installed within the first week of May in hospitals in and around Delhi.Those five plants will be installed at AIIMS Trauma Centre, Dr Ram Manohar Lohia (RML) Hospital, Safdarjung Hospital, Lady Hardinge Medical College and one at AIIMS in Jhajjar, Haryana. The ministry said two of them reached Delhi on Tuesday and the installation process is already underway at AIIMS and RML Hospital.These oxygen plants have been supplied by M/s Trident Pneumatics Pvt. Ltd., Coimbatore, a technology partner of DRDO. The company has been given an order of 48 medical oxygen plants. Apart from these, the government has placed an order for 332 plants with M/s Tata Advanced Systems Limited and the delivery is expected to start from mid-May.“The delivery schedule is being monitored very closely to deliver before the plants time. Sites are being prepared at each hospital in parallel,” the ministry of defence said in a statement.These medical oxygen plants are designed for a flow rate of 1,000 litres per minute to tackle the surge in coronavirus disease (Covid-19) cases and subsequent oxygen shortages, according to the ministry. The system is expected to cater to 190 patients at a flow rate of 5 litres per minute and charge 195 cylinders per day.The technology for the medical oxygen plant has been developed by DRDO based on the On‐Board Oxygen Generation for LCA, Tejas. The ministry stressed that these plants will overcome the logistics issues of oxygen transportation and help the Covid-19 patients in emergency. Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) has also ordered 120 medical oxygen plants through its industries.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/drdo-to-install-medical-oxygen-plants-in-delhi-equipment-arrives-at-aiims-rml-101620144401721.html

The joint team were able to recover incriminating materials including huge quantity of arms and ammunition from the hideout,” a spokesman of Jammu and Kashmir police had said at that time. It was also revealed that Nazir was involved in providing logistic support to the terrorists. However, his family alleged he was framed by the police.Similarly, assistant professor Bari was arrested in a terrorism-related case and booked under the Public Safety Act (PSA) in March this year. Specific details of Idrees Jan’s misconduct have not been revealed yet.The dismissals come following identification and scrutiny of government employees believed to be involved in anti-national activities and or in cases posing a threat to the country’s security. The LG had set up a special task force for this purpose.Now, the JK Employees Joint Action Committee is protesting their termination and demanding that the reasons for termination are made public and the employees are given a chance to explain their position. “Termination of employees without giving them a chance to be heard is against the spirit of law and the constitution of the country. This move has spread panic among the employees who are not only stressed but also over burdened,” said Mohammad Rafique Rather, president, JK Employees Joint Action Committee (EJAC)He also alleged that the decision was taken in haste. “The dismissed employees should be allowed to put up their defence.” He also requested LG Manoj Sinha’s intervention in the matter.On Monday, Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) president Mehbooba Mufti alleged that the terminations were done on “flimsy grounds”. However, her comments led to a backlash with many pointing out that many government employees were dismissed for anti-national activities during her tenure as the chief minister of the erstwhile state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jammu-and-kashmir-employees-union-protests-dismissal-of-3-employees-101620138677851.html

As they were living closely it must have been spread among them," Mishra told PTI."Now we are developing a method to test the samples of their faeces. This method would be useful in future as every time it is not possible to collect saliva samples from wild animals," he added.He further said the virus which is present in the lions at the Nehru Zoological Park here is not any new variant."They have mild symptoms and they are eating well and they are fine," he said.Replying to a query, he said there is every possibility of animals contracting the virus as they are also mammals like human beings.Mishra further said these animals must have got infected through zoo-keeping staff.A senior official of the zoo said they keep sending the samples of the animals to CCMB from time to time for analysis.As the lions started showing symptoms such as fever, the zoo officials collected the samples and sent them to CCMB.The official further said the samples from the wild animals will be collected either by 'Squeeze cage' method or by tranquilising them.In the 'squeeze cage' method, the animal will be confined in a cage without any space so that it cannot move or resist while taking samples.In view of rapid spread of the coronavirus in the country, the Ministry of Environment Forests and Climate Change, recently issued an advisory to close all zoological parks, national parks, tiger reserves and wildlife sanctuaries for visitors till further orders to control the spread of the pandemic.Accordingly, the zoo here, Kakatiya Zoological Park, Warangal, Kawal and Amrabad Tiger Reserves, all National Parks and wildlife sanctuaries in Telangana were closed from May 2, an official release had earlier said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/lions-in-hyderabad-zoo-test-covid-19-positive-samples-examined-by-ccmb-101620124769839.html

Mamata’s party Trinamool Congress immediately demanded a recount but was turned down by the EC.Hindustan Times reported that on Monday, Banerjee said she will move court against the EC’s decision and alleged that the refusal by polling officer was made under pressure. Showing a text message in her mobile phone to reporters, Banerjee said, “I cannot reveal who forwarded this but the returning officer, who wrote it, clearly says that his life was under threat. In the message, he said he was held at gunpoint and forced not to order a re-counting which we demanded.”WATCH: ‘I may be murdered…’: Mamata reads out Nandigram poll officer’s alleged messageThe Election Commission said “the returning officer of an assembly constituency performs statutory functions under the Representation of the People Act, 1951 in quasi-judicial capacity independently. Whether it is nomination, polling or counting, the RO acts strictly in accordance with the extant electoral laws, instructions and guidelines of the ECI.”The poll panel further said that when an application for recounting of votes is made the returning officer shall decide the matter and may allow the application in whole or in part or may reject it in its entirety if it appears to him to be frivolous or unreasonable.“After the counting in Nandigram AC, the election agent of a particular candidate requested for recount, which was rejected by the RO (returning officer), through a speaking order, on the basis of material facts available before him in accordance with the provisions of Rule 63, as above, and declared the result. In such a case, only legal remedy is to file an EP (election petition) before the high court,” the poll commission said.As per provisions of the Representation of the People Act, 1951, the decision of a returning officer can only be challenged through an election petition under section 80 of the Act.ALSO READ: Mamata Banerjee, a street fighter who’s now beaten Left, Right, CentreThe Election Commission said, “Each counting table (in Nandigram) had one micro-observer. Their reports never indicated any impurity of counting process on their respective table. The RO caused the entries of votes polled by each candidate after each round to be written on the display board which could be easily seen by the counting agents. No doubt was raised on the result of round-wise counting. This enabled the RO to proceed uninterruptedly with the counting of votes.”The poll panel further said that a copy of each of the results after each round was shared with all the counting agents, who the result sheets.Refuting the allegations of malpractice, the Election Commission said “polling officers on ground perform in extremely competitive political environment diligently with full transparency and fairness and, therefore, attribution of any motive in such cases is not desirable.”Taking cognisance of media reports on alleged threat to the life of the returning officer, the Election Commission said it has directed the chief secretary of West Bengal to provide adequate security to the officer.The Trinamool Congress won 213 of the state’s 294 assembly constituencies, with the BJP winning 77. Counting was held for 292 seats, as voting for two seats will take place at a later date.

04-05-2021||India||Odisha IFoS officer Abhay Kant Pathak, in jail in DA case, compulsorily retired||Senior Indian Forest Service (IFoS) officer Abhay Kant Pathak, in jail since November last year on charges of amassing assets disproportionate to his known sources of income, was compulsorily retired on Monday after the Centre approved the state government’s recommendations for the same.As part of its policy of zero tolerance towards corruption, the Odisha government last year recommended retirement of the 1987 batch IFoS officer, accusing him of being “very corrupt and high-flying”. The state had accused Pathak of depositing his “ill-gotten” wealth in his son Akash Pathak’s bank accounts and said that he was also involved in a job racket run by his son, who posed as managing director of Tata Motors to rob unemployed youth of huge amounts of cash on the false pretext of giving them jobs in the company.In the last 1 year, more than 104 state officials have been given compulsory retirement over corruption issues.Pathak, who served as the additional principal chief conservator of forests would have become the next principal chief conservator of forests of Odisha in June this year had he not been named in a corruption case in November last year. The state vigilance department accused Pathak of amassing disproportionate assets worth ₹9.35 crore, 435 % of his total income and claimed it to be the biggest disproportionate assets case in Odisha’s history.Pathak, working as Odisha’s additional principal chief conservator of forests (Plan, Programme and Afforestation), was arrested after vigilance conducted raids at 13 places including his official residence in Bhubaneswar, his office, his apartment, the apartment of his nephew, driver’s house, his house at his native village in Khagaria, Bihar, luxury apartments and farmhouse in Pune and residence of his son’s manager at Samata Colony, Pune. His son Abhay Pathak, who owned Mercedes, BMW and Tata Harrier brand vehicles as well as high-end bikes such as Yamaha FZS, was arrested too.The vigilance sleuths had alleged that Pathak and his family made at least 20 trips to different cities through chartered planes at an expenditure of over ₹3 crores during Covid lockdown last year. The vigilance sleuths found hotel bills totalling over ₹90 lakhs for expenses made at Hotel Taj Mahal Palace, Mumbai and advance booking worth ₹20 lakhs at Taj Lake Palace, Udaipur in Rajasthan for the impending marriage of Pathak’s son with the daughter of former BJD minister Pradip Panigrahy.Panigrahy was also accused of conspiring with Pathak’s son Akash to cheat job seekers by promising jobs at Tata Motors without any authority to do so. He is also behind bars for more than 5 months.In January this year, a vigilance court in Odisha granted bail to Pathak and his son in the disproportionate assets case. However, he and his son remain behind bars in another case of non-payment of money to a travel agency in Bhubaneswar. The father-son duo had booked chartered flights, five-star hotels and air tickets through the agency which cost around ₹2.78 crore. They paid the agency ₹2.13 crore while ₹65.16 lakh is yet to be cleared....||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/odisha-ifs-officer-abhay-kant-pathak-compulsorily-retired-for-corruption-101620124878949.html
04-05-2021||India||New insectivorous mammal species discovered in India after four decades||A new insect-eating mammal species almost the size of a house mouse has been discovered in India after over four decades. A Zoological Survey of India (ZSI) team discovered the grey-coloured shrew that feeds on insects on the remote uninhabited dormant volcanic island of Narcondam in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands.“Till date, 422 species of mammals have been reported from India. We have added one more... with the new discovery. It is after four decades that we have discovered an insect-eating mammal. In between, a few other mammal species like macaques and bats have been discovered,” said Kailash Chandra, former director of ZSI, who retired last week.The last insect-eating mammal species were discovered on South Andaman Island in 1978. It was named Jenkin’s Andaman shrew. The new animal has been named Crocidura Norcondamica after the Narcondam Island where it was found. Also Read | Rare butterfly species documented on Vetal tekdi by Pune research studentsEarlier, 11 species of shrew have been reported from India.The latest finding has been published in Scientific Reports, an online multidisciplinary open-access journal from the publishers of Nature.“The new species show substantial genetic differences with other shrew species earlier discovered from India, Myanmar, and Sumatra,” said Shantanu Kundu, a scientist from the ZSI’s Centre for DNA Taxonomy.The animal lives on the forest floor, feeds on insects and helps control the insect population in the dense forest of Narcondam.Due to the remoteness and inaccessibility throughout the year, the smaller islands of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands are not as explored as the larger islands.“As the island [Narcondam] is uninhabited, the new species may not face the human disturbances, but the extremely restricted insular habitat and the associated limited population size will automatically result in increased vulnerability of the species,” said Chandra.According to ZSI scientists, further field studies on taxonomy, ecology, and distribution of the animal will help understand the present status and promote conservation plans.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/new-insectivorous-mammal-species-discovered-in-india-after-four-decades-101620122958574.html

Total revenue collection from various own tax and non-tax sectors during 2020-21 financial year is estimated at ₹56, 363 crore against ₹46,970 crore collected in 2019-20 financial year.The increased collection of GST is important for Odisha in a pandemic year as the state is looking at more expenditure on health than was budgeted for 2021-22 due to the second wave of Covid-19. With daily cases likely to touch around 15,000 by May second week, the state government estimates it may have to spend far more than the ₹9,164 crore it had budgeted.Last month, Odisha chief secretary fixed a target of ₹40,000 crore as tax collection from own sectors like stamp duty and registration fees, sales tax, state GST and excise duty apart from another ₹21,500 crore from non-tax sectors like mining, water tax and forest tax for the 2021-22 financial year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/odisha-records-highest-ever-gst-in-april-despite-covid-induced-slowdown-101620122297024.html

04-05-2021||India||PM Modi, PM Boris Johnson to boost trade during virtual summit||Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his British counterpart Boris Johnson are set to unveil a “Enhanced Trade Partnership” to deepen bilateral cooperation during their virtual summit on Tuesday, part of London’s post-Brexit efforts to conclude new trade deals around the world. The partnership includes lower trade barriers and improved market access for certain British items such as fruits and medical devices. The partnership is also being described by the British side as a precursor to a possible free trade agreement. Ahead of the virtual summit, Johnson announced a package of trade and investment deals with India worth £1 billion, including a £240 million investment by the Serum Institute of India (SII) in the UK, that is expected to create more than 6,500 jobs. This virtual summit is also expected to lead to deeper relationship in healthcare, climate action and defence. The trade barriers addressed by the Enhanced Trade Partnership include the lifting of restrictions to enable fruit producers across the UK to export their produce to India for the first time, and improved access for medical devices through the acceptance of the “UK Certificates of Free Sale” in India, thus removing the need for additional accreditation of British medical devices exported to India. Under the partnership, the two sides will also commit themselves to removing barriers in the Indian legal services sector that prevent UK lawyers from practising international and foreign law in India, said a statement from the UK Prime Minister’s Office. This measure “could significantly increase UK legal services exports and UK legal services imports from India”. The two sides will also work to deepen cooperation in educational services and conclude work on recognition of UK higher education qualifications, which is expected to encourage an increase in student flows, skills transfer and knowledge-sharing between the two sides. However, experts believe the Indian side is in no rush to sign new free trade deals, especially at a time when the Indian government is pushing its “Make in India” and Aatmanirbhar Bharat (self-reliant India) initiatives. Some Western countries have expressed concerns about these initiatives restricting access to the Indian market. Johnson’s summit with his Indian counterpart is part of the British government’s pivot to the Indo-Pacific and efforts to conclude more trade deals around the world after the UK’s exit from the European Union (EU). Britain has so far concluded trade deals with Japan and Singapore. The new trade and investment deals announced by Johnson include new Indian investments of more than £533 million into the UK that are expected to create more than 6,000 jobs in vital sectors such as health and technology, and deals worth £200 million will support low carbon growth. British businesses have secured new export deals with India worth more than £446 million. This includes CMR Surgical exporting its next generation “Versius” surgical robotic system that helps surgeons perform minimal access surgery under a deal worth £200 million. Annual trade between India and the UK is currently worth around £23 billion. More than 800 Indian companies have a presence in the UK, which they were using as a base to access markets in the EU.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-pm-boris-johnson-to-boost-trade-during-virtual-summit-101620117376690.html

04-05-2021||India||'Unconstitutional': Supreme Court strikes down Bengal law regulating real estate||The Supreme Court Tuesday struck down West Bengal’s law on regulating the real estate sector saying it was “unconstitutional” as the state's statute encroached upon the Centre's Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act (RERA).The top court also said that WB HIRA has failed to include valuable safeguards for the homebuyers'.A bench of justices D Y Chandrachud and M R Shah said the West Bengal Housing Industry Regulation Act (HIRA), 2017 is more or less identical to the Centre's RERA and hence repugnant to Parliament's law.”The state law has encroached upon the domain of the Parliament and hence is unconstitutional,” the verdict said.It said however that homebuyers who have purchased properties under state law before its verdict, will not have to worry as their registration and other acts would remain valid.The judgement came on a plea of ‘Forum For People's Collective Efforts’ , an umbrella homebuyers association, challenging the constitutional validity of West Bengal Housing Industry Regulation Act, 2017, which is more or less identical to the Centre's RERA.Pronouncing the verdict through video conferencing, Justice Chandrachud said that fundamental features of WB HIRA overlaps and is a word-to-word copy of Centre's RERA. The bench, which passed a lengthy verdict on the issue, said that WB HIRA touches upon entry 6 and 7 of the concurrent list which was occupied by the law passed by Parliament and set up a parallel regime in the state.“The state doing so is plainly unconstitutional,” the bench said, adding that provisions in the legislation show that there is repugnancy in WB HIRA and RERA.“WB HIRA is directly in conflict with RERA, without any valuable safeguards for the home buyers”, the bench said, adding that it is invoking powers under Article 142 to hold that registrations of properties done under the state law before its verdict, will be valid. The top court had during the hearing of the petition wondered whether a state, in the name of cooperative federalism, enacts legislation under the concurrent list to occupy the same subjects in which Parliament has enacted a law.It had observed that both Centre's RERA and WB HIRA dealt with issues of providing reliefs to home buyers and promoting real estate sectors but some of the provisions of the State's legislation were in direct conflict with the law passed by Parliament.The top court had said that a state can have legislation but to supplant the Centre's law and not to be direct conflict or to override it and say that “now we will not follow your law but our law”It had wondered why a state would have a similar law enacted when there is already a law passed by Parliament and said many provisions in WB HIRA are repugnant to Centre's RERA.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/unconstitutional-supreme-court-strikes-down-bengal-law-regulating-real-estate-101620116648420.html

04-05-2021||India||Armed forces use lease route to cut red-tape, stay prepared for adversaries||Rather than getting caught in the laborious defence acquisition process, the armed forces are using the financial powers of vice-chiefs to lease out critical weapon platforms from strategic allies like the United Sstates, France and Russia. The vice-chiefs have the power to purchase ₹300 crore worth of equipment as part of capital purchases as well as half of ₹500 crore can be used for emergency requirements for the service but outside capital outlay.According to South Block officials, the leasing of two Predator unmanned aerial vehicles from the US, a nuclear power submarine Akula class to replace the presently leased INS Chakra from Russia, and the proposal to lease a Airbus 330 multi-role transport tanker from France are examples in this direction. While the leasing process allows the armed forces to train on a platform that it plans to acquire, it also short-circuits the labyrinth of acquisition process like acceptance of necessity, request for information, request for proposal, defence acquisition committee, finance ministry approvals and finally the Cabinet Committee of Security (CCS).Faced with a northern neighbour who is constantly inducting stand-off weapon systems like weaponized drones, nuclear powered submarines, fifth generation aircraft and large warships, the leasing system at least allows the Indian armed forces to be prepared for future wars. “The leasing of two Predator drones from US allows India to train and be prepared to induct 10 such drones in each of the three services. The MQ9 Predator drone is a highly versatile UAV with capacity to target the adversary through Hell-fire missile and laser guided bombs. The process for acquisition of drones has already begun,” said a top admiral of Indian Navy. The Navy is also eyeing to lease Rafale maritime fighters for its upcoming indigenous aircraft carrier INS Vikrant as the American fighters like F-18 and F-15 are too heavy and large for 45,000 tonne flat-top warship.After its tender to purchase mid-air refuellers was canned by the Defence Ministry, the Indian Air Force is now leasing one Airbus 330 MRTT while eyeing further lease of five more refuellers currently with France through the proper acquisition route.While the Indian Army has no plans to take weapon platforms on lease as of now, the military purchased anti-tank weapon systems, UAVs and laser guided shells from Israel under emergency purchases powers with the vice-chief at a time when India and China were locked eyeball to eye ball at Pangong Tso in eastern Ladakh.While Chinese President Xi Jinping has offered support to Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi to ride out of Covid-19 crisis, the paramount leader has refused to budge on the Gogra-Hot Springs issue in eastern Ladakh as if the present government will allow the land dispute to be swept under the carpet or to be left to future generations.With Beijing determined to play hardball on the border with India, the latter will have to be in advanced state of preparedness with high tech weapons in case the balloon goes up when the pandemic with origins in Wuhan sweeps India.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/armed-forces-use-lease-route-to-cut-red-tape-remain-prepared-for-adversaries-101620114293042.html

Former Congress president Rahul Gandhi has slammed the government for enlisting the project under "essential services". He urged the NDA government to work with a vision to curb the growing Covid cases and not spend money on Central Vista redevelopment project at a time when the country was reeling under the pandemic that has almost choked the healthcare system.“Central Vista -not essential.

Jagmohan is known for his contributions to the Jammu region, including the creation of the Shri Mata Vaishno Devi Shrine Board (SMVDSB) when he was the Jammu & Kashmir governor.The board was created in 1986 and the model has been emulated for the management of shrines and temples across India.SMVDSB chief executive officer Ramesh Kumar said Jagmohan’s contribution is remarkable, and he will be remembered forever. “He was the man behind the creation of the board in 1986. The entire facilities and creation of infrastructure were his brainchild. He is the man behind what exists today,” said Kumar. “It was his vision of development...all the facilities that exist today are because of him.” Kumar said they vow to carry forward Jagmohan’s legacy. “We will remember him forever. Earlier, only 10 lakh [one million] pilgrims used to visit the cave shrine every year but with his vision and creation of facilities, the footfall increased to one crore [10 million] per year. It was he who propelled this pilgrimage on the national and international map. We deeply condole his sad demise.”Former Jammu & Kashmir police chief SP Vaid called the board a very big contribution of Jagmohan. “He will be remembered for it. Because of him, all the facilities came up and for that, he will be remembered by millions not only in Jammu & Kashmir but across the country.”Also Read | Mehbooba criticises sacking of govt staff over ‘anti-state’ activitiesVaid called Jagmohan a very able administrator too. “[Jagmohan] worked in very difficult times in the early 90s when Pakistan-sponsored terrorism raised its ugly head and Jammu & Kashmir had all sorts of law-and-order problems, but he faced them head-on. He was a very able administrator.”Former deputy chief minister Kavinder Gupta echoed Vaid. “He played an indispensable role in Jammu & Kashmir when terrorism was at its peak. Had he not been there, the Kashmiri Pandit community would have been wiped out. He played a proactive role in bureaucracy. A visionary leader and administrator, he created the Shri Mata Vaishno Devi Shrine Board that brought a sea change in the concept of pilgrimages across India. His model is still being studied by other shrines and temples...,” said Gupta. “He will be remembered for his indispensable contribution to Jammu & Kashmir.”Ravinder Raina, the chief of Bharatiya Janata Party’s Jammu & Kashmir unit, said Jagmohan was a national leader. “When Jammu & Kashmir was passing through difficult circumstances, he was the one who dealt a severe blow to Pakistan-sponsored terrorism. He gave his services like a true soldier of the nation… he conceived and speeded up developmental projects, created Shri Mata Vaishno Devi Shrine Board, and brought this pilgrimage on the international map. All these flyovers and big institutions were conceived and executed by him. Today, he may not be with us, but he will live in the hearts of the countrymen.”Devender Singh Rana, the provincial president of the National Conference, said, “Jagmohan was the architect of the Shri Mata Vaishno Devi Shrine Board, which led to...ushering of a new chapter in the facilitation and management of the pilgrimage.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jammu-mourns-demise-of-former-union-minister-jagmohan-101620111736782.html

He also served as the lieutenant governor of Delhi.He was appointed Jammu and Kashmir governor in 1984 and completed his five-year tenure.As militancy erupted in Jammu and Kashmir, he was made the governor again in 1990 but was removed within a few months as differences between him and the then V P Singh-led government at the Centre grew over tackling the militancy.Jagmohan then joined the BJP and represented the party in the Lok Sabha a number of times from New Delhi.His tenure as a Union minister in the Atal Bihari Vajpayee-led government earned him praise from many quarters.In his condolence message on Twitter, Union Home Minister Amit Shah said, "Shri Jagmohan Ji will always be remembered for his remarkable tenure as the Governor of J&K.

The agency has booked some Kerala police officers, they said without naming them.A Supreme Court bench of justices AM Khanwilkar, Dinesh Maheshwari and Krishna Murari called the matter “serious” and ordered the CBI probe on April 15. It accepted the report of a court-appointed panel that looked into the role of the police officers. The court said the CBI will be at liberty to use the contents of the report for the registration of a preliminary inquiry for further investigation.Also Read | The 1994 espionage case that led to Isro scientist Nambi Narayanan’s arrestThe Kerala police registered two cases in October 1994 after Maldivian national Rasheeda was arrested in Thiruvananthapuram for allegedly obtaining secret drawings of ISRO rocket engines to sell to Pakistan. Narayanan, the then director of the cryogenic project at ISRO, was arrested along with his colleague, D Sasikumaran, and Fousiya Hasan, a Maldivian friend of Rasheeda. Former Supreme Court judge DK Jain inquired into the circumstances that led to the framing of Narayanan, 79, and his arrest. The CBI probed the matter and exonerated Narayanan in 1996.The Supreme Court called the police action against Narayanan “psycho-pathological treatment”. In September 2018, it said his “liberty and dignity”, basic to his human rights, were jeopardised as he was taken into custody and, eventually, despite all the glory of the past, he was compelled to face “cynical abhorrence”.In 2018, the Supreme Court directed the state government to pay him ₹50 lakh compensation for his wrongful incarceration, malicious prosecution, and humiliation for being framed in a false case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cbifiles-case-in-framing-of-isro-scientist-nambi-narayanan-101620099975528.html

A special military flight from Italy brought in the oxygen generation plant and a team of specialists to support the response to a massive surge in Coronavirus infections that has stretched healthcare facilities in many cities. The plant, capable of supplying an entire hospital, will be deployed at the ITBP hospital in Greater Noida, the Italian embassy said. The Italian support included 20 ventilators. The Italian specialists include a team from the Maxiemergenza 118 emergency service of Piedmont region, a doctor from Lombardy region and a representative of the Italian health ministry. The delegation was received by European Union (EU) Ambassador Ugo Astuto and Italian ambassador Vincenzo De Luca, who said, “Italy stands with India in the fight against Coronavirus...The medical team and equipment provided by Italy will contribute to saving lives in these terrible moments.” Italy is the third EU country, after France and Germany, to include an oxygen generation plant in its support package. France sent eight high capacity plants on Sunday while Germany is set to deliver a similar plant this week. The fourth consignment of medical supplies from the UK, containing 60 ventilators, also arrived on Monday. According to the Indian embassy in Qatar, 300 tonnes of medical aid from around the world, including ventilators, oxygen concentrators and PPE kits, are being flown in free of charge by Qatar Airways. The Singapore high commission said three cryogenic oxygen tanks and almost 1,000 oxygen cylinders were being despatched by the Singapore Red Cross and its corporate partners on the Indian warship INS Airavat. According to an official count, India has already received 1,656 oxygen concentrators, 965 ventilators, 1,782 oxygen cylinders, 17 large cylinders, 20 large oxygen concentrators, 150 bedside monitors, 480 BiPAPs, 20 high flow humidifying oxygen therapy devices, nine oxygen generation plants, 136,000 doses of Remdesivir, 200,000 packs of Favipiravir and other supplies. However, few details are officially available regarding the distribution of this equipment and other supplies. France and Italy are the only two countries that have specified where some of the equipment they supplied will go – the eight French oxygen generation plants are being distributed among hospitals in Delhi, Haryana and Telangana, while the Italian plant will go to the ITBP Hospital in Greater Noida. This has resulted in questions regarding the allocation of the supplies, including on social media. The external affairs ministry has said an empowered group of ministers and senior officials is responsible for allocation of the supplies in response to the needs of state governments. Once the foreign relief materials arrive at an Indian airport, they are handed over to the Indian Red Cross Society, which receives all supplies on behalf of the government. People familiar with developments said on condition of anonymity the supplies are then handled by the Red Cross, the Union health ministry and state-run HLL Lifecare, which is responsible for procurement and warehousing of medical supplies for the government. However, there was little clarity as of Monday how much of the materials had been despatched from HLL’s warehouses at the Delhi airport. The issue of transparency in distribution of relief materials has been raised by the media in countries such as the US. Asked about the matter, a US embassy spokesperson in New Delhi said: “As each US shipment arrives, USAID is transferring ownership of provided materials upon their arrival to the government of India through the Indian Red Cross organisation.” The spokesperson added: “We refer you to the government of India for information about the deployment and use of these materials subsequent to their transfer.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/more-covid-19-help-pours-in-for-india-questions-raised-about-aid-allocation-101620098535360.html

Previously, companies were required to do the trial prior to approval.India has invited Pfizer, Johnson & Johnson and Moderna Inc to sell their vaccines to the country but none have applied to do so yet.Pfizer, however, said it is holding fresh talks with the government after having withdrawn its initial application in February over the earlier local trial rule."Pfizer’s application for emergency use authorization was supported with data that shows an overall efficacy rate of 95% with no safety concerns," a company spokeswoman told Reuters, when asked if it had sought an exception even to the current trial rule in its discussions with the government.She added that the safety and efficacy data had been backed by regulatory authorities in the United States, Britain, Japan and the World Health Organization - agencies that India endorses.Pfizer, which produces the vaccine with German partner BioNTech SE, reiterated that it would supply doses only through government contracts.Asked about the vaccine's ultra-low temperature storage requirements - minus 70 degrees Celsius (-90 F) - Pfizer said the company could deliver the shot to vaccination centers using its specially designed, temperature-controlled thermal shippers.It said doses could be stored in ultra-low-temperature freezers for up to six months, in the shippers for up to 30 days by refilling them with dry ice every five days, or in common refrigeration and freezer units for five days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-safety-concern-with-our-covid-19-vaccine-pfizer-to-india-101620090054248.html

We stand with India, particularly during these difficult times India is experiencing, and are sending life-saving equipment to our Indian brothers and sisters," Foreign Minister Gabi Ashkenazi said in the statement."Israel and India share strategic ties that span a wide range of political, security, and economic issues. India is one of the most important countries for Israel broadly in the international arena and particularly in Asia-Pacific," the Foreign Minister said, adding that the emergency assistance is an "expression of deep friendship" between both countries.He thanked all those who cooperated in arranging the comprehensive package.The economic division at the Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs is said to have roped in key economic bodies, including the Israel-India Chamber of Commerce, Israel-Asia Chamber of Commerce, Manufacturers' Association of Israel, Federation of Israeli Chambers of Commerce and the Israel Export Institute for the aid package.Separately, Amdocs has announced to donate 150 oxygen generators, which will be sent to India as part of the Israeli aid package, the press statement said.The JDC (American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee) is said to have also joined Israel’s aid efforts and will donate oxygen generators and other equipment."We recall that at the beginning of the coronavirus crisis last year, India mobilised to assist Israel and within this framework approved the air delivery of masks, gloves and raw materials for medicines to Israel and also helped arrange the repatriation of Israeli citizens," the statement said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/israel-to-send-life-saving-medical-equipment-to-india-amid-covid-19-crisis-101620085668047.html
04-05-2021||India||PM Modi-Boris Johnson virtual summit brings 1 bn pound worth of deals||The British government has finalised GBP 1 billion worth of trade and investment with India, creating over 6,500 jobs in Britain, ahead of the virtual summit between UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson and his Indian counterpart Narendra Modi on Tuesday.The investments confirmed by Downing Street on Monday evening form part of an Enhanced Trade Partnership (ETP), which the two leaders will formally sign off during their talks.The ETP will set the ambition to double the value of UK-India trade by 2030 and declare a shared intent to begin work towards a comprehensive Free Trade Agreement (FTA).“Like every aspect of the UK-India relationship, the economic links between our countries make our people stronger and safer,” said Johnson.“Each and every one of the more than 6,500 jobs we have announced today will help families and communities build back from coronavirus and boost the British and Indian economies. In the decade ahead, with the help of (the) new partnership signed today and a comprehensive Free Trade Agreement, we will double the value of our trading partnership with India and take the relationship between our two countries to new highs,” he said.The trade and investment package unveiled by the British government contains over GBP 533 million of new Indian investment into the UK, covering areas such as healthcare and technology.This includes a GBP 240 million investment by the Serum Institute of India (SII) in the UK into its vaccine business and a new sales office in the country, expected to generate new business worth over USD 1 billion.Serum Institute's investment will support clinical trials, research and development and "possibly" manufacturing of vaccines, to help the UK and the world defeat the coronavirus pandemic and other deadly diseases, Downing Street said.British businesses have also secured new export deals with India worth more than GBP 446 million, which is expected to create more than 400 British jobs.This includes CMR Surgical exporting its next-generation “Versius” surgical robotic system, which helps surgeons perform minimal access surgery being rolled out to hospitals in India.This export deal is worth GBP 200 million and will result in the creation of 100 new jobs in the UK.“With almost 1.4 billion people, India’s population is bigger than the EU and US combined and by far the largest market the UK has committed to negotiating a trade deal with to date,” Downing Street said.The ETP agreed between India and the UK is said to create immediate opportunities for British businesses in India across industries including food and drink, life sciences and the service sector.Non-tariff barriers on fruit and medical devices will be lowered, allowing British businesses to export more of their products to India and boosting UK growth and jobs.It also commits both sides to addressing immediate market access barriers as well as continuing to seek further opportunities on the road to an FTA.“A future UK-India trade deal will support hundreds of thousands of jobs and boost the economies of both the UK and India by potentially lowering or removing current tariffs such as those of up to 150 per cent on whisky and up to 125 per cent on automotives as well as on other British products. It would also create huge benefits for British services -- four out five of India’s fastest growing imports are for services like IP and telecommunications,” Downing Street said.The trade barriers addressed by the ETP include lifting restrictions to enable fruit producers across the UK to export British apples, pears and quince to India for the first time and improved access for medical devices through the acceptance of UK Certificates of Free Sale in India, removing the requirement for additional accreditation of UK medical devices when exporting to the Indian market before they can be sold.There is also a commitment to deepening cooperation in educational services and concluding work on the recognition of UK higher education qualifications, which will encourage an increase in student flows, skills transfer and knowledge sharing between the UK and India.It has also been agreed for both sides to work on removing barriers in the Indian legal services sector preventing UK lawyers from practising international and foreign law in India, a step that Downing Street could “significantly increase” UK legal services exports and UK legal services imports from India.According to official statistics, trade between the UK and India is already worth around GBP 23 billion a year, supporting more than half a million jobs.Last week, Johnson spoke to Indian business leaders from companies Infosys and HCL and the software majors are among the Indian firms listed as part of a series of investment deals, set to create 1,000 jobs each in the UK.Some of the others on the list include the likes of biotech firm Global Gene Corp, TVS Motors and Goila Butter Chicken.The UK companies clinching export deals with India include Morningside Pharmaceuticals with an R&D pact, Kloudpad with a data centres deal, BP in a partnership with Infosys and GoZero Mobility with an e-bicycles deal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-boris-johnson-virtual-summit-brings-1-bn-pound-worth-of-deals-101620085690967.html

The army’s foreign division received a call for help and immediately took him to Base Hospital,” the people said. Mlula died on April 28 at the Base Hospital at Delhi Cantonment.The people cited above said there were reports of Indian staff and junior diplomats testing positive at several foreign missions, including those of the Philippines, New Zealand, Thailand, Vietnam, Palestine, the US and Afghanistan. Some of those who tested positive were self-isolating at home while a handful had been hospitalised. There was no official word from Indian officials on these developments.The foreign missions too are tight-lipped on issues such as whether the treatment of infected staff has been affected by the shortage of oxygen and hospital beds, especially after a spat between the government and the opposition Congress over Youth Congress volunteers delivering oxygen cylinders to the Philippines embassy and the New Zealand high commission.The people cited above acknowledged that some missions faced difficulties in accessing both medicines and hospital beds but pointed out that this should be seen in the overall context of swamped healthcare facilities in Delhi and the NCR.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tanzanian-diplomat-dies-of-covid-as-missions-battle-surge-in-capital-101620086127080.html
04-05-2021||India||UK PM announces new £1 bn trade deal with India||UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Monday announced new UK-India trade and investment worth £1 billion, including an investment of £240 million by the Serum Institute of India (SII) for its vaccine business in Britain, ahead of a virtual summit with his Indian counterpart Narendra Modi.The virtual summit on Tuesday will witness the roll-out of a new “Enhanced Trade Partnership” that is expected to pave the way for a future free trade agreement. More than 6,500 new jobs are expected to be created in the UK by the new bilateral trade and investment announced by Johnson.The package contains new Indian investments of more than £533 million that is expected to create more than 6,000 jobs in vital sectors such as health and technology. Deals worth £200 million will support low carbon growth.The investments include £240 million to be pumped in by SII for its vaccine business in Britain, and a new sales office that is expected to create a “large number of jobs”, the UK Prime Minister’s Office said in a statement. SII’s sales office is expected to generate new business worth more than $1 billion, £200 million of which will be invested into the UK.SII’s investment will also support clinical trials, research and development and possibly manufacturing of vaccines. This will help the UK and the world to defeat the pandemic and other deadly diseases. SII has already started phase one trials in the UK of a one-dose nasal vaccine for the coronavirus in partnership with Codagenix INC.British businesses have secured new export deals with India worth more than £446 million, which are expected to create more than 400 British jobs.

04-05-2021||India||Covid-19: What you need to know today||From the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic, some states and Union territories have expended more energy in managing the numbers than managing the spread of the viral disease. It’s almost as if by showing fewer reported cases — these are, in any case, a fraction of the actual cases — and recording fewer deaths, the pandemic will magically go away. At one level this is outright dishonesty; at another, it is understandable because it comes from untrained minds unfamiliar with both science and data (and the importance of both in addressing the pandemic). Then if mygov.in thinks it’s alright to advise people to put oil in their nostrils — don’t try this at home; actually, don’t try this at all — what chance do science and data have in the country? Mathematically, as much chance as Ayush-64 actually working as a Covid-19 treatment. For those who came in late, this is another cure being sold on the basis of a completely disingenuous study. For instance, give me a bunch of healthy individuals, asymptomatically infected with Covid-19, and I can show that Japanese whisky, in moderate doses, helps them (again, don’t try this at home). The fact that the eminently qualified worthies who have been put in charge of India’s Covid response don’t think it is necessary to identify such claims for what they are says a lot about them.But back to the numbers — anyone looking at India’s Covid-19 numbers over the past few days can be forgiven for thinking the country is beating back the second wave. On Friday, India saw 408,331 new Covid cases. On Saturday, this number fell to 392,497. And on Sunday, it fell further to 363,921. This is far from the truth (although there is nothing more I’d like to see than the numbers coming down). Over these three days, the number of tests carried out has fallen (quite sharply), from 1.945 million on Friday to 1.804 million on Saturday, and then, to 1.504 on Sunday. Fewer tests mean fewer cases. The corresponding positivity rates on the three days: 21%, 21.7%, and 24.2%.This is understandable (and also shows there hasn’t been large-scale gaming of the positivity rate). But at the disaggregated level, there is clearly an effort to show things are better than they actually are. A quick revision of what we know of positivity rates may be in order: when a region starts testing more (from a low base), the positivity rate increases, then stays the same for some time — in fact, as evident from the experience of the first wave in states such as Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, and Kerala, it stays at a high plateau for weeks sometimes — before beginning to decline. A sharp decline in the positivity rate with an increasing number of tests is actually a red flag. Delhi saw this last year — a very sharp peak in the case trajectory (peaks are actually more rounded) brought about by a faulty testing strategy — and it means the positivity rate is being managed in some way. Is that happening now? Most likely.Consider Uttar Pradesh — I pick it because it is India’s most populous state, and also escaped the brunt of India’s first wave, which doesn’t bode well for it now. Between April 26 and May 2, the number of cases in the state has ranged between 29,000 and 35,000. It was 33,551 cases on April 26, but only 30,857 cases on May 2 (it was as low as 29,751 cases on April 28). In this period, the number of tests has increased from 176,720 to 297,385, which is good, and the positivity rate has declined sharply from 18.9% to 10.3%. In fact, it has consistently dipped — 18.9%, 17.8%, 15.9%, 15%, 14%, 11.3%, and 10.3%. That’s an 8.6 percentage point drop in the positivity rate in seven days in a state that has seen neither surges nor plateaus of the kind seen in Maharashtra, Karnataka, Kerala, and Tamil Nadu. That’s entirely within the realm of the possible — but there’s a very low probability of it happening.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid19-what-you-need-to-know-today-101620075202433.html

04-05-2021||India||21 at Jaipur Golden died of co-morbidities, not lack of oxygen: Delhi govt report to HC||New Delhi: The Delhi government on Monday denied before the Delhi high court said that 21 patients who died at north Delhi’s Jaipur Golden hospital on April 23-24 lost their lives due to the lack of medical oxygen, and claimed that 20 deaths were either due to pre-existing conditions and one due to the lack of specific medicines.The claim was made in an inquiry report submitted before a bench of justices Vipin Sanghi and Rekha Palli.Twenty-one 21 critically ill patients died overnight between April 23 and 24 at the hospital in Rohini amid a serious oxygen crisis. “The oxygen pressure has dipped as we are running out of stock,” Dr D K Baluja, the medical director of Jaipur Golden Hospital said on April 24. The same day, senior advocate Sachin Datta, appearing for the Jaipur Golden Hospital, told high court that the hospital lost 20 patients due to the shortage of oxygen, and was still facing a deficit in supply.The Delhi government on April 28 constituted a a committee to ascertain the number of deaths due to shortage of oxygen in the hospitals across the national capital, following a direction by the high court on April 27.The four-member committee was mandated to examine the case sheets of all such patients, and to determine whether the cause of death was shortage of oxygen or otherwise; in addition to seeking data from all hospitals and nursing homes on such deaths. In response to the query of the city government, six hospitals and nursing home sent reports on an email id created for this purpose.Documents reviewed by HT have shown that the committee said that all 21 patients at Jaipur Golden Hospital were sick or critical and suffering from Covid-19. It said that all 21 patients were getting oxygen therapy or ventilation throughout their hospital stay including at the time of resuscitation, and there was no mention of oxygen shortage in any of the case records.“In view of natural virulent course of the disease and lack of any evidence suggestive of oxygen shortage in the case records, the committee was of the opinion that shortage of oxygen as the cause of death could not be ascertained,” the Delhi government told the high court bench on Monday.The committee noted that the deaths took place over the course of seven hours. While the first patient died at 10.44pm on April 23, the last death was reported at 5.51am on April 24, the document seen by HT said. The committee said that many of the patients had one or multiple co-morbidities such as heart disease, diabetes, hypothyroidism and hypertension.“All these patients were receiving some form of oxygen therapy and/or ventilator support during the hospital stay,” the report said, adding that “all patients were given supplemental oxygen till their resuscitation/death”.“There was no mention of shortage of oxygen in any of the case sheets and patients were given oxygen supplementation till last, based on the clinical requirement, as per records made available to the committee. …The reason of death in all 21 cases has been uniformly mentioned as “respiratory failure” in the proforma submitted by the hospital,” the report said.The committee has also said that even though shortage of drug was recorded in the case sheet of one patient. However, shortage of oxygen, if any, was not recorded.The hospital did not respond to requests for comment.Meanwhile, some relatives of the 21 who died at the hospital labelled the Delhi government’s move a “cover up”.“This is a complete cover up by the Delhi government. Hospital authorities started making SOS calls to the government regarding the shortage of oxygen but to no avail, “ said Erick Massey, whose mother Delphin Massey (61) died on the same day.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/21-at-jaipur-golden-died-of-co-morbidities-not-lack-of-oxygen-delhi-govt-report-to-hc-101620071231788.html
04-05-2021||India||Covid relief aid flows in as 20 ventilators, oxygen production unit arrive from Italy||On Monday afternoon, a shipment of an oxygen production plant and 20 ventilators arrived at Delhi’s Indira Gandhi International Airport as Covid relief aid from Italy. On Sunday, two relief aircraft from the US landed in the Capital carrying over 1,000 oxygen cylinders, regulators and other medical equipment as well as 125,000 vials of remdesivir.Several countries have been extending a helping hand to India, to fight the second wave of the pandemic that has hit the country hard, resulting in a shortage of oxygen, beds, drugs and other medical essentials.Between April 28 and May 2, the Delhi airport has handled around 25 Covid relief flights, which have brought in around 300 tonnes of medical supplies from various countries such as the US, the UK, the UAE, Uzbekistan, Thailand, Germany, Qatar, Hong Kong and China.The relief material received so far comprises over 5,500 oxygen concentrators, approximately 3,200 oxygen cylinders, over 928,000 face masks and about 136,000 remdesivir injections.All the relief material received on Monday was transferred to the cargo area of the airport and stored inside a temperature-controlled warehouse, JEEVODAY, set up to handle relief material, until the goods are dispatched to their destinations, Delhi airport officials said.The airport operator, DIAL (Delhi International Airport Ltd), said they have a dedicated team of operators at the cargo terminal -- clearing agents, staff from the warehouses and government agencies such as the customs and Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) — who together ensure that all incoming relief material is processed and handled without delay.“We ensure priority landing is given to flights carrying Covid relief material, and such aircraft get parking at the cargo bays near the cargo terminals, just like aircraft bringing in vaccines. We make sure consignments are processed and cleared in the least possible time,” DIAL said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/covid-relief-aid-flows-in-as-20-ventilators-oxygen-production-unit-arrive-from-italy-101620071111220.html
04-05-2021||India||Stalin rises to the helm but AIADMK retains bastions||Chennai: MK Stalin led the DMK and its allies to a comfortable victory with 159 seats out of 234 in the Tamil Nadu assembly, as they were backed by Chennai and regions of the north, south and the centre. But defying the trend in these regions, the AIADMK retained its grip over its bastion, which is the western belt or Kongu region, from where outgoing chief minister Edappadi Palaniswami and other top ministers in his cabinet hail. A combination of their work and caste factor helped the party in putting up a tight fight along with its allies and securing 75 seats. Chennai Chennai, with 16 assembly seats, showed that it remains the DMK’s fort with the party winning 15 and its main ally Congress securing one. Stalin won from the city’s Kolathur constituency for the third time. His son, who made his debut from late DMK patriarch M Karunanidhi borough -- Chepauk-Thiruvallikeni -- also won by a wide margin. AIADMK’s heavyweight outgoing ministers D Jayakumar and ‘Mafoi’ Panidarajan lost in the city wave that supported the DMK. In 2016, when J Jayalalithaa retained power, the AIADMK performed the worst in Chennai (37.5%) compared to other regions, winning only six seats. This was largely due to the electorate’s anger in the aftermath of the 2015 December floods in Chennai. The DMK wrested back these six constituencies and improved its vote share. North In the northern region, the DMK has gone from winning 35 seats in 2016 to 47 this election out of 64 seats. This region includes districts, such as Villupuram and Dharmapuri, where there are caste tensions. The AIADMK’s last-minute announcement of 10.5% internal reservation for the Vanniyar community, a core votebank of its ally Pattali Makkal Katchi (PMK), within the MBC (Most Backward Caste) quota resulted in a consolidation of non-Vanniyar votes. A considerable Dalit population in the region backed the DMK which is in alliance with Viduthalai Chiruthaigal Katchi (formerly known as the Dalit Panthers of India). The AIADMK’s law minister CV Shunmugam also lost to former partyman Dr R Lakshmanan who joined the DMK -- both candidates are Vanniyars. Interviews with voters before the polling indicated that the Vanniyars in this region weren’t appeased by the reservation, which they believed was a hasty decision done for political gains and may not come through -- some weren’t aware of the Bill being passed in the assembly. West The Vanniyar reservation, however, did have some gains in the western belt, which has a presence of Vanniyars as well as Gounders, a community to which Palaniswami belongs. A combination of caste factor as well as the work done by ministers here has helped the AIADMK regain its position after losing much of it to the DMK in the 2019 parliamentary elections. This region catapulted Jayalalithaa to become chief minister for the second time in 2016 where the party gave its best performance winning 84% of the seats. In 2021, this has reduced to 66% but higher than DMK’s 33%. However, following Jayalalithaa’s death in December 2016, a divided AIADMK’s alliance with the BJP led to a strong anti-incumbency that had helped Stalin sweep 38/39 Lok Sabha seats. On his home turf Edappadi constituency, Palaniswami won for the seventh time and bettered his margin by winning with a 92,849 vote difference this election compared to 42,022 vote margin in 2016. The party won six out of the eight segments falling within the Salem parliamentary constituency, which includes Edappadi seat. “He has caused a ripple effect as even those surrounding Salem voted for the AIADMK,” said political analyst Maalan Narayanan. South and Central region In DMK’s traditional stronghold, it reigned supreme --more than doubling its performance in the central region from 41.3% in 2016 to 86.9% this election. The DMK now has 40 MLAs from this region and AIADMK has come down from 27 to six MLAs. “The crop loan waiver has had no effect in the delta region,” said Narayanan. The central districts include Trichy, Nagappatinam, and Karur where the AIADMK’s efforts to appease farmers by waiving ₹12,110-crore crop loans for 1.63 million farmers and announcing delta districts as a protected agriculture zone didn’t help the party. In the south, DMK’s campaign against police excesses in the Thoothukudi firing, in which 13 anti-Sterlite protestors died in May 2018, and the custodial deaths of the father-son duo last year seems to have worked. The DMK improved its vote percentage from 44.8% in the previous election to 68.9%. The big upset here was AIADMK’s rebel faction AMMK founder TTV Dhinakaran’s loss to sitting minister Kadambur Raju. “It was expected that the south will see a split because of caste votes. AMMK was expected to take away Mukkaluthur caste voters who would support VK Sasikala but it seems to have gone to the DMK,” said Narayanan. “Overall, the AIADMK has to introspect because except for its stronghold in the west, the ministers in other regions have lost by huge margins.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/stalin-rises-to-the-helm-but-aiadmk-retains-bastions-101620070330912.html
04-05-2021||India||After Kerala debacle, many demand Cong overhaul||Thiruvananthapuram: After shocking defeat in the assembly elections in Kerala knives are out in the Congress, with many leaders openly demanding complete overhaul of the organisation and corrective steps to stem the tide, people familiar with the developments said. The Congress-led United Democratic Front (UDF) managed to win only 41 out of 140 seats in the Kerala assembly elections, results of which were announced on Sunday. The ruling Communist Party of India (Marxist)-led Left Democratic Front swept the polls, winning 99 seats and breaking the four-decade-old jinx of alternating government in the state. Soon after the results were declared, leader of opposition Ramesh Chennithala and Kerala Pradesh Congress Committee president Mullapally Ramachandran reportedly informed the party high command about their intention to quit. While the HT cannot independently verify the veracity of the reports, it has learnt that the two leaders were waiting for permission from the high command. Many district Congress presidents have also offered to quit, people quoted earlier said. Alapuzha district Congress president M Liju, who lost in Ambalapuzha, has already resigned and Idukki and Kannur DCC presidents have also offered to quit. Many party workers took to the social media to vent their anger and sought immediate change of the state leadership, with a section strongly batting for Kannur strongman and member of Parliament K Sudhakaran to assume the PCC president’s post to lift the sagging morale of workers. They argued that only a strong leader could check the ruling CPI(M), adding that Sudhakaran is known for his acerbic tongue and strong reactions. Senior leader and former minister Thiruvanchur Radhakrishnan has also endorsed the name, saying Sudhakaran was able enough to steer the party out of trouble. “There was laxity after the big victory in parliament elections (winning 19 out of 20 Lok Sabha seats) and some of the leaders failed to gauge the Left front’s ability to manipulate things. It is a collective responsibility, but senior leaders will have to own it up,” senior Congress leader P T Thomas, who emerged victorious from a seat in Ernakulam, said on Monday. Another section of Congress workers blamed the party for introducing so many young candidates in such a short span. Out of 95 Congress candidates, more than 55% were new faces and the party termed it a “generational shift”. But only a couple of them made it in the Left surge and the party could win only 21 seats this time. Some workers even said that party’s national leader Rahul Gandhi, who campaigned extensively and had a big role in the selection of candidates, will have to share responsibility. He and his sister Priyanka Gandhi Vadra had campaigned extensively in the state. As an MP from Wayanad, Gandhi held many rallies, road shows and interactions in the state. Some of his videos like addressing students in a women’s college in Kochi and his sea voyage with fishermen in Kollam later turned viral. Meanwhile, some young party workers have sought a larger role for Thiruvananthapuram MP Shashi Tharoor, who is quite popular among youth. Tharoor campaigned extensively in the state this time and also prepared a “people’s manifesto”. “The party will have to undergo a major operation. It has to be built all over again bottom up. And many young leaders will have to come up. Otherwise, it will stagnate at this level and decline in its popular base,” said G Pramod Kumar, political analyst and former advisor of the United Nations Development Programme.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/after-kerala-debacle-many-demand-cong-overhaul-101620070150854.html
04-05-2021||India||‘Stressed’ B’luru police worried about additional IPL duties||Bengaluru: Ten matches of the ongoing Indian Premier League (IPL) are scheduled in Bengaluru between May 9 to May 22, and several officers in the Bengaluru police are not happy about the additional burden of providing security to the cricket league. With more than 700 policemen in isolation due to Covid and the police forces working overtime to enforce the lockdown, these officers feel setting aside more than 300 policemen for IPL duties would put pressure on the force. A senior police officer on the condition of anonymity said that even though no crowd is allowed during the matches, protection of the stadium and players will still require security personnel. “We will have to secure all entry and exit points of the stadium, conduct sanitization of the stadium and provide escort for players and other staff, apart from security at the hotels,” said the officer. Talking about the current deployment of the police in the city, an IPS officer said that while the normal duties such as manning a police station have come down, additional boots are required on the field. “We have to conduct patrols, man check posts, provide security to Covid centres and hospital. In fact, we have deployed home guards to make fill the gaps in the manpower,” the officer added. The top brass of Bengaluru police, however, said they will fulfil the commitment of providing security, which was decided before the second wave. “As a professional force we will provide adequate security,” said Kamal Pant, Bengaluru police commissioner. “Unless the government decides otherwise, we will provide enough men to ensure that the Indian Premier League goes without any security hassle,” he added. Talking about the security arrangements, Pant said that security will be provided at the hotels where the players say, an escort will be provided on the route of their travel and there will be deployment at the stadium. “Since there is no crowd, there will be only three categories of people. – players, support staff and organizers of the tournament. Only two gates will be left open because there is no crowd,” he added. When asked about the reservations from his subordinates, he said that police will abide by the government’s decision. A junior officer, however, added that as part of the security protocols ambulances will have to stationed at the stadium in the case of an emergency. “This is a time when we need all ambulances, we have for Covid patients. The contingency plans will also cater for oxygen supplies and other medical services for the players and others in case of an emergency during the tournament. Already there is news of some players catching the virus,” the officer detailed his concerns. The officer added that Bengaluru police had refused to provide security for IPL in 2009 after the police department was stretched because of the Lok Sabha elections. At the same time, some officers within the department argued that the IPL is a good move since people would stay at home to watch the games, even after the lockdown is lifted. On April 27, taking exception to the Indian Premier League being conducted at a time when the country is facing its worst Covid tragedy, Congress MLC Prakash K Rathod has sought the cancellation of the cricket tournament. In an open letter, the MLC has asked the State government to urge the Board for Cricket Control in India (BCCI) and the Karnataka State Cricket Association (KSCA) to cancel the games, and convert the Chinnaswamy stadium, located in the heart of the city, into a Covid Care Centre. “It is surprising that KSCA has been adamant on hosting the IPL games in Bengaluru. Has KSCA forgotten that Bengaluru is number one in Covid cases in India? Can KSCA’s Chinnaswamy stadium not be converted into a huge Covid centre instead?” he asked. When contacted a senior official of the Karnataka State Cricket Association (KSCA) said that the tournament is being held with permissions from the required authorities. “The union home ministry has granted security clearance for the tournament and the state government after deliberations have agreed to provide security. There are strict safety protocols being followed and most importantly the matches are not open to crowds, this reduces the burden on security considerably,” the official said on the condition of anonymity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/stressed-b-luru-police-worried-about-additional-ipl-duties-101620070090943.html
04-05-2021||India||Bypoll results can help revive Cong before 2023 polls: Experts||Bengaluru The Congress won one of the two Assembly seats and made significant gains in the Belagavi Lok Sabha constituency in the recently concluded bypolls, results of which were announced on Sunday. Though numerically the Congress emerged victorious on only one of the three bypolls in the state, but political analysts said the results might revive the party’s chances in the state, which will go to assembly elections in 2023. DK Shivakumar, the Karnataka Congress president, said the results showed that people were showing their confidence in the party. With just two years to go for the assembly polls, the Congress has an opportunity to wrest power in the state by capitalising on the internal bickering within the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the growing voices against chief minister BS Yediyurappa, analysts said. “If they (Congress) make their candidates’ choice strategically and carefully, they can fight the BJP,” A Narayana, political analyst and faculty at the Azim Premji University in Bengaluru said. Congress’s Basanagouda Turvihal won the Maski assembly bypoll, defeating BJP’s Pratap Patil by a margin of 30,606 votes, while the other assembly bypoll saw BJP’s Sharanu Salagar beat the Congress candidate, Mala B Narayanrao by 20,629 votes. In Belagavi Lok Sabha bypoll, BJP’s Mangal Suresh Angadi defeated Congress’ Satish Jarkiholi by a narrow margin of 5,240 votes. On the latter’s candidature for the Lok Sabha bypoll, Nayarayan said Satish Jarkiholi was a strong local face with influence over the district. Analysts also pointed out that while Jarkiholi lost the Belagavi bypoll, but the margin was a positive sign for the Congress, which had lost the seat to late Union minister Suresh Angadi of the BJP in 2019 by a margin of nearly 4 lakh votes. Analysts said the Congress has gained in Karnataka by decentralising power, leaving more decision-making powers with local units than with the high command. However, this has led to the creation of local chieftains like Siddaramaiah, who refuses to cede control over the party affairs to Shivakumar, the Congress president in the state, analysts said. They pointed out that another factor that was working in Congress’ favour was the gradual dilution of former chief minister HD Kumaraswamy-led Janata Dal (Secular) or JD(S). “We have seen the gradual dilution of the JD(S). They are increasingly getting marginalised and searching for a political identity for themselves. That gives the Congress greater credibility in terms of revivalism in Karnataka politics,” Vinod MJ, a Bengaluru-based political analyst, said. Analysts also said that the Congress’ decision to put Siddaramaiah and Shivakumar at the helm of affairs gives it a good chance for a revival, if the two could manage to put their differences aside. Another positive for the Congress was its performance in the recent local urban body elections, where it managed to win six out of the 10 ULBs across several districts, including pockets of Shivamogga, the home district of chief minister Yediyurappa. The results came as an embarrassment to the ruling BJP, which is yet to put its house in order despite being in power for two years in the state. With allegations of mismanagement of the Covid-19 pandemic situation, lack of performance, cash-crunch, running a parallel administration through his second son (BY Vijayendra) and simmering dissent, Yediyurappa has spent most of his time in office dousing one crisis after another. While the BJP shrugged away any chance of Congress’ revival, analysts said the party would do that at its own risk. “This is a kind of revivalism that the BJP cannot ignore,” Vinod MJ added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bypoll-results-can-help-revive-cong-before-2023-polls-experts-101620070030952.html
04-05-2021||India||Govt orders green corridor for oxygen tankers||Bengaluru: The Karnataka government on Monday ordered to provide green corridors for oxygen tankers and to conduct daily audits of oxygen supply, which will be made public every day. This is among the several decisions taken by the government on Monday after 24 people died in a hospital in Chamarajangar district and two hospitals ran short of oxygen supply in Bengaluru. On Monday evening, chief minister BS Yediyurappa held a meeting with oxygen manufacturers and suppliers in the state. Apart from offering green corridors, which provide is a special route to the vehicle by manually operating traffic signal to avoid red lights, the government announced several other directions. As per communication from the Chief Minister’s office, during the meeting, Yediyurappa has asked the oxygen manufacturers to reduce the time taken to re-fill the oxygen tankers. Directions were given to toll gates to avoid unnecessary delay, convert nitrogen and argon tankers available for supplying oxygen, utilize the services of LPG tanker drivers in case of emergency. In another order on Monday, the government has asked all oxygen re-filling agencies in a particular district and Bengaluru to furnish their total and full accounts of oxygen, every day. The reporting should include the receipts of the day, supply and balance oxygen stock. “All the oxygen re-filling agencies of a district & BBMP shall every day give a detailed and accurate account of their supply (expenditure) of the Oxygen to the hospitals and other establishments to whom the oxygen is supplied by them and the quantity that is supplied. The said break-up shall match the daily total supply (expenditure),” read a government order dated May 3. The order further added that the details collected from suppliers will be made public by respective authorities. “The districts and the BBMP shall nominate one Camp Officer, not below the rank of Tehsildar, for each Re-Filler Station falling in their jurisdiction. who shall camp at his/her assigned Re-Filling Station and oversee and ensure that medical oxygen supplies to indenting hospitals are smooth,” the order added. At the same time, The Clinical Expert Committee of Karnataka chaired by the Vice-Chancellor, RGUHS has recommended guidelines for minimizing wastage and rational use of oxygen in health care facilities in the state. “The rate of the consumption of oxygen by the hospitals treating COVID-19 patients has revealed that there is indiscriminate and wasteful use of oxygen in many hospitals. Optimal use of oxygen needs to be ensured both for better healthcare of the patient as well as the curtailment of wastage of oxygen as it is a scarce resource,” read a government order. The guidelines contain details like how to adjust oxygen use to the lowest permissible level along with other advisories. “These guidelines also lay down the responsibility of health team regarding judicial use and the responsibility of the hospital administrators in monitoring and audit of oxygen use. As per the guidelines, each health care facility shall designate an Oxygen Monitoring Team for each shift. Each facility shall also form an Oxygen Audit Committee and submit a report on the use of oxygen pre and post-audit to the Expert Committees constituted by Order No. HFW 276 ACS 2020, dated 29.07.2020. Further, the Expert Committees shall review the action taken by the health care facilities in this regard,” read the government order.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-orders-green-corridor-for-oxygen-tankers-101620069970833.html
04-05-2021||India||Another letter accuses Param Bir Singh of extortion||A cricket bookie and two businessmen from the city have written to Director General of Police Sanjay Pandey alleging that former Mumbai police commissioner (CP) and present commandant general, Maharashtra home guards, Param Bir Singh ran a recovery and extortion racket in Thane while serving as CP Thane.The three complainants have also named a former encounter specialist and a serving police inspector of Thane police as part of Singh’s alleged activities. The three claimed that the rogue cops extorted crores of rupees from them.Police officers who asked not to be named said DGP Pandey has entrusted the complaints to the state Crime Investigation Department (CID). Singh did not respond to phone calls and messages seeking comment.Cricket bookie Sonu Jalan, businessman Ketan Tanna and Munir Ahmed Pathan met DGP Pandey last month and filed their complaints against Singh.According to their complaints, reviewed by HT, the three say that under the instructions of Singh, who served as Thane CP between 2015 and 18, a former encounter specialist and a serving police inspector from the anti-extortion cell, would call upon businessmen on the pretext of enquiry and extort money by threatening to implicate them in false cases. The complainants have claimed that under Singh’s leadership these police officers allegedly extorted from those who received calls from gangster Ravi Pujari .Jalan, who was arrested by the Thane police in 2018 in a Maharashtra Control of Organised Crimes Act (MCOCA) case, has stated that Singh with the help of these corrupt officers manipulated complaints with the intention of extortion from innocent persons.Singh is already facing an FIR registered by an Akola police inspector BR Ghadge alleging that he was implicated in some cases after refusing to follow Singh’s instructions aimed at benefiting the accused in a criminal case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/another-letter-accuses-param-bir-singh-of-extortion-101620069850709.html
04-05-2021||India||24 dead in Karnataka hospital, kin allege oxygen shortage||The BS Yediyurappa-led Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government in Karnataka came under heavy criticism on Monday after 24 Covid-19 infected persons died in the span of a day allegedly due to shortage of oxygen in Chamarajanagar district, about 175 km from Bengaluru.The state government has been accused of not preparing adequately to deal with the second wave of infections and has now swung into action to contain the damage to its image. “Three people died due to shortage of oxygen between 12 and 3 am (on Monday morning),” said K Sudhakar, state health, family welfare and medical education minister. He did not specify how the others died.He added that there were 123 Covid patients in the district hospital, of which 14 were on ventilators, 36 on non invasive ventilation, 58 on Hyperbaric oxygen and 29 breathing with the help of oxygen cylinders.The government has sought a report on the incident within three days. “Strict action will be taken at the earliest...,” Yediyurappa said in a post on Twitter.Relatives and others were seen crying and cursing the government outside the hospital in Chamarajanagar, levelling allegations of dereliction of duty and that there were not enough doctors to tend to the critically ill. Several of them also alleged that the district was facing oxygen shortage.The incident has sparked off a blame game between the district administrations of Mysuru and Chamrajanagar, two neighbouring districts over delays in supply of oxygen. A section of the Chamarajanagar administration is alleging that Mysuru DC Rohini Sindhuri delayed the dispatch of oxygen as she retained most of it for use in her own district, which is one of the worst Covid-19 hit regions outside Bengaluru. Sindhuri could not be reached for comment.“Died or Killed? My heartfelt condolences to their families. How much more suffering before the ‘system’ wakes up?” Rahul Gandhi of the Congress posted on Twitter.The district in-charge minister of Chamrajanagar, Suresh Kumar, hinted that there was a shortage of oxygen in the district and that requests were made to fulfil them. ST Somashekar, the district in-charge minister of Mysuru said that the oxygen, which comes from Ballari was dispatched to Chamarajnagar on time.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/24-dead-in-k-taka-hospital-kin-allege-oxygen-shortage-101620069790783.html
04-05-2021||India||Scramble across states: SOS for oxygen rings out||New Delhi: Several state governments continued to send emergency messages to the Union government for medical oxygen as hospitals across states -- from Ranchi in Jharkhand to Alwar in Rajasthan to Rohtak in Haryana to Meerut in Uttar Pradesh -- reported shortages that were putting critical Covid-19 patients at risk, state and district officials said.The Union health ministry has increased allocation of several states in the past one week since the oxygen demand has spiked due to a rise in infections and hospitalisations, but some states said the enhanced supply was also not enough. They also reported the shortage of tankers and cylinders to store and transport the medical essential.In Meerut, Uttar Pradesh, angry family members of some patients went on rampage, damaging furniture and health monitors in Nutema hospital on Sunday after five Covid-infected patients died allegedly due to low oxygen pressure. “We have formed a committee to investigate the matter and action would be initiated on the findings of the committee,” said district magistrate K Balaji, adding that the administration was providing oxygen cylinders to hospitals.Dr Manisha Tyagi, secretary of the Meerut unit of the Indian Medical Association (IMA), said this was the third hospital in the past one week where family members got agitated after patients were denied admission due to heavy load in hospital, or death of patients due to alleged lack of oxygen. Last Friday, in Agra, family member of patients beat up hospital staff after oxygen supply got disrupted. Oxygen supply shortages were also reported from several other UP districts, such as Noida, Lucknow, Bareilly, Agra and Varanasi, officials said.In Haryana, there were reports of oxygen shortage from some hospitals in Gurugram, Rohtak, and Karna, but the districts did not officially report any shortage. The state quota for Haryana has been increased from 162 million tonnes (MT) per day to 257 MT, but the state government is demanding 300 MT every day. Chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar, however, said all districts were being provided oxygen as per their requirement. According to locals, patients in Rohtak were struggling to find oxygen and ICU beds at the Postgraduate Institute of Medical Sciences (PGIMS), and in private hospitals in Jhajjar, Sonepat, Hisar , Rewari, and other parts of the state. Neeraj Kumar, a resident of Kathura village in Sonepat, said he tried for three days to get an oxygen-supported bed for his father, a retired army personnel. “Despite all efforts, we did not get a bed in Rohtak, Jhajjar, and Sonepat. Finally, my father’s friends helped in getting a bed at army hospital, Ambala, where he is undergoing treatment,” he said. A functionary at PGIMS, who asked not to be named, said all the oxygen and ICU beds were occupied and were unable to admit new patients. In Bihar, the state government on Monday approved the Oxygen Production Policy 2021, which provides for financial assistance to establish oxygen manufacturing units as several hospitals reported shortage of the crucial gas. Bihar has been allotted 194 MT of medical oxygen every day, which was increased to 214 MT on May 2. Out of this, 34 MT is to be created from the Air Separation Units (ASU) in the state, and the rest from industrial units in neighbouring Jharkhand and West Bengal.At least seven district in Jharkhand informed the state government about an oxygen shortage. In Ranchi, some private hospitals stopped taking patients, according to district officials, and oxygen was also in short supply in Jamshedpur, where several hospitals stopped taking in new patients despite having vacant Covid beds.In Rajasthan, among the hospitals that reported shortage of oxygen were Sania hospital, the biggest private medical facility in Alwar. On Monday, the hospital put up a notice asking patients or their families to arrange for oxygen on their own since they did not receive their allocated supply. Behror resident Ved Prakash Gupta, whose brother Hitesh Gupta is admitted to the hospital, said the administration told them that there was no medical oxygen left, and they should take patients to other hospitals. Sania Hospital’s CEO, Dr. Tayyab Khan, said the hospital received 10 oxygen cylinders from the district administration on Monday, as against requirement of 150 every day. Behror MLA, Sanjay Sharma of the BJP, said they were trying to get oxygen for the hospital. Officials in Madhya Pradesh said the state requires about 700 MT oxygen but was getting about 564 MT. As a result, they added, they were unable to increase the number of oxygen beds in high Covid-influx cities such as Bhopal, Gwalior, Indore, Ujjain and Jabalpur. State health commissioner Akash Tripathi asked private hospitals to do a daily audit of oxygen consumption and inform the district administration about the shortage of oxygen at least six hours in advance so that necessary arrangements could be made. There were also reports of no or low oxygen from hospitals in Punjab, Jammu & Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand. Punjab chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh on Monday said more oxygen tankers would be available to the state by Tuesday to handle transporting of oxygen supplies from other states. Punjab has a 195 MT allocation from various plants in other states, but actual supply over the past seven days has been around 110-120 MT, which has also been erratic, the CM said during Covid review meeting.J&K LG Manoj Sinha on Sunday directed officials to do an oxygen audit in every hospital of the UT. The Himachal Pradesh government, meanwhile, has ordered installation plants in main hospitals of the state even though the state has been getting 62 MT of oxygen as against the demand of 22 MT, said HP health secretary Amitabh Awasthi, adding state was facing shortage of cylinders. Uttarakhand health secretary Amit Negi said six oxygen plants were operating in the state, and nine more will be set up soon.“7,200 mt was our last month production. We ramped up 25%_ upti 9,000MT. But demand is more, allocationis more than that. Demand is more than capacity. We meet it by dipping into our stocks. Cant ramp up too much more than that. Small plants in hospitals dont really help that much. A third option was to rationalise use of oxygen. We are having non stop meetings on allocation and will probably manage to take from stocks in our plants in eastern India. Earlier, Air liquide was giving 315 mt from its stocks. But with depleting stocks, can give 280mt tonnes only now. So 35 MT of supply has got depleted again and will impact some allocation’’ said a member of the empowered group.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/scramble-across-states-sos-for-oxygen-rings-out-101620069070635.html
04-05-2021||India||‘Logistics, not deficit’: What govt told courts on O2 crisis||Does India have enough oxygen? Does Delhi? Plaintive cries from hospital administrators and individuals, as well as reports of deaths of critically ill patients on account of lack of oxygen (most recently in Chamrajnagar, Karnataka) suggest the answer to the questions is “No”. Yet, the Union government has consistently maintained before constitutional courts that the country and Delhi both have enough oxygen and there is no deficit at all.There are three aspects to the question, though: production and stock; demand and supply; and logistics. HT tries to look at each on the basis of information from the Centre’s affidavits before the Supreme Court and the Delhi high court in public interest litigations .First , production and stock.The production capacity for liquid oxygen was 8,788 MT per day, the Centre said on April 28.In addition, as on that day, there was 19,871 metric ton (MT) of liquid medical oxygen available. That excluded the liquid oxygen with steel plants (major producers of the chemical), a further 16,000 MT of liquid oxygen as on 21 April . And finally, there is another 2850 MT of liquid oxygen with manufacturers not attached to the steel plants, taking the gross quantity of liquid oxygen available to in excess of 38,000 MT.Second, demand and supply.According to the Centre, from April 29, the projected demand for all states was 8707 MT per day. On April 28, while the production capacity was 8,788 MT per day, 7,479 MT of oxygen was supplied to various states. This is a contentious point, though. The Delhi government has insisted that it does not get as much oxygen as it needs. Delhi’s own estimate is that it needs 700 MT a day. The Centre’s allocation to it is 490 MT a day (increased to 700 MT a day from Tuesday, according to a Supreme Court order on Sunday). But the Delhi government has said it receives lesser oxygen -- it received 409 MT on Thursday, 312 MT on Friday, 454 MT on Saturday, and 448 MT on Sunday. Delhi also claimed last week in the high court that while other states were getting almost as much as they asked for, or even more in some cases, Delhi was the only one to get much lesser.That explains the cries for help, but there’s the third aspect as well.LogisticsThe major suppliers for both industrial and medical oxygen are steel plants in the public and private sectors, besides private entities. However, there are only a few states that are oxygen producing, such as Maharashtra, Rajasthan and Jharkhand; others need to ship their oxygen in.The Union government’s position before the courts is that its role was limited to procurement and allocation of medical oxygen to each state but that it is the state governments’ absolute responsibility to arrange transportation to pick up their allotted quantity from the supply point using cryogenic tankers.The ministry of home affairs constituted an Empowered Group-II (EG-II) as an inter-ministerial body to ensure availability of essential medical equipment and oxygen management, which has carried out a mapping exercise to connect sources of supplies with the demand of medical oxygen to the critically affected states.The requirement of oxygen for each state is ascertained on the basis of the doubling rate of active cases, which refers to the number of days in which Covid cases are likely to double.These projections change on a daily basis, explained the Centre through its affidavits. It added that a virtual central control room has also been created to monitor demand and supply of oxygen on a real time basis.According to the Centre, Delhi, Rajasthan, Punjab, Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand and Madhya Pradesh, faced challenges despite this allocation owing to logistical bottlenecks and incidents of local authorities disrupting supplies (or oxygen producing states not allowing supplies). But the biggest impediment, as per the Centre, remains the geographical location of the supply points. The high concentration of oxygen is in steel plants located on the eastern side of the country (Odisha, West Bengal) whereas the demand is mostly from the West (Maharashtra, Gujarat, Rajasthan), North (UP, Delhi, Haryana, Punjab) and central part of India (MP, Chhatisgarh). This has resulted in heavy pressure on the handful facilities in the North such as those in Panipat, Modinagar and Bhiwadi.Following the mapping exercise, the Centre said, a judicious mix of road, rail and air routes have been arranged. A supply point in Jharkhand’s Jamshedpur has been mapped to Delhi, UP, Haryana and Bihar while Bhilai in Chhatisgarh has been mapped to MP.Trains (Oxygen Express) are also being used to carry oxygen. Air routes are being used to carry empty containers to the supply points, as per the government’s affidavits. Liquid oxygen containers cannot be transported by air. However, in order to carry oxygen, the states must have the tankers of their own and only industrialised states such as Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat, Haryana, Jharkhand and West Bengal have them in sufficient quantity. Delhi has only 19 oxygen tankers, leading to a crisis as regards carrying the oxygen from the points of procurement.On April 30, the Central government submitted in the Supreme Court that the chief reason for shortage of oxygen in the capital was the inability of the Delhi government to lift the allocated quantity of oxygen from the supply point for want of enough tankers.But the top court did not find favour with this contention and told the Centre that lives of citizens cannot be put in jeopardy in the battle of shifting responsibility of supplying or off-taking of oxygen.The Centre has to submit its compliance by May 10 when the Supreme Court will hear the suo motu (on its own motion) case again.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/logistics-not-deficit-what-govt-told-courts-on-o2-crisis-101620068716286.html
04-05-2021||India||‘HCs must have freedom, can’t restrain media’, Supreme Court says to EC||The Supreme Court on Monday said it was not in favour of putting fetters on judges’ remarks or their reportage by the media, saying that high courts must get “complete freedom” to decide issues before them, and that the “media is a very important and powerful watchdog of the judicial processes”.A bench of justices Dhananjaya Y Chandrachud and MR Shah termed as “far-fetched” a plea by the Election Commission of India (ECI) before the Madras high court to restrain media from reporting oral observations of the judges that the poll body was singularly responsible for a second wave in the country and that its officials should probably be tried on murder charges for allowing political parties to hold massive rallies without following Covid-19 norms.“In today’s time, we cannot say that media won’t report contents of discussion in a court and only orders. Since the discussion is of equal public importance, we will put it on the same pedestal like our orders. There is a dialogue between the court and the lawyers and when they are reported, people get to know about the judicial process. The unfolding of the debate in the court of law is equally important and media has a duty to report. It is not only our judgements that are significant but the dialogue also is,” justice Chandrachud told senior advocate Rakesh Dwivedi, who appeared for the ECI.On April 26, the high court made the scathing remarks against ECI during a hearing a writ petition filed by Tamil Nadu transport minister MR Vijayabhaskar seeking a direction for safety measures and fairness during counting in Karur constituency from where he is contesting. “You are the only institution that is singularly responsible for the situation today...No action against political parties taking rallies despite court orders. Your election commission officials should be put up on murder charges probably,” the high court had observed.Asking for a gag on the media was not part of EC’s prayer before the Supreme Court. In the appeal before the top court, Dwivedi rued that the high court judges should use “temperate language” and not blame the ECI for something which was not within their domain.“We do not take over the governance during the election. We issue directions and guidelines that the states are bound to follow. But if those responsible for adhering to the Covid guidelines are the ones to breach it, we cannot be held responsible. Now there is a non-stop coverage of how EC officials should be charged of murder. We are not seeking any order against media but we want the judges to exercise restraint,” said the counsel.The bench responded that the EC’s concerns regarding the observations were taken into account and that a balance had to be struck. The bench said that it may not have used the words used by the Madras high court. It, however, pointed put that the plea before the high court to restrain the media was problematic.“What is happening in the court is also of concerns to the citizens. What is happening; whether there is an application of mind; the dialogue between the bar and the bench; how it fosters justice; these are all of concern for the citizens. Their reportage instills a sense of confidence among the public about what has transpired in the court and how the decision was made. It was too far-fetched on your part to ask a constitutional court to restrain media,” remarked the bench.Asking ECI to take the observations by the high court in the right spirit, justice Shah told Dwivedi: “Judges use harsh words sometime because of anguish; sometime out of frustration and sometime because of anger after seeing what has been happening around them. They are also human beings. It is also in the larger public interest what they said. And you can see the result. Your subsequent decisions improved the situation. You restricted election rally with more than 500 persons that you had not done earlier. Victory processions were prohibited too.”Dwivedi, however, maintained that it was not appropriate for the high court judges to say that a high constitutional body like the ECI should be charged with murder and that they had serious objections to it.The bench told ECI that the high courts were also a constitutional body and that the Supreme Court will not demoralise the high court judges by issuing any kind of restraint on their process of judicial determination.“We don’t want to demoralise the high courts. They are vital part of this institutions. They are the ultimate protector of fundamental rights because of their access to public. We have to protect the sanctity of high courts. Our chief justices and judges should feel free to have to a dialogue. We cannot restrain them. We also wish that media should report fully what is happening in a court. It brings a sense of accountability. Media reporting would also show that we are dispensing our duties fully,” said the bench.The court also took a grim view of the ECI’s petition before it against the high court’s observations, for it premised on the fact that the high court overlooked the constitutional stature of the poll body.“You say in your petition that you are a constitutional body and so, a court should not have said something. Parliament is a sovereign authority. But don’t we deal with the laws passed by them? By exercising our power to examine validity of a law, we don’t take upon the powers of the parliament. It won’t be a correct reading of the Constitution to say that because EC is a constitutional body, its power should not be questioned. You have taken an extreme position in saying that,” said justice Chandrachud.“Speaking for myself, I would not have used these words in the course of a discussion. But the issues raised in your special leave petition is much wider. We will have to pass a detailed order on the issues raised by you regarding your constitutional status. We will bring about a sense of balance in our order. You also tell your election commissioners that the intention of the high court was not to run anybody down. It was not to tarnish anybody’s image but to find out a way so that they can help public.

On May 1 roughly about 400,000 new Covid-19 cases were reported from across the country, on May 2 it came down to 392,000 cases, and in past 24 hours (Sunday), we find 367,000 cases that shows there’s reduction in daily new cases to some extent cases,” said Lav Agarwal, joint secretary, Union health ministry, in the regular media briefing on Covid-19.To be sure, these numbers hide a significant dip in the number of tests conducted across the three days (around 400,000), and a corresponding increase in the positivity rate, suggesting there will likely be no let up in daily cases, at least not immediately.“We have found early signs of plateauing upon analyzing the Covid-19 data; in a state or two we can also say we have seen decrease in daily new cases. Among those states you find in Chhattisgarh that used to report 15,500 daily new cases, is now reporting around 14,900... Delhi, which used to get about 25,200 cases, now is getting 24,000 cases, hinting at early plateauing signs,” added Agarwal.He said this is also becoming evident in numbers from Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Jharkhand, Punjab, Telangana, Uttar Pradesh, and Uttarakhand.“But these are very early signals. There is a need for further analysis ; and related efforts to monitor it on a continued basis. Similarly, if we look at reported deaths 48 hours ago then we find 3,689 deaths, and in the past 24 hours, data shows 3,417 deaths have been reported.Experts say it is too early to even think of this as a trend.“You cannot establish a trend by looking at 48-72 hours data. This could be an aberration, and needs to sustain for a few weeks before something can be declared concretely,” said a senior public health expert, requesting anonymity.However, there also are states that are showing an upward trajectory of cases, according to Agarwal — Andhra Pradesh, Assam, Bihar, Chandigarh, Haryana, Karnataka, Kerala, and Himachal Pradesh etc.India’s active case load has also gone up, and is currently around 3.4 million, with 12 states reporting at least 100,000 active cases. Seven states have active cases between 50,000 and 100,000, and 17 have less than 50,000 active cases.A high positivity rate is a concern in many states, Agarwal said, with 22 states showing a positivity rate in excess of 15% . In nine states, the positivity rate is between 5% and 15%, and only five states currently report a positivity rate of 5% or lower. These numbers also clearly indicate that cases in the country will continue to rise for some time.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-says-covid-cases-plateauing-in-some-states-experts-disagree-101620066910097.html
04-05-2021||India||Reports claiming fresh vaccine orders not placed are incorrect, says Centre||The Centre on Monday denied allegations that the government has not placed any fresh orders for the Covid-19 vaccines for its nationwide immunisation programme, and pointed out that the suppliers credit extended to both the Serum Institute of India (SII) and Bharat Biotech in late April was against future supplies.“There have been some media reports alleging that the Centre has not placed any fresh order for Covid-19 vaccines. The news reports suggest that the last order placed with the two vaccine makers (100 million doses with SII and 20 million doses with Bharat Biotech) was in March 2021. These media reports are completely incorrect, and are not based on facts,” the Union health ministry said in a statement.It clarified that 100% advance of Rs.1,732.50 crore (after TDS Rs.1,699.50 crore) was released to Serum Institute of India (SII) on April 28, for 110 million doses of Covishield vaccine to be delivered in May, June and July. In addition, as on date, against the last (March) order of 100 million doses for supplies of Covishield, 87.5 million doses have been delivered till May 3, 2021.The ministry also said that 100% advance of Rs.787.50 crore (after TDS ₹772.50 crore) was released on April 28, to Bharat Biotech India Ltd (BBIL) for 50 million Covaxin doses to be delivered in May, June and July. As on date, against the last (March) order of 20 million doses for supplies of Covaxin vaccine, 8.8 million doses have been delivered till May 3, 2021.SII put out a tweet endorsing the health ministry’s statement. “...We have been working closely with the Government of India for the past year & thank it for its support. We remain committed to ramping up our vaccine production to save every life we can,” it read.“Vaccine manufacturing is a specialized process, it is therefore not possible to ramp up production overnight, SII CEO Adar Poonawalla said in a statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/reports-claiming-fresh-vaccine-orders-not-placed-are-incorrect-says-centre-101620040145582.html

This effort, in combination with Pfizer foundation funding that supports humanitarian organisations providing essential and life-saving equipment to India, such as ventilators, oxygen concentrators, and consumables, is our most comprehensive humanitarian relief response ever,” said Albert Bourla chairman and chief executive officer, Pfizer, in a statement.“Pfizer is aware that access to vaccines is critical to ending this pandemic. Unfortunately, our vaccine is not registered in India although our application was submitted months ago. We are currently discussing with the Indian government an expedited approval pathway to make our Pfizer-BioNTECH vaccine available for use in the country,” Bourla added.He said the effort -- he called it at attempt to mobilise the largest humanitarian relief effort in Pfizer’s history -- was being made because they were deeply concerned by the critical Covid situation in India. “…Pfizer colleagues at distribution centres in the US, Europe, and Asia are hard at work rushing shipments of Pfizer medicines that the government of India has identified as part of its Covid treatment protocol. We are donating these medicines to help make sure that every Covid patient in every public hospital... can have access to the Pfizer medicines they need free of charge...”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pfizer-donates-70-mn-medical-supplies-to-india-seeks-expedited-vaccine-approval-101620037681235.html
