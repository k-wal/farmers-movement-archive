Maharashtra and Gujarat, next in the storm’s path, also stepped up efforts to prepare for possible impact.“Tauktae will intensify further while on its track and cross the Gujarat coast with a speed of 155 to 165kmph gusting to 185kmph. We are not expecting it to become a super cyclone but it is a big and intense system,” said Sunitha Devi, incharge of cyclones at the India Meteorological Department (IMD).Hundreds of people were evacuated from coastal regions across the states, which are also burdened by the Covid-19 pandemic.Around a hundred teams of the National Disaster Rescue Force (NDRF), teams of the Indian Army, Navy and Coast Guard along with ships and aircraft have been deployed for rescue and relief operations.Weather scientists on Sunday warned that Cyclone Tauktae – which has been categorised as a “very severe” cyclonic storm – is gaining intensity and is likely to make landfall on Gujarat’s coast with wind speeds up to 155-185kmph by Tuesday afternoon.According to IMD, large-scale destruction is expected over Porbandar, Amreli, Junagarh, Gir, Somnath, Botad, Bhavnagar and coastal areas of Ahmedabad in Gujarat.The cyclone, which began as a low pressure area over Lakshadweep and southeast Arabian sea earlier, turned into a depression and evolved into a cyclone moving towards the north on Saturday. “Tauktae intensified by 65kmph in the last 24 hours, fuelled by heat and energy from the ocean,” Roxy Mathew Koll, a climate scientist at the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology, said on Sunday.Union home minister Amit Shah on Sunday held a meeting with chief ministers of Gujarat, Maharashtra and the administrator of Daman and Diu, and Dadra Nagar Haveli to review preparedness before the cyclone makes its presence felt higher up along the western coast.At the meeting, Shah directed the state governments to ensure there is adequate power back-up in all facilities that are dealing with Covid-19 patients. The minister also asked the Maharashtra and Gujarat governments to keep a plan ready for buffer stock of medical-grade oxygen for at least two days in case of any disruption in supply.“A 24x7 control room is functioning in MHA, which can be contacted at any time for any assistance by the States. Indian Coast Guard, the Navy, Army and Air Force units have also been put on standby and surveillance aircraft and helicopters are carrying out aerial sorties,” Shah said, according to a statement.Four deaths were reported from Karnataka’s Uttara Kannada, Udupi, Chikkamagaluru and Shivamogga districts in cyclone-related incidents on Saturday.In Kerala, where thunderstorms began on Friday night, there was widespread water-logging and the state government sounded an alert after water levels rose in several dams across the state.Strong winds and heavy rain lashed parts of Goa on Sunday morning, killing two people in related accidents along with snapping electricity supply and uprooting trees.“Two people lost their lives – a woman, in her 30s, died after a coconut tree fell on her in north Goa’s Mapusa and a scooter passenger in Marcel (also in north Goa) succumbed to injuries after being hit by an electric pole,” chief minister Pramod Sawant said at a press briefing in Panaji on Sunday.Power supply in a majority of areas in Goa was disrupted as hundreds of electric poles were uprooted due to the high-speed winds, state power minister Nilesh Cabral told PTI.“Many high tension 33 KV feeders are down due to the falling of trees. Even the 220 KV lines bringing power to Goa from neighbouring Maharashtra have been damaged,” he said.“Our force has been working since last night to clear the roads and remove trees which have fallen on the power lines,” said Ashok Menon, director of the fire and emergency services in the state.In Karnataka, more than 98 villages in seven districts -- including Uttara Kannada, Dakshina Kannada, Kodagu and Hassan – reported widespread damage after heavy rains, State Disaster Management Authority officials said.Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray on Saturday sounded an alert for Mumbai and the four coastal districts of Palghar, Raigad, Ratnagiri and Sindhudurg. The authorities also said that the people living near the coast were shifted to temporary relief shelters.In Gujarat, where the cyclone is now heading, the government mobilised the authorities on Sunday to shift around 150,000 people out of low-lying areas and deployed over 50 NDRF and SDRF teams. “With the cyclone likely to affect power supply, hospitals treating Covid-19 patients have been asked to ensure power back-up. Arrangements have also been made to ensure uninterrupted generation of medical oxygen in the eight manufacturing units and buffer stock is also created,” chief minister Vijay Rupani told reporters in Gandhinagar.Maharashtra CM Thackeray assured the Union home minister at the meeting on Sunday that measures to ensure Covid-19 patients are not affected by the cyclone had been put in place.However, the cyclone appears to have hit the vaccination drive across the affected states. Officials in Karnataka, Gujarat and Goa said vaccinations against Covid-19 were suspended in multiple areas on Sunday.Experts have warned that natural disasters the world over are becoming more frequent and deadlier as a by-product of global warming.“With cyclone Tauktae, this will be the fourth consecutive year of pre-monsoon cyclone over the Arabian Sea. This is also the third consecutive year when a cyclone has come very close to the west coast of India. Sea Surface Temperatures in Arabian sea have increased rapidly during the past century and this has led to an increase in the frequency and intensity of cyclones in the Arabian Sea…global warming has presented us with new challenges such as rapid intensification of cyclones, which need to be closely monitored at higher resolution and accuracy using on-site platforms such as buoys and moorings. Improving the Indian Ocean Observing System (IndOOS) and incorporating the global warming signals in the weather models can help us tackle the challenges of intense cyclones in the future,” Koll said on Sunday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/western-coast-on-edge-as-cyclone-intensifies-101621187930875.html

16-05-2021||India||2 more black fungus cases detected, Covid-19 cases dip in Bihar||Two new cases of mucormycosis or black fungus were detected at the Indira Gandhi Institute of Medical Sciences (IGIMS) while three others were suspected to be infected with the fungus, taking their total number to 24 on Sunday, when 6,894 new infections of coronavirus — the lowest in a day this month — and 89 deaths were reported in Bihar. “We got two new confirmed cases of black fungus, taking its total cases at our institute to six,” said Dr Manish Mandal, medical superintendent, IGIMS. Details of the patients were awaited, he added. Of the new Covid-19 infections reported on Saturday, Patna topped with 1,103 cases, followed by Gaya 381, Samastipur 331, East Champaran 297, Begusarai 270, Madhubani 267, Supaul 240, and Araria 236, among other districts. Bihar’s test positivity ratio (TPR), which is the people testing positive for the virus out of the total tested, had declined to 6.7% on May 15, the lowest this month. Bihar’s TPR was 15.6% when it went in for a 10-day lockdown on May 5. The state’s lockdown has since been extended to May 25. The average growth rate of Covid-19 infection between May 8 and 15 also slid to 1.5%. Bihar inoculated 1,09,706 people against Covid-19 on Sunday as against 1,24,104 people on Saturday and 1,16,441 on Friday because of closure of many vaccination session sites. Bihar health minister Mangal Pandey said 14,000 vials of Liposomal Amphotericin-B injection, a specific drug for treatment of cases of mucormycosis, were made available to the health department through the World Health Organisation. Some hospitals had earlier claimed that the injection was not available in the state and they had written to the state drug controller about it. Around 6,000 vials of injection from this stock were made available to different hospitals in the state. These include AIIMS-Patna (2000 vials), IGIMS, Patna Medical College Hospital, Nalanda Medical College Hospital, Jawaharlal Nehru Medical College Hospital, Bhagalpur (300 vials each), Darbhanga Medical College Hospital, Government Medical College Hospital, Bettiah,, Anugrah Narayan Magadh Medical College Hospital, Gaya, Vardhaman Institute of Medical Sciences, Pawapuri (200 each) and 1,600 vials to the Rajendra Memorial Research Institute of Medical Sciences (RMRIMS), Patna. Pandey said that injections for patients admitted at private facilities would be stored at the RMRIMS. Around 24 cases of black fungus, associated with Covid-19, have so far been reported in the state. He also said that 37,430 doses of Remdesivir, for treatment of coronavirus patients, had been made available to various district hospitals while 50,321 doses were available in Patna.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/2-more-black-fungus-cases-detected-covid-19-cases-dip-in-bihar-101621187228046.html

16-05-2021||India||500 Kerala nurses stranded in UAE after agents lure them with jobs||Nearly 500 nurses from Kerala who were promised high salaries and other perks were reportedly stranded in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) after recruiting agents allegedly cheated them. Some of them have returned but others are still stranded and they said they were forced to work as home nurses and masseurs in parlours. One of them, Reen Rajan (30) said she applied for the job after she came across an advertisement in leading newspapers that UAE was recruiting nurses on urgent basis in view of the pandemic situation and Keralites would be given preference. She said she had to cough up ₹2.30 lakh to the agent and later she was granted a visit visa. When asked about this, she said, the agent had told her that a work visa would be granted once they reach the UAE. “We were kept in dingy rooms for about a month. Some of them have returned after they got to know they were cheated. We had been recruited by a Kochi-based agency ‘Take Off” two months back. Now these agents are saying we can work in care homes and massage parlours,” said Reena Rajan, who quit her job with a private hospital in Kollam to take up the new assignment. She said she had sent a letter to chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan narrating her plight and had also taken up the issue with her legislator K B Ganesh Kumar. Her brother Rijo Rajan, who works in Kollam said, after he came to know about his sister’s plight he made inquiries about the agency and found that its proprietor Firoze Khan was allegedly involved in another case of cheating and was in jail for some time. He said after his release he closed his agency “Keydot” and started a fresh one “Take Off” to cheat gullible aspirants. Most of the stranded nurses said they paid between ₹2-4 lakh to get the visa. “Some of us have taken a loan to pay up. They know our precarious financial situation and so they are forcing us to do odd jobs. We were promised a pay packet of ₹one lakh and accommodation and they showed us some videos of nurses recruited by them. We were asked not to disclose it to anyone as recruitment of nurses was only permitted through government-approved agencies in the state,” another nurse Susan Saji said. Some of them said they had applied after they were told that there were enough vacancies and many hospitals needed nurses urgently due to the pandemic situation. To contain the exploitation of such job aspirants, earlier both the Union and state governments had constituted special agencies for their recruitment--- in Kerala nurses are recruited through the Overseas Development and Employment Promotion Consultants Ltd and Non-Residents Keralites Affairs. When contacted the CM’s office said it is yet to know about their complaint. Despite such approved agencies, many aspirants approach such dubious agents and get cheated. Last year, the Kerala police had busted a gang that recruited models to the middle-east countries and later force to become escorts and gold carriers. Once land up in foreign countries, these gang members seize passport and other documents and helpless will be forced to toe their diktats.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/500-kerala-nurses-stranded-in-uae-after-agents-lure-them-with-jobs-101621185008002.html

There has been a rise in such misinformation in the state of Haryana."The letter stated that there have been incidences in Haryana wherein the farmer groups are also getting agitated over the myth of linking the Covid-19 pandemic with 5G services.Several farmers from Punjab, Haryana and western Uttar Pradesh have been sitting on three borders near Delhi for about six months demanding repeal of the new three farm laws.The Association said, "We would like to state that such misinformation or rumors being spread are baseless, and there is no evidence or fact to suggest that there is any harmful effect of the 5G services with relation to Covid-19."The letter has also quoted the World Health Organization's (WHO) statement saying that "viruses cannot travel on radio waves or mobile networks. Covid-19 is spreading in various countries which do not have 5G networks."COAI has also requested the chief secretary to instruct the district authorities to safeguard telecom infrastructure and related assets and take tough action against miscreants spreading such misinformation.In Uttar Pradesh also, such rumours were being spread, following which the UP Police headquarters wrote a letter to all the commissioners of the state, issuing instructions to them to take strict action against those spreading rumours. After this, such rumours in UP have decreased, the COAI said.Recently, following such rumours, the Department of Telecommunications (DoT) in its statement said these messages are false.It stated that the public is informed that there is no connection between 5G technology and the outbreak of Covid-19. And, public is urged not to be misguided by the false information and rumours being spread in this matter, the statement added.The DoT also clarified that testing of the 5G network has not even started anywhere in India.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/telecom-operators-urge-haryana-govt-to-curb-rumours-linking-covid-spread-to-5g-101621183169355.html

16-05-2021||India||Cyclone Tauktae intensifies; 6 dead; Gujarat braces for impact||Gale-force winds, heavy rainfall and high tidal waves swept the coastal belt of Kerala, Karnataka and Goa as Cyclone Tauktae hurtled northwards towards Gujarat on Sunday, leaving six people dead, damaging hundreds of houses, uprooting electricity poles and trees and forcing evacuation in low-lying areas.According to the India Meteorological Department (IMD), Tauktae which has taken the form of a "very severe cyclonic storm" is likely to intensify further during the next 24 hours and reach the Gujarat coast on Monday evening.Strong winds with speed reaching up to 90 km/per were lashing the western coastal region. According to the Cyclone Warning Division of the IMD, by May 18 the wind speed is expected to increase to 150-160 km per hour, gusting up to 175 km per hour.An estimated 1.5 lakh people are being shifted from low-lying coastal areas in Gujarat while 54 teams of the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) and State Disaster Response Force (SDRF) have been deployed in the state.Maharashtra too was bracing for the storm as the Met department predicted heavy to very heavy rains at isolated places in north Konkan, Mumbai, Thane and Palghar and extremely heavy rainfall in Raigad on Monday.The water level in many dams across Kerala showed a rising trend after heavy rains in the catchment areas, prompting authorities to sound an alert.Four deaths were reported from Karnataka’s Uttara Kannada, Udupi, Chikkamagaluru and Shivamogga districts and two in Goa in cyclone-related incidents.Gusty winds and heavy rains started lashing several parts of Goa since Saturday night disrupting power supply in a large part of the state.Chief Minister Pramod Sawant said the major impact of the cyclonic winds was felt in Bardez taluka in North Goa district and Mormugao in South Goa.He said there was power disruption for some time at the Goa Medical College and Hospital (GMCH), where Covid-19 patients are undergoing treatment, but it did not affect the functioning."Hundreds of houses suffered major damage due to the cyclonic winds. Some highways were blocked at several points after trees got uprooted. However, the roads were cleared by the disaster management teams," Sawant said.The power supply was disrupted as electric poles were uprooted due to the high-speed winds, state Power Minister Nilesh Cabral told PTI."Many high tension 33 KV feeders are down due to the falling of trees. Even the 220 KV lines bringing power to Goa from neighbouring Maharashtra have been damaged," he said.The electricity department deployed its full force for the restoration work, but it was getting hampered due to the strong winds, he said.In Karnataka, over 70 villages in seven districts including Dakshina Kannada, Kodagu and Hassan have been affected by the cyclone, the Karnataka State Disaster Management Authority officials said.The highest rainfall of 385 mm was recorded at Nada Station in Kundapura taluk of Udupi district, which was the worst affected, and 15 stations recorded more than 200 mm of rainfall in the district.Officials said nearly a dozen relief camps are functioning in the state. There has been damage to 112 houses, 139 electricity poles and other infrastructure in coastal areas.Chief Minister B S Yediyurappa has asked in-charge Ministers of coastal districts and Deputy Commissioners there to visit the affected areas and carry out rescue and relief works.The IMD has issued orange alerts --a warning indicating heavy to very heavy rain-- on Sunday in three Kerala districts-Ernakulam, Idukki and Malappuram.Many houses were damaged in coastal areas across the state as seawater seeped in following high waves. According to the state government, at least nine districts have been severely affected by sea incursion.The Thrissur district administration said spillway shutters of the Peringalkuthu dam will be opened if the water level crosses the permitted limit of 419.41 metres. In a statement, the administration has urged the people living on the banks of Chalakudy river to be cautious.Shutters of Malankara dam in Idukki district will be opened on Sunday, as the water level has increased, the district authorities said.Families living in coastal areas and low-lying areas of the state have been shifted to relief camps.Indian Navy deployed its diving and quick reaction teams in the coastal village of Chellanam in Ernakulam district, which was heavily hit by tidal waves. The teams, braving harsh weather conditions, undertook rescue and rehabilitation of people who were trapped in houses.High tidal waves have also lashed Kaipamangalam, Chavakkad and Kodungallur in Thrissur, Pallithura in Thiruvananthapuram, Thrikkannapuzha in Alappuzha and Beypore and Koyilandy in Kozhikode districts.The cyclone, which is the first this year, has added to the woes of the states which are already grappling with the devastating third wave of Covid.IMD Director General M Mohapatra said the cyclone has seen a rapid intensification.The gradual intensification stages are cyclonic storm, severe cyclonic storm, very severe cyclonic storm, extremely severe storm and super cyclonic storm.The National Crisis Management Committee (NCMC) headed by Cabinet Secretary Rajiv Gauba met on Sunday in the national capital, where the top bureaucrat of the country directed agencies to ensure "uninterrupted" functioning of the Covid hospitals in the states affected by Cyclone Tauktae and secure "zero loss" of lives.Home Minister Amit Shah reviewed the preparedness for Cyclone Tauktae in Gujarat, Maharashtra and the Union territories of Daman and Diu and Dadra and Nagar Havel and "specifically" stressed that all health facilities, including those for Covid-19 treatment, falling in the affected areas should be secured along with the patients.Shah also advised them to ensure adequate stocks of all essential medicines and supplies in the hospitals, keeping in view a likely disruption in the movement of vehicles, a statement issued by the Union home ministry said.Prime Minister Narendra Modi had on Saturday reviewed the preparedness of states, central ministries and agencies concerned to deal with the situation arising out of Cyclone Tauktae.Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray said an alert has been sounded in coastal districts of the state and the administration is prepared to ensure uninterrupted electricity and oxygen supply in Covid-19 hospitals.The IMD said Tauktae would cross Gujarat’s coast between Porbandar and Mahuva in Bhavnagar district by early Tuesday morning and tidal waves are likely to inundate several coastal districts during the landfall."The very severe cyclonic storm Tauktae over the east-central Arabian Sea moved nearly northwards with a speed of about 11 kmph during the past six hours," it said."It is very likely to intensify during the next 24 hours. It is very likely to move north-northwestwards and reach the Gujarat coast in the evening hours of May 17 and cross the state coast between Porbandar and Mahuva in Bhavnagar district around May 18 early morning," the IMD said.With the cyclone intensifying, the wind speed along and off Gujarat coasts in Porbandar, Junagadh, Gir Somnath and Amreli districts will reach 150-160 kmph gusting to 175 kmph by Tuesday morning.It will reach a speed of 120-150 kmph gusting to 165 kmph over Devbhoomi Dwarka, Jamnagar, Bhavnagar districts during the same period, the IMD said."Gale winds with speed reaching 70-80 kmph gusting to 90 kmph are likely to prevail along and off Valsad, Navsari, Surat, Bharuch, southern parts of Ahmedabad, and Anand districts, as well as Dadra, Nagar Haveli, Daman (Union Territories) from May 17 midnight till Tuesday morning," it said.The sea conditions will become "very rough to high" along and off the south Gujarat coast from Monday morning, and "very high to phenomenal" from Monday midnight.A tidal wave of about 3 metres, 1-2.5 metres above the astronomical tide, is likely to inundate several coastal areas of the state during the time of the landfall, it said.Heavy to very heavy rainfall in isolated places was likely over Saurashtra and Kutch and Diu on Monday, and extremely heavy rainfall at isolated places on Tuesday, according to IMD.The Indian Coast Guard said on Sunday evening hat all fishing boats have reached their harbours in Maharashtra and Gujarat."With the cyclone likely to affect power supply, hospitals treating Covid-19 patients have been asked to ensure power back-up.

The famous temple is closed for the devotees since May 5 as a state-wide lockdown was imposed by the Odisha government.The Shree Jagannatha Temple Administration made the decision to keep the temple closed for people till June 15 at a review meeting chaired by SJTA Chief Administrator Dr Krishan Kumar and attended by Puri Collector Samarth Verma.The administration of the temple in Puri is under the law department of the state government and the SJTA, which is responsible for management of the shrine, is headed by a senior IAS officer.It was also decided at the meeting to review the standard operating procedure from time to time, keeping in view the evolving situation.Though members of the temple will not be allowed to enter the temple, all the age-old rituals of the deities continue with the help of servitors and the temple administration officials, Kumar said.The spread of Covid-19 among the servitors during these times will be detrimental to the observance of daily rituals and annual programmes such as 'Chandan Yatra', 'Sanan Yatra' and 'Ratha Yatra', a statement issued by the SJTA said.Odisha's Covid-19 caseload on Sunday surged to 6,12,224 after 11,732 more people tested positive for the infection, while 19 fresh fatalities pushed the death toll to 2,313, a health department official said.Meanwhile, the Chandan Yatra (sandalwood festival) began on Saturday, adhering to Covid-19 protocols.

16-05-2021||India||Delhi, Punjab looking forward to Sputnik V amid Covid-19 vaccine shortage||As Russia-made Sputnik V is likely to be available in the Indian market from the upcoming week, states are hopeful to bring back speed to their vaccination drive which, at present, is suffering in want of vaccine stocks. The second batch of Sputnik V, containing 60,000 vaccine doses, arrived in Hyderabad on Sunday. The first consignment of 1.50 lakh doses arrived in India on May 1.Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh on Sunday asked government officials to explore whether Sputnik V can be procured as used for the inoculation of people between the age group of 18 and 44 years.While the imported doses are likely to be available in the coming week, Dr Reddy's Laboratories will be manufacturing the vaccine soon — tentatively from July.According to the agreement between Dr Reddy's Laboratories and the Russian Direct Investment Fund, the Indian company is expecting 36 million doses from Russia in several tranches. According to the health ministry's estimate, 15.6 crore doses of the Sputnik vaccine will be available in India between August and December 2021.Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Saturday said his government has written to Dr Reddy's Laboratories asking by what time it will be able to supply 67 lakh doses to the Capital.Sputnik V is the third vaccine approved to be administered and sold in India, after Serum Institute's Covishield and Bharat Biotech's Covaxin.The vaccine has recently been soft-launched in India, as Dr Reddy's administered the first jab on May 14. This vaccine uses two different vectors for the two shots and its efficacy, according to the Lancet, is 91.6 per cent.The vaccine is presently priced at ₹995.4 per dose, including GST, which makes it cheaper than Covaxin for private hospitals. Bharat Biotech's Covaxin is priced at ₹1,200 for private hospitals. Sputnik V doses that will be produced in the country may cost less, Dr Reddy's has said.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhi-punjab-looking-forward-to-sputnik-v-amid-covid-19-vaccine-shortage-101621178523740.html

16-05-2021||India||First batch of DRDO's anti-Covid drug 2-DG to be released tomorrow||The first batch of drug 2-deoxy-D-glucose drug to treat Covid-19 patients, developed by the Defence Research and Development Organisation in collaboration with Hyderabad's dr Reddy's Limited, will be launched on May 17, marking a landmark in India's fight against the Covid-19 pandemic. Defence minister Rajnath Singh and health minister Dr Harsh Vardhan will release the first batch of the drug.Early this month, the drug, which is a glucose analogue, was cleared by the Drug Controller General of India for emergency use as an adjunct therapy for Covid-19 patients. The results of clinical trials, which were conducted in several states, showed that this 2-DG molecule helps in faster recovery of hospitalised patients and also reduces oxygen dependence. A higher proportion of patients treated with 2-DG showed RT-PCR negative conversion in COVID patients, the government said.Covid-19 hospitals, oxygen generation, 2-DG drug: How DRDO has pitched in to tackle second wavePreparation for developing a drug meant for Covid-19 treatment began in April 2020, during the first wave of the pandemic, when DRDO scientists conducted laboratory experiments with the help of the Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology, Hyderabad and found that this molecule works effectively against the SARS-CoV-2 virus and inhibits the viral growth.Between May to October 2020, phase 2 trials were conducted and the drug was found to be safe in Covid-19 patients. The second phase trial was conducted in two parts on 110 patients — first in six hospitals and the second in 11 hospitals.The third phase clinical trial was conducted on 220 patients between December 2020 and March 2021 at 27 Covid hospitals in Delhi, Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal, Gujarat, Rajasthan, Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu.In the trials, patients treated with this drug recovered around 2.5 days earlier than those under standard treatment. A significantly higher proportion of patients improved symptomatically and became free from supplemental oxygen dependence (42% vs 31%) by day 3 in comparison to SoC, indicating an early relief from Oxygen therapy/dependence, the government said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/first-batch-of-drdo-s-anti-covid-drug-2-dg-to-be-released-tomorrow-101621172353471.html

16-05-2021||India||Three Bengal BJP legislators detained, traders held for flouting lockdown||Three Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) legislators were detained in Siliguri town and a few people were held in several districts for violating restrictions imposed on shops and commercial establishments as a 15-day partial lockdown began successfully in Bengal on Sunday. Streets across the state wore a deserted look. Three newly-elected BJP lawmakers from north Bengal, Sankhar Ghosh from Siliguri, Sikha Chatterjee from Dabgram-Fulbari and Anandamoy Burman from Matigara-Naxalbari, were detained by the police when they started a sit-in demonstration at Hafdar Hashmi Chowk in Siliguri demanding better handling of healthcare facilities in the wake of a sharp spike in Coronavirus infections in the region. “The three legislators were detained because there is a ban on political assembly. They were released later,” an officer from Siliguri police station said on condition of anonymity. Former Trinamool Congress (TMC) minister Gautam Deb, who has been made administrator of the Siliguri Municipal Corporation following his defeat at Dabgram-Fulbari, said, “The BJP MLAs acted irresponsibly only to be in the news.” Police detained several people in other parts of Bengal for violating lockdown restrictions. Some people were arrested as well. Although there is a ban on all modes of transport, including local trains, buses and Kolkata Metro, many people were caught driving personal vehicles. Some grocery stores were shut down by the authorities in Kolkata, East Burdwan, East Midnapore, North 24 Parganas (a district with high infection rate), Purulia and Hooghly districts as the owners were found to be operating beyond the stipulated time of 7 to 10 am. Two employees of a gymnasium at Srirampore in Hooghly district were detained for letting a few members enter through the back door. The Bengal government on Saturday said sweetmeat shops can operate from 10 am to 5 pm. Owners of four shops that opened before time were arrested at Dantan in East Midnapore. At Park Circus in Kolkata, a milk van was detained for carrying some migrant labourers. The passengers told the police that they were trying to reach Howrah station to catch a Bihar-bound train. Flights and inter-state trains have been exempted from the lockdown.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/three-bengal-bjp-legislators-detained-traders-held-for-flouting-lockdown-101621169467314.html

The company formally commenced production of medical oxygen on Thursday and the very next day, the facility in Tuticorin, about 600kms from here, suffered a jolt in operations after developing a 'technical snag'. In a statement shared on the micro-blogging site on Sunday, Sterlite Copper said, "efforts to resume production at our oxygen plant are progressing". "Today, an expert team from the Indian Space Research Organisation arrived at the premises to support our ongoing efforts and collaborate with our technical team." The expert team has suggested some measures to fix the snag and resume production of oxygen. "This has helped fastrack the repair process for which we are thankful to the local administration, which was instrumental in facilitating this cooperative effort to recommence our oxygen production," Vedanta said. The facility, on May 13, began producing medical oxygen to meet the demand for the life-saving gas following a surge in Covid cases in the state. The first set of oxygen tankers have been dispatched to the beneficiaries. The Sterlite copper smelter plant was accorded approval by the then AIADMK government on April 26 at an all-party meeting to produce medical oxygen at its facility for a period of four months at the facility in Tuticorin. The unit was sealed by the state government in May 2018, days after 13 agitators who were part of a protest against the company over environmental concerns, were killed in police firing during a violent anti-Sterlite stir in the southern district.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/isro-team-at-sterlite-copper-plant-to-help-fix-snag-affecting-oxygen-production-101621166836977.html

While Bharat Biotech itself is ramping up the production, the Centre has created additional ways to boost the production as it has already entered into agreements with three public sector undertakings that will get the technology from Bharat Biotech and will manufacture the vaccines at their own facilities. Talks are on with several others, the Centre has recently said.3 PSUs will produce one crore doses each every monthHyderabad's Indian Immunologicals Limited, Uttar Pradesh's Bharat Immunologicals and Biologicals Corporation and Mumbai's Haffkine Institute for Training will start producing Covaxin.

Professor Abu Qamar, 75, the former dean of the Faculty of Medicine in the Jawaharlal Nehru Medical College and Hospital died here on Sunday of Covid-19 after battling it for nearly three weeks, JNMC Principal Shahid Ali Siddiqui said. Prof Qamar died two days after AMU’s former proctor, Prof Nasim Beg, 76, died in a New Delhi hospital where he was shifted to and admitted after his condition worsened here, his family members said. At least 38 AMU teachers, including 21 serving ones, have died of Covid or Covid-like symptoms in the last one month, triggering doubts if any new deadly strain of the virus has been in circulation on the AMU campus. These doubts also prompted the varsity’s JNMC authorities to send Covid-19 samples from the AMU campus and its neighbouring Civil Lines area for genome sequencing to the CSIR-Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology in New Delhi. No new strain of coronavirus has been detected in samples sent for genome sequencing to the CSIR in New Delhi, said a senior JNMC official, in a relief to the hospital’s beleaguered staff who have been on the edge following a large number of deaths of the serving and retired AMU employees. Prof Haris Manzoor Khan, the head of the JNMC’s Department of Microbiology and the principal investigator of the AMU’s Viral Research and Diagnostic Laboratory, said out of the 20 samples sent to CSIR for genome sequencing, 18 (90 percent) had B.1.617.2 lineage referred to as the double mutation variant, first identified in Maharashtra on October 5, 2020. It is a subtype of B.1.617 variant which is the main virus circulating in the second wave of Covid-19 in Uttar Pradesh, he added. The WHO has described it as a “Variant of Concern” because of its higher transmissibility and reduced neutralization from pre-existing antibodies, he said. B.1.617 has a higher growth rate than other circulating variants suggesting a potentially increased rate of transmission.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-new-virus-strain-behind-spate-of-covid-19-deaths-in-amu-says-official-101621167381987.html

Many high tension 33 KV feeders are down due to the falling of trees. Even the 220 KV lines bringing power to Goa from neighbouring Maharashtra have been damaged," he said.The electricity department deployed its full force for the restoration work, but it was getting hampered due to the strong winds, he said.The state Fire and Emergency Services control room was flooded with hundreds of calls from locals about falling of trees and blocked roads, its director Ashok Menon said."Our force has been working since last night to clear the roads and remove trees which have fallen on the power lines," Menon said.No casualty was reported so far, he added.At the Cacra village in Bambolim near state capital Panaji, fishermen were seen rushing back from the sea with their canoes as gusty winds hit the coast.Local fisherman Sanjay Pereira claimed this was the worst cyclone since 1994."The water level in the sea has increased and it is expected to rise further by afternoon. All the fishermen are on alert to ensure their canoes are not pulled into the waters by strong currents," he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cyclone-tauktae-strong-winds-rain-in-goa-power-supply-hit-101621145380641.html
16-05-2021||India||Bodies of Covid-19 victims among those dumped in Ganga river: Govt||Bodies of Covid-19 victims have been found dumped in some Indian rivers, a state government said in a letter seen by Reuters, the first official acknowledgement of an alarming practice it said may stem from poverty and fear of the disease in villages.Images of corpses drifting down the Ganges river, which Hindus consider holy, have shocked a nation reeling under the world's worst surge in infections.Although media have linked the recent increase in the numbers of such bodies to the pandemic, the northern state of Uttar Pradesh, home to 240 million people, has until now not publicly revealed the cause of the deaths."The administration has information that bodies of those who have succumbed to Covid-19 or any other disease are being thrown into rivers instead of being disposed of as per proper rituals," a senior state official, Manoj Kumar Singh, said in a May 14 letter to district heads that was reviewed by Reuters."As a result, bodies have been recovered from rivers in many places."Singh confirmed the letter to Reuters but said autopsies on four to five bodies in the state's disrict of Ghazipur had not revealed virus infection."The bodies are decomposed, so I am not sure in this state it can be found out about corona positive," he said in a text message.Prime Minister Narendra Modi urged officials on Saturday to beef up rural healthcare resources and boost surveillance as the virus spreads rapidly in those areas, after ravaging the cities.Uttar Pradesh, home to more people than Brazil or Pakistan, has been badly hit by India's dramatic second surge of Covid-19. Health experts say many cases are going undetected in the state's villages, home to the bulk of its people.In the memo, Singh said a lack of funds for materials such as firewood for cremation, religious beliefs in some communities, and families abandoning victims for fear of the disease were among the likely reasons for the surge in dumping.He asked village-level officials to ensure no corpses were thrown into water and said the state government would pay poor families 5,000 rupees ($68) each to cremate or bury the bodies of the dead.The state has also asked police to patrol rivers to stop the practice.India has been officially reporting about 4,000 daily deaths from the disease for nearly two weeks, but health experts say the toll is probably much higher because of factors such as poor testing in rural areas.The jump in deaths has led to backlogs at crematoriums in many places and multiplied the cost of last rites.On Saturday, Uttar Pradesh spokesman Navneet Sehgal denied media reports that as many as 2,000 corpses of possible virus victims had been pulled from rivers in the state and neighbouring Bihar in recent days."We keep recovering 10 to 20 bodies every now and then," Sehgal told Reuters, adding that some riverside villages did not cremate their dead due to Hindu traditions during some periods of religious significance.Bihar officials did not respond to requests for comment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bodies-of-covid-19-victims-among-those-dumped-in-ganga-river-govt-101621165753886.html

16-05-2021||India||Bodies found buried in sand on banks of Ganga in UP's Prayagraj||More bodies were found buried in the sand on the banks of the Ganga in Uttar Pradesh's Prayagraj district.The discovery has caused panic among people living in nearby areas.Scores of decomposing bodies laid uncovered in the Sangam area."For the last 2-3 months, people have been burying their dead here. Sand covering the bodies is blown away by strong winds, exposing the decomposing bodies. Predatory birds and dogs feast gather and feast on the remains. The government should make arrangements for proper burials," a local, Dina Yadav told ANI.Others have expressed concerns that the corpses will spread more diseases."The government should be more careful, especially during this pandemic, as this can spread more diseases to people and worsen the situation. People are helpless. Many are poor and do not have the resources for a proper burial. The government should see to this as well," said Sanjay Srivastava, another nearby resident.Despite repeated attempts, district officials have refused to comment on the matter.Locals have also voiced concerns that the sanctity of the holy river is being compromised, as devotees have stopped taking holy baths due to the foul smell that has worsened over the days."At least 400-500 bodies have been buried here. This is a sacred place where people used to come to take holy baths. People no longer like to come here. The government should ensure that this matter is taken care of," said Kunwar Jeet Tivar.Similar scenes were witnessed in UP's Unnao district, after which a team of the local police carried out an inquiry to find more bodies.In the last week, Ghazipur and Bihar's Buxar too have seen grim incidents of bloated, decomposing bodies floating in the river. Many washed up on the shores while some were pulled up by stray dogs.While it remains unconfirmed if the bodies in Prayagaraj are of COVID-19 patients, nearby residents have said such scenes have never been witnessed before and only started with the second COVID wave."We have never seen such a sight near the river Ganga before. There are thousands of bodies here. The government should follow 'Swachh Bharat' and maintain cleanliness in the area," said Sanjay Srivastav.As per the union health ministry, there are currently 1,93,815 active COVID-19 cases in Uttar Pradesh. A total of 13,85,855 patients have recovered so far and 16,957 deaths have been reported since the beginning of the pandemic.According to the district administration, 165 fresh cases, 521 recoveries and nine deaths were reported in Prayagraj on Saturday.

16-05-2021||India||Delhi extends lockdown by a week even as cases dip to 6K. Kejriwal explains why||After witnessing record Covid-19 cases close to 30,000 last month, the national capital has decided to strictly follow the lockdown strategy till the cases come down to permit regular function of Delhi. Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Sunday extended the ongoing lockdown by another week which will now end at 5am on May 24, stating that the recovery made cannot be lost by rushing to open the national capital for people.The gains made so far in fighting Covid-19 cannot be lost suddenly due to any relaxations now, Kejriwal said.With the positivity rate shooting past the 30 per cent-mark, Delhi went into lockdown on April 20 in a bid as the CM warned that the fourth wave in the city-state is dangerous and people will have to stay indoors to save lives.The positivity rate in Delhi rose to its highest (35%) on April 26 but has gradually come down in the last 21 days.Also read: Covaxin effective against coronavirus strains found in India, UKExplaining the reason behind extending the lockdown, Kejriwal said the number of Covid-19 cases is decreasing in Delhi and recovery has increased but "we do not want to lose this gain, therefore, lockdown is extended".In the past 24 hours, Kejriwal said Delhi has reported around 6,500 cases and the positivity rate has come down to 10% from 11%.According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the positivity rate needs to come down below 5% for the outbreak to be considered under control.The CM said that the signs of recovery can be seen in Delhi's Covid-19 case trajectory. "I hope in the next week, there will be greater recovery. As far as I can understand, Delhi is slowly coming back on track. The lockdown is to continue as it is, no concessions will be given."Addressing the concerns of vaccine shortage in Delhi, CM said that the AAP-led government has written both to the Centre and the two companies to provide the vaccine.However, there is no indication of the vaccine being given to us, Kejriwal said.The coronavirus cases in the national capital were recorded to be around 6,500 for the second day in a row, indicating that Delhi may have arrested to some degree the "fourth wave" of the coronavirus outbreak.Also read: Shiv Sena accuses Modi government of Covid-19 mismanagementThe lockdown imposed on April 19 has been extended for the fourth time till May 24 morning.

16-05-2021||India||Shiv Sena accuses Modi government of Covid-19 mismanagement||Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut has accused the BJP-led Central and Uttar Pradesh governments of mismanaging the Covid-19 crisis while citing instances of behaviour encouraging ‘superstition’ instead of a scientific approach to deal with the pandemic.Sena MP Sanjay Raut alleged in his weekly column Rokthok, in party mouthpiece Saamana, that while citizens were unable to give a decent cremation to their dear ones and were disposing of the bodies in Ganga river, the ruling party indulged in religious slogans and superstition.“In Varanasi, the dead bodies have piled up and there is no place to cremate them. We are seeing hundreds of bodies floating in the river which were found in Bihar. In Ayodhya, the Prime Minister conducted the Bhoomi Pujan for the Ram Mandir a few months ago, but now Covid-19 has caused huge havoc there. There is a shortage of oxygen, medicines, hospitals and vaccines and all that the state government in Uttar Pradesh is doing is sloganeering ‘Jai Shri Ram’. This may provide oxygen to a political party but not for the hassled people,” said Raut.Hundreds of bodies of suspected Covid-19 victims have been found floating mostly in river Ganga over the past few days in Uttar Pradesh and Bihar. The Bihar government has claimed that the bodies were carried downstream from Uttar Pradesh. The National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) has issued a notice to both states and the Supreme Court has been requested to order a probe into the matter.“A state minister is asking citizens to perform Yagna so that Covid-19 can be destroyed which is shocking. Some are advocating applying cow dung while others are consuming cow urine to fight Covid-19. What more can happen when our own prime minister is advocating fighting the Covid-19 virus by clapping and banging the utensils,” Raut said.BJP leader and Madhya Pradesh culture minister Usha Thakur was in news recently for suggesting the Hindu ritual could help prevent the third wave of Covid-19 and some people were seen smearing themselves with cow dung and urine in Ahmedabad in the belief that it could boost immunity against Covid-19.Raut said the Modi government was more focussed on providing security to their newly elected legislators in West Bengal than containing the virus.“...It was the duty of the state government, and Mamata Banerjee should have been given the chance but this was not done. The whole motive was to keep their MLAs in check through this mechanism so that they don’t defect back to Mamata,” Raut said.As per the latest data released on Saturday, Karnataka has reported the highest daily new cases at 41,664 followed by Maharashtra with 34,848 cases and Tamil Nadu with 33,658 new cases. Uttar Pradesh reported 12,547 fresh Covid-19 cases taking the total case count to over 1.6 million, while Maharashtra’s Covid count stands at 5,344,063 or over 5.3 million.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/shiv-sena-accuses-modi-government-of-covid-19-mismanagement-101621161727154.html
16-05-2021||India||DRDO's 2DG medicine to treat Covid-19: Availability, dosage, price||The 2-deoxy-D-glucose drug, the first such medicine in India meant to treat Covid-19 infections, is likely to be available from the coming week, news agency ANI reported. In the first batch, 10,000 doses of this medicine will be launched. In the last year, medical experts deliberated on the effectiveness of several drugs including Hydroxychloroquine, Remdesivir, Ivermectin. But 2-DG is the first one to be termed as an anti-Covid drug. The apex drug controller of the country has allowed this drug for emergency use among Covid-19 patients.Here is all we need to know about this drug:Manufacturers: The drug has been developed by the Defence Research and Development Organisation's laboratory Institute of Nuclear Medicine and Allied Sciences. Hyderabad-based Dr Reddy's Laboratories has been a partner and it is manufacturing the drug for public use.How will the drug work?The drug is a repurposed drug as the 2-DG molecule is meant for treating tumour, cancer cells. This is a glucose analogue, which looks like glucose but is not. A virus that is multiplying fast in the body needs glucose for energy. Thus, the virus will take this glucose analogue and will get arrested. The drug will then stop the virus from multiplying.How will it treat Covid-19 patients with oxygen level dropping?Director of the Institute of Nuclear Medicine and Allied Sciences, Dr Anil Mishra, has explained in an interview to All India Radio that the oxygen demand increases as the virus is multiplying fast in the body. Once that process is stopped, the oxygen crisis will also be addressed.Will this drug work on variants of the virus?Dr Mishra has said that the way the drug functions is supposed to arrest any variant as a multiplying virus, irrespective of variant, will need food and thus will get trapped by the drug.Recently approved anti-COVID oral drug 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2-DG), developed by @DRDO_India, will help patients recover faster!

Dr Mishra said the pricing will be done keeping affordability in mind.DosageDr Sudhir Chandna has said like glucose powder, this drug can be taken with water, twice a day. A Covid-19 patient may have to take this drug for five to seven days to get completely cured.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/drdos-2dg-medicine-to-treat-covid-19-availability-dosage-price-101621160474807.html

16-05-2021||India||Rajeev Satav remembered fondly, Maharashtra leaders say his death a ‘great loss’||Maharashtra Congress leaders have described parliamentarian Rajeev Satav’s death as a major setback to the party’s state unit while expressing shock at the demise of the young leader, who was elected to the Rajya Sabha just a year ago. Satav died owing to secondary pneumonia with multiple-organ dysfunction syndrome on Sunday morning, a news agency quoted Pune’s Jehangir Hospital authorities as saying.Former chief minister and state revenue minister Ashok Chavan said Satav’s death was saddening. “We have lost a talented leader who had [a] great future. He had carved a niche at national level after starting his political career at district level. He was [the] pride of Maharashtra and had created curiosity about his leadership across the nation. His passing is a great loss for Maharashtra and especially for Marathwada,” he said. Satav was admitted to Jehangir Hospital on April 23 with acute respiratory distress syndrome and severe Covid-19 pneumonia and tested negative for the infection on May 9, hospital authorities said. However, due to complications, he was put on ventilator support a few days ago and breathed his last this morning.Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar said Rajeev Satav was known as a young, dynamic and scholastic leader. “The sad demise of the Congress Working Committee’s convenor is shocking,” Pawar tweeted in Marathi. Maharashtra governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari called Satav a leader known for his “leadership qualities and organisational abilities”. “Death has snatched away a promising leader with great potential,” he said. Maharashtra’s deputy chief minister and NCP leader Ajit Pawar said Satav had friends in all political parties. “Very close confidante and a friend to former Congress president Rahul Gandhi, Rajeev shared cordial, friendly relations with leaders from other parties. He was a decent face in Indian politics. We have lost a good-natured person,” he said. Earlier today, Rahul Gandhi said he was “very sad” at the loss of his “friend Rajeev Satav”. “He was a leader with huge potential who embodied the ideals of the Congress. It’s a big loss for us all,” Gandhi had tweeted. His sister and Congress general secretary in charge of eastern Uttar Pradesh, Priyanka Gandhi, described him as “one of our brightest colleagues” and said he was “clean of heart, sincere, deeply committed”.Leader of opposition in the legislative assembly Devendra Fadnavis said, “Rajeev Satav’s passing is shocking and saddening. We have lost a young, promising and studious leader in him. I pray to [the] almighty to give all [the] strength to his family to face the loss.” Satav was a legislator from Hingoli district and won the Lok Sabha election in 2014 when Congress could win only two seats in Maharashtra. He, however, chose not to contest the 2019 Lok Sabha elections citing his responsibility in Gujarat, where he was looking into organisational matters and election management of the party. He was later elected to Rajya Sabha.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rajeev-satav-remembered-fondly-maharashtra-leaders-say-his-death-a-great-loss-101621148826776.html
16-05-2021||India||Centre releases Covid-19 guidelines for rural areas, focus on surveillance, screening||The Centre on Sunday released new guidelines in the wake of the spread of coronavirus disease (Covid-19) in rural areas. The government said that a gradual ingress is now being seen in peri-urban, rural and tribal areas as well.Releasing the guidelines, the ministry of health and family welfare said that there is a need to enable communities, strengthen primary level healthcare infrastructure at all levels to intensify Covid-19 response in these areas while continuing to provide other essential health services.The health ministry guidelines said that in every village, active surveillance should be done for influenza-like illness/severe acute respiratory infections(ILI/SARI) periodically by ASHA with help of Village Health Sanitation and Nutrition Committee (VHSNC).It also asked the community health officer (CHO) the determine the seriousness of the infection by teleconsultation and recommend cases with comorbidities and low oxygen saturation to higher centres. It also said that the CHOs should be trained in performing rapid antigen testing (RAT) and the kits should be made at all public health facilities."These patients should be counselled to isolate themselves till test results are available. Those asymptomatic but having history of high-risk exposure to COVID patients (exposure of more than 15 mins without a mask within 6 feet distance) should be advised quarantine and tested as per ICMR protocol," the ministry further said in the guidelines.The guidelines also talk on focusing on contact tracing as per Integrated Disease Surveillance Programme’s (IDSP) guidelines, adding that those testing positive should be allowed to quarantine at home by following the protocols issued by the ministry.Also Read: Bihar enrols ward committees to check Corona in rural areas, says it’s helpingStressing on the need to monitor oxygen saturation levels, the ministry directed the VHSNC to mobilise resources through local PRI to make provisions for these equipment. Thermometers and pulse oximeters can be given the families in the rural areas on loan and follow-up visits should be undertaken by frontline worker/volunteers/teacher following required infection prevention practices."A home isolation kit shall be provided to all such cases which should include required medicines such as Paracetamol 500 mg, Tab. Ivermectin, cough syrup, multivitamins (as prescribed by the treating doctor) besides a detailed pamphlet indicating the precautions to be taken, medication details, monitoring proforma for patient condition during the home isolation, contact details in case of any major symptoms or deterioration of health condition and the discharge criteria," the ministry said in the guidelines.The guidelines come a day after Prime Minister Narendra Modi, chairing a high-level meeting on the Covid-19 situation, directed government officials to make a distribution plan for oxygen supply to rural areas and scale up health infrastructure to manage the disease burden in those regions.The Prime Minister asked officials to focus on testing, including door-to-door testing and assist health care workers in rural areas, the Prime Minister’s Office said in a statement.During the first wave, urban areas contributed a majority of new infections in India every month for five months from March 2020 to July 2020, before rural areas started contributing more new cases. In the second wave, which began in February this year, this took just two months as rural areas began contributing more cases April onwards.Experts say the impact of the outbreak could be even deadlier in rural areas, where health care infrastructure is traditionally weaker and fewer medical facilities are available. About 73% of the country’s population also resides in rural districts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-released-covid-19-guidelines-for-rural-areas-to-check-its-spread-101621146135876.html

16-05-2021||India||India's power consumption up nearly 19% in first fortnight of May from last year||New Delhi, May 16 (PTI) Power consumption in the country grew by around 19 per cent in the first fortnight of May to 51.67 billion units (BU) over the same period last year, showing recovery in industrial and commercial demand of electricity, according to the power ministry data.Power consumption in the first fortnight of May 2020 was 43.55 BU. The power consumption in the entire month of May last year was 102.08 BU.Also Read | India's power consumption up nearly 25% in first week of May from last yearDuring the first fortnight of May this year (from May 1 to 14), peak power demand met or the highest supply in a day touched the highest level of 168.78 GW (on May 6, 2021) and recorded growth of over 15 per cent over 146.54 GW (peak met) recorded in the same period in 2020 (on May 13, 2020).The power consumption in April grew nearly 40 per cent to 118.08 BU. Power consumption in April 2020 had dropped to 84.55 BU from 110.11 BU in the same month in 2019, mainly because of fewer economic activities following the imposition of lockdown by the government in the last week of March 2020 to contain the spread of deadly COVID-19.The power consumption also fell in May 2020 to 102.08 BU from 120.02 BU in May 2019.Similarly, peak power demand met or the highest power supply in a day also slumped to 132.73 GW in April last year from 176.81 GW in the same month in 2019, showing the impact of lockdown on economic activities.The fewer economic activities also resulted in a fall of peak power demand in May 2020 to 166.22 GW from 182.53 GW in May 2019.Taking to PTI, Davinder Sandhu, Advisor Primus Partners said, "Energy is derived demand, and with onset of summer and the productive pre-monsoon cycle of the Indian economy, an uptick is always expected."Sandhu who is also a former Advisor at World Bank said, "Both energy demand and supply have risen by 25-40 per cent over March-May 2021, with thermal PLFs (plant load factor or capacity utilisation) rising to 75 per cent and more, after many quarters. This is aided by the opening of the economy in Q1 (January-March 2021), with rising economic output as well as sharp uptick in exports."The second wave of lockdowns will certainly impact economic activity, and in turn, energy demand. The larger than usual increase in part is attributed to lower base, and as well as to the pent up demand being executed now, he added.After a gap of six months, power consumption had recorded a 4.6 per cent year-on-year growth in September 2020 and 11.6 per cent in October 2020.In November 2020, the power consumption growth slowed to 3.12 per cent, mainly due to the early onset of winters. In December 2020, power consumption grew by 4.5 per cent while it was up 4.4 per cent in January 2021.Power consumption in February this year recorded at 103.25 BU compared to 103.81 BU last year. But 2020 was a leap year. In March this year, the power consumption grew nearly 22 per cent to 120.63 BU compared to 98.95 BU in the same month of 2020.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/indias-power-consumption-up-nearly-19-in-first-fortnight-of-may-from-last-year-101621143725116.html

It also highlighted that the positivity rate has gone below 20 per cent.At a media briefing by the Union health ministry on Saturday, joint secretary Lav Agarwal said that the positivity rate - proportion of samples that return positive for Covid-19 - dipped from 21.9% last week to 19.8% in the May 8-14 period. A dropping positivity rate is indicative of slowing of the spread of infection.Government figures show that the number of active cases, which were touching 40 lakh, has now gone down to around 36-37 lakh. The health ministry officials called it a "big achievement" due to more recoveries and the case fatality rate remaining stable.For the fourth time in the last five days, India's daily Covid-19 recoveries outnumbered new cases on Saturday. The national recovery rate stands at 83.83 per cent.Major reasons for the drop in cases of Covid-19 are the strict curbs announced by various states governments and inoculation of more people in the ongoing vaccination drive. Joint secretary Lav Agarwal said that a total of 18.04 crore vaccine doses have been administered so far in the country. This includes 13.74 crore people above the age of 45 years, 1.62 crore healthcare workers, 2.25 crore frontline workers and 42.59 lakh people between the age of 18-44 years who have received their first dose.The government is now focussing on those states which have high number of active cases. According to health ministry data, there are 11 states which have over one lakh active cases and 17 have less than 50,000 cases. High caseload states like Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh, Gujarat and Chhattisgarh have reported a decline in the number of active cases in the last one week, whereas the situation in Tamil Nadu remains an area of concern due to rise in the number of active cases in the same period.On May 3, the active cases were 17.13 per cent of the total caseload, which has declined to 15.1 per cent and recovered cases stand at 83.8 per cent, according to government data.The national mortality rate currently stands at 1.09 per cent, according to Union health ministry.(With inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid19-cases-decline-in-last-7-days-govt-focus-on-states-with-high-caseload-101621136292989.html

16-05-2021||India||25 more oxygen generators to reach India from Europe next week||Twenty-five more oxygen generators will reach India from Europe over the next week to ease the severe medical oxygen supply crisis in the country, particularly the national capital Delhi, people familiar with the development said.The high-capacity generators, most of them made by French company Novair, produce medical oxygen from ambient air to feed a hospital’s oxygen system. The oxygen generators include 19 bought by three-four Indian firms including an IT major, which dipped into their corporate social responsibility funds to buy the high-capacity oxygen generators.Officials coordinating foreign assistance and import of medical equipment from abroad said the oxygen generators - 17 will come from Novair’s manufacturing facility north of Paris and another 2 from its Italian plant - will be dispatched on 17 May. Each plant has the capacity to generate 24,000 litres of oxygen per hour.Five more oxygen generators will be picked up from France by the Indian Air Force’s C-17 Globemaster III, the heavy-lift transport aircraft that can carry a payload of 77 tonnes, on 21 May. There is a plan by the army to fly in another five generators from Paris but the schedule hasn’t been finalised yet, an official said.Also Read | 'Vaccinated or not': Government's scientific advisor has 3 tips against Covid-19In addition, an official said, India had also managed to get a commitment for 420 metric tonnes of zeolite from another French firm Arkema. The company had initially agreed to ship 160 MT but later relented. Zeolite is used in oxygen concentrators to absorb nitrogen when the ambient air is forced under pressure through the concentrator’s molecular sieve.Officials said these emergency supplies are in addition to supplies being received from European Union and its member states to help India cope with record-breaking infections that have stayed above the 300,000-mark for weeks.Officials in New Delhi said India has received a substantial part of the offers from the EU, 17 EU member states, Norway and Iceland including items worth more than Euro 100 million, apart from the Euro 2.2 million emergency funding by the EU to WHO’s management of patients and strengthening testing capacities in India.Around 250 more ventilators, 250 oxygen concentrators and 5,000 more vials of Remdesivir are in the pipeline. India has already received 12 oxygen plants, 1,700 ventilators, 1,500 oxygen concentrators, 1,300 cylinders, 70,000 vials of Remdesivir, 20,000 vials of monoclonal antibodies and more than 210 tonnes of liquid medical oxygen.

16-05-2021||India||India to have 51.6 crore Covid-19 vaccine doses by July: Harsh Vardhan||The number of vaccine doses administered in India will reach 51.6 crore by the end of July, Union Health Minister Harsh Vardhan said on Saturday.India has so far administered over 18 crore jabs to eligible beneficiaries.Vardhan, during his discussion with the health ministers of Uttar Pradesh, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh and Andhra Pradesh, said vaccine production was being ramped up to cater to the increased demand."Production of vaccines is being steadily ramped up to cater to increased demand while vaccines that are being produced now continue to be equitably apportioned and swiftly sent to States/Union Territories."We will have 51.6 crore vaccine doses by the end of July including the 18 crore doses already administered. Sputnik has been approved. This along with the slated approval of the new vaccine of Zydus Cadila, Serum Institute of India- Novavax vaccine, Bharat Biotech's nasal vaccine and the Genova mRNA vaccine will push the availability of COVID vaccines to 216 crore doses in the August-December period,” he said.During his interaction with the state health ministers and principal secretaries/additional chief secretaries of the four states in the presence of Ashwini Kumar Choubey, Union Minister of State for Health and Family Welfare, Vardhan highlighted the challenges faced by the states.He said that Gujarat has displayed a gradual increase in the positivity rate since April and the recovery rate stands at 79 per cent, which is lower than the national average.He noted that nearly 100 per cent ICU beds in Ahmedabad, Vadodara and Mehsana and 97 per cent and 96 per cent of oxygen beds in Ahmedabad and Vadodara, respectively, stood occupied indicating saturation.Andhra Pradesh has had an increasing positivity rate since early April and the weekly growth rate was as high as 30.3 per cent, he said, adding that Chittoor, East Godavari, Guntur, Srikakulam, Visakhapatnam were flagged as districts of concern in the state.Uttar Pradesh saw an exponential growth in cases in a six-week period (5,500 to 31,000 cases and two per cent to 14 per cent positivity rate) with Lucknow and Meerut having more than 14,000 active cases with all categories of bed showing more than 90 per cent occupancy.In Madhya Pradesh, 10 districts have more than 20 per cent positivity with over one lakh active cases all over the state. Indore, Bhopal, Gwalior and Jabalpur were flagged as districts of concern, the minister said.During the meeting, Uttar Pradesh and Gujarat were cautioned for having a high proportion of deaths in the age group 18-45 years.Vardhan also expressed a strong view that the present plateauing of Covid cases should not be taken as a sign for complacency but as a breathing space to expand, revamp and improve health infrastructure.State health administrators were advised to increase ICU and oxygen-supported beds, undertake oxygen audits, take stock of availability of medicines in the states and strengthen their medical workforce.Dr Sujeet K Singh, Director, National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC), presented the epidemiological findings and a granular analysis of the Covid trajectory in the states.He suggested continuing focus on the health infrastructure in small cities as people from nearby towns and villages would rush there in case of surge.He also urged the states to keep a tab on the variants of Covid through the INSACOG consortium.States were advised to ensure complete utilisation of available vaccination slots for 45 age-group/healthcare workers/frontline workers with awareness campaigns for conveying the importance of completing the second dose of vaccine.It was reiterated that States need to focus on reduction of vaccine wastage as that will be factored in subsequent allocations to that State.States were advised to constitute a 2/3-member team at State level on the lines of the dedicated team at Union Health Ministry to regularly coordinate with manufacturers for timely supplies of vaccine through 'Other than Govt. of India channel' and also to coordinate with private hospitals for their procurement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-to-have-51-6-crore-vaccine-doses-by-july-harsh-vardhan-101621128661244.html

16-05-2021||India||Gujarat Covid-19 deaths underreported: Chidambaram||The Congress on Saturday accused the Bharatiya Janata Party government in Gujarat of underreporting Covid-19 deaths in the state, calling it a “grave misdeed apart from being a national shame and a national tragedy”.Addressing a virtual press conference, former Union finance minister P Chidambaram highlighted a report published in a Gujarati newspaper, Dhaivy Bhaskar. “During the period March 1, 2021 to May 10, 2021, the government of Gujarat has officially admitted to only 4,218 Covid-related deaths, while death certificates issued are about 123,000 against 58,000 certificates that were issued during the same period last year. This can’t be an annual natural increase but can only be attributed to a pandemic,” he said, asserting that the Congress has independently verified the figures and all of it was supported by the thousands of unidentified bodies found floating in Ganga river or buried along its banks.State home minister Pradipsinh Jadeja has dismissed the newspaper report as “mischievous”.Chidambaram also accused the BJP-led central government of ‘bluffing with people of India’ by suppressing the true number of new Covid infections in the country.“The Government of India and the Government of Gujarat owe an explanation to the people of India,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/gujarat-covid-19-deaths-underreported-chidambaram-101621124470057.html

16-05-2021||India||Ex-IAS officer booked for spreading misinformation: Police||A former IAS officer has been booked for spreading misinformation by tweeting a seven-year-old photograph of dead bodies floating in the Ganga in Unnao and claiming them to be recent ones spotted in the river in Ballia, police said on Saturday.Police said the 1982-batch, UP-cadre officer Surya Pratap Singh was booked on May 13 after he tweeted an Unnao picture of 2014 vintage, claiming that bodies being seen in them were spotted a day earlier in the Ganga in Ballia district.Earlier, officials said, a total of 52 bodies found floating in the Ganga in Ballia district on Tuesday were retrieved and were disposed of after proper last rites.In an FIR lodged at the Unnao Kotwali police station, the retired IAS officer Singh has also been accused of claiming on social media that 67 bodies were buried on the Unnao riverbank using JCB and without performing any last rites. Kotwali police station’s SHO Dinesh Chandra Mishra said the case against Singh was lodged on May 13 on complaints by several city residents. The former outspoken officer had been booked on May 13 after he tweeted the picture of floating bodies and wrote in Hindi, “Tairati laashon aur ukharhtee saanso kaa UP model (The UP model of floating bodies and gasping breaths)." SHO Mishra said the case against Singh has been booked under various sections of the Indian Penal Code, the Information Technology Act, the Disaster Management Act and the UP Public Health and Epidemic Diseases Control Ordinance, 2020. Quoting from the FIR lodged against the former IAS officer, Mishra said the case against Singh was registered on the complaint by various Unnao residents. He said the residents also accused Singh of falsely claiming on social media that 67 bodies were buried on the riverbank using JCB and without performing their last rites, in an insult to the Hindu religion. The SHO said the people also accused the former IAS officer of observing on social media that it was the Yogi model of the governance in Uttar Pradesh where the living ones fail to get the treatment and the dead ones their last rites. “Due to this tweet, the atmosphere of the district became tense. In the probe, the tweet was found to be misleading with old pictures of Unnao linked to Ballia,” Mishra said. About the authenticity of the floating bodies tweeted by Singh, Mishra said on being contacted, the Social Media Cell of the Unnao Police found that the photograph tweeted by Singh dated back to January 13, 2014, in which around 100 bodies were seen floating on the Ganga in Unnao's Pariyar Ghat. Mishra said the IAS officer, by tweeting an old picture of dead bodies floating in the Ganga in Unnao and claiming them to be those spotted in Ballia, has deliberately created a feeling of animosity among people belonging to different religions. Reacting to the registration of the criminal case against him, Singh, in a fresh tweet asked, "Were no bodies floating in Unnao? Will the truth change after registering a case against me?"||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/exias-officer-booked-for-spreading-misinformation-police-101621116887932.html

Police said he worked as a labourer in Lucknow but was unemployed following the imposition of the lockdown.Police said Yadav’s friend persuaded him to dupe people looking for life-saving medicines and injections. Police are on the lookout for his accomplices.Deputy commissioner of police (southeast) R P Meena said a woman, Pooja Gupta, filed a complaint alleging that a person cheated her of ₹20,000 for getting six remdesivir injections for her sister-in-law, a critical Covid-19 patient.“Gupta found a supplier’s number on a WhatsApp group and contacted the person, who demanded ₹9,000 for each injection and tricked her into paying ₹20,000 as a token amount. After the money was transferred, the person gave Gupta the contact number of a delivery boy. However, after dilly-dallying for two days, the cellphones of both the persons were switched off,” said DCP Meena.A case was registered on Gupta’s complaint, following which Yadav was arrested. Police said he was using a fake name “Sunny” to contact and con Gupta.In another case, a 29-year-old man was arrested from Dwarka’s Sector 23 on Friday for his alleged involvement in black-marketing of oxygen cylinders. Four cylinders were recovered from his car. “The arrest was made following information that a man was involved in hoarding and black marketing of oxygen cylinders. The suspect, identified as Mohit, was arrested with four cylinders kept in his car,” said DCP (Dwarka) Santosh Kumar Meena.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/man-held-for-duping-covid-19-patient-s-family-on-pretext-of-remdesivir-sale-101621115798398.html
16-05-2021||India||Govt reaches out to Dr Reddy’s for Sputnik V doses||With its Covaxin supply almost exhausted, the Delhi government has reached out to Dr Reddy’s Laboratories (DRL), seeking 6.7 million doses of Sputnik V vaccine, to increase the pace of the inoculation drive in the city.“Vaccination is very necessary. The experience of those from the UK and USA tells that if vaccination is carried out on a massive level, then the effects of coronavirus can be curtailed. We are seeing that the central government is also trying its best and the state governments are also trying their best. We have contacted Dr Reddy’s for the Sputnik vaccine. We have written to them but have not received a complete response as to how many vaccines they can provide. We have asked for 67 lakh doses of Covishield, 67 lakh of Covaxin, and a similar amount for Sputnik V,” said chief minister Arvind Kejriwal.While a first batch of 150,000 Sputnik V doses was imported from Russia by the firm earlier this month, DRL officials had said that commercial shipments are expected to begin only later.Days after closing several centres where Covaxin was being administered to people between the ages of 18 and 44 in Delhi, the Capital was left with just over 5,600 doses of the vaccine at some centres on Saturday morning. “For those between the ages of 18 and 44 years, the Covaxin stock in Delhi is almost over. There are a few hundred doses left with some of the centres which are being used up. Most of the Covaxin centres have been closed,” said AAP MLA Atishi.Going by the vaccination bulletin released on Saturday, the government‘s Covishield stock may last about eight days for the 18-44 age group. The government also received a consignment of 173,760 Covishield doses, earmarked for those above the age of 45, health care, and frontline workers, from the Centre on Saturday, said Atishi.As per the bulletin, the available Covishield doses for these groups will last around six days and Covaxin for three days at the current pace of vaccination.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-reaches-out-to-dr-reddy-s-for-sputnik-v-doses-101621115250777.html
16-05-2021||India||PM stresses localised containment, testing in high-level Covid-19 review meeting||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday chaired a high-level meeting to review the Covid-19 situation in the country, directing government officials to make a distribution plan for oxygen supply to rural areas and scale up health infrastructure to manage the disease burden in those regions.The Prime Minister asked officials to focus on testing, including door-to-door testing and assist health care workers in rural areas, the Prime Minister’s Office said in a statement. He also stressed that local containment efforts were the “need of the hour”, especially in states where the test-positivity rate – an indication of the spread of the virus within a population – is high.“PM asked for augmentation of healthcare resources in rural areas to focus on door-to-door testing and surveillance. He also spoke about empowering ASHA & Anganwadi workers with all necessary tools,” the statement said.PM Modi’s directions are significant, given that the deadly second wave of infections in the country appears to have affected rural hinterland faster than it did during the first outbreak last year.As reported by HT on May 8, during the first wave, urban areas contributed a majority of new infections in India every month for five months from March 2020 to July 2020, before rural areas started contributing more new cases. In the second wave, which began in February, this took just two months as rural areas began contributing more cases April onwards.Experts say the impact of the outbreak could be even deadlier in rural areas, where health care infrastructure is traditionally weaker and fewer medical facilities are available. About 73% of the country’s population also resides in rural districts.“The Prime Minister directed that a distribution plan for ensuring oxygen supply in rural areas should be worked out, including provision of Oxygen Concentrators,” the statement said.The PM’s meeting was also held just weeks after the national capital plunged into a health care crisis over the supply of oxygen, which is crucial in the treatment of Covid-19 patients. Starting April 22 until the first week of May, hospitals across New Delhi repeatedly made distress calls over dwindling stocks of oxygen, and dozens of patients died as some facilities waited for supplies to be replenished.The situation in the Capital has now eased but other states are facing a similar issue. At least 75 Covid-19 patients died at a premier hospital in Goa after fluctuation in the supply of medical oxygen this week.At the meeting that was attended by Niti Aayog member VK Paul, cabinet secretary Rajeev Gauba among other officials, PM Modi also instructed officials to ramp up testing with both RT-PCR and rapid tests, specifically focusing on Covid-19 hot spots. According to the statement, the PM was informed that testing figures have gone up from 5 million per week in early March to around 13 million/week presently.Separately, the statement said the Prime Minister “took serious note of some reports about ventilators lying unutilised” and ordered an immediate audit of installation and operation of the life-saving machines that were provided by the central government to states in recent weeks.The PM’s response likely refers to the spat between the Centre and the Congress-led Punjab government after the Union health ministry dismissed reports suggesting that ventilators given to a hospital in Punjab’s Faridkot were lying unused because of technical glitches. The Union health ministry said earlier this month that the reports of faulty ventilators were “unfounded”.Training for properly operating ventilators should be provided to health care workers if necessary, PM Modi added.The Prime Minister also appeared to address concerns regarding allegations of states undercounting cases and deaths linked to the viral illness. He “encouraged” governments to report Covid-19 numbers “transparently without any pressure of high numbers showing adversely on their efforts”.The move came a day after the Opposition Congress in Gujarat demanded an inquiry into a local media report that said around 61,000 deaths had not been counted in the state’s official toll of Covid-19 victims. The Bharatiya Janata Party-led state government has denied the allegations.Officials on Saturday gave a detailed presentation on state- and district-level situation of Covid-19 testing, oxygen availability and health care infrastructure. They further briefed the Prime Minister about the slowdown of the second wave of infections and said that daily new cases across the country had reduced from over 400,000 a day.On average, India has been adding XX new cases per day this week, as compared to XXX cases/day last week.The PMO said the road map for future vaccine availability was also discussed, with Modi directing officials to work closely with states to fasten the pace of inoculations.In recent days, vaccination centres across several states such as Maharashtra and Delhi said they halted inoculations due to a scarcity of vaccine doses. Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal also appealed to the Centre this week not to leave it only to the state governments to procure doses from international vaccine makers for the 18-44 age group.Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Saturday attacked the central government over its Covid-19 strategy and said that its “disastrous vaccine strategy” will ensure a devastating third wave. “It can’t be repeated enough-India needs a proper vaccine strategy!” he wrote.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-stresses-localised-containment-testing-in-high-level-covid-19-review-meeting-101621113955210.html

In fact, it would not be wrong here to say that the applicant by his instigation to the rioters acted as a cannon fodder for them to wreak havoc upon the persons of majority community (sic),” it noted.In its 34-page order, the judge noted that the allegations against the accused are “extremely grave in nature”.While Delhi Police’s Special Cell has charged Hussain for rioting, murder and inciting rioters and named him as accused in 11 FIRs, on Saturday, the court was hearing two cases related to gunshot wounds sustained by two persons during the riots.The court said that even if there were no direct acts of violence attributable to Hussain, he cannot shy away from his liability under the provisions of the sections invoked against him, particularly on account of the fact that his house/building became the hub for the “rioters and rabble rousers to unleash the worst communal riots since partition in Delhi”.“He permitted his big house... to be used by rioters to play havoc upon persons of other communities. He indulged in terror funding and collection of means of rioting and thereafter, under a conspiracy hatched at local level, used seduced persons as ‘human weapons’,” he added.“It is also evident that the participants of the larger conspiracy had collected huge amounts (terror funding) through hawala and other illegal means...and ultimately the smaller conspiracy at local level were given effect to (sic),” the order read.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/court-dismisses-tahir-hussain-s-bail-plea-in-two-delhi-riots-cases-101621111291441.html
16-05-2021||India||25 held for posters critical of PM Modi||Continuing their action against people putting up posters critical of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the Delhi Police on Saturday said they arrested 25 in as many cases registered at different police stations across the city even as they were trying to ascertain the key players behind the posters.Police registered the FIRs under sections of the Prevention of Defacement of Property Act. The number of first information reports (FIRs) and arrests could increase in the coming days as more posters reading “Modiji humare bachon ki vaccine videsh kyon bhej diya? (Why did Modi send vaccines meant for our children to foreign countries?)” are being found across the city, senior police officers privy to the development said.Since the legal sections mentioned in the FIRs were all bailable, a majority of those arrested till Saturday afternoon were released on bail from the concerned police stations itself. Those arrested after Saturday afternoon were likely to be released by late in the night after completing the legal formalities, the officers said.The police are trying to ascertain if all the posters were printed at one printing press and whether the order for the same was given by an individual or any political party. However, the initial investigations in most of the registered cases and interrogation of the arrested people have not yielded much of a result.A few of the arrested persons claimed that they were given money for pasting the posters. The police are now trying to identify the people who paid the money. Their questioning may lead to the key players behind the critical posters, the officers said.The first such posters, nearly 1,800 in number and not bearing any logo or mention of any political party or organisation, were found in east Delhi’s Kalyanpuri between Wednesday and Thursday, after which a case was registered and four persons were arrested. Their interrogation pointed towards the involvement of a local politician.“We are probing the role of the politician. Our investigation is still on. It’s too early to comment on any individual’s involvement,” said a police officer, who did not want to be identified.As similar posters were found in other parts of the city from Thursday onwards, more FIRs were registered. Till Saturday evening, the number of FIRs reached 25 in 13 different police districts.All the cases were registered under sections 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant) of the Indian Penal Code and other sections including section 3 of the Prevention of Defacement of Property Act across various districts. In total, 25 people were arrested till Saturday evening.As per details obtained from the police, except New Delhi and outer-north, all other 13 districts registered between one and four cases each. In four cases registered by the north-west district, two people were arrested while the outer, west and north-east districts filed three cases each.Two cases each were registered in the south, central and Rohini districts while the remaining six districts – Shahdara, Dwarka, North, south-East, south-west, and east – registered one case each. West district police made five arrests, while in the east and central districts, four people each were arrested.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/25-held-for-posters-critical-of-pm-modi-101621109330775.html

This cyclonic storm comes at a time when India is battling a raging second wave of Covid-19 pandemic, which has infected 24,679,650 and killed 270,259 people, so far.According to the India Meteorological Department, the cyclonic storm is very likely to intensify further into a “very severe cyclonic storm” and move north-northwestwards and cross Gujarat coast between Porbandar and Naliya around May 18.The Met department has recommended a total suspension of fishing operations in Gujarat and other states on the west coast. It has also asked for regulation of rail and road traffic and advised people to stay indoors.In view of the warning, Gujarat has geared up adequately to ensure there is no casualty and set up a control room, chief minister Vijay Rupani said even as a central advisory predicted damage to thatched houses, roads, power and communication lines in the Saurashtra region.In Delhi, Prime Minister Narendra Modi held a review meeting on preparedness in the face of the cyclone. He instructed officials to ensure maintenance of essential services like power, telecommunications, health and drinking water.The weather department has also predicted rainfall of varying intensity, from light and moderate to extremely heavy, due to the impact of cyclone in Lakshadweep Islands, Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Konkan and Goa, Gujarat and West Rajasthan. Red and orange alerts have been sounded in various parts.More than 50 teams of the National Disaster Response Force are on duty in five states - Kerala, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Gujarat and Maharashtra.While Kerala is not in the predicted path of the cyclone, the state government said it is prepared as heavy rains, strong winds and strong sea gusts are expected till Sunday. The state has reported two deaths due to the torrential rains. In Tamil Nadu, more than 300 people have been relocated from disaster-prone areas to relief camps in Thiruvananthapuram.The storm could also bring gusty winds and showers to Mumbai. “In a prep meeting regarding Cyclone Tauktae, CM Uddhav Balasaheb Thackeray instructed the District Administration, Divisional Commissioners & District Collectors to be vigilant & well equipped in coastal areas, especially of Palghar, Raigad, Ratnagiri & Sindhudurg (sic),” read a tweet by the office of Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/states-brace-as-cyclone-nears-with-strong-winds-heavy-rain-101621106336100.html
16-05-2021||India||As cases surge, Good Samaritans lend a helping hand in Bengaluru||Bengaluru: As the city struggles to cope up with surging Covid-19 cases, Good Samaritans in Bengaluru have come forward to extend a helping hand to those in need. Volunteers from a range of backgrounds, including software industry, films, police department and others, have been providing all kinds of support to people in Bengaluru, which has become one of the most impacted cities in the country during the second wave of infections. The efforts of volunteers and frontline workers, both organised and individuals, included dissemination of information, supply of food and other essentials and even helping ferry the large number of migrants who left Bengaluru back to their home states fearing the uncertainty. Actor working as an ambulance driver At a time when cases are increasing exponentially, Kannada actor Arjun Gowda put on a new hat, not in reel but real life, working as an ambulance driver to help Covid-19 patients in Bengaluru. He has started also started ‘Project Smile Trust’ that aims to reach out to those who are stuck without any help during the pandemic. “We want to ensure that we help out anyone in need irrespective of where they come from or what religion they practice. I’m also ready to travel across town for help. I plan on continuing with this help for the next couple of months as the current situation is quite bad and I want to do my bit to people in whatever little way that I can,” he said. A senior cop who hasn’t touched his new-born Anuchet MN, deputy commissioner of police, central, became a father soon after the second wave of Covid hit the city. Responsible for one of the busiest regions of the city, Anuchet has been on duty to ensure enforcement of lockdown, arrange essential services and most importantly, ensure the men serving in his division were safe. But, amid all these, he still hasn’t been able to hold his newborn so far. “Because I’m out in the field, I see my child only from a distance. I use a different room and have little physical interaction with family. It is tough, but that is what every policeman is going through. We are out on the streets, and we are highly susceptible to the virus. But this is what we signed up for,” he said. A transwoman lending helping hand Veena, a transsexual woman is a familiar face in Okalipuram area in Bengaluru. At a time when the pandemic is wreaking havoc, she visits from house to house, checking on people and providing food to those in need. In the second week of April, when she realised there was an increase in the number of deaths in her locality, she took onto herself to ensure that people were tested. Last week, when the Indira canteens began demanding Aadhaar cards for providing free food, she led an agitation outside one of the canteens. “In such a situation, it is the poor who suffer the most. I initially started helping the transgender community in my area, because I know what they go through. Over a period of time, people started seeing my work and came to me for help. Once the Covid started, I started using my contacts to get free food for people who had lost their job. I have goodwill with people, something that I now use to spread awareness about vaccination and testing,” Veena said. Scaling aide work with tech Sneha Vachhaney, who has created a platform for home chefs providing food for those in need, is a key link in the food distribution in the city. “In the initial days, I was cooking around 50 meals a day to distribute around the area I lived in. Soon, I realised that there was a large demand for meals for those who are in quarantine. Then we put out a call for home chefs and so far around 200 of them have responded,” she said. Sneha, who comes from a corporate background, said soon she realised that just cooking meals won’t be enough and her expertise could be used for scaling this process. “With help of my friends, we have created a platform where home chefs can join, and this process is streamlined. We also contacted food delivery companies like Swiggy and Dunzo for our deliveries as the numbers increased,” she said, adding that Bengaluru’s tech background came to help after all. An ambulance that never stops For 12-year-old Daniel, helping his father in hospital was all he knew, and which later became his profession, something that has now become one of the most sought-after services during the pandemic. “My father used to conduct post-mortem in Bowring hospital. I used to go with him after it in the hearse van to conduct last rites on unknown and unclaimed dead bodies,” Daniel said. Now 33, Daniel drives an ambulance that has ferried hundreds over the last 12 years and several more since the outbreak of the pandemic. Daniel and his two brothers, Kumar and Stalin, are among the hundreds of ambulance drivers who have looked beyond individual and their family’s safety and tirelessly worked during the last year of the pandemic, which has impacted thousands in Bengaluru, Karnataka, India and globally. A recruiter who helps bury bodies Tanveer Ahmed, a recruiter by profession, is among a select group of volunteers in Bengaluru who have helped conduct the last rites of people whose families are in dire need of help during the pandemic. Ahmed, a 45-year-old father of four, is part of Mercy Angel’s, a volunteer-driven organisation that has helped in providing relief like food distribution, helping distressed and Covid- 19 infected families find medicine, hospital beds and oxygen as well as helping with last rites. The team helped with the last rites of the first-ever casualty in Bengaluru on March 23 last year and has since teamed up with the BBMP as one of the most experienced and adept groups to carry out Covid-related relief work. Ahmed starts his day at 5.30am and goes on till around 8 pm. “Since last year, we must have helped with the last rites of over 1,500 persons. There are days when we handle up to 20-25 deaths,” Ahmed said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/as-cases-surge-good-samaritans-lend-a-helping-hand-in-bengaluru-101621105264328.html
16-05-2021||India||Health dept to take over Bengaluru Covid fight from civic body: Govt||Bengaluru: The Karnataka State Covid Task Force has proposed to hand over Covid management in Bengaluru to the department of health and family welfare – so far handled by Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike – announcing major changes in Karnataka’s fight against the pandemic.“To make this a reality, certain technical issues need to be studied. A committee will be constituted to look into this and will be asked to submit the study report in the next meeting of the task force,” read a statement from the office of the deputy chief minister and Covid Task Force head, CN Ashwatha Narayan, on Saturday. The decisions come as Karnataka reported 3,500 Covid-related deaths between May 7 and 13, the highest in a week since the outbreak of the pandemic, an analysis of the health department data shows. The death toll in the second week of May was more than twice that of the first week. The state has reported more than 5,000 deaths this month, of which Bengaluru alone accounts for 2,700. The state reported 41,664 new cases on Saturday, taking the active caseload to 6,05,494. Bengaluru accounted for 13,402 new infections, taking its active cases to 3,66,791. As many as 349 fatalities were reported across Karnataka, which took the state’s toll to 21,434. Bengaluru’s toll due to Covid-19 jumped to 9,340, with 94 deaths being reported on Saturday, according to the state health department. The task force also decided not to allow home isolation in rural areas and slums of urban areas. All cases from those places will be admitted to Covid care centres (CCCs). “In rural areas, Covid care centres will be established at public health centre level. Rapid antigen test needs to be done at the doorstep in hot spots. In rural areas, arrangements for isolation and treatment shall be made in places, such as hostels. District commissioners will be entrusted this responsibility,” Narayan told reporters in Bengaluru. There are 207 community health centres of 30 beds each in the state. All the 30 beds in each of these centres will be converted into oxygenated beds. Out of these, 5 ICU beds and 5 HDU (high dependency unit) beds will be made available. In taluk hospital, 50 ICU beds will be made available. It was also decided to set up 100 ICU beds in district centres where medical colleges do not exist, the statement added. A 100-bed secondary hospital will be set up in each assembly constituency of Bengaluru and one tertiary care hospital for every 4 constituencies, the task force said. It was decided that in every district hospital, 100 ICU beds will be made available on a permanent basis. For this, required infrastructure and manpower need to be provided and all district hospitals should have oxygen-generating units. It was also decided that no one will be given the second dose of Covishield vaccine without finishing a mandatory 12 weeks. “With regard to administering vaccine for 18-44 age group, a new App needs to be developed and this will be interfaced with Cowin App and later the vaccination schedule will be prepared to take into account the availability of vaccines,” read the statement. Vaccination will be given outside hospitals in places, such as school grounds, and for each bed in government hospitals ₹10 will be given to facilitate timely disposal of waste. The task force has also approved ₹843 crore for calling a global tender for vaccines. “To study the changes in the genetics of viruses, it was decided to set up genome labs in six places in the state. Four will be from medical colleges and two will be from the health department,” said the statement from the deputy CM’s office. The government has also approved procurement of medicines and other consumables required for the next 90 days in a phased manner at ₹260 crore. At present, about 400 cases of Black Fungal are estimated per week and there is a shortage of the required drug. The Centre will be asked to provide 20,000 vials of the drug. The state will also set up oxygen bottling plants. “These will be set up in nine districts that do not have this facility. Oxygen generators of 200-300 litre per minute will be set up in community health centres. All the beds will be oxygenated in all taluk hospitals. To facilitate this, oxygen generators of 500-600 litre per minute capacity will be set up,” the statement said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/health-dept-to-take-over-bengaluru-covid-fight-from-civic-body-govt-101621104904290.html
16-05-2021||India||Deaths not linked to oxygen: Goa hospital dean||The dean of Goa Medical College and Hospital said on Saturday that the deaths that occurred in the hospital over the last five days were not necessarily linked to dropping oxygen levels.Dr Shivanand Bandekar said his hospital is a tertiary care centre where all referred cases come and where criticality is high. “Most of the patients die because of Covid pneumonia where oxygen is part of the treatment. So, we cannot directly say this (disruption in oxygen supply) is the reason why they have died, because if you see their CT severity score, they were all more than 20 (very severe),” Bandekar said. “But how do we prove that the interruption has caused (the deaths) ... you are trying to correlate ... last night eight patients died between 2am and 6am (when there was no reported drop in the oxygen supply).”The dean tried to explain how difficult the situation is, but also claimed that the hospital has risen to the challenge. “If you see the criticality of patients, I have 160 patients right now who are on ventilator, that’s why the consumption is more. The sudden spike had also brought a lot of surprises to us. We are trying to make that whole thing meet (ensure supply meets demand). We got concentrators in no time, we got cylinders, beds within no time and we are the centre where we cannot refuse any case,” Bandekar said, urging people to look at the “whole story”.The hospital made news for the wrong reasons after oxygen levels dropped for six consecutive nights, allegedly resulting in 75 deaths over four days. The matter went to the High Court of Bombay at Goa where the state government declared on Friday that logistical issues, not supply shortage, had resulted in the drop in oxygen.The health department has now claimed that with a new oxygen tank donated by a private player, the issue has been “sorted”. State health secretary Ravi Dhawan informed on Saturday that a cryogenic tank having the capacity of 20,000 litres of oxygen has been installed at the hospital, which will make the present system of supplying oxygen through trolleys redundant. “The supply of oxygen to this tank will be directly from the manufacturer M/s Praxair — the tank belongs to them. We should see a continuous supply of liquid medical oxygen through this tank as is done in all major hospitals anywhere,” Dhawan added.The hospital said it has also shifted more than 350 patients to a newly commissioned block that already has a tank installed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/deaths-not-linked-to-oxygen-goa-hospital-dean-101621104665363.html

16-05-2021||India||West Bengal enters lockdown mode as Covid-19 cases surge||The West Bengal government imposed several restrictions for the next 15 days beginning Sunday, entering a near-lockdown phase, to combat the spread of Covid-19 in the state. While all public transport – trains, buses and Kolkata Metro -- have been shut down, government and private offices closed, markets and retail shops selling grocery have been allowed to remain open from 7 am till 10 am, and emergency services have also been permitted. All outdoor activities at night including movement of people and vehicles between 9 pm and 5 am have been prohibited, except for health services, law and order and essential commodities. “Madhyamik (class X board exams) and Higher Secondary (Class XII board exams) scheduled in June this year are also being postponed. No exams would be held in June as schools and colleges are closed. Notification for the new schedule would be issued in due time,” said a senior state government official. Schools, colleges and universities have already been shut in the state since April 20. Sweetmeat shops have been allowed to remain open from 10 am to 5 pm, jewellery shops may remain open from 12 noon to 3 pm. E-commerce and home delivery of all commodities have been allowed. Earlier this month, the state government had shut down local trains, while allowing buses, trams and Kolkata Metro to run with 50% capacity. Government and private organisations were allowed to run with half the workforce. RT-PCR negative test reports have been made mandatory for anyone trying to enter Bengal.The daily count of Covid-19 cases has shot up exponentially in West Bengal since March this year. Experts have blamed it on the rampant violations of Covid-19 protocols at the countless election rallies held in the run-up to the assembly elections that ended on April 29. On May 13, the state registered 20,846 new cases up from 812 fresh cases reported on March 27, when the eight phase assembly polls began. The state now has 131,792 active cases. At least 136 people have died in the last 24 hours, according to official data. Movement of private vehicles, taxis and auto-rickshaws will be prohibited except to and from hospitals, vaccination centres, diagnostic centres and the airportOperations in tea gardens have been allowed with 50% strength, jute mills have been allowed to run with 30% strength. Marriage functions have been allowed but with a cap of 50 people, while funeral rituals may be held with a maximum of 20 people. Chief minister Mamata Banerjee, who assumed charge for the third consecutive time on May 5, had ruled out imposing a total lockdown. Banerjee’s younger brother Ashim Banerjee died on Saturday morning after being detected with Covid-19 last month. He was admitted at a private hospital in Kolkata. Balram Bhargava, head of the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), had said in a recent interview that lockdown restrictions should remain in place in all districts where the rate of infection is above 10% of those tested. Union health minister Harsh Vardhan had flagged the issue that some districts in the state were registering 40% positivity rate for the Covid-19 infection.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/west-bengal-enters-lockdown-mode-as-covid-19-cases-surge-101621104304913.html
16-05-2021||India||IIT-Kanpur to study impact of immersion of bodies on soil, water||Indian Institute of Technology (IIT)-Kanpur (IIT-K) is set to undertake a study to assess the adverse impact of immersion of bodies in rivers and their burial on river banks on soil and water, said Prof Vinod Tare, advisor to the National Mission for Clean Ganga (NMCG).The development comes in the backdrop of mass graves being discovered on the banks of the Ganga in Rae Bareli, Unnao, Kanpur, Fatehpur and Kannauj, and fears about possible contamination of water and soil if the bodies were those of Covid-19 patients.“We are going to study the impact of immersion of bodies and their burial on water and soil,” Prof Tare said, adding that the issue has been discussed at the NMCG level.“Immersing a Covid body in the Ganga would wash the virus, but it won’t be destroyed; you need different agents such as heat and others to destroy (it),” said Prof Tare, who is with the institute’s environmental science department and has been part of all top panels formed to rejuvenate the Ganga.Seeking a complete ban on immersion and burial on the riverbed, he said immersion was wrong from the religious point of view as well. The government should make arrangements in order to prevent the immersion of bodies, he said.All districts, especially the big ones, receive drinking water drawn from the Ganga and vegetable cultivation also takes place on the riverbed.Tare has issued an appeal for the people not to dump the bodies in the river or bury them close to it.Many graves have been found in Unnao, Kanpur and Kannauj in the last few days. The bodies were buried at less than two-to-three-foot depth. This has heightened the fear that these corpses would be washed away once the river rises.A unit of the State Disaster Response Force (SDRF), one platoon of Provincial Armed Constabulary (PAC) and jawans from river police would patrol the rivers on boats in these districts. Kanpur police commissioner Aseem Arun said the arrangement would be made in several districts. In Kanpur, a team would ensure that bodies were not immersed or buried along the river, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/iitkanpur-to-study-impact-of-immersion-of-bodies-on-soil-water-101621104004310.html
16-05-2021||India||CID names two Telugu TV channels in FIR; HC rejects MP’s bail plea||The Andhra Pradesh Police on Saturday named two Telugu television channels as co-accused in the sedition case filed a day ago against Kanumuri Raghurama Krishnam Raju, the rebel parliamentarian of the ruling YSR Congress Party.Raju was arrested by the state Crime Investigation Department (CID) from his residence in Hyderabad on Friday evening. His lawyers immediately moved a bail petition in the Andhra Pradesh high court, which rejected it on Saturday and asked him to move the lower court first.On Saturday evening, CID authorities produced Raju before the Sixth Metropolitan Magistrate Court in Guntur dealing with CID cases. The court remanded Raju to 14-day judicial custody late in the evening. It, however, said the MP should be sent to the hospital because of his health condition and that he should not be sent to jail, till his health condition improves.Raju, who represents Narasapuram Lok Sabha constituency in West Godavari district, was booked under Section 124-A (sedition) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC), for alleged comments against the Jagan Mohan Reddy government, damaging its reputation and inciting hatred among the people.The CID has also invoked Section 153 (b) (making comments causing communal disharmony or affecting national integration) and Section 505 (making statements with public mischief) against the MP.In the FIR, which was disclosed to the media on Saturday, the CID named two Telugu television channels – TV5 and ABN Andhra Jyothy, as co-accused in the case.The CID said the two media houses had conspired with Raju against the state government. “The two channels, by allowing pre-meditates and organised slots in their bulletins, have clearly shown that there was a meeting of minds of Raju with the heads of these media channels and all of them together conspired against the government,” the CID said in the FIR.“Raju did not restrict himself to fair criticism of the government, but made every attempt to create hatred, contempt disaffection towards the government with his words and visual postures provoking his followers to take up violence. They are seditious in nature,” the investigating agency said.The CID has charged Raju and the two channels with hatching a well-orchestrated conspiracy to create disaffection and to being contempt and hatred against the government. “They also instigated disharmony in public by creating a feeling of hatred on the grounds of caste and religion,” the FIR said.While the CID has arrested Raju, it has not taken any action against the media channels so far. Representatives of the two channels – TV5 and ABN Andhra Jyothy – refused to comment on the FIR.In his bail petition before the high court, Raju said he had been targeted for filing a case seeking the cancellation of the bail granted to the chief minister, who was involved in 11 cases registered by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) and also in money laundering cases.He sought bail pleading that he had undergone heart surgery four months back. However, the high court rejected his plea and asked him to first approach the lower court for bail.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sedition-case-cid-names-two-telugu-tv-channels-in-fir-hc-rejects-mp-s-bail-plea-101621103944235.html
16-05-2021||India||Bengal governor visits Nandigram, says ‘never heard of such violence’||Kolkata West Bengal governor Jagdeep Dhankhar turned emotional and could be seen wiping tears after meeting some of the alleged victims of post-poll violence at Nandigram in East Midnapore.The governor’s visit to one of the most high-profile assembly constituencies, where a tough electoral battle was fought between chief minister Mamata Banerjee and her protégé-turned-adversary Suvendu Adhikari, triggered a political slugfest between the ruling TMC and the BJP.“Unimaginable post poll violence @MamataOfficial Terrified people with difficulty and fear @WBPolice and reprisals at hands of ruling party workers narrate indescribable woes of horror. Appeal CM to take urgent steps to restore their confidence in the worst post poll violence,” Dhankhar tweeted.Dhankhar alleged that the violence was being sponsored, organised and condoned by the state.The governor visited some of the victims’ villages, sometimes by battery-driven rickshaw and sometimes on a motorcycle. He interacted with the villagers and some women could be seen wailing before him. Dhankhar could also be seen wiping his eyes more than once.“The state is passing through a very severe crisis of Covid-19 and unprecedented post-poll violence that is retributive and targeted. I never heard of such violence. I would appeal to the chief minister. It is high time that she took note of it. We are sitting on a volcano,” he said while adding that thousands of people had to abandon their homes in West Bengal and take shelter outside the state.On Friday, Dhankhar visited Assam’s Dhubri district and interacted with people who fled from their homes in Bengal following post-poll violence allegedly perpetrated by Trinamool Congress workers.“The governor interacted with the affected people for nearly an hour and inquired about their condition. At present we have 176 people at Ranpagli (relief camp) and nearly 30 more at another camp in the district. While some have returned to Bengal, these people are afraid to go back as their houses had been allegedly burnt. We are providing them food and other basic necessities. They can stay in Assam as long as they desire. If they wish to go back we will facilitate their return,” Anand Mishra, superintendent of police of Dhubri, said on Friday.The ruling TMC however said that the governor’s visit was motivated as he only visited the houses of BJP workers.“He (Dhankhar) has demeaned the governor’s chair by giving a call for change ahead of the assembly elections. The BJP lost because the people discarded them. Now he is moving around like an unsatisfied spirit and trying to disturb the peace,” said Kunal Ghosh, TMC spokesperson.The TMC supremo’s chief election agent at Nandigram Sk Sufiyan alleged that the helipad where the governor’s chopper landed was built by the BJP during the elections. The governor went to Nandigram in a BSF (Border Security Force) chopper.While the BSF refused to comment, senior police officials said that the helipad was already there and was built during the elections.“At least 24 BJP workers and supporters have been killed so far in poll-related violence. The BJP’s state headquarters have received more than 17,000 complaints from its workers and supporters of TMC’s torture and atrocities. BJP workers are not being able to return home as they are scared. Fresh violence was triggered in the villages where a team of the ministry of home affairs visited to take stock of the violence. The state should take care of the homeless people,” said Samik Bhattacharya, BJP spokesperson in West Bengal.He said the governor cried because he could not take the pain. “Anyone who sees such pain would cry,” Bhattacharya said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bengal-governor-visits-nandigram-says-never-heard-of-such-violence-101621103884274.html
16-05-2021||India||Bengal steps up curbs as surge continues||Kolkata: The West Bengal government on Saturday imposed several strict restrictions for the next 15 days staring from Sunday, virtually entering a near-lockdown phase, to combat the spread of Covid-19 cases in the state. The government also postponed Class X and XII board exams scheduled in June.While all conveyances – trains, buses and Kolkata Metro -- have been shut down, government and private offices closed and markets and retail shops selling grocery allowed to remain open from 7 am till 10 am, only emergency services have been allowed.According to state government’s order, all outdoor activities at night including movement of people and vehicles between 9 pm and 5 am have been prohibited, except for health services, law and order and essential commodities.“Madhyamik (class X board exam) and High Secondary (Class XII board exam) scheduled in June this year are also being postponed. No exams would be held in June as schools and colleges are closed. Notification for the new schedule would be issued in due time,” said a senior state government official. Schools, colleges and universities have already been shut in the state since April 20.Sweetmeat shops have been allowed to remain open from 10 am to 5 pm, whole jewelry shops may remain open from 12 noon to 3 pm. E-commerce and home delivery of all commodities have been allowed. Earlier this month, the state government had shut down local trains, while allowing buses, trams and Kolkata Metro to run with 50% capacity. Government and private organisations were allowed to run with half the workforces. RT-PCR negative test report have been made mandatory for anyone trying to enter West Bengal. Daily count of Covid-19 cases has shot up exponentially in West Bengal since March this year. Experts have blamed it on the rampant violations of Covid-19 protocols at the countless election rallies held in the run-up to the assembly elections that ended on April 29. On May 13, the state registered 20,846 new cases up from 812 fresh cases reported on March 27 when the eight phase assembly polls kicked off. The state now has 131,792 active cases. Officially 136 persons died in the last 24 hours. Till Friday, the state registered 1,094,802 Covid-19 cases and 12,993 deaths, according to the health department.Movement of private vehicles, taxis and auto-rickshaws will be prohibited except to and from hospitals, vaccination centres, diagnostic centres airports among others. While operations in tea gardens have been allowed with 50% strength, jute mills have been allowed to run with 30% strength. Marriage functions have been allowed but with a cap of 50 persons, while funeral rituals may be held with a maximum of 20 persons. Chief minister Mamata Banerjee, who assumed charge for the third consecutive time on May 5, had ruled out imposing a total lockdown. Banerjee’s younger brother Ashim Banerjee died on Saturday morning after being detected with Covid-19 last month. He was admitted in a private hospital in Kolkata. Balram Bhargava, head of the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), in a recent interview said that lockdown restrictions should remain in place in all districts where the rate of infection is above 10% of those tested. Union health minister Harsh Vardhan had also flagged the issue that some districts in the state were registering 40% positivity rate.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bengal-steps-up-curbs-as-surge-continues-101621103584281.html
16-05-2021||India||Gujarat rejects report on Covid-19 deaths, calls it bid to create fear||Twenty-four hours after a leading Gujarati daily reported that the government agencies gave away over 120,000 death certificates between March 1 and May 10, the state government issued a statement that the media was “creating wrong fears in the minds of people” and sensationalising the issue.Minister of state for home Pradipsinh Jadeja said at a press conference on Saturday morning, a day after the report by Divya Bhaskar, that it was “mischievous” to connect the number of deaths on the basis of death certificates with the Covid-19 pandemic.An official press statement by the minister in English stated: “When there is a death of a person in the family, death certificate is required for the bank insurance, LIC and other services. In such circumstances, we have developed an online process so that family members can obtain certificates at home easily. Death certificates are issued for various reasons, so we can not ignore the possibility of more than one registration for a person sometimes. Therefore, there can be a difference in the figure of death certificates issued and the number of deaths. As death is a serious matter and involves many rituals, it is possible that people might not register it at the same time. The time of death, registration and issuing of certificate are three different aspects. All these 3 things combined together to show death figures and analysis in the print media report is totally inappropriate.”Jadeja asserted, “When the number of cases is coming down, when the recovery rate is improving, the media should not create fears and panic among the people with such misleading reporting. Seeing the number of death certificates together with Covid-19 deaths is not presenting the right picture.”The minister, however, did not refute the report about the number of death certificates. Divya Bhaskar reported that from March 1 to May 10 the state issued 120,000 death certificates, while the number was 58,000 during the corresponding period in 2020. As against this, the officially admitted Covid-19 deaths (between March 1 and May 10 this year) were 4,218 in Gujarat.The state government has also not given an estimate on the annual average number of deaths in Gujarat during normal years.In response to the government’s denial, Divya Bhaskar’s Gujarat editor Devendra Bhatnagar tweeted in Hindi: “We have given the source of our data. Tell us on what basis you are refuting us. Please add the bodies cremated, those reaching the cemeteries, the homage advertisements in the newspapers and bodies brought out in ambulances in hospitals, you will get the truth of the death certificate numbers.”“The government! You will not tell the truth even now? These death numbers are from March to May 2021. If you can, make public the morbid and comorbid Covid-19 death numbers. The high court has also stated this,” Bhatnagar said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/guj-rejects-report-on-covid-19-deaths-calls-it-bid-to-create-fear-101621103524839.html
16-05-2021||India||2 firms, Gujarat institute to scale up Covaxin production||To ramp up the manufacturing of Covaxin, Bharat Biotech will transfer technology to two Ahmedabad-based companies and a state-run biotechnology research institute in Gandhinagar. A statement to this effect released by the department of biotechnology (under the Union ministry of science & technology) on Saturday informed that “technology transfer agreements have been finalised with all manufacturers”.Two of the manufacturers are Hester Biosciences, an animal healthcare company, and OmniBRx, a biotech company. The third, Gujarat Biotechnology Research Centre, is an institute under the state’s department of science and technology. Together, they are likely to add a production capacity of 20 million doses per month.The Centre had last month announced financial support to Bharat Biotech as well as three public sector undertakings to increase vaccine production to 100 million doses per month by September. A grant of ₹65 crore was given to Bharat Biotech’s new Bangalore facility to repurpose it for vaccine production. Another ₹65 crore was given to PSU Haffkine Biopharmaceutical Corporation in Mumbai to manufacture 20 million doses a month, ₹60 crore to Indian Immunologicals Limited-Hyderabad, and ₹30 crore to Bharat Immunologicals and Biologicals Limited in Bulandshahr to produce up to 15 million doses a month.Last week, top government advisor, Dr V K Paul of NITI Aayog, had said that the Centre and Bharat Biotech are willing to invite other companies to produce the vaccine. This was amid growing calls from experts to transfer the technology of the indigenously developed vaccine, the rights to which are jointly owned by Indian Council of Medical Research.But Paul insisted that Saturday’s announcement wasn’t influenced by the growing clamour for technology transfer even though some people have tried to make that connection. “Complex technologies cannot be transferred like this. It takes about 70 to 75 days for the vaccine to be manufactured. Bharat Biotech along with the government have transferred technology to the three PSUs. This is the outcome of those efforts,” Paul said at a health ministry briefing on Saturday.He added, “We have been trying to do this and we will keep assessing where else it can be manufactured, including other private players. This is not a vaccine that can be made in any laboratory. It deals with live virus and can only be done at Bio-Safety Level 3 labs so that it is not released in public.”India will need one and a half billion vaccine doses to inoculate its adult population. For this, it will have to rapidly enhance supply even as the second wave of the pandemic rages.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/2-firms-guj-institute-to-scale-up-covaxin-production-101621103524250.html
16-05-2021||India||Govt, people misread pandemic after first wave of Covid: RSS chief||Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) chief Mohan Bhagwat said on Saturday that both the government and the people misread the situation after the first wave of the coronavirus pandemic, which resulted in complacency leading to the present situation. The country now needs to face the problem with a positive frame of mind and people should help in whatever capacity they can, he said.Urging people not to give up, Bhagwat said just as Britain did not lose courage during World War II and withstood adverse conditions to emerge victorious, India should not lose hope and must view the pandemic as a challenge to be overcome.To underscore the need to face the challenge with a positive frame of mind, he referred to an inscription on former British premier Winston Churchill’s seat that read: “Please understand there is no depression in this house and we are not interested in the possibilities of defeat. They do not exist.”Delivering a lecture online, Bhagwat said, “Some people have died… they should not have died this way, untimely. But those who have passed away are in a way free and they don’t have to face it anymore… but we have to. We have to keep ourselves and our people safe and therefore we don’t need negationism. We can’t say nothing has happened, everything is alright. We are not saying that. Situation is hard and saddening, but while accepting that we are not going to allow ourselves to feel negative,” he said.The lecture is part of a “positivity unlimited” series that the RSS has initiated with an aim to help people overcome difficulties during the second wave of the pandemic that has ravaged the country. There has been severe criticism of the government for failing to prepare for the second wave and for deficiencies in meeting the demand for health care. Both the RSS and its political arm, the Bharatiya Janata Party, are pushing to shift the popular narrative towards “positivity and a proactive approach”.“If we get tired and give up, then we will be like the rat who gives up in front of a snake. We cannot let this happen. There is as much hope as there is unhappiness. In such a situation many wrongdoings happen, but a lot of people are doing good deeds, they are helping people in whatever capacity they can,” he said.Amid criticism that the government dropped the ball on Covid management, Bhagwat said now that scientists have cautioned about a third wave, arrangements should be made so that the country is well prepared.Urging people not to feel depressed or disillusioned, Bhagwat said hearing about the situation being bad every day should not demoralise us. He said the focus should be on helping people find beds in hospitals, oxygen and the other things needed. He also spoke about ensuing that students do not miss out on acquiring knowledge.“We have to worry about those who depend on daily wages, we should ensure that they do not go hungry. We should look around us and see what the problems are and help those in need,” he said, adding that the country will also need to start making arrangements to see how we can face up to the economic problems that will arise.“The challenge will test our good qualities...It is an exam of our patience. Success is not final, failure is not fatal. The courage to continue is the only thing that matters. We have to have the courage to continue,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-people-misread-pandemic-after-first-wave-of-covid-rss-chief-101621103404325.html
16-05-2021||India||Govt says Covid-19 situation stabilising but flags cases of black fungus||The overall Covid-19 situation in the country appears to be stabilising, the Union government said on Saturday, but experts also warned that secondary infections such as mucormycosis or “black fungus” were adding to the country’s mortality rate.Niti Aayog member Dr VK Paul said that to control the spread of the rare fungal infection, people must control their blood sugar levels, maintain hygiene, and doctors must prescribe steroids with caution. “Some states are reporting 400 to 500 cases; we do not know the burden of the disease yet. This is an emerging problem and ICMR (Indian Council of Medical Research) has started collecting data. We have also asked states to keep an eye on it,” he said.Black fungus cases went up 2.5 times last year between September and December across 16 centres in the country, according to Dr Arunaloke Chakrabarti, head of the department of microbiology at Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education & Research, Chandigarh. He is part of the Fungal Infection Study Forum and is one of the members who drafted the government advisory on mucormycosis.India’s Covid-19 positivity rate – proportion of samples that return positive – dipped from 21.9% last week to 19.8%, said Union health ministry’s joint secretary Lav Agarwal during the health ministry briefing on Saturday. A dropping positivity rate is indicative of slowing of the spread of infection, but experts urged caution.An increase in cases was seen in Tamil Nadu, which was a “cause of concern,” Agarwal said. Currently, 11 states have over 100,000 active cases, eight states have 50,000 to 100,000 active cases, and 17 have fewer than 50,000 cases, according to data shared by the official.Dr Randeep Guleria, director of the All India Institute of Medical Sciences, who was present at the briefing, said that there was a need to ensure good infection control practices in hospitals as there was an increase in secondary infections such as Covid-associated mucormycosis.Click here for complete Covid-19 coverageThere are at least 23 people with the infection currently admitted to AIIMS, of whom 20 are still positive for Covid-19, Dr Guleria said.Mucormycosis, also known as black fungus, has been seen among those who have uncontrolled diabetes, whose immunity is compromised or those who are given excessive steroids or immune-modulating drugs such as tocilizumab.According to doctors, if left untreated, it may kill 80% of those infected. If not detected early, it affects the orbit of the eye and the mouth, resulting in people losing their vision or jaw during debridement — the process of removing dead tissue from an infection or wound.“Covid-19 itself is a risk factor for the infection as it leads to the reduction in lymphocytes (white blood cells, one of body’s main immune cells), this increases the risk of opportunistic infections. There was a similar increase in fungal infections seen during the SARS outbreak too. The second risk factor is uncontrolled diabetes and the third is misuse of steroids (which suppress the immune system),” said Dr Guleria.He added: “Studies have shown that steroid given in those who have mild disease and are not on oxygen leads to more morbidity and mortality because of secondary infections.” The expert urged diabetics to keep their sugar levels in check and those who have been treated with steroids to monitor their blood sugar levels.He added that high doses of steroids were not required for the treatment of Covid-19 patients. “Mild to moderate dose is good and only for five to 10 days. Longer use of steroids also leads to poor control of blood sugar and increases the chances of fungal infections.”Other than the focus on the fungal infection, Paul also said that the country “managed” to deal with four million active cases, the case fatality ration (CFR) – the proportion of people who die among those who test positive – “remained stable”, and the improvement was faster than the previous wave.He said that a “narrative” was being created that the technology transfer for Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin happened because “certain people” said it should be done a few weeks ago.“There is a narrative that the tie-ups for Covaxin is being done after some people said it a few weeks ago. That is not the case. Complex technologies cannot be transferred like this. It takes about 70 to 75 days for the vaccine to be manufactured. Bharat Biotech along with the government has transferred technology to the three PSUs. This is the outcome of those efforts,” he said.He also said that the second “narrative” was that the duration between two Covishield shots was being increased to 12-16 weeks due to vaccine shortage. He said everyone should trust the experts in the National Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation (NTAGI), which had taken the decision based on data coming out of the UK, where the duration had been extended.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-says-covid-19-situation-stabilising-101621103346140.html
16-05-2021||India||Tauktae may intensify into ‘very severe cyclonic storm’, says IMD||The next 12 to 15 hours might see Cyclone Tauktae (pronounced Tau’te) become a “very severe cyclonic storm” with wind speeds reaching up to 145 km/hr, officials at the India Meteorological Department said on Saturday. They also mapped its likely trajectory and estimated it to move north-northwestwards and cross the Gujarat coast between Porbandar and Naliya around afternoon or evening of May 18.Sunitha Devi, who studies cyclones at IMD, said she spotted some similarities between the current cyclone and the one that hit Gujarat in 1998. Tauktae was a depression until Friday, when it intensified very rapidly into a cyclone — all due to various favourable atmospheric and oceanic conditions, said Devi.Independent experts have noticed cyclones intensifying over the Arabian Sea more frequently in recent years and say this is due to global warming pushing sea surface temperatures up. “Rapid warming has made the relatively cooler Arabian Sea (compared to the Bay of Bengal) a warm pool region that can actively support cyclone formation,” said Roxy Mathew Koll, a climate scientist at the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology. “Climate projections indicate that the Arabian Sea will continue to warm under increased carbon emissions, resulting in more intense cyclones in the future.”OP Sreejith, scientist and head, Climate Monitoring and Prediction Group at IMD Pune, said there were two more cyclones in the past with similar tracks. One blew from May 13 to 19 in 1933, the other between May 20 and 21 in 1975. The memory of Cyclone Amphan wreaking havoc in West Bengal last year is only too recent. So, Tauktae has worried the agencies, more so because there is already a pandemic raging, which could likely complicate evacuation and relief efforts.Before making landfall on May 18, the cyclone will move alongside the coastline, triggering very heavy rain at several places, experts indicated. “We are most worried about flash floods that it can trigger, creating devastation in places that are already battling Covid. Pre-emptive measures such as evacuations need to be adopted with great care, adhering to Covid protocols,” said Anshu Sharma, co-founder, Sustainable Environment and Ecological Development Society.He added that the authorities are bracing for impact. “We are ramping up support to local communities to interpret the warnings in their own hyperlocal contexts, and to take appropriate action. We are also pre-positioning our supply lines to extend relief support if required anywhere,” said Sharma.The sea will be choppy from May 15 until May 18 with phenomenal waves (up to 14 metres high) and wind speeds (up to 64 knots) along the coast of Kerala, Maharashtra, Goa, Karnataka, and Gujarat, with Gujarat likely to be the worst-hit. Met has warned that tidal waves of up to 3-metre height are likely to inundate coastal areas of Morbi, Kutch, Devbhoomi Dwarka, Jamnagar, Porbandar, Junagadh, Gir Somnath, Amreli, Bhavnagar and other coastal districts of Gujarat.Then there is rain to contend with. Kerala and Karnataka are likely to receive very heavy rain on May 16, with coastal and ghat areas of Karnataka getting extremely heavy rain (over 20 cm). Konkan, Goa and adjoining ghat areas might also get very heavy rain on May 16 and 17.Light to moderate rain is likely to occur in coastal districts of Saurashtra from May 16 afternoon, while heavy to very heavy rain might occur at isolated places in Junagadh and Gir Somnath districts on May 17. Over 20 cm rainfall might also occur at isolated places in Porbandar, Devbhoomi Dwarka, Jamnagar and Kutch districts on May 18. Parts of West Rajasthan are also likely to receive light to heavy rain on May 18 and 19.Already, gale winds with speeds up to 95 km/hr are blowing over east-central Arabian Sea and adjoining southeast Arabian Sea and Lakshadweep areas. From May 16 morning, this might go up to 145 km/hr.Squalls of up to 70 km/hr are hitting Karnataka, south Maharashtra, and Goa coasts; on May 16, Maharashtra and Goa coasts will see squalls of up to 80 km/hr.Squalls with speeds of up to 60 km/hr are likely over south Gujarat, Daman and Diu coasts on May 17, which, by May 18, will turn into gale winds of up to 175 km/hr. Off the Saurashtra and Kutch coasts (Devbhoomi Dwarka and Porbandar), gale winds of up to 165 km/hr will blow on May 18 morning, hitting Junagadh and Jamnagar districts too. Extensive damage is expected in these areas and in Amreli, Rajkot and Morbi districts.The Met department wants a total suspension of fishing operations in Gujarat and other states on the west coast. It has also asked for regulation of rail and road traffic and advised people to stay indoors.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tauktae-may-intensify-into-very-severe-cyclonic-storm-says-imd-101621103345606.html
16-05-2021||India||Aadhaar not must for treatment, vaccine: UIDAI||No one shall be denied vaccines, medicines, hospitalisation or treatment for want of Aadhaar number, the Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI), the statutory authority that issues 12-digit unique identification numbers called “Aadhaar” to Indian residents, said on Saturday.“Aadhaar should not be misused as an excuse for denial of any essential service. There is a well established exception handling mechanism (EHM) for Aadhaar and it should be followed to ensure delivery of benefits and services in the absence of Aadhaar. If a resident does not possess Aadhaar for some or the other reason, s/he must not be denied essential services as per Aadhaar Act,” the authority said in a statement.UIDAI issued the statement after a section of media reported that vaccination and few other essential services such as hospitalisation were being denied to residents for want of Aadhaar.An identification (ID) document is, however, required for getting Covid-19 vaccines. According to the Aarogya Setu app, people can register themselves for vaccination by using one of the seven IDs – Aadhaar number, driving licence, permanent account number (PAN), passport, pension passbook, NPR smart card and voter ID.In the pandemic situation, no one shall be denied any service or benefit in want of Aadhaar number, the statement said. “If one does not have Aadhaar or if Aadhaar online verification is not successful due to some reason, the concerned agency or department has to provide the service as per Section 7 of Aadhaar Act, 2016 and the Cabinet Secretariat OM dated 19th Dec 2017,” it said.While Section 7 ensures that there is no exclusion and no denial of essential services, the Cabinet Secretariat in 2017 clarified that the use of alternative means of identification is allowed for extending benefits and essential services to such Indian residents who do not posses Aadhaar or whose Aadhaar authentication is not successful.UIDAI said Aadhaar is meant to bring transparency and accountability in public service deliveries through effective use of technology, but there are exceptions. It said in case of any such denial, the matter should be brought to the knowledge of the higher authorities of concerned department.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/aadhaar-not-must-for-treatment-vaccine-uidai-101621103164197.html
16-05-2021||India||GST Council meet on May 28, tax waivers on medicines on agenda||The Goods and Services Tax (GST) Council will meet for the first time in seven months on May 28 to discuss key issues such as compensation to states and tax waivers on various medicines, medical devices, and health services amid the second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic, two officials said on Saturday.The office of finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Saturday tweeted the date and timing of the meeting. The move came after several states, including Punjab and West Bengal, raised the issue of an inordinate delay in convening the meeting, the officials aware of the developments said on condition of anonymity.“Smt @nsitharaman will chair the 43rd GST Council meeting via video conferencing at 11 AM in New Delhi on 28th May 2021. The meeting will be attended by MOS Shri @ianuragthakur besides Finance Ministers of States & UTs and Senior officers from Union Government & States,” a tweet from the finance minister’s office said.The GST Council is required to meet once in every quarter. Its meetings are convened by the finance ministry as the council is chaired by the Union finance minister. Finance ministers of states and Union Territories (UTs) are members of the council, the apex federal body on indirect tax matters.The last time the council met was on October 5, 2020 (the 42nd meeting) to resolve the issue of compensating states for their revenue shortfall in 2020-21. That meeting was extended to next week on October 12 for finalising a centralised borrowing mechanism to meet the revenue shortfall. After that, the council did not meet.Earlier this week, West Bengal finance minister Amit Mitra wrote to Sitharaman, asking her to convene the GST Council meeting immediately as states were expecting an alarming shortfall in GST compensation revenue because of the Covid-19 pandemic. “As per GoI [Government of India] projection, the shortfall was expected to be to the tune of ₹1,56,164 crores in 2021-22 without taking into consideration the impact of Covid Wave-2,” Mitra said in the letter to the finance minister. HT reported on the letter on May 14.Last week, Punjab finance minister Manpreet Singh Badal asked the Union finance minister to urgently convene a meeting of the council for a “serious mid-term correction” on tax issues. In his letter Badal said: “...failure to hold any constructive consultation with states for so long in such critical times makes me wonder whether Centre has usurped all the powers of states putting the spirit of cooperative federalism...”Besides full compensation to states, many members want GST waivers on several critical items necessary for people at the time of the pandemic, including vaccines, key medicines and health care services. These matters could be discussed at the council meet, the officials mentioned above said.Ranjeet Mahtani, partner at consultancy firm Dhruva Advisors, said the council needs to resolve other pressing issues such as inverted duty structure on certain products. “This has lingered as an issue for some time now,” he said. According to him, there is a need to rationalise GST rates and reduce the number of tax slabs by merging the 12% and 18% slabs into one revenue-neutral rate. He said compensation is also a key issue for states.At the time of introducing the new indirect tax regime in July 2017, the GST law assured states a 14% increase in their annual revenue for five years (up to 2022), and assured them that their revenue shortfall would be made good through the compensation cess levied on luxury goods and sin products such as liquor, cigarettes, aerated water, automobiles, coal and tobacco.The issue of compensating states for their revenue losses due to a 68-day lockdown and because of the first wave of Covid-19 came up in the previous fiscal year, when GST revenues plunged and there was a gap of over ₹1.10 lakh crore in the collection of compensation cess. The matter was resolved after the Centre agreed to raise back-to-back loans on behalf of states and compensated them for their shortfall in revenue.

16-05-2021||India||'Must ensure essential services': PM Modi reviews preparations on Cyclone Tauktae||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday reviewed preparations to deal with the impending Cyclone Tauktae, according to an official press note. The high-level meeting was attended by officials from the states, central ministries, and agencies concerned to deal with the situation arising out of the approaching cyclonic storm. Union home minister Amit Shah was also present.Also Read: India closely monitoring Cyclone Tauktae, no decision yet on shutting airportsWhile reviewing preparations over Cyclone Tauktae, Prime Minister Modi called for ensuring maintenance of all essential services such as power, telecommunications, health, and drinking water and their immediate restoration in the event of damages caused to them, according to a government state.Issuing an alert over Cyclone Tauktae, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) announced earlier this day that a deep depression over the Arabian Sea had intensified into the cyclonic storm was currently centered over Lakshadweep island. Tauktae (pronounced Tau’Te) is predicted to intensify further into a 'very severe cyclonic storm’ by Monday, with windspeed ranging between 150kmph and 160kmph. It is very likely to move north-northwestwards and cross the Gujarat coast between Porbandar and Naliya around 18th May afternoon/evening.Also Read: As Tauktae approaches west coast, know more about the storm and how to track itThe Union ministry of home affairs (MHA), under the direct supervision of Amit Shah, is reviewing the Cyclone Tauktae situation 24x7 and is in constant touch with the state governments and central agencies concerned, it was said. The home ministry has already released the first instalment of the state disaster relief fund (SDRF) in advance to all states, the press note read. NDRF has also pre-positioned 42 teams which are equipped with boats, tree-cutters, and telecom equipment in six states and has kept 26 teams on standby, it read.Prime Minister Modi said that concerned officials must ensure special preparedness on Covid-19 management in hospitals, vaccine cold chain and other medical facilities on power back up and storage of essential medicines and to plan for unhindered movement of oxygen tankers. He also said that special care needs to be taken to ensure that there is the least possible disruption in oxygen supply from Jamnagar and spoke about the need to involve the local community in timely sensitisation and relief measures, the prime minister's office (PMO) said.The India Meteorological Department (IMD) said at the meeting that Cyclone Tauktae is expected to touch the Gujarat coast between Porbandar and Naliya around May 18 afternoon or evening with a wind speed ranging up to 175 kmph.Cyclone Tauktae is likely to cause heavy rainfall in the coastal districts of Gujarat, including extremely heavy falls in Junagadh and Gir Somnath and heavy to very heavy rain at a few places in the districts of Saurashtra, Kutch and Diu, namely Gir Somnath, Diu, Junagadh, Porbandar, Devbhoomi Dwarka, Amreli, Rajkot, Jamnagar.The IMD also warned of storm surge of about two-three metre above astronomical tide to inundate coastal areas of Morbi, Kutch, Devbhoomi Dwarka and Jamnagar districts and one-two metre along Porbandar, Junagarh, Diu, Gir Somnath, Amreli, Bhavnagar and 0.5 to one metre over the remaining coastal districts of Gujarat, the statement said. The IMD has been issuing three hourly bulletins since May 13 with the latest forecast to all the states concerned.(With inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/must-ensure-essential-services-pm-modi-reviews-preparations-on-cyclone-tauktae-101621088126733.html
16-05-2021||India||Cyclone Tauktae likely to intensify into ‘very severe storm’, to cross Gujarat coast on May 18||Cyclone Tauktae (pronounced as Tau’Te) is likely to intensify into a ‘very severe cyclonic storm’ in the next 12 to 15 hours with a wind speed of 120 to 130 kmph gusting to 145 kmph, according to the India Meteorological Department.It is also expected to move north north-westwards and cross the Gujarat coast between Porbandar and Naliya as a very severe cyclonic storm around May 18 afternoon or evening.Tauktae intensified very rapidly from a depression to a cyclone on Friday. “The cyclone track is very similar to the 1998 Gujarat cyclone except that storm had crossed Kandla. We noticed rapid intensification of Tauktae because of various favourable atmospheric and oceanic parameters,” said Sunitha Devi, in charge, cyclones at IMD.Independent experts said rapid intensification of cyclones over Arabian Sea is linked to a marked rise in sea surface temperatures due to climate change. “The frequency and intensity of cyclones in the Arabian Sea have increased in recent years. This is because of the rapid warming that has made the relatively cooler Arabian Sea (compared to the Bay of Bengal) a warm pool region that can actively support cyclone formation. Climate projections indicate that Arabian Sea will continue warming under increased carbon emissions, resulting in more intense cyclones in the future,” said Roxy Mathew Koll, a climate scientist at the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology on Saturday.There were two more cyclones in the past with similar tracks according to OP Sreejith, scientist and head, Climate Monitoring and Prediction Group (CMPG) at IMD Pune. One in 1933 between May 13 to 19 and another in 1975 between May 20 to 21. The 1998 Gujarat cyclone had killed over 4,000 people.“Conditions are extremely favourable for its (Tauktae’s) rapid intensification. Ocean heat potential is above normal; sea surface temperatures are 1-2 degree C above normal… We should be prepared,” Sunitha Devi had said on Thursday when a low pressure area had formed over the Arabian Sea.Agencies are facing multiple challenges of maintaining Covid-19 protocol, evacuation efforts during a pandemic and the risks from Tauktae itself. Last year, super cyclonic storm Amphan had formed in the pre-monsoon season and crossed the West Bengal coast over Sundarbans on May 20. It claimed over 90 lives and about 4,000 livestock mainly in West Bengal. According to WMO, Amphan is estimated to be the costliest tropical cyclone on record in the North Indian Ocean with economic losses of approximately US$14 billion.“Cyclone Tauktae has arrived at an already critical time when Covid-19 cases are very high, and communities are struggling in most of our western coastal states. As the cyclone moves alongside the entire coastline, it will trigger very heavy rainfall in a number of places, till it finally hits land in Gujarat on May 18, as per current forecasts. While cyclones carry an image of strong winds, we are most worried about flash floods that it can trigger, creating devastation in places already battling Covid-19. Pre-emptive moves such as evacuations need to be carried out with great care, adhering to Covid-19 protocols such as social distancing and masking. We are ramping up our support to local communities to interpret the warnings in their own hyper-local contexts, and to take appropriate action. We are also pre-positioning our supply lines to extend relief support if required anywhere,” said Anshu Sharma, Co-founder, Sustainable Environment and Ecological Development Society.Sea condition over east-central Arabian Sea will be high to very high (9-14 metres wave height/38-63 wind speed in kts) on May 15 and very high to phenomenal (14 metres wave height /64 wind speed in kts) on May 16 and over northeast Arabian Sea on May 17 and 18.Sea conditions will be rough to very rough over Comorin area and along and off Kerala coast on May 15 and 16; very rough to high over east central Arabian Sea along and off Karnataka coast and Maharashtra – Goa coasts on both days. It is very likely to be very rough to high over northeast Arabian Sea along and off south Gujarat coast from May 17 morning and very high to phenomenal on May 18.Tidal wave of about 2-3 m above astronomical tide is likely to inundate coastal areas of Morbi, Kutch, Devbhoomi Dwarka and Jamnagar districts and 1-2 meters along Porbandar, Junagarh, Gir Somnath, Amreli, Bhavnagar and 0.5 to 1m over the remaining coastal districts of Gujarat, IMD has warned.There is likely to be heavy to very heavy rain over Kerala and Karnataka on May 16 and extremely heavy rain (over 20 cm) over coastal and ghat areas of Karnataka. Heavy to very heavy rain is also likely over Konkan, Goa, adjoining ghat areas on May 16 and 17.Light to moderate rainfall at many places is likely to commence over coastal districts of Saurashtra from May 16 afternoon, at many places with heavy to very heavy rainfall at isolated places over Saurashtra and Kutch and extremely heavy rainfall at isolated places over Junagarh and Gir Somnath districts on May 17 with extremely heavy rainfall (over 20 cm) at isolated places (Porbandar, Devbhoomi Dwarka, Jamnagar and Kutch districts) on May 18. Parts of West Rajasthan are also likely to record light to moderate rainfall at many places with heavy to very heavy rainfall at isolated places on May 18 and 19.Gale wind speed reaching 75–85 kmph gusting to 95 kmph is prevailing over east-central Arabian Sea and adjoining southeast Arabian Sea and Lakshadweep area. It is likely to increase over east-central Arabian Sea to 120-130 kmph gusting to 145 kmph from May 16 morning. Squally winds of 50-60 kmph gusting to 70 kmph along and off Karnataka, south Maharashtra and Goa coasts on May 15 and 16 and Gale winds speed reaching 60-70 kmph gusting to 80 kmph along & off Maharashtra –Goa coasts on May 16; squally wind speed reaching 40-50 kmph gusting to 60 kmph likely over northeast Arabian Sea and along and off south Gujarat; Daman and Diu coasts on May 17 morning which will gradually increase becoming gale winds reaching 150-160 kmph gusting to 175 kmph over northeast Arabian Sea from May 18 morning and along and off Saurashtra and Kutch coasts (Devbhoomi Dwarka and Porbandar) at 120-150 kmph gusting to 165 kmph over Kutch, Porbandar, Junagarh, Jamnagar districts of Gujarat on May 18 afternoon.Over Devbhoomi Dwarka, Kutch, Porbandar, Junagarh, Gir Somnath and Jamnagar districts of Gujarat extensive damage is expected on May 18. There could be total destruction of thatched houses or extensive damage to kutcha houses; some damage to pucca houses; threat from flying objects; bending/ uprooting of power and communication poles; major damage to kutcha and pucca roads; flooding of escape routes; minor disruption of railways; overhead power lines and signalling systems; widespread damage to salt pans and standing crops etc. Similar damage is also expected in Amreli, Rajkot and Morbi districts.IMD has said there should be total suspension of fishing operations in Gujarat and most states along the west coast; judicious regulation of rail and road traffic; people to remain indoors and movement in motorboats and small ships could be unsafe.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cyclone-tauktae-likely-to-intensify-into-very-severe-storm-to-cross-gujarat-coast-on-may-18-101621080484089.html
16-05-2021||India||Officials fret as Malana villagers refuse vaccine citing deity’s diktat||For two months, health care workers have been trekking 7km every alternate day of the week to reach the remote villages of Malana in Kullu district of Himachal Pradesh. Their aim: to take the Covid-19 vaccines to a remote corner of the country -- to the villages nestled in the Himalayas at an altitude of around 9,900 feet.But their efforts have been in vain.Not a single person in the two villages in Malana, with around 2,000 residents, has been inoculated yet. Health care workers say villagers, who believe they are the descendents of Greek king Alexander, repeatedly refused to get the jab because it is against their beliefs.The residents of Malana have followed their traditions for centuries now. Most decisions are taken by their own local governing bodies, but the local deity -- Jamdagni Rishi or Jamlu Devta -- has the final say.“I’ve been trying to convince the villagers, but they refuse citing the deity’s diktat. In 2015, it took me three months to convince mothers to get their children vaccinated (for newborns). But this time, not a single person in the village has come forward for vaccination and my attempts to convince them have proven futile,” said 35-year-old Nirmala Devi, an accredited social health activist (ASHA) who has been working in the Kullu district for several years and has been walking up from the nearest bus station in Jari to Malana for weeks now.Villagers in the area refused to comment on the matter.“Himachalis have faith in mystical powers of deities. The deity culture is a part of our daily life but at the same time the safety of people is of importance. Residents are reluctant to get inoculated but I’ll try to persuade them again,” Kullu legislator Sunder Thakur said on Friday.Panchayat secretary Tek Chand, too, said he has been trying to convince the villagers to get vaccinated since the government launched the drive for senior citizens in the first phase. But “they have immense faith in the deity and it’s difficult to convince them. I have tried to educate panchayat representatives during our meetings, but in vain,” he said.“The final decision will be taken by the village parliament. Its meeting is to be held shortly (next week). I’m trying to persuade residents too,” said panchayat pradhan Raju Ram.The Malana panchayat comprises two villages of Saura Behad and Dhara Behad and has a total population of 2,041 in 475 households, comprising 1,039 men and 1,002 women. The main occupation of villagers is sheep rearing and agriculture.LOCKED DOWNIndia’s second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic crept up to several regions that were previously unaffected, but Malana’s relative isolation has kept it from seeing a full-blown outbreak since the beginning of the pandemic.Early last year, the two villages banned more than 20 guest houses in their vicinity from operating. According to them, the local deity, Jamdagni Rishi or Jamlu Devta, had prohibited the entry of outsiders after the Covid-19 outbreak.The village also closed entry to outsiders a week before the first nationwide lockdown was enforced on March 25, and although the self-imposed restrictions have eased now, there are no tourists who visit.“We deputed people to guard the trails leading to our villages to restrict entry of tourist, we had eased them but now no outsiders visit the village,” Bhagi Rama, a Malana resident, said.So far, Malana has not recorded any Covid-19 case and death linked to the illness.NOT JUST MALANAIt’s not Malana alone, the vaccination drive in the entire Kullu district has been slower than other districts. Around 135,077 doses of the vaccine have been administered in Kullu so far, lagging behind Kangra’s 464,172, Mandi’s 352,285 and Shimla’s 278,041.Till Saturday evening, Himachal Pradesh administered a total of 2.2 million doses of the vaccine.Vaccination for the 18-44 age group is yet to begin, and will start only on Monday.“We are analysing the progress of vaccination in the state. Where people are reluctant, we will seek the help of motivators,” said Dr Gopal Berry, deputy mission director of the National Rural Health Mission.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/not-one-resident-in-hp-s-remote-malana-village-has-taken-vaccine-101621076463814.html

As the sea turned turbulent many coastal villages bore the brunt and several houses were damaged in Thiruvananthapuram, Kochi and Alappuzha. A 19-year-old youth was drowned in a swollen river in Mukkam in Kozhikode district.The whole state has been on high alert and nine teams of the National Disaster Response Force have been deployed in affected areas. Kerala has also sought the help of three armed forces. Some areas have received 40 mm rain in the last 24 hours.“We are facing a peculiar situation. In the midst of the fight against the Covid-19 pandemic, the cyclonic threat is posing an additional burden on us but we will overcome it,” said chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan adding the state is prepared to meet the fresh challenge posed by the cyclone. He said the army, air force and navy units were ready to help the state in case of an emergency.Reeling under the impact of Covid-19, it is a double whammy for many villages. In Kochi’s Chellanam where the test positivity rate is more than 50 per cent, high tides damaged at least fifty houses. Many people were reluctant to leave their homes fearing they would be infected. “We are literally between the devil and the deep sea. A perennial sea erosion area we have been seeking a strong sea wall for many years,” said resident Antony Sebastian who lost his three-roomed house.Overworked officials have set up separate relief camps for Covid-19 positive patients and health workers have been deputed to monitor their health condition. Authorities swung into action after the warning and opened many relief camps in coastal districts. Some of the rivers in Thiruvananthapuram and Kochi have filled to the brim due to the heavy downpour. The state had witnessed a massive flood in 2018 that claimed 400 lives.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-braces-to-meet-threat-of-cyclone-tauktae-101621015081701.html

16-05-2021||India||Low pressure area over Arabian Sea may turn into cyclone Tauktae on Sunday||The low pressure area over Lakshadweep and adjoining southeast Arabian sea is now lying as a well marked low pressure area over the same region. It is very likely to concentrate into a depression during the next 24 hours and intensify further into a cyclonic storm, Tauktae in the subsequent 24 hours. It is then likely to intensify further and move north-northwestwards towards Gujarat and adjoining Pakistan coasts and reach near Gujarat coast around May 18 evening. “We cannot rule out intensification similar to Super Cyclone Amphan. At present, it is difficult to say which category of intensification the cyclone will reach. But conditions are extremely favourable for its rapid intensification. Ocean heat potential is above normal; sea surface temperatures are 1-2 degrees C above normal and Madden Julian Oscillation (MJO) is also favouring rapid intensification. We should be prepared,” Sunitha Devi, in-charge of cyclones at India Meteorological Department had said on Thursday.Also Read | Major township project in Great Nicobar to impact turtle nesting sites, coralsUnder its influence, heavy to very heavy rainfall is likely at a few places over Lakshadweep during May 13 to 16 with isolated extremely heavy rain on May 13 and 14; heavy to very heavy rainfall is likely at a few places over Kerala during May 13 to 16 with extremely heavy falls (more than 20 cm) at isolated places on May 14 to 15; heavy to very heavy rainfall at isolated places over Tamil Nadu is very likely on May 14 to 16, with extremely heavy falls at isolated places on May 15; heavy to very heavy rainfall at a few places is likely over Coastal and adjoining ghat districts of Karnataka during May 14-17 with extremely heavy fall at isolated places on May 15.A Western Disturbance as a trough (area of low pressure) is affecting the western Himalayan region and a cyclonic circulation is lying over central parts of south Uttar Pradesh and neighbourhood and another cyclonic circulation lying over central Pakistan.
