The government has imposed an eight-day lockdown in Kerala to contain the surge. The state has reported another high recording 41,971 new Covid-19 cases with a test positivity rate (TPR) of 28.25 per cent on Saturday. Addressing the media through a virtual meet, the CM said the second wave was really challenging and the government will do everything possible to save lives. “Situation is really tough during the second wave. Though we are facing a shortage of doses we have started vaccinating people below 45 years. The government is keeping a strict watch on the oxygen situation and availability of hospital beds,” he said. In the morning he had a series of meetings with heads of various departments to spruce up the ongoing fight against the pandemic. Vijayan said during the first wave the state did a commendable job in tracing patients and quarantining them but during the second there was laxity on the part of everyone and this would have to be plugged. “Experts say in the second phase the virus strain is deadly. So we will have to take extra caution,” he said requesting people to remain at home and follow directives of the state health ministry in letter and spirit. Experts have warned recently that the double mutant variant or SARS-COV2 lineage B.1.617 has been found in Kerala. They said it was almost similar to the one reported in Maharashtra (Amaravati strain) and it was at least twice as infectious as earlier variants. Earlier the state had confirmed the presence of mutant strains from United Kingdom and South Africa. Experts have also warned that the double mutant variant is more dangerous than the UK and African variants. As Covid-19 cases surged the government imposed a complete lockdown as the weekend restrictions and curbs failed to check the rising graph. This will be extended till May 16 midnight and the government said it is likely to be extended further after gauging the situation. Around 25,000 additional policemen have been deployed to ensure adherence to lockdown norms. After testing 1.48 lakh samples 41,971 positive cases were detected with a TPR of 28.25 per cent. It also reported 64 fatalities taking the death toll to 5746. The total caseload has also risen to 4,17,101. Among those infected are 127 health workers. The growing infection rate among health workers is posing an extra burden on the overworked health system. Ernakualm district topped the infection list with 5492 cases, Thiruvananthapuram followed with 4560 and Malappuram with 4558 cases. Among the 20 worst affected districts in the country, five are in Kerala, according to Union health ministry statistics.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid19-situation-critical-says-kerala-cm-pinarayi-vijayan-as-tpr-climbs-to-2825-101620496149583.html
08-05-2021||India||As Covid cases in Maharashtra dip, state prepares paediatric task force||With daily Covid-19 infections gradually coming down in Maharashtra, the state government, according to reports, is now preparing for the third wave of the pandemic and, as the first step, setting up a paediatric task force for Covid-19 treatment of children.The government's principal scientific advisor, K Vijay Raghavan, recently said a third wave of the pandemic is inevitable, given the higher levels of the circulating virus, though he did not give any time frame. Explaining his comment, he later said that the wave is not unavoidable. If adequate precautions are taken and the virus does not get the opportunity to infect people, then there might not be any third wave. Even if it happens, it will not affect all places equally, Raghavan explained.Considering that the ongoing rage of the pandemic is the second wave, the first wave took place in India in September 2020, when daily cases breached 97,000-mark. As Maharashtra remained at the forefront of both the first and the second waves of the pandemic, the Maharashtra government is already on its toes to prepare for the third wave, which may come in around July-August, Maharashtra health minister Rajesh Tope has said.Though there is no scientific claim, many people are anticipating that the third wave may impact children. More than 1.30 lakh minors in the state have been infected by coronavirus during the second wave which began around February 15, as per official data, quoted by news agency PTI. "We will need new designs for isolation or treatment centres because generally mother has to stay with the child," Tope said"As we prepare for 3rd wave capacity building in Maharashtra, I met AMC Sanjeev Jaiswal ji to discuss the measures we've undertaken in Mumbai. I have suggested to him that we create a paediatric covid care ward anticipating the next wave and the demographic it may target," Aaditya Thackeray tweeted a few days ago.Along with paediatric covid care centre, another aspect we are now focussed on is to create a network of crèches for those parents who may have to be in covid care centres and may not have support to look after their children, that aren’t infected by covid. (2/n)"Along with paediatric covid care centre, another aspect we are now focussed on is to create a network of creches for those parents who may have to be in covid care centres and may not have support to look after their children, that aren't infected by covid," he added.From around 70,000 Covid-19 infections per day, Maharashtra is now registering around 50,000 cases per day as many districts have been able to bring the daily rise down, because of strict restrictions in place.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/as-covid-cases-in-maharashtra-dip-state-prepares-paediatric-task-force-101620493045260.html

The army plans to induct 800 women into the military police with a yearly intake of 52 women who will serve as personnel below officer rank. Currently, there are more than 9,000 women serving the army, navy and air force as officers, with the services giving them more opportunities to boost career progression. The headcount of women in the military has increased almost threefold over the last six years. The army will soon open the doors of its aviation wing to women officers. Until now, women officers were only carrying out ground duties in army aviation. The army’s aviation wing operates helicopters. The first batch of women officers will commence training to become pilots in July 2021. They will join front-line flying duties on completion of training in July 2022.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/army-inducts-first-batch-of-women-in-military-police-101620484389232.html

AIRF, since the beginning has been demanding parity between different cadres who are working 24x7 during this corona period and scarifying their lives. However, It is quite unfortunate that while other categories of front line workers viz medical staff, security forces, sanitation staff etc. are being paid ₹50 lakh as compensation but Railwaymen are being paid ₹25 lakh only."This is an absolute discrepancy and we request that it should be removed immediately by equalising the compensation of ₹50 lakh to boost the morale of Railwaymen as well as their families," Mishra said in his letter."We hope the benefits announced for other corona warriors will also be given to railwaymen. AIRF, has already raised this issue in details to the CEO/Chairman," he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rail-union-demands-parity-in-compensation-with-frontline-workers-in-case-of-death-on-duty-during-covid19-101620481414829.html

Like cigarette smoke spreading in a room, says expert||As the second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic rages across India, international health experts have warned that the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) is airborne but it does not mean that the virus is out there spreading through the air and anyone who goes outside will simply get infected by breathing.The United States Centers of Disease Control (CDC) on Friday issued a new advisory regarding the transmission of coronavirus disease (Covid-19) and highlighted that there are three primary ways in which a person can contract Covid-19. The CDC said that the virus spreads primarily by inhalation, deposition and touching. The CDC advisory says when one inhales the air carrying very small fine droplets or aerosol particles containing the virus, one gets infected.It highlights that the risk of transmission is greatest within three to six feet of an infected person as the amount of these droplets are very fine in nature. It said that these droplets spread through exhalation during activities such as quiet breathing, speaking, singing, exercise, coughing, sneezing and transmitting the infection.This means that in enclosed spaces or areas which are poorly ventilated there are increased chances of this disease spreading from one person to another. The CDC also pointed out that large droplets are not concerning as they disperse within seconds but fine droplets and aerosol particles which are formed when these droplets dry up can remain suspended for at least 30 minutes to 1 hour.Two medical health experts dealing with the Covid-19 second wave also told HT recently that being airborne does not mean that the virus is out there in the air.“Airborne does not mean it is in the air and wherever you are you can catch it. If there is Covid-19 positive person in a small room or an enclosed space which lacks ventilation and the person coughs, the aerosol remains suspended in the air for 30 minutes to 1 hour,” Dr Rommel Tickoo of Max Healthcare told HT on Friday.Another expert, Dr Ambarish Satwik, who is a vascular and endovascular surgeon at Sir Ganga Ram Hospital, said that one can imagine these aerosols as smoke cloud emanated from a person smoking. “If someone is smoking a cigarette in a corner of a large room, then you can smell the cigarette smoke standing in another corner of the room. This is how the virus is currently behaving. It is dissipating from one part of the room to another and if one person is infected in that room, it is likely that others sharing the same space will get infected if they are unmasked. Even if you enter a room where a person had smoked a cigarette an hour earlier, you still get the smell, so that is also another example of how the virus is behaving.”Both doctors also highlighted that people are still unaware of how to wear a mask properly. They also said that people are often surprised regarding how they contracted the virus. “Half the people do not know how to wear a mask, they think they have done whatever it takes but they go out for groceries or to the pharmacy, they meet people and they tend to fiddle with the mask and that is how they get it. It is not airborne to the extent that wherever you go you catch the virus,” Tickoo further added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/how-airborne-is-covid-19-like-cigarette-smoke-spreading-in-a-room-says-expert-101620476402795.html
08-05-2021||India||India surviving on system created by Nehru, Indira Gandhi: Shiv Sena editorial||In a hard-hitting editorial in its mouthpiece 'Saamana', the Shiv Sena on Saturday criticised the Modi government for "failing" to handle the Covid-19 pandemic situation of the country. At a time when India is trying to become 'Aatmanirbhar', it has to seek help from smaller countries like Nepal, Sri Lanka, the editorial said."In clear terms, India is surviving on the system created by Nehru-Gandhi. Many poor countries are offering help to India. Earlier, countries like Pakistan, Rwanda and Congo used to get help from others. But due to the wrong policies of today's rulers, India is going through that situation now," it said, as reported by news agency PTI.PM Modi speaks to Maharashtra CM Thackeray over Covid-19 situation in state"The country is presently surviving thanks to the development works, projects set up by and the confidence given by the previous governments of Pandit Nehru, (Lal Bahadur) Shastri, Indira Gandhi, Rajiv Gandhi, P V Narasimha Rao, Manmohan Singh," it said.The editorial also mentioned the government Central Vista project, the work of which is going on amid the pandemic as it has been declared an essential service. Talking about the global pandemic situation, the Sena said that the world now fears India as India has left the US and Brazil far behind.

Therefore, every officer concerned should ensure that special vigilance is kept on every village and for this, a massive Covid-19 screening campaign should be conducted,” the CM told officials at a review meeting.He said a special awareness campaign-cum-counselling of rural inhabitants should be done and for this officers of Health Department, along with accredited social health activists (ASHAs), former and present public representatives in each village have to play a key role.“Further strengthening of medical infrastructure along with ramping up Covid-19 management preparations coupled with aggressive surveillance, stringent containment, focused clinical management should also be done in every village on a priority basis," directed the chief minister.Khattar directed that about 8,000 multidisciplinary teams led by trainee doctors, including Health Department officials, ASHAs and Anganwadi workers should be constituted across the state for the door-to-door screening in villages.“If during the screening camps, any person is found having Covid-like symptoms, then the person should be advised to stay in home isolation immediately so as to prevent the possibility of the infection spread. Approximately one team per 500 households should be deployed for conducting the health screening,” said Khattar.He said while conducting the screening, the multidisciplinary teams should ensure that the patients having mild and moderate symptoms are immediately given preventive medicines.Besides, it should also be ensured that those having severe symptoms are immediately hospitalised, he added.The chief minister said since the infection is spreading fast in rural areas, screening camps focusing on “test, track and treat” should be held.Besides, the Health Department has also been directed to impart necessary training to people in villages so that they can spread the required awareness against the disease, he added.“Awareness campaigns along with proactive information education and communication (IEC) activities, especially in rural areas, should be started,” he said.The chief minister directed that the possibility of converting dharamshalas and government schools into isolation centres should be explored at the earliest.He said if the patient rush in the Covid care centres and hospital increases, then the dharamshalas and government schools having required medical facilities to treat the Covid-19 patients can be utilised.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/haryana-govt-to-launch-door-to-door-covid-19-screening-drive-for-villages-101620478981396.html

Doctor explains||Amid the ongoing second wave of the pandemic, as states are conducting a higher number of Rt-PCR tests, people are now aware of a new term, called CT value, a score written on the RT-PCR report, if the outcome of the test is positive. According to ICMR documents, CT value is the cycle threshold value, which is "inversely proportional" to viral load, which means the lower the number higher the viral load and vice versa. But the value can differ from one kit to another and the viral load does not have much role in patient management, the ICMR has said.#कोरोना जांच में सीटी वैल्यू 28 होने का क्या अर्थ है ?#IndiaFightsCOVID19 | #Unite2FightCorona @PIB_India | @MIB_India | @PrakashJavdekar | @shashidigital pic.twitter.com/SWWaEgbocXDr Hemant Deshmukh of Mumbai's King Edward Memorial Hospital has said if the value is over 35, then it is considered a negative result and when the value is below negative, the result is considered positive. The number suggests the number of cycle after which the virus has been detected. So in general, if the CT Score is, for example, 20, it means the virus is spotted in 20 cycles, thus implying that the load is higher than a score, for example, 30.'1 CT scan is equivalent to 300 chest X-rays', Guleria warns against risk of cancer"But whatever the value is, be it 10 or 28, an infected person can spread the virus," Dr Deshmukh said.What is CT Scan score?कोविड में सीटी स्कैन को कैसे समझें ?#IndiaFightsCOVID19 | #Unite2FightCorona @PIB_India | @MIB_India | @PrakashJavdekar | @shashidigital pic.twitter.com/Ej0vTBp2AhDr Deshmukh said doctors may advise CT Scan if a patient does not get cured of fever or cough after medicine. A CT scan score of 5 out of 25 is considered normal. "If the score is more than that, then the doctor may advise to get hospitalised. But sometimes, even if a patient has a higher CT Scan score, he or she may not have any inconvenience. "Nowadays people are googling a lot and becoming doctors themselves. But regarding CT scan, one should take the doctor's advice," Dr Deshmukh said.AIIMS chief Randeep Guleria recently said Covid-19 patients should not rush for CT scan as it increases the risk of cancer. One CT scan is equivalent to 300 to 400 chest x-rays, Dr Guleria said adding that people with mild covid-19 and normal oxygen saturation should not do CT scan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/what-does-ct-value-in-rt-pcr-report-mean-doctor-explains-101620476310089.html

Many states are closing the entry of residents of other states. We have also decided to impose strict lockdown in the state from Monday. This time, the infection is spreading at a rapid pace in rural areas and among the youth.” In another tweet, he said, “To control this infection, a strict lockdown will be in force for 15 days across the state from Monday. It is the duty of all of us to uphold our civic responsibilities and fully abide by this lockdown so that Rajasthan can be saved from the pandemic.” Gehlot said Rajasthan is in a better position than other states. “If you support the government, we will be able to beat Corona as soon as possible.” On May 6, in view of a surge in Covid19 cases, the Rajasthan government announced a lockdown from May 10 till May 24, and a ban on marriages till May 31.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ashok-gehlot-calls-for-decision-on-lockdown-at-central-level-101620475028214.html

Around 67 patients are being treated for the same in the Ear, Nose and Throat (ENT) ward of BJ Medical College and 45 of them are scheduled to undergo surgery, Dr Kalpesh Patel, associate professor in the hospital told news agency ANI on Saturday.“There's been a rise in cases of mucormycosis in Covid patients for the last 15-20 days. Currently, 67 patients are in the ENT ward alone. Of which, 45 are yet to undergo surgery. We're conducting 5-7 operations daily,” said Dr Patel.Mucormycosis is a rare fungal infection that is found in immunodeficient patients. Last year too, the country witnessed an outbreak of this fungal disease in Covid patients who have recently recovered. Dr Manish Munjal, a senior ENT surgeon at the Sir Ganga Ram Hospital, told PTI last year it caused the loss of eyesight and removal of jaw bone in many patients in the national Capital.Niti Aayog member (Health) V K Paul told on Friday said there is "no big outbreak" of mucormycosis in the country and the disease mostly ails patients with a pre-existing condition like diabetes. Diabetics who have been subjected to immunosuppressive medicines during Covid-19 treatment or have cancer run the risk of contracting it.“It, to a large extent, is happening to people who have diabetes. It is very uncommon in those who are not diabetic. There is no big outbreak and we are monitoring it," Paul said at the press briefing."Mucormycosis attacks people with uncontrolled sugar. Other than that, if the diabetes patient is taking immunosuppressive medicines, steroids, or has cancer, then the impact of mucormycosis is more on that person. If these patients are exposed to wet surfaces, then the chances of getting this disease increases," he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mucormycosis-on-rise-in-covid-19-patients-in-ahmedabad-says-doctor-101620468857557.html

This will mark the resumption of trade talks that were stalled in 2013 because of differences on key issues such as market access and mobility of professionals.The two sides will also launch a connectivity partnership based on their shared approach to transparent and sustainable initiatives.“The meeting is also an opportunity to give a new impetus to trade and investment negotiations between the EU and India,” the article said.“It is the right time to resume negotiations toward an ambitious and balanced trade agreement capable of acting as a key driver for sustainable growth and jobs creation, both for India and Europe. Apart from everything else, an EU-India agreement would send a powerful signal to the world in support of the benefits of international trade cooperation,” it added.Modi and Costa said a similar rationale applies to investment, and the “negotiation of an EU wide investment protection framework would provide greater stability and certainty to companies from India and EU to expand their presence in each other’s markets”.They noted that EU-India relations have always been marked by mutual support and solidarity, and this was evident during the coronavirus pandemic when both sides supported each other and the rest of the world. “India extended medical supplies to Europe earlier and now the EU has extended assistance to India as it experiences a second wave of Covid-19,” the article said.The summit will be “crucial to rebalancing relations between the EU and the Indo-Pacific”, and it is key for both sides to “reaffirm our firm belief in democracy, rule of law, tolerance and the universality and indivisibility of human rights”, the leaders wrote.“We must seize this opportunity to elevate our relationship, using the huge potential of our democratic spaces to advance trade and investment ties and to support effective multilateralism and a rules-based order,” the article said.The summit is also a chance to expand cooperation in new areas for the development of societies and economies, such as the digital transition, connectivity, mobility, health, the energy transition and climate action, it added.The EU is India’s biggest trading partner and the second-largest destination for Indian exports. Trade between the two sides increased 72% in the last decade and the EU is the leading foreign investor in India. Some 6,000 European companies are present in India, generating 1.7 million direct and five million indirect jobs.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-portuguese-counterpart-underline-significance-of-india-eu-summit-101620466447607.html

In his three-line tweet, he said he would continue as a soldier of the BJP to restore West Bengal's democracy. Concoctions and conjectures (of Mukul Roy attempting to come back to the Trinamool Congress) can be put to rest, he said."My fight would continue as a soldier of BJP to restore democracy in our state. I would request everyone to put the concoctions and conjectures to rest. I am resolute in my political path," Mukul Roy wrote, dousing speculations that were doing the rounds in the political circle of West Bengal after Trinamool won 213 seats in the 294-member Assembly election.Reacting to the assertion of his commitment to the party, BJP president JP Nadda said Mukul Roy's statement is an example for all BJP workers. मुकुल राय जी का यह बयान बहुत ही सराहनीय है।यह वक्तव्य सभी का मार्गदर्शन करने वाले और सभी भाजपा कार्यकर्ताओं के लिए अनुकरणीय है। https://t.co/2TdxrGucRaMamata says Centre's inactivity over past 6 months led to current Covid crisisMy fight would continue as a soldier of BJP to restore democracy in our state. I would request everyone to put the concoctions and conjectures to rest. I am resolute in my political path.Mukul Roy is one of the 77 MLAs that the BJP will be sending to the Bengal Assembly, as Roy, for the first time in his political career, won an election from Krishnagar North. Roy who was the number 2 in the Trinamool Congress for a long time left the party in 2017 and was credited for BJP's performance in Lok Sabha Elections 2019.At Friday's meeting of the new BJP members in the Assembly, both Mukul Roy and Suvendu Adhikari were missing, though both of them were present at the Assembly as they took oath as MLAs. The speculation of Mukul Roy engaging in parleys with Trinamool leaders got triggered after Roy reportedly exchanged pleasantries with Trinamool's Subrata Bakshi. Mukul Roy, though considered a tall leader of the BJP in Bengal, has so far not commented on BJP's performance in the Assembly election. Mukul Roy's son Subhanshu lost from Bijpur on BJP ticket.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mukul-roy-says-he-will-remain-a-bjp-soldier-conjectures-can-be-put-to-rest-101620464495833.html

08-05-2021||India||Covid-19: Gujarat govt urges Centre to raise oxygen allocation to state||The Gujarat government has requested the Centre to raise to 1,400 metric tonnes the allocation of medical oxygen to the state by May 12, saying that due to the shortage of the life-saving gas, it was unable to operationalise 11,500 additional beds for Covid-19 patients.It said that the Centre's current allocation of 975 metric tonnes (MT) is way below the requirements of the state."The Government of India has not increased the allocation of (medical oxygen to) Gujarat beyond 975 MT, which is creating tremendous distress to the patients seeking hospitalisation and oxygen therapy, resulting in denial of medical treatment to needy despite availability of beds and qualified personnel in hospitals," Gujarat chief secretary Anil Mukim said in a letter to Union home Secretary Ajay Kumar Bhalla.The letter written on May 6 was annexed to an affidavit that the state government filed on Friday in the Supreme Court, which was hearing a suo motu PIL on issues related to Covid-19.There is an immediate demand of 1,190 MT liquid medical oxygen in Gujarat, Mukim said.The total number of oxygen beds (in the state) have gone up from 53,913 on April 26, when the additional allocation was sought, to 57,368, due to an increase in Covid-19 cases, the letter said.Accordingly, Gujarat's requirement of medical oxygen has gone up from projected 1,250 MT (as on April 30), to 1,400 MT for today (May 6) and is likely to increase to 1,600 tons by May 15, Mukim said in the letter.Despite mobilising additional oxygen from all ASU/PSA plants, etc, the state is not able to meet the rising demand for oxygen and as a consequence, is not able to operationalise additional 11,500 beds, created with oxygen line, just for want of oxygen, he added.This is causing tremendous distress in rural areas, because now the COVID-19 cases are picking up there and yet, hospitalisation with oxygen therapy is not available resulting in long wait before the hospital admission, the letter said."Under these circumstances, I request you to immediately enhance allocation of medical liquid oxygen under central allocation to Gujarat to 1,200 MT for today (May 6) and 1,400 MT for May 12," Mukim said.Meanwhile, in the same affidavit, the state government said that it has administered 2,24,749 doses of Covid-19 vaccine to 18-44 age group till May 5, and orders have been placed for two crore doses of Covishield from Serum Institute of India in Pune, and 50 lakh doses of Covaxin from Bharat Biotech in Hyderabad on April 25 for that purpose.As far as timeline for vaccination of the 18-44 age group is concerned, it depends on the availability of the vaccines, it said.The state is maintaining continuous contact and follow-ups with the manufacturers for the early supply of vaccines, it said.For people above the age of 45, as total of 3,95,920 doses of Covishield and 2,00,490 doses of Covaxin are available, the government said.In terms of bed availability for Covid-19 patients, there were 1,05,701 beds across 2,446 institutions as on May 6, out of which 59,186 are oxygen beds and 13,733 are ICU beds. There are 6,407 ventilators in Gujarat.The number of beds was 42,000 in the first week of April, it said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid19-gujarat-govt-urges-centre-to-raise-oxygen-allocation-to-state-101620463501727.html

The two officers had already recovered from Covid-19 infection and the entire delegation boarded the flight to London with negative RT-PCR report including minister Jaishankar. Even at the airport, the rapid antigen of all the delegates came negative but an RT-PCR of two officers showed positive before the G-7 meeting on May 5.While Jaishankar decided to move virtual after the positivity report, and British Prime Minister Boris Johnson personally thanked him for that, the second RT-PCR report of the two officers came negative. However, keeping up with protocols, the entire delegation tested four times during the trip and returned safely to India on Friday night.Good to be back home, all of us having tested negative for Covid. These are difficult times and false alarms do happen. Thank those who sent their good wishes.Despite the scare, Jaishankar met US Secretary of State Tony Blinken, South African foreign minister Naledi Pandor and UK home secretary Priti Patel physically while all the other meetings were held virtually with the UK government providing secure communications to the Indian delegation.According to official sources based in London, the four big ticket items on the G-7 meeting were: Covid-19 and vaccine; Indo-Pacific, Reliable supply chains and reliable technology and Climate Change.Also Read | G7 meet: 2 Indian delegation members test positive for Covid-19 in LondonWhile India and South Africa were able to convince the US Secretary of State for an IPR vaccine waiver for the larger good of the world as the virus could not be confined geographically, all the G-7 members were seen converging on the Indo-Pacific with EU and UK the latest to join the band wagon in support of rules based open seas and navigation.Significantly, the India-UK bilateral virtual summit also saw the Boris Johnson government recording a strategic shift on issues including trade and investment as well as Indo-Pacific. The EU putting the trade and investment agreement with China on a back burner was not lost to the G-7 club as well as the position of the European consortium on Indo-Pacific.There was significant movement recorded by the G-7 ministerial on building reliable supply chains and reliable technologies for future handling of pandemics in order to ensure no single country can exercise veto in times of crisis. Foreign minister Jaishankar encouraged other G-7 players to take advantage of Modi government’s product linked incentive scheme and shift factories to India for transparent supply chains without any attached conditions. This issue was discussed in details in a trilateral with Japanese and Australian Foreign Ministers with Jaishankar.Another significant issue that was discussed was climate change at the G-7 ministerial with India making it clear that it was open to green goal objectives as long as the rich and developed world kept the green resources window open.On a bilateral front, India and UK recorded huge forward movement on trade and investment as well as convergence on Indo-Pacific goals with Jaishanker and Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal signing three agreements with the Boris Johnson government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/g7-closes-ranks-on-indo-pacific-reliable-tech-and-vaccine-ipr-101620449986960.html

08-05-2021||India||US govt doing everything it can to help India fight Covid-19: Official||The US government is making all the efforts to help India in this hour of crisis, a senior State Department official has said.In the last one week, six air shipments of vital assistance have landed in India, which is battling the second wave of the coronavirus pandemic, Senior Advisor Ervin Massinga from the Bureau of South and Central Asian Affairs said on Friday.These flights included health supplies such as oxygen concentrators, N95 masks, rapid diagnostic tests and medicines. US assistance is expected to be about USD 100 million, he said."The entire US government – from President Biden to our team at the Embassy and consulates on the ground – is doing everything we can to help India," Massinga said during an event called "Bolstering US Covid Relief Efforts in India: Perspectives from the Diaspora"."We are bringing to bear the strength, innovation, and unique capabilities of the American people to assist those suffering in India. And we recognise that the pandemic will not be over for anyone until it is over for everyone,” he said.Massinga referred to the recent remarks of US President Joe Biden when he told Prime Minister Narendra Modi that his government will do everything possible to help India at this time.Biden's discussion with Modi last week marks their fourth conversation in the administration’s first 100 days.Secretary of State Tony Blinken and other senior Department officials have also been regularly engaged with their Indian counterparts to address the most recent coronavirus wave, Massinga said."In my 26 years with the Department of State, I have never seen such an outpouring of personal and institutional generosity as we have experienced from the Americans of all backgrounds in the last month. The level of focus and dedication from private sector, civil society and community-based organisations, including contributions from Indian-Americans, has contributed to ensuring much needed supplies and resources get to those most in need,” he said.USAID Deputy Assistant Administrator for Asia Anjali Kaur said the whole-of-US government response has been immediate, targeted to India’s evolving needs and informed by nonstop consultations with their Indian counterparts and a multitude of other stakeholders.Kaur said the US has mobilised its partners in India to immediately expand existing programs to meet urgent needs."For instance, as hospitals across the country ran out of oxygen and related supplies, within days of receiving a request from the Government of India, the USAID quickly mobilised funding to purchase 1,000 oxygen concentrators. These life-saving units, with a lifespan of more than five years, will provide oxygen to hundreds of primary health care facilities,” she said."The USAID is also supporting the Government of India’s efforts to establish 150 Pressure Swing Adsorption oxygen generating plants, which will allow 150 healthcare facilities to generate their own oxygen, rather than rely on oxygen deliveries,” she addedThe USAID, she said, has received an overwhelming response from both US and Indian companies, as well as the Indian diaspora.Even individual states, such as California, have responded by partnering with USAID to facilitate a donation of life-saving oxygen supplies, Kaur said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/us-govt-doing-everything-it-can-to-help-india-fight-covid-19-official-101620439288074.html
08-05-2021||India||‘Variant of concern’: UK raises vigil on India-linked mutations||UK health officials on Friday labelled a coronavirus variant first found in India a “variant of concern” and said it appeared to spread at least as readily as the one they found last year, which went on to trigger new waves of Covid-19 and force several countries into lockdown.New data seen in India too suggested this may be true. As per the latest genome sequencing data shared by Indian labs with the global repository GISAID - B.1.617.1 and B.1.617.2 accounted for 58% of all samples submitted in the last 30 days.The B.1.617.2 is one of three lineages of the B.1.617 variant that is expanding its footprint in India, with experts fearing it may be behind the relentless surge in cases that has crushed the country’s health care system.Public Health England on Friday announced it has found B.1.617.2 to have spread in Britain in a way similar to the early days of B.1.1.7, which is now known as the UK variant.Cases of the B.1.617.2 variant increased to 520 from 202 over the last week, PHE said, mainly in London and the northwest town of Bolton, with almost half the cases related to contact with a traveller.“I think we’ve got to be very careful about that,” UK PM Boris Johnson told reporters, in reference to the variant, Reuters reported. “We’re doing a huge amount, obviously, to make sure that when we do find outbreaks of the Indian variant that we do surge testing, that we do door-to-door testing.”PHE cited evidence that it spreads more quickly than the original version of the virus and could spread as quickly as the B.1.1.7.“There is currently insufficient evidence to indicate that any of the variants recently detected in India cause more severe disease or render the vaccines currently deployed any less effective,” PHE said in a statement.According to an analysis of GISAID genome sequencing data on outbreak.info, Bihar, Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand have reported high numbers of the B.1.617.2 variant, with Bihar also reporting several samples with B.1.617.1.This analysis, to be sure, is based on the data uploaded to GISAID, and may not reflect the entire scale of the outbreak or how these variants are displacing others.The original variant first seen in India, B.1.617, was first detected in October, but PHE as well as Indian experts have categorised three different subtypes, all with slightly different mutations.Other variants of concern include variants first identified in Kent, southeast England, as well as South Africa and Brazil.The B.1.617 has also been classified as a VOC and the Union health ministry on Wednesday said the variant was found in 1,504 samples that were sequenced, compared to 1,391 samples that showed the UK variant.The fresh clues will have several implications for India: a variant that is more transmissible will require stricter curbs such as lockdowns for containment and countries are likely to keep arrivals from India suspended until the outbreak is controlled.But to understand more of how it has behaved, experts have urged Indian authorities to release details of when and where samples with the variant was found, which could help determine if it is indeed displacing other variants.Experts said the UK data confirmed the B.1.617.2 may be fitter. “The rate of growth of B.1.617.2 against B.1.1.7 seems to be similar to the rate at which B.1.1.7 replaced the previous variant. This means relative fitness of B.1.617.2 vs B.1.1.7 may be similar to the relative fitness of B.1.1.7 vs previous variants,” said Deepti Gurdasani, an epidemiologist Queen Mary University of London, in a tweet.“This is concerning because we have seen how quickly a new more transmissible variant can change the shape of the pandemic and how quickly these can spread. Currently, B.1.617.2 appears to be doubling every week, so it may become dominant in some parts of the UK in 2-4 weeks,” she added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/variant-of-concern-uk-raises-vigil-on-india-linked-mutations-101620435497724.html
08-05-2021||India||Modi govt firm to help West Bengal fight Covid-19: Health minister Harsh Vardhan to Mamata Banerjee||With West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee seeking a uniform vaccination policy for the country, Union Health Minister Harsh Vardhan on Friday assured her that the Modi government was firm in its resolve to help the state fight the Covid-19 pandemic, but also flagged more than 40 per cent positivity rate in some districts of the state.In a four-page letter addressed to her and posted on his Twitter timeline, Vardhan congratulated Banerjee for her victory in the recently held assembly elections and also asked her to focus on conducting more tests to detect infections in the state.Referring to her letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi on "further requirements for Covid-19 management in West Bengal", the minister said the Centre has been supporting each and every state "not just financially, but also through requisite diagnostics, therapeutics, medical devices and other essential materials and services".He further flagged a high positivity rate of over 40 per cent in some districts of West Bengal and asserted that testing needed to be significantly ramped up."Similarly, we will need to augment the health infrastructure in the state significantly," he wrote.The letter came on a day when the West Bengal government moved the Supreme Court seeking directions to disband Phase-III vaccine policy of the Centre and adoption of a uniform policy of procuring 100 per cent doses of Covid-19 from vaccine manufacturers for equitable distribution to all the states and Union territories for free decentralised distribution.The state government also sought setting aside the differential pricing mechanism for Covid-19 vaccines and capping the price for the vaccines at a uniform price of ₹150 per dose.The plea in the apex court followed letters written by Banerjee to Modi on various requirements listed by her for fighting the Covid-19 pandemic.Vardhan, in his letter, also said that the objective of the Covid vaccination program launched by the central government is to ensure that all citizens of the country are covered eventually, dividing them into priority age groups based on their vulnerability and mortality risk."In accordance with the demand raised by the states, the New Liberalized Pricing and Accelerated National Covid-19 Vaccination Strategy, which has just kicked off, decentralises the process and incentivises the manufacturers to produce more. Equally, it encourages off-shore vaccine manufacturers to bring their vaccines into our country, thereby increasing the overall availability of the vaccines in India," the letter stated.He said the Centre will continue to provide Covid-19 vaccine free to all the states/UTs, including West Bengal, for coverage of healthcare workers, frontline workers and persons above 45 years of age calculated on the basis of the average consumption of the state.As on date, West Bengal has been provided a total of 1,18,83,340 vaccine doses. Further 2,00,000 vaccine doses are in the pipeline for immediate supply, he said.Based on the monthly production of vaccine manufacturers and Central Drugs Laboratory cleared doses projected to be available with the vaccine manufacturers, the quantity of doses available for "other than Government of India channel" was worked out on state-wise population of 18 to 44 years pro-rata.The Union health ministry has so far provided West Bengal with 18.38 lakh N95 masks, 4.84 lakh PPE kits, 1,245 ventilators and 43.5 lakh Hydroxychloroquine tablets for management of Covid-19 pandemic, Vardhan pointed out.As many as five Pressure Swing Adsorption (PSA) plants have been sanctioned for the state, out of which, two have already been installed and made functional. Similarly, 849 D-Type and 1504 B-Type oxygen cylinders have been allocated to West Bengal. Out of this, 700 will be delivered on or before May 21. This entire support has been provided free of cost, he said.Vardhan added that as many as 94,400 vials of Remdesivir have, accordingly, been allocated to West Bengal for the period April 21 to May 9. The Centre has, in addition, delivered another 3,686 and 4,402 vials of Remdesivir in two tranches between May 4 and May 5, he said.“Meanwhile, all steps are being taken to ensure increased availability of domestic Remdesivir in the country. On the Tocilizumab front, the Union government is making all efforts for equitable availability across the country, based on the active case load in each state,” read the letter.Apart from the delivery of essential medical devices and drugs, West Bengal has been supported with a financial grant of ₹295.28 crore under the Covid-19 package, it said.Vardhan also highlighted that West Bengal has been allocated 308 MT of oxygen to meet the demand of oxygen from April 25 onwards."In this regard, we had allocated the maximum possible amount to West Bengal at the time of the issue of the aforesaid order. Once the allocations are made, states are required to lift the allocated quantities from the assigned manufacturers," he said.“… orders for oxygen cylinders have been placed for an additional 1,27,000 cylinders on April 21. The said procurement includes 54,000 jumbo cylinders (D type) as well as 73,000 regular cylinders (B type). Under this initiative, a tentative allocation for West Bengal is 849 D-Type and 1504 B-Type cylinders. Out of this, 700 cylinders will be delivered to the state on or before May 21,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/modi-govt-firm-to-help-west-bengal-fight-covid-19-health-minister-harsh-vardhan-to-mamata-banerjee-101620432008660.html

Cost of Central Vista is about ₹20,000 crore, over several years. GoI has allocated nearly twice that amount for vaccination! India’s healthcare budget for just this year was over ₹3 lakh crore. We know our priorities. There are hundreds of projects being executed by various depts. Governance hasn’t come to a standstill, unlike the Congress’s times of policy paralysis,” Puri tweeted.Also read | Consider urgent hearing of plea against Central Vista project: SC tells Delhi HCThe minister’s tweet came hours after Congress MP Rahul Gandhi criticised the Modi government for executing the project, terming it a “criminal wastage”, while asking the dispensation to focus on people’s lives during the pandemic.“Central Vista is just another ongoing project. It’s only the Congress that’s obsessed about it, nobody else. Moreover, only projects for New Parliament Building & rejuvenation of Central Vista Avenue have been awarded at an estimated cost of ₹862 crore & ₹477 crore respectively till now,” Puri added in a series of tweets.Earlier this week, the proposal for the new Vice President’s estate, and Prime Minister’s house were granted environment clearance by the environment ministry’s expert appraisal committee (EAC). The overall cost of project, which also includes a common Central Secretariat, has been estimated at ₹13,450 crore.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/opposition-discourse-against-central-vista-bizarre-says-minister-hardeep-puri-101620424662687.html

But just by reading a patent, does not necessarily offer the ability to replicate the product or the process, because while a patent does share a lot of the generic information, it protects the specifics, and it is not a self-guide,” said Prabuddha Kundu, co-founder and managing director at Premas Biotech, which is working on an oral Covid-19 vaccine.To understand the challenge, consider the case of some coronavirus vaccines: AstraZeneca and J&J’s vaccines involve a bio-engineered adenovirus that expresses the Sars-Cov-2’s spike protein; Novavax’s vaccine consists directly of the spike protein that has been cultured and grown in moth cells in labs.“A chemical entity and a biological entity are very different. Even a simple protein, for example, is hundred times more complex or has more components than a drug like, say, paracetamol. There can be many ways to make paracetamol, and it would turn out to be exactly that but even if there were few ways to produce the protein, the final product varies in its final shape and form,” added Kundu, who is a biomedical engineer by training and specialises in scaling up.And for that, he added, “you must understand the process so well, that every time you carry it out, you end up with exactly the same product. In many situations in biologics, the process is the product. So when patents are filed for a product or part of the process, it is to protect the geographical rights or commercial interest but in no way are we being provided with a to -do guide for how to do it”.Legal experts in the pharma field said this constitutes know-how, which often is a trade secret. “There is a clear divide between a patent and a trade secret. The technical know-how is proprietary. TRIPS provides for protection of undisclosed information, which would not be found in patents,” said Dev Robinson, partner and head, Intellectual Property, at Shardul Amarchand Mangaldas.Also read | India to seek EU support on vaccine patent waiverTRIPS refers to the Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights agreement under the World Trade Organization (WTO), the specific framework that India and South Africa have sought waivers under – which has been backed by the United States and France as on May 6.In an interview with HT published on March 26, Cipla chairman Yusuf Hamied too called vaccines “a different ballgame”, and said producing these was different from what the company did with an HIV drug in early 2000s, when it offered it to the world at a fraction of the cost.“All drugs required for HIV-AIDS were synthetic drugs, and in the synthesis of drugs, India, even at that time, was quite proficient. But vaccines are a different ballgame. You can pick up a patent of a vaccine manufacturer, and you still won’t be able to produce,” he said.The conversation around patents has been in the spotlight as the world struggles to make access to vaccine equitable. The wealthiest 27 regions in the world account for 10.5% of the population, but 35.6% of vaccinations, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.Robinson added that securing a patent waiver in itself will be a long process and may do little to make the know-how available quickly. “How you can get private companies to part with trade secrets under changes to TRIPS agreement in the immediate future? I don’t know. The TRIPS agreement is still a treaty at the end of the day – what you have to do is get every member to agree, or at least by majority, to have it adopted.“Then each of these countries or the country of interest will have to take it back to their local legislative bodies where they will have to turn it into a municipal law, only then will it become enforceable against a private party. It doesn’t happen overnight. Historically, it has taken years to get this thing done,” he said, adding that a short term solution may “therefore lie in getting the cooperation of the private players to part with their know-how and to not assert their IPRs”.Analysts said the production of coronavirus vaccines till now has demonstrated the complicated challenges that these processes involve, and they are particularly harder for breakthrough technologies like the mRNA platform.“There is a very big difference between vaccines and medicines. For vaccines, ingredients, formula etc are very important but equally important are the production and quality setup and the personnel needed to oversee that. We have actually seen where the number of staff required for quality checks is in a 10:1 ratio because it is a biological product,” said Rasmus Bech Hansen, CEO of London-based science analytics company Airfinity.With Covid-19 vaccines, Hansen added, “you could argue that yes freeing patents would make sense but as we have seen with vaccine production, that really does not seem to be the bottleneck – it’s not so much the number of facilities but the ability for them to produce vaccines and the quality that has mattered”.A second Airfinity analyst cited some examples. “Till now, we have seen more production from fewer sites than the other way around – mostly due to difficulties in setting up. For example, AstraZeneca set up plenty of sites all around the world, some of which we haven’t seen open up yet – for example, there are sites in Australia and Europe have been behind schedule,” said Caroline Casey.Kundu agreed with the assessments. “The analysts are right in saying that not only do you need duly trained manpower who should have done this before, but you need adequate equipment, tools and critical reagents to tell, if you are on the right path or not,” he added.Kundu said that patents can also involve other patents, or a family of patents, complicating efforts to wade past licensing restrictions, as well as a principle known as freedom to operate (FTO) for any recipient of a patent to have the legitimate rights to commercialise a product that is created using a wide variety of components, that may involve other proprietary components.“That said, opening of IP can be beneficial on the long run to cater to a global crisis. The nuts and bolts have to be worked out,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/patent-waivers-alone-may-not-lead-to-quick-vaccine-access-say-experts-101620422052701.html

A total of 401,358 new infections were reported on Friday, taking the cumulative number of confirmed cases in India to 21,886,256, according to HT’s dashboard. The highest ever single-day death toll was reported in the US on January 12, when it reported 4,490 fatalities.While some of the areas that were among the first to be hit by the second wave -- such as Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Telangana and Delhi -- appear to be seeing a stabilisation in new Covid-19 cases, deaths continue to remain high.Of Friday’s 4,192 deaths, Maharashtra recorded 898, the highest among all states and Union territories, followed by Karnataka (592), Uttar Pradesh (372), Delhi (341), and Chhattisgarh (208). The 592 deaths in Karnataka were an 80% increase from Thursday’s toll of 328, the highest jump among all major states.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/daily-deaths-hit-4-000-india-3rd-to-cross-grim-landmark-101620419228246.html
08-05-2021||India||Won’t put lives at risk: SC rejects Centre plea||The Supreme Court on Friday said it “will not put the people of Karnataka in the lurch”, and turned down a plea by the central government seeking a stay on a Karnataka high court order that directed it to immediately increase the supply of medical oxygen to the state from 962 metric tonnes (MT) per day to 1,200 MT per day.Karnataka had more than 536,641 active Covid-19 cases till Friday, and its medical infrastructure has been struggling handle the spike in the ongoing second wave of infections.“It is a well-calibrated and judicious exercise of power by the high court. It is not an arbitrary order but based on adequate reasons. The high court order is a well-considered order... We will not keep the people of Karnataka in the lurch by interfering with this order,” a bench of justices Dhananjaya Y Chandrachud and MR Shah told the Central government, represented through solicitor general Tushar Mehta.Discomfited by the remarks of the bench, Mehta retorted that the Centre was willing to “walk out” of the oxygen allocation process if the high courts were willing to decide the quantity of oxygen each state should get. “We are willing to give the entire quantity of oxygen to the high courts. Let high courts distribute it. We will be out,” said the SG.Also read | SC warns of coercive action if Delhi’s O2 quota not metThe bench, however, replied: “That may not be the correct attitude. We understand the issues involved and we are constituting a committee that will go into the criteria of allocation. But that does not mean that our high courts will shut their eyes... and will not say anything even if people are suffering.”At this, Mehta sought to persuade the bench not to record statements in the court order on the quantity of oxygen demanded by the Karnataka since the Union government was going to resolve it through talks. He also urged the bench to add that the Karnataka high court order should not act as a precedent for other high courts to also start passing order on allocation of oxygen by Centre to the respective states.But the bench told Mehta that the high court order was based on the norms laid down by the Centre’s own expert committee on the requirement of oxygen on the basis of active cases and the number of beds available. “You may have difficulty in procuring the oxygen but the 1,162 MT per day is the requirement of Karnataka based on your own norms,” it told the SG.In its order, the bench recorded that while the allocation was increased to 856 MT to 965 MTs from May 5, the minimum requirement of the state, as projected by the state government on May 5 was 1162 MT per day.“The order of the High Court is based on the need to maintain at least a minimum requirement as projected by the state government until a decision on the representation is not taken. Hence, without enquiring into the wider issues sought to be raised at this stage (and keeping them open) there is no reason to entertain the special leave petition,” the order stated.Watch | ‘Covid third wave may not happen if we take strong measures’: Dr K VijayRaghavan﻿It added that the high court has furnished adequate reasons for issuing a calibrated ad-interim (temporary) direction without precluding a mutual resolution by the Centre and Karnataka government.On May 5, the high court, while hearing a public interest litigation by Mohammed Arif Jameel, recorded a statement of Karnataka’s additional chief secretary that the requirement of oxygen in the state was likely to go up to 1,792 MT by May 5, and directed the state government to submit a representation to the Centre in this regard. It further ordered that till this representation was considered, the Centre will supply 1,200 MT of oxygen per day to the state.Challenging this order before the top court, the Centre said that such a direction by the high court will “have a cascading effect and result in the total collapse of the system” in its fight against the ongoing second wave of the coronavirus disease.“I welcome the Supreme Court order and it is a good thing for Karnataka. If we get 1200 mt, then we can comfortably manage the situation,” Jagadish Shettar, Karnataka’s minister for large and medium industries said. He said that the number of cases is increasing and , we would need 1700 mt of oxygen.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/wont-put-lives-at-risk-sc-rejects-centre-plea-101620417724827.html
08-05-2021||India||Second wave spreading much faster in rural India than first||The second wave of Covid-19 in India has gained traction in the country’s vast rural hinterland, where health care infrastructure is weaker than in urban areas, at a much faster rate than it did during the first wave of the outbreak, shows data analysed by HT.During the first wave, urban areas contributed a majority of new infections in India every month for five months from March 2020 – the first month when India detected a locally transmitted case of the infection – to July 2020, before rural areas started contributing more new cases than urban areas. In the case of the second wave, which started in February, this has taken just two months.In March, rural areas, where 73% of the country’s population resides, contributed a little over a third (34.3%) of new infections compared to 48.2% contributed by urban areas, where 14% of India’s population lives (the rest came from areas with mixed urban and rural population).Also read | Third wave of Covid inevitable, says governmentIn April, rural areas contributed close to half (44.1%) of all new cases, compared to 40.8% contributed by urban areas.In the first four days of May, rural areas have contributed 1.39 times the number of new cases as urban areas. The only months in which rural areas contributed more cases than urban areas before this was last year, between August and October, and then again in December.To be sure, in terms of new cases reported per month per million population, urban areas have always stayed ahead of rural areas, and are still ahead currently. In April, urban areas reported 4.9 times the cases per million population compared to rural areas. This number for May was 3.8 until May 4. This could, however, be on account of lack of access to testing in rural areas.For the purpose of this analysis, India’s 700-plus districts have been classified into three categories on the basis of rural population share: urban districts (less than 40% rural population), rural districts (more than 60% rural population, and mixed districts (40%-60% rural population). District-level data on Covid-19 cases were compiled by How India Lives.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/second-wave-spreading-much-faster-in-rural-india-than-first-101620416984127.html
08-05-2021||India||SC warns of coercive action if Delhi’s O2 quota not met||The Supreme Court on Friday reproached the central government for not supplying 700 metric tonne (MT) of medical oxygen to Delhi every day, warning it of “coercive steps” if there is any deficit in the future.The remarks came after the Capital received 527 MT of oxygen on Thursday, lower than the 730 MT is received the day before. The city is estimated to require at least 700 MT to sustain the critical care patient load and consistently lower supplies have caused several hospitals to reduce the number of beds, officials have said.“We have been very clear that you have to give 700 MT to Delhi every day. We said it in our earlier order and also clarified this yesterday (Thursday). Don’t drive us to a situation where we have to take firm and take coercive steps,” the bench of justices Dhananjaya Y Chandrachud and MR Shah told solicitor general Tushar Mehta, who appeared for the Centre.The strictures came after senior counsel Rahul Mehra, representing the Delhi government, made an urgent mentioning before the court about shortage of oxygen supply between Thursday and Friday despite the court’s categorical directive that the city must get 700 MT every day till the order is either reviewed or modified. Mehra said Delhi received only 527 MT oxygen by Thursday midnight.The bench reminded the S-G that it was repeated several times by the court during the proceedings on Thursday that the Centre will have to keep supplying 700 MT to Delhi unless the order is modified.Also read | World’s largest cargo plane carries three oxygen plants to India from UK“Mr Solicitor, please note that when we say 700MT has to be supplied to Delhi, it does not mean it is only for one day. Tell your officers that it is not acceptable. We clarified yesterday also that till the further orders, you have to supply 700 MT. We made it very clear. Whenever the committee gives its report on allocation, we will see. But you cannot give it only one day to assuage us and say ‘chalo de diya ek din’ (we have given it one day),” it told the law officer.Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal said on Thursday that Delhi can add 9,000 to 9,500 more beds for Covid-19 patients if the Union government continues to send 700 MT of medical oxygen. In addition to the Supreme Court and the government, the Delhi high court has also asked the Union government to ensure the city gets adequate amount of medical oxygen.The bench also expressed displeasure at the Centre’s note in the court on Thursday wherein the supply of oxygen to Delhi was conditioned on availability of containers and tankers.“Yesterday when we saw your affidavit it said oxygen will be supplied but there were caveats and explanation about containers and tankers. We don’t want to get into it. We are not drivers of your containers. We will not get into it at all,” justice Chandrachud remarked.As the S-G sought to give an explanation, the court retorted that it is being made clear again that the Centre must give 700 MT oxygen to Delhi every day. “We are going to clarify this in our order again. We will see what the committee that we are going to form has to say about your allocation plan but till that time, it has to be 700 MT per day,” it added.While Delhi received 730 MT oxygen on May 5, the note submitted by the Centre in the court on Thursday also laid down a projection of oxygen supply from May 6 to May 14. The chart, reviewed by HT, shows that Delhi is expected to get 700 MT oxygen only on May 10 and May 14 whereas the quantity will be less on all other days. Moreover, the Centre has maintained that the supply is contingent on availability of containers.Watch | Covid update: Kamala Harris pledges more US aid to India; CoWIN’s 4-digit codeDuring the hearing on Thursday, the bench looked at these numbers and told the S-G that it was inclined to set up a committee which will go into the Centre’s oxygen allocation plan that needed a “revamp” for having missed the “most obvious points of considerations” regarding need of the states. It had also said that the Centre must continue supplying 700 MT oxygen to Delhi in the meantime.On May 2, the top court directed the Union government to ensure 700 MT of medical oxygen is supplied to Delhi every day. On May 5, the bench reiterated its order when the Centre approached it with a plea for suspending the contempt proceedings initiated by the Delhi high court against them over deficit in oxygen supply.The apex court had stayed the contempt proceedings, but not before clarifying that this is contingent on the Union government’s admission that the court order of May 2 required the Centre to supply 700 MT of oxygen to Delhi until further orders. It had also asked the Centre to submit a plan in the court by Thursday morning detailing how this target would be met, including logistical details, following which the note mentioned above was submitted by the S-G.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-warns-of-coercive-action-if-delhi-s-o2-quota-not-met-101620415842814.html
08-05-2021||India||Bengal poll rout divides Left Front leaders, alliance with cleric under scanner||After being completely routed in the battle between the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the Trinamool Congress (TMC) in the West Bengal polls, a section of leaders in the Communist Party of India (Marxist), or CPI(M), and its partners in the state Left Front have questioned the election strategy the Marxists followed and the alliance they formed with cleric Abbasuddin Siddiqui’s Indian Secular Front which was formed barley two months before the polls.The issues raised a storm at a closed-door meeting of the Left Front partners on Thursday when the CPI(M) was accused of thrusting its decision to have ISF as an ally on the smaller Left parties without any elaborate discussion.For the first time, the Bengal assembly has no Left and Congress MLA. This is in sharp contrast to the CPI (M)’s victory in Kerala. The CPI (M) was an ally of the Congress and the ISF and contested the polls as part of the Samyukta Morcha (united front). The only Morcha candidate to win is Nausad Siddiqui, Abbasuddin Siddiqui’s brother who contested the Bhangar seat in South 24 Parganas district.Of the 292 seats where polls were held, TMC bagged 213 while BJP won 77. Polls in the remaining two seats, where two candidates died of Covid-19, will be held later.Three senior CPI(M) leaders, who lost the polls, have questioned the alliance with ISF. They are Ashok Bhattacharya, the former urban development minister who lost the Siliguri seat, Kanti Ganguly, another former minister who lost the Raidighi seat in South 24 Parganas and Tanmoy Bhattacharya, who lost the North Dumdum seat in North 24 Parganas.“The leadership has to accept the responsibility. The alliance with the ISF must be reviewed. Did people accept it? Those who impose decisions from the top must be accountable,” said Tanmoy Bhattacharya.“The leadership has to explain the reason for our defeat,” said Ganguly.“It is evident that all Muslim votes went to the TMC. We did not get any,” Asok Bhattacharya said in Siliguri, referring to the leadership’s belief that ISF might erode the TMC’s Muslim vote bank.Even young leaders of the CPI(M) could not make it. For example, Jawaharlal Nehru University’s Left students’ union president Aishe Ghosh, a nationally known face, lost from Jamuria in West Burdwan district.Nausad Siddiqui feels that ISF should not be blamed for the defeat of the Left candidates.“We campaigned hard for candidates of all parties and poll results show that in many seats vote share of the Left nominees went up in comparison to their tally in the Lok Sabha polls in 2019. All I can say is that I will represent the Samyukta Morcha at the assembly,” he told HT on Friday.A month before the eight-phase polling began, the alliance with ISF, an unprecedented move by the Marxists, raised disturbing questions not only in the Left Front and the Congress but rattled senior members of the Siddiqui family at the famous Furfura Sharif mausoleum in Hooghly district as well. Pamphlets, asking people to vote for TMC, were distributed at Furfura Sharif. In Hooghly, the BJP faced defeat.On March 2, shortly after Abbasuddin Siddiqui appeared for the first time alongside Left and Congress leaders at the CPI(M) rally in Kolkata’s Brigade Parade Grounds, signs of discomfort appeared on several faces on the dais.A senior leader of the Left Front disclosed to HT that barely 12 hours before the rally, Forward Bloc, the party freedom fighter Subhas Chandra Bose formed in 1939 after quitting the Congress and which is a part of the Left Front, refused to attend the mega event because Siddiqui had been invited.“Naren Chatterjee, the Forward Bloc state secretary, wrote a letter to Front chairman and senior CPI(M) leader Biman Bose seeking proof of the ISF’s secular credentials. Three leaders of the Bloc took the letter to the CPI(M) office at Alimuddin Street. Bose called up Chatterjee and somehow convinced him to attend the rally,” said the Left Front leader.Leaders who attended the Left Front meeting on Thursday said Chatterjee once again raised sharp questions on the alliance and even suggested that there was no point in having the Left Front if the CPI(M) takes all decisions unilaterally. Chatterjee refused to comment.A member of the CPI(M) state committee, who did not want to be named, said there are many in his party to whom the idea of allying with a religious leader goes against the fundamentals of Marxist ideology.“In 2006 Subhas Chakraborty, one of our most popular leaders and minister was pulled up by the CPI(M) for offering prayer at the Tarapith temple in Birbhum district. He was made to explain his action,” said the CPI(M) state committee member.CPI(M) Politburo member Md Salim, who held the alliance talks with ISF, said Left leaders can say anything now as there is no restriction on talking.“One thing is for sure. We are facing the worst crisis,” said Manoj Bhattacharya, state secretary of the Revolutionary Socialist Party (RSP), a Left Front ally.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bengal-poll-rout-divides-cpi-m-left-front-leaders-alliance-with-cleric-under-scanner-101620415202682.html

This will help us to lessen the load on the existing oxygen supplies in the state,” he wrote.The state government has been pleading with the Centre for more allocation of oxygen due to the dire situation in the state, which recorded its highest fatality rate on Friday at 1.21%.The decision comes on a day when Karnataka reported 592 Covid-related fatalities of which 346 were in Bengaluru. The fatality rate reached a high of 1.21%, according to the daily bulletin of the state health department. The state recorded 48781 new infections that takes its active case count to 536641. The positivity rate was at 30.28%, according to the bulletin. Bengaluru appears to be plateauing with infections steadily in the range of 21376 new cases that takes its active case count to 341978. The death toll in India’s IT capital rose to 7491.Karnataka got a breather after the Supreme Court on Friday turned down a plea by the central government, seeking a stay on the Karnataka high court order that directed it to immediately increase the supply of medical oxygen to the state from 962 metric tonnes (MT) per day to 1,200 MT per day.Yediyurappa also requested Boeing to set up a 250-oxygen bed hospital in Kalaburagi, one the worst affected regions outside of Bengaluru. While Bengaluru appears to be peaking with the number of cases, the spike is slowly moving to districts across the state where health infrastructure is far poorer than India’s IT capital. “The districts in the northern Karnataka, especially Bidar, Kalaburagi, Belagaum and Raichur, are also worst affected by Covid-19 pandemic and the entire region lacks in medical infrastructure facility. There it is requested that Boeing India may please be asked to set up a similar hospital with 250 oxygen beds at Kalaburagi under their CSR activities or otherwise,” he added.“Thanks @Boeing_In for coming forward to set up two 200 oxygenated bed hospitals in Karnataka for treating COVID-19 cases. Yelahanka(Bengaluru) & Kalaburgi.The latter also to serve Bidar, Belgaum & Raichur. The nodal officers appointed by Hon CM @BSYBJP would expedite the process,” Sitharaman said in a post on Twitter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/boeing-india-to-set-up-hospital-with-200-oxygen-beds-in-bengaluru-cm-yediyurappa-101620414841767.html
08-05-2021||India||Vaccination drive takes a hit in Bengaluru as stocks run dry||Bengaluru The vaccination drive, which the Karnataka government is banking on to contain the Covid-19 surge, has taken a huge setback as stocks run dry in most private hospitals and medical facilities in Bengaluru.Boards stating “No vaccination today” were seen on most private hospital gates on Friday while those visiting public medical facilities were sent back without inoculation, according to multiple persons aware of the developments.“Except Manipal and Apollo, no other private hospital has a single dose of vaccine now,” Dr Prasanna HM, the president-elect of the Private Hospitals & Nursing Homes Association (PHANA) told Hindustan Times.It comes even as the BS Yediyurappa-led government has withdrawn its earlier practice to distribute vaccines to private hospitals, asking them instead to procure on their own.“We are under tremendous pressure to give the second dose for all those who took the first dose. We are unable to answer them and request them to go to government facilities and take it,” Prasanna added.Both Manipal and Apollo hospitals, where vaccination drive continued, said they have procured stocks from manufacturers directly.Karnataka’s vaccination drive has seen a sharp decline since May 1, as per the daily bulletin of the state health department.Inaccurate reporting of vaccine data was another big challenge to gauge the actual number of inoculations in the state, experts said.According to the daily bulletin, only 62417 vaccinations were carried out in the state on Friday till 3 pm. However, senior government officials claimed the actual number was higher ,adding that the discrepancy was due to the format of reporting the numbers.Even if their version is believed, the daily vaccination numbers are far short of Yediyurappa’s aim of increasing the vaccination to 300,000 per day, as announced on 17 March.The lax in vaccination has come at a time when the caseload in Karnataka has breached all previous records. The state and its capital Bengaluru are among the worst impacted regions in the country.On Friday, Karnataka reported 48,781 new infections , taking the active caseload to 536,641. Bengaluru accounted for 21,376 new cases, taking its total active case count to 341,978. A record 592 persons succumbed to the viral disease in Karnataka, taking the toll in the state to 17,804. Bengaluru reported 346 deaths on Thursday, taking its toll due to Covid-19 to 7,149, according to the daily bulletin of the health department. Going by the daily bulletin, a total of 866,533 vaccine shots have been administered in the state from April 28 till Thursday. During the same time, there have been 421,159 new Covid-19 infections from across the state, data shows.Though Karnataka is the first state to cross the 10-million vaccination mark, a closer look of state data shows that most of them are people who received only the first dose.Out of the 10,316,686 vaccinations, 8,426,383 account for the first dose and only 1,890,303 have received both doses, according to government data.A senior government official said around 300,000 doses of vaccine were left in Karnataka and new stocks are expected at the earliest.Karnataka has ordered 10 million doses of Covishield vaccine from Pune-based Serum Institute of India (SII) at a cost of ₹400 crore, but the delivery has been delayed.While the focus remains on Bengaluru, one of the worst impacted regions in the country, the other 29 districts of Karnataka have witnessed a sharp surge of cases. According to experts, the worry is that if the health infrastructure in Bengaluru was crumbling, the situation in other districts, some of which are among the most backward in the country, is unimaginable.“We have created a lot of facilities. Last time, taluka hospitals did not have oxygen, this time we have them. District hospitals have been ramped up. Number wise oxygenated beds have been ramped up almost six times,” a senior official at the health department told Hindustan Times, requesting anonymity.P Ravi Kumar, the state’s chief secretary said that vaccine stocks come in every two days and there were no shortages.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/vaccination-drive-takes-a-hit-in-bengaluru-as-stocks-run-dry-101620414601738.html

A statement from the AIADMK said that they will reconvene on May 10 under the leadership of Palaniswami and Panneerselvam. “We thought we could resolve the issues today but it will take a few days time,” said a former AIADMK minister not wishing to be named. Before the start of the meeting on Friday, supporters of both leaders got into a verbal argument over who should be leader of opposition, an important position which will decide the future of the party as well the leader’s. Inside the meeting, the legislators and leaders were expected to discuss their performance and factors that led to the loss. Since Palaniswami contested as the chief minister candidate, increased his margin of win by defeating DMK’s candidate by 92,849 votes in Edappadi constituency in Salem district and helped increase the party’s tally which performed the best in western region from where he and his former top ministers hail, he was expected to be chosen as the opposition leader. But the Panneerselvam camp is putting up a resistance.This isn’t the first time that the party is facing such a crisis. Before, outgoing chief minister Palaniswami was decided as the candidate for the top job, Pannerselvam resisted for more than two weeks before giving in and making the announcement himself in October 2020. While Palaniswami is the party’s joint co-ordinator, outgoing deputy chief minister Pannerselvam is the coordinator of the AIADMK. The dual leadership has been maintained in party administration and governance but simmering tension between the duo has come up every now and then over important decisions over position. After J Jayalalithaa’s death in December 2016, V K Sasikala briefly held the reins of the party but after her imprisonment in February 2017, Palaniswami and Panneerselvam joined hands and ousted Sasikala and her nephew TTV Dhinakaran. The latter floated AMMK with a rebel faction of Sasikala supporters with the intention of reclaiming the AIADMK. After her release, Sasikala expected her loyalists to return to her but as Palaniswami- Paneerselvam had put up a united front and solidified the party, there was no exodus. Sasikala eventually decided to step away from politics. With trouble brewing in the party now it remains to be seen how AIADMK will resolve these challenges. Meanwhile, the DMK appointed its MLA Kovai Chezhiyan as the government’s chief whip.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/aiadmk-meet-to-chose-leader-of-opposition-remains-inconclusive-101620414541731.html

08-05-2021||India||Vizag gas leak: A year on, villagers near the plant continue to live in fear||A year on since Visakhapatnam in Andhra Pradesh woke up to one of its worst environmental disasters – leakage of poisonous gas from a storage tank of LG Polymers Ltd, a South Korean company on the outskirts of the city, killed 12 people while nearly 500 were hospitalised – villagers settled near the plant continue to live in a state of fear.Though the plant has since been closed following orders from the Andhra Pradesh high court, residents of Venkatapuram and four other villages surrounding the plant said the horror from the tragic incident haunt them to this day.On May 7 last year, poisonous Styrene gas leaked from one of the tanks at LG Polymers Ltd due to sudden rise in temperature at the bottom of the tank at around 3.30 am. The gas slowly spread over a radius of about 3 km, affecting five villages — Venkatapuram, Venkatadri Nagar, Nandamuri Nagar, Pydimamba Colony and BC & SC Colony.Srinu Yadav, a transport worker from Venkatapuram, said the incident had created havoc in the lives of several villagers, particularly the poor and the middle class. “Many in these villages, particularly Venkatapuram, where the LG Polymers plant is located, continue to face health issues, like breathing problems, asthma, and gastrointestinal disorders,” Yadav said.The villagers recall how thanks to the timely alert from locals, the authorities of Greater Visakhapatnam Municipal Corporation and the district administration swung into action and shifted people from the affected areas with the help of police to safer areas.The Jagan Mohan Reddy government paid ex gratia of ₹1 crore each to the families of the 12 who died in the incident, besides ₹10 lakh for persons who were kept on ventilator for a long time, ₹1 lakh each to 485 people who were hospitalised with serious complications and ₹25,000 each to 99 people who were treated as outpatients. Another 19,893 people were paid ₹25,000 each towards compensation.Also read | Andhra begins enforcing partial lockdown, Telangana still waiting for nod from KCR“In the next one week, three others from the affected villages died but the authorities attributed their deaths to some other reasons. In the last one year, at least 15 people, including my father-in-law, died due to symptoms that surfaced after the Styrene gas leak. But no forensic studies were done to prove they were related to the gas leak tragedy,” Yadav said.An eight-member expert committee headed by state special chief secretary (environment and forests) Neerabh Kumar Prasad, which was constituted to probe into the mishap, came up with a series of suggestions, including periodical testing of health conditions of villagers in the area so as to monitor the short-term and long-term impact of the Styrene gas on their health.“Subsequently, a committee of health experts was appointed to regularly monitor the health of people in the affected villages, but it did not commence its work because of the Covid-19 pandemic,” K Kumara Mangalam, a local trade union leader, said.He added that the government has washed off its hands by setting up a primary health centre in a local school, but it hardly helped. “Except for an occasional visit by a junior doctor and para-medical staff, nothing much has happened. It doesn’t have any facilities, though the authorities promised to set up a hospital in the area,” Mangalam said.A study conducted in March this year by local environmentalists under Alluri Sitarama Raju Vignana Kendram on environment, health and safety of people in the villages surrounding LG Polymers, observed that the GVMC authorities were neither monitoring water bodies periodically nor getting an expert study on the water quality.“Most of the households are depending on the canned water for drinking purposes and spending between ₹300- 600 per month,” said K Eswar, another resident.An official of the GVMC, however, denied contamination of the drinking water in villages. “Scientists belonging to CSIR-National Environment Engineering Research Institute studied the water samples in and around the area and found that styrene is insoluble in water and would drain away in case of water flow. We are supplying Godavari water to local residents through pipeline,” the official said on condition of anonymity.The LG Polymers has shut its operations since the tragedy and the Korean management, with special permission from the Ministry of Shipping, shifted 13,000 tonnes of unused Styrene in two ships back to Seoul. On April 6 this year, the company got permission from the high court to move and sell leftover raw material, finished product and packaging material from the plant as it could pose danger to the public health if left unattended.The court directed that sale process be done in the supervision of a three-member committee appointed by the state government and the company deposit the sales proceeds in an account in the name of Vizag district collector.The villagers in the area are apprehensive that the LG Polymers might restart their operations once the cases pending in the high court and the National Green Tribunal were settled. “Unless the plant is completely shifted from the area, the fear of recurrence of such incidents will continue to haunt us,” said S Pydi Raju, a resident of Venkatapuram.When contacted, state industries minister Mekapati Gautam Reddy said the government has not focused on LG Polymers as of now as it was busy tackling the Covid-19 situation. “We shall take appropriate decision after discussing with the industries department authorities later,” he said..||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/vizag-gas-leak-a-year-on-villagers-near-the-plant-continue-to-live-in-fear-101620414482377.html

The 68-year-old leader, the son of former chief minister M Karunanidhi, led the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam to victory after a decade in the recently concluded assembly elections.As he took the oath,his wife Durga, and son and newly elected MLA Udhyanidhi broke down while party cadre cheered him on. The crowd was restricted due to Covid-19 curbs and Stalin had asked his followers to watch the event on television.“Congratulations to Thiru @mkstalin on being sworn-in as Tamil Nadu chief minister,” Prime Minister Narendra Modi tweeted.After reaching his office in the Secretariat at Fort St George, he signed five important orders, four of which were promised in DMK’s election manifesto.Also read | DMK's MK Stalin takes oath as Tamil Nadu's next chief ministerThe decisions included financial relief of ₹4,000 to 20.7 million ration card holders to tide over hardships faced due to the Covid-19 pandemic. The first instalment of ₹2,000 will be distributed in May and the rest will be given later. This scheme will cost the state ₹4,153 crore.The Chief Minister’s Comprehensive Health Insurance Scheme will be extended to cover treatment for Covid-19 in private hospitals for existing beneficiaries of the scheme. Travel was made free for women in state-owned buses. This will roll out from Saturday and the state will sanction ₹1,200 crore towards this scheme.Stalin also slashed the price of milk produced by state-run Aavin by ₹3 per litre. A new department will be formed to address people’s grievances within the first 100 days of the new government. The department ‘CM in your constituency’ will be headed by an IAS officer, Shilpa Prabhakar. Stalin had collected these grievances during his campaign titled ‘Stalin in your constituency’.In the previous All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam regime, the late J Jayalalithaa, who assumed office in May 2016, also signed five orders on her first day.Stalin also held a Covid-19 review meeting with all district collectors via video conference. Tamil Nadu on Friday reported 26,445 new cases and 197 new deaths. “According to experts this will increase over the next two weeks,” Stalin said in his video address. “So we have to increase bed and oxygen facilities and drugs on war footing.” He also announced setting up a 800 bed facility with oxygen in Chennai out of which 300 will be opened from May 10.Also read | TN CM-elect Stalin gets home portfolio as DMK issues list of 34 ministersExperts said Stalin aimed to start on a good note but the five orders will be a huge burden on the exchequer. “He has made generous announcements which are also election promises but it will cost the exchequer at least ₹10,000 crore,” says political analyst Maalan Narayanan. “In the present economic condition, the GDSP will come down due to Covid-19, the state’s borrowing has reached its limits, the state is also carrying the burden of public sector undertakings such as the electricity and transport corporation which isn’t making profit.”Stalin’s new teamV Irai Anbu was named the new chief secretary, replacing Rajeev Ranjan who took over in February. A seasoned IAS officer and writer, Anbu received the Si Pa Aditanar Literary Award for the year 2017 from Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Anbu’s brother is a 1995 batch IAS officer of the Gujarat cadre, V Thiruppugazh who is considered to be close to Prime Minister Modi.Thiruppugazh had served as Modi’s secretary in 2005-06 when the latter was Gujarat chief minister. He served in the Modi administration in the Centre too and was appointed as Advisor in the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA). “All officers appointed are efficient and one of the reasons for Irai Anbu’s appointment could be to have a more cordial relationship with the Prime Minister’s Office,” said Narayanan.Four senior bureaucrats were also announced as private secretaries to Stalin--T Udhayachandran as secretary 1, Dr P Umanath, is transferred from his role as managing director, Tamil Nadu Medical Services Corporation (TNMSC) and posted as secretary-2, M S Shanmugam as secretary-3 and Anu George as secretary- 4.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/stalin-era-begins-with-covid-welfare-schemes-in-focus-101620414481681.html
08-05-2021||India||Telangana govt extends night curfew; limits attendees at gatherings||Hyderabad The Telangana government on Friday extended the ongoing night curfew by another week while announcing additional restrictions on public gatherings to contain the spread of Covid-19 in the state.The move comes a day after chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao ruled out the possibility of a partial or total lockdown but said that all required measures would be adopted to contain the pandemic. The latest orders were issued by chief secretary Somesh Kumar in the evening. The night curfew – from 9 pm to 6 am – which was initially imposed on April 20 and extended twice, will now continue till May 15. “All business establishments, hotels and other offices should be closed by 8 pm. Collectors and superintendents of police, besides commissioners of police in all major cities, have been empowered to implement the night curfew,” the chief secretary saidin the order.The state government also imposed restrictions on public gatherings like marriages and similar events. Accordingly, only 100 members would be allowed to attend any such functionsunder strict compliance of Covid-19 norms. Not more than 20 people would be allowed to attend funerals. The government completely banned political meetings, rallies, sports and other entertainment programmes in view of the Covid-19 situation.On Thursday, the state government ruled out the possibility of any kind of lockdown – partial or total – citing that it would result in total collapse of the financial system of the state. Rao, who held a high-level meeting at his camp office late on Thursday, told officials that the lockdown would bring life to a standstill and would affect the livelihood of over 25-30 lakh migrant workers from other states who were working in Telangana. “Moreover, there is a bumper yield of paddy in the state and workers are busy in the procurement activity across 6,144 procurement centres in the state. There are lakhs of people involved in the process. What will happen to the workers who come from other states to work in the rice mills if a lockdown is imposed? The entire paddy purchasing process will come to a standstill if the lockdown is imposed,” he said. Rao added that a lockdown would also lead to a panic-like situation. “Hence, we are not ready for the lockdown. However, we will identify the areas where Covid-19 cases are more and declare them as micro-level containment zones and take required measures,” he explained. According to the official bulletin from the state medical and health department, the state reported 5,559 new Covid-19 infections and 41 fatalities as on Friday evening, taking the cumulative number of positive cases to 487,199 and total deaths to 2,666. The number of active cases in Telangana is 71,308.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/telangana-govt-extends-night-curfew-limits-attendees-at-gatherings-101620414361652.html

The deceased have been identified as Mohammad Pasha (40) and A Kamalakar Chary (36). The incident happened close to the Mahabubabad railway station. The bodies have been shifted to the Mahabubabad district government hospital for post mortem, an official of the Warangal Railway Police said. According to the railway police, the two men were doing their regular duty of checking the railway tracks. They were working on track-1 when they noticed a train approaching on the track. They immediately crossed to track-2 for safety. “However, the men failed to notice that another train – Konark Superfast Express from Bhubaneshwar to Secunderabad, was approaching on the second track and even before they realised it, they were knocked down by the express train resulting in their death on the spot,” the police said. They said the victims may not have anticipated the passage of two trains on adjacent tracks almost at the same time and that led to the accident. The Warangal Railway Police registered a case and took up the investigation. The South Central Railway authorities also ordered an independent inquiry into the accident.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/2-railway-staff-killed-after-being-hit-by-speeding-train-while-on-duty-in-telangana-101620414062250.html

Mamata Banerjee took charge as West Bengal chief minister for a third time on Wednesday while M K Stalin took oath in Tamil Nadu on Friday.Also read | Five days after election results, Assam yet to get a new CMIn the Union territory of Puducherry, N Rangasamy was sworn in as the chief minister on Friday. The new government under Pinarayi Vijayan in Kerala is likely to assume office in the third week of this month.In Assam, however, the BJP leadership in Delhi is yet to decide between Sonowal and Sarma for the top post.“Government formation will happen in due course. Right now, all our focus is on controlling the spread of Covid-19 across the state and saving lives,” Sonowal said on Friday while taking stock of facilities to tackle the disease.In the polls, the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance won 75 seats in the 126-member Assembly.The BJP leadership is yet to send central observers to Assam to interact with the party’s state office-bearers and no official meeting of the 60 newly-elected members have taken place as of yet to choose the new chief minister.“The delay was initially due to the violence in West Bengal after declaration of results in which the Trinamool Congress (TMC) workers targeted our members. The prevailing Covid-19 situation in the country has also affected the decision on formation of the next government,” BJP spokesperson Rupam Goswami said.“There’s already a caretaker government in place in Assam and it is functioning well. There’s no difference within the party on the CM’s post and the same will be announced soon,” he added.The delay in government formation comes at a time when the state is witnessing a spike in Covid-19 cases. On Thursday, Assam recorded 5,626 new positive cases, which was the highest ever single-day figure in the state ever since the pandemic broke out last year. It also recorded 47 deaths on the same day.Also read | JD(U) and other Bihar parties hit rock bottom in Assam, Bengal polls“BJP got a clear and decisive mandate, but still it hasn’t been able to form a government. Especially at a time when the state is going through a difficult time, critical decisions like dates of board examinations and handling of the Covid-19 spike shouldn’t be left to an ad-hoc government,” Congress Lok Sabha MP Pradyut Bordoloi said.“At present, what was needed was an all-out effort on war footing to check the alarming surge in Covid-19 and community spread of the disease seen in tea-gardens. But the delay exposes the bankruptcy of the BJP’s decision-making process,” he added.Akhil Ranjan Dutta, professor of political science in Gauhati University, said that the BJP’s defeat in West Bengal could have played a part in delay in announcement of Assam’s next CM.“The outcome in West Bengal in a way eroded the moral authority of the BJP leadership to dictate or impose decisions in Assam. Therefore, they are taking time and indulging in negotiations as they are worried about a possible revolt,” Dutta said.“The BJP got its fourth successive poll victory in Assam in this election since the 2014 general elections. But the delay in the government formation process amounts to complete insult to the faith reposed in the party by the voters,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjpsummons-sonowal-sarma-as-uncertainty-over-assam-cmcontinues-101620413762339.html

This will help us to lessen the load on the existing oxygen supplies in the state,” he wrote.The state government has been pleading with the Centre for more allocation of oxygen due to the dire situation in Karnataka which recorded its highest fatality rate on Friday.The decision comes on a day when Karnataka reported 592 Covid-19 related fatalities of which 346 were in Bengaluru. The fatality rate touched a high of 1.21%, according to the daily bulletin of the state health department. The state recorded 48,781 new infections that take its active case count to 536,641. The positivity rate was at 30.28%, according to the bulletin. Bengaluru appears to be plateauing with infections steadily in the range of 21,376 new cases that take its active case count to 341,978. The death toll in India’s IT capital rose to 7491.Karnataka got a breather after the Supreme Court on Friday turned down a plea by the Central government, seeking a stay on the Karnataka high court order that directed it to immediately increase the supply of medical oxygen to the state from 962 metric tonnes (MT) per day to 1,200 MT per day.Yediyurappa also requested Boeing to set up a similar 250-bedded hospital with oxygen facility in Kalaburagi, one the worst affected regions outside Bengaluru. While Bengaluru appears to be peaking with the number of Covid-19 cases, the surge is slowly moving to districts across the state where health infrastructure is far poorer than India’s IT capital. “The districts in northern Karnataka especially Bidar, Kalaburagi, Belagaum, Raichur are also badly affected by the Covid-19 pandemic and the entire region lacks in medical infrastructure facility. There it is requested that Boeing India may please be asked to set up a similar hospital with 250 oxygen beds at Kalaburagi under their CSR activities or otherwise,” he added.“Thanks @Boeing_In for coming forward to set up 200 bed hospitals in Karnataka for treating COVID-19 cases. Yelahanka (Bengaluru) & Kalaburgi. The latter also to serve Bidar, Belgaum & Raichur. The nodal officers appointed by Hon CM @BSYBJP would expedite the process,” Sitharaman said in a post on Twitter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/boeing-to-set-up-200-bed-hospital-with-oxygen-facility-in-bengaluru-101620413102402.html
08-05-2021||India||Knew lives were at stake: Officer who helped avert tragedy at Mumbai airport||“For some reason, I kept watching the plane as it was speeding on the runway,” recalled Ravi Kanth Avala, a Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) head constable who averted a major tragedy by spotting a technical malfunction in an air ambulance, at the Nagpur airport late on Thursday.The plane carrying a total of five people, including a patient and a doctor, belly-landed under full emergency protocols at the Mumbai airport on Thursday night without any casualties.The air ambulance--a chartered flight with registration VT-JIL--took off from Bagdogra for Mumbai with five people on board, but had a stopover at Nagpur for re-fuelling around 2.30 am.Avala was deployed at the watchtower near the runway of the Nagpur airport. Around 5.50pm, when the Beechcraft King Air C90 plane was taking off, Avala noticed that its rear wheel “fell off in the air”. “The moment it took off, the rear left wheel of the plane broke and got separated. The speed of the aircraft was such that the detached wheel went rolling at least half a kilometre ahead, towards the left of the runway, before it came to halt. The plane, however, took off, unaffected,” said Avala.Sensing the gravity of the incident, the 48-year-old head constable immediately rushed towards the runway, barely 300 metres from watchtower number 12, and alerted the Nagpur SOCC (security operational control centre), which in turn reported the matter to the air traffic control (ATC).Also read | Air ambulance lands on belly in Mumbai as wheel falls off in Nagpur“I went to the spot where the wheel fell. Since it was a charter jet, I was sure it would land somewhere within 2-3 hours maximum. I also knew that such planes have a capacity of 7-8 passengers and therefore lives are at stake. At that time I didn’t know that it’s an air ambulance carrying a Covid-19 patient. Thinking that it can lead to a fatal accident upon landing, I immediately reported the matter to my superiors who further alerted the authorities concerned,” Avala said. “The Nagpur ATC quickly informed the pilot of the aircraft and arrangements were made at Mumbai airport for safe landing,” the Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) said in a statement. The plane landed on a foamed runway at the Mumbai’s Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj International Airport at about 9:09 pm on Thursday and rescue authorities evacuated those on board.“Had head constable Avala not shown alertness, a major tragedy could have occurred during the landing of the aircraft..,” the CISF statement said.On Friday, the CISF announced a cash reward of ₹10,000, the top force honour of a DG commendation disc and certificate for Avala.Avala said he feels fortunate to have saved a tragedy from unfolding. “My seniors and colleagues appreciate my quick reaction. My alertness and promptness was lauded. My family members, my wife and children are also proud of me,” said Avala, who has been posted at Nagpur airport since 2017.Meanwhile, senior officials at the Airport Authority of India said that after learning about absence of rear left wheel, the pilot requested the ATC to get in touch with the aircraft type’s (C-90) expert from the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) to figure out the best possible procedure to be followed in the situation.“The checklist with the pilot did not state his course of action needed, in case one of the rear wheels went missing,” claimed an AAI official. “Though the pilot had communicated to go for belly landing, he shared a contact of an expert for C-90 aircraft and asked the on-duty controllers to reconfirm the course of action needed,” the officer added. It was then that the air traffic controllers (ATCos) got in touch with two experts from the DGCA to get their views. The experts agreed and asked the ATCos to go ahead with the belly landing.Mohan Ranganathan, aviation safety expert and former instructor pilot of Boeing 737 said, “Absence of standard operating procedure on partial landing gear failure, is a very serious lapse on the DGCA’s part.”DGCA director general Arun Kumar said that investigation will reveal the facts. “We would not like to speculate,” he added.The Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau (AAIB) however confirmed that they have taken over the investigation. “The AAIB is conducting an investigation as per Aircraft (Investigation of Accidents and Incidents) Rules, 2017 into the causes of the occurrence,” read AAIB’s reply to the email sent by the paper.An Airports Authority of India official said the aircraft luckily had enough fuel to stay in the air while the authorities and the pilot prepped for a belly landing. “This gave us a good time to consider all possibilities and take a call,” the official who was on duty on Thursday evening said.AAI officials said that the Nagpur ATC informed the Mumbai ATC about the plane’s missing wheel around 6.45pm.“The pilot was unaware of the situation until the Mumbai ATC got in touch with Capt Kesari Singh to inform him about it. However, none of us knew which wheel of the aircraft was detached,” said the AAI official quoted earlier.Capt Singh suggested ‘low pass’ over the runway to identify which wheel had fallen off, a reference to the aircraft flying at a height of 50m over the runway. “The pilot was cleared to conduct the ‘low pass’ immediately at around 6.45pm when the aircraft was 200Nm away from Mumbai,” said a controller at Mumbai.The low pass, carried out at around 7.30pm, led the Mumbai ATC and fire department officials to figure that the aircraft’s rear left wheel was missing.A Delhi-based AAI official explained that the absence of either of the two rear wheels is riskier than any issue with the nose wheel. “This is because the two rear wheels come in contact with the runway first, followed by the nose wheel.”“ATCos were asked to go ahead with belly landing after which the airport operator was contacted and asked to prepare for foam-based landing. Arranging for foam and making it available at the touchdown point of runway 27 took some time,” said a senior AAI official in Mumbai.“At first, when the arrangement of foaming the runway was taking time, we were even thinking on the lines of sending the aircraft back to Nagpur, however, by then the airport operator confirmed that foam was being arranged,” the official added.The aircraft touched down safely at 9.09pm after which the fire department officials took over and handled the situation so that the aircraft did not catch fire. Though the aircraft suffered substantial damage, there were no injuries. The mid-aged male patient, who was one of the passengers was being treated for Covid-19, was rushed to Nanavati hospital. A hospital official said the patient is on oxygen support, but he is conscious and stable.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/knew-lives-were-at-stake-officer-who-helped-avert-tragedy-at-mumbai-airport-101620412801437.html
08-05-2021||India||Sonia, Rahul attack Centre, say it failed people||Congress president Sonia Gandhi on Friday demanded an all-party meeting on the coronavirus disease pandemic, accusing Prime Minister Narendra Modi of failing the people of India and announced that the Congress’ organization would enhance its relief activities, even as party leader Rahul Gandhi wrote to the Prime Minister that the Centre’s failures at managing the pandemic’s second wave have made another “devastating national lockdown almost inevitable.”In the first Congress Parliamentary Party meeting after the recent assembly elections where the party was decimated everywhere except in Tamil Nadu where it was the junior partner in the winning alliance, Sonia Gandhi said that a Congress Working Committee meeting will soon be called to review the results. “But it goes without saying that we as a party collective must draw appropriate lessons from this setback in a spirit of humility and honesty.” She congratulated Trinamool Congress chief Mamata Banerjee, DMK chief M.K. Stalin and the Left parties for their “handsome victories” in West Bengal, Tamil Nadu and Kerala and said, “Most unfortunately, our own performance in all the states was very disappointing and if I may say, unexpectedly so.”The Congress failed to win Assam, Kerala and Puducherry, and drew a blank in West Bengal .Underlining that the fighting Covid is not “a “Government versus Us” battle but a “Us versus Corona” battle,” she demanded that the PM should call an all-party meeting as “we have to fight this battle together as a nation.”Also read | Central Vista project a criminal wastage, says Rahul Gandhi“Let us be absolutely clear – the system hasn’t failed. The Modi government has been unable to constructively channelize India’s many strengths and resources. I say this categorically -- India is crippled by a political leadership today that has no empathy for the people. The Modi Government has failed the people of our country,” Sonia Gandhi said in the CPP meeting.The Congress president accused Modi of abdicating a government’s fundamental responsibilities and duties towards the people and argued that the Centre had “refused to strengthen the supply-chains for oxygen, medicine, and ventilators” and “failed to place” sufficient orders for vaccines and “Instead, it consciously chose to allocate thousands of crores for non-essential projects that have nothing to do with the peoples’ well-being.” The last was a reference to the Central Vista projects.Rahul Gandhi’s letter cautioned against the “uncontrollable spread” of this virus. He offered four suggestions to slow its spread: track the virus and its mutations, dynamically assess the efficacy of all vaccines against mutations, rapidly vaccinate India’s entire population, and remain “transparent and keep the rest of the world informed about our findings.”Rahul Gandhi also demanded financial, food and transportation support “to prevent a repeat of the manifold suffering caused by last year’s lockdown.”“I am aware that you are concerned about the economic impact of a lockdown. Inside and outside India, the human cost of allowing this virus to continue its march unimpeded will result in many more tragic consequences for our people than any purely economic calculations your advisors are suggesting,” his letter reasoned.In the meeting, Abhishek Manu Singhvi gave suggestions such as the party should set up a fund by imposing a uniform “Congress Covid Charge” on all its members and the money can be used for medical activities such as buying oxygen cylinders and medicines. He also suggested creation of an IT portal and aid for poor people. Leaders such as DK Suresh, Nasir Hussain, Saptagiri Ulaka and Ripun Bora described the prevailing Covid situation in their areas.Several leaders praised Rahul Gandhi, who didn’t speak at all. Francisco Sardinha said he had tried to open the eyes of Modi but it fell on deaf ears. Punjab MP Jasbir Singh Gill tried to raise the election issue, but Sonia Gandhi told him that the CWC would discuss it separately.Sonia also maintained that the vaccination policy will exclude millions backward people as well as the poor and the marginalized. Claiming that “the nation is sinking under the weight of the Modi government’s indifference and incompetence” she added that the Congress would “enhance and streamline” its relief efforts and that “efforts must be made to organize ambulances, temporary beds, oxygen concentrators and necessary medicines.”The work being done by the Youth Congress, which has run a more effective helpline that some states and Union Territories, also came in for praise from the party president.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sonia-rahul-attack-centre-say-it-failed-people-101620412681362.html
08-05-2021||India||Centre asks states to prioritise beneficiaries of 2nd vaccine dose||The Union government has directed states to prioritise beneficiaries due for their second Coronavirus disease (Covid-19) vaccine dose, amidst reports of difficulties faced by those unable to schedule a session for a second dose -- the result of a supply crunch.“Utilise supplies of vaccines through government of India channel in 70:30 ratio for the second dose and first dose respectively. Regular review of coverage of Covid-19 vaccination drive to be undertaken to formulate and implement strategy for such prioritization,” said Arti Ahuja, additional secretary, health, in the customary Covid briefing.Vaccine doses provided through the government of India channel are to be used exclusively for those above the age of 45 years and health care and front line workers. In addition, states have started sourcing their own supplies to vaccinate those between the ages of 18 and 45 years. But over the past few days, there have been several reports of people not being able to schedule their second doses -- recommended between 6 and 8 weeks in the case of the Covishield vaccine and 4 and 6 weeks in the case of Covaxin.Interestingly, the guidance came even as there has been talk of the government extending the gap between doses to 12 weeks in the case of Covishield -- the vaccine administered to over 90% of Indians -- so as to maximise the number of people who receive at least one dose, an immediate priority to crush the ongoing second wave of the pandemic which has seen the last 2 million cases added in just six days. Also read | Covid-19: Centre issues SoP to vaccinate beggars, prison inmates without IDsResearch has show that the efficacy of the AstraZeneca/Oxford vaccine -- developed in India as Covishield by Serum Institute of India -- is the highest when there is a 12 week gap between doses.Interestingly, days after a similar briefing in which the focus was on the inevitability of a third wave, officials said in Friday’s briefing that India could avoid one.“If we take strong measures, the third wave may not happen in all the places or indeed anywhere at all. It depends much on how effectively the guidance is implemented at the local level, in the states, in districts and the cities everywhere,” said Prof K VijayRaghavan, principal scientific advisor, in the briefing.For the past week, according to the HT dashboard, India has reported an average of 389,044 cases and 3,775 deaths a day. On Friday, the country reported 401,358 cases and 4192 deaths.At least 12 states currently have at least 100,000 active Covid-19 cases. The disease positivity rate in some states such as Goa is nearing 50%. Four states have a positivity rate of 30% and above. At least 24 states and UTs currently have a positivity rate of 15% and above; nine states and UTs are reporting between 5 and 15%; and only three states and UTs have less than 5% positivity rate.A total of 167 million vaccine doses have been administered across the country . This includes 34 million fully vaccinated people and 99 million who have received one dose. Of this, only 1.181 million of those between the ages of 18-44 have been vaccinated since the third phase of the vaccine drive began on May 1.“Everyone should get vaccinated when they can; it will help in dealing with subsequent waves,” said Dr Giridhara R Babu, head, epidemiology, Indian Institute of Public Health.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-asks-states-to-prioritise-beneficiaries-of-2nd-vaccine-dose-101620412561367.html
08-05-2021||India||O2 crisis persists across India, 3 states write to Centre on quota||The pan-India medical oxygen shortage was under focus again on Friday with two states, West Bengal and Rajasthan, asking the Centre to increase their quotas, and the Supreme Court refusing to intervene in a Karnataka high court order increasing the allocation of the medical essential for the state.Tamil Nadu asked the Centre to restore its quota. On May 1 and May 2, in a meeting with Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade, it was agreed that the state will be re-allotted 476 MT of oxygen as opposed to 220 MT but Centre hasn’t issued orders yet.Some other states, however, said that supply improved over the past week due to higher allocations and improvements in the supply chain -- issues that led to several high courts passing directives over the past fortnight as hospitals were struggling to treat patients for want of oxygen in the middle of a deadly second Covid-19 wave.On Friday, West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, her third letter in three days, requesting that 550 MT of medical oxygen be supplied to the state every day to manage the health care emergency. “Any allocation of medical oxygen less than the requested amount (550 MT) will not only adversely affect the supply of medical oxygen but may also result in loss of lives of the patients in the state,” she wrote.On Friday, West Bengal reported 19, 216 new Covid-19 cases. The daily Covid death count in the state has shot up 20 times from six on February 26, when the assembly elections were announced, to 117 on May 6.On May 5, Banerjee wrote to Modi and said the demand of medical oxygen in the state had nearly doubled from 220 MT to 400 MT. On Friday, she said that the demand further shot up to 470 MT in the last 24 hours, and was expected to touch 550 MT in another week.“However instead of allocating the same as per the requirement of West Bengal, the Centre has increased allocation of medical oxygen to other states from the total production in West Bengal,” she wrote. Bengal’s allocation was fixed at 308 MT since May 4.The Rajasthan government on Friday claimed that the oxygen supply to the state worsened since the Centre on May 4 decided to provide supply to the state from Jamnagar in Gujarat instead from Panipat in Haryana.Also read | SC warns of coercive action if Delhi’s O2 quota not met“The oxygen supply from Jamnagar would take more time as compared to Panipat, which is comparatively closer to Jaipur. Apart from the factor of distance, the non-availability of tankers is another challenge to get oxygen from Jamnagar,” Rajasthan health minister Raghu Sharma said.The Centre last Friday allotted an 100 MT oxygen to Rajasthan from Odisha and West Bengal, rasing its total allocation to 270 MT, but the state government said it could not get oxygen due to the lack of tankers.The state has 35 oxygen tankers, and will require 25 more tankers for smooth supply, a health official said. He added that the state has around 200,000 active cases, and daily demand of oxygen hit 550 MT. The state health department has said that the demand is set to increase to 705 MT by May 10 and 795 MT by May 15 based on current trends.“Against the demand of 615MT of oxygen, the GoI is providing 270 MT, that too 100 MT from Bhiwadi; 70 MT from Jamnagar; 40 MT from Burnpur in West Bengal and 60MT from Kalinganagar in Orissa. Transporting oxygen from these places will take 10 days. Our officials are coordinating with railways and air force to speed up the process,” he said.Till Thursday, Rajasthan reported 5,182 deaths and 702,568 coronavirus cases.Tamil Nadu chief minister MK Stalin on Friday wrote to Modi asking to restore oxygen diverted to other states as the state could face oxygen shortage from Saturday.Stalin said the current consumption was 440 MT which would increase to 840 MT in the next two weeks. Tamil Nadu on Friday reported 26,445 new cases, almost double the daily cases on May 1.Also read | World’s largest cargo plane carries three oxygen plants to India from UKOther states such as Odisha, Chhattisgarh and Andhra Pradesh claimed that they were not facing any shortage of oxygen despite increase in cases as allocation has increased.Odisha’s director health services Bijay Mohapatra said no hospital in the state reported any shortage of oxygen even though daily Covid cases rose to 9,889 on Friday.Chhattisgarh health minister T S Singhdeo said that the state has ramped up oxygen supply from local industrial units and there was ample supply in hospitals and for patients in home isolation.“The demand for oxygen has also flattened in the state in the last three days and we have enough oxygen for time being,” he said. An official of the Andhra Pradesh health department said the state is not facing any oxygen shortage and was exporting oxygen to other states such as Maharashtra.Hospitals in Patna continue to face a crisis, forcing some to reduce oxygen pressure to patients and refuse fresh patients.Ruban Hospital, accredited to the National Accreditation Board for Hospitals and Healthcare Providers (NABH), had to curtail admission of new Covid-19 patients. “Our oxygen requirement is 600 cylinders (1 cylinder is 340 litres) per day, but we are able to get a maximum of 400-450 cylinders only in a day,” said a spokesperson of Ruban hospital.The Centre has allocated Bihar a daily quota of 214 MT, but the state was able to lift only 167 MT because of logistical issues.Madhya Pradesh received 524 MT oxygen on Friday from different sources but the crisis persisted in private hospitals.“It is easy for big and renowned hospitals to get oxygen...but small hospitals have to struggle daily We queue up at refilling centres for 6-12 hours daily,” said a doctor of Bhopal based hospital, who didn’t wish to be named.State minister Vishwas Sarang said, “We are putting our best efforts to fulfil the requirement...are setting up oxygen generation plant in every district.”Indian Railways delivered 2,960 MT of liquid oxygen to states since April 19 in 185 tankers. Of this, 174 MT has been offloaded in Maharashtra, 729 MT in Uttar Pradesh, 249 MT in Madhya Pradesh, 305 MT in Haryana, 123 MT in Telangana, and 1,334 MT in Delhi, according to the Railways ministry.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/o2-crisis-persists-across-india-3-states-write-to-centre-on-quota-101620412321396.html

The vaccine maker has not been able to supply vials in time due to a surge in demand," the minister said.Altogether, 2,25,387 people have been inoculated in the state so far, and 47,778 of them received both doses of the vaccine till Friday.The health minister said 15 oxygen concentrators and cylinders each have arrived in the state from Taiwan on Friday.Besides, 60 oxygen concentrators were provided to the state by the Centre, he said.Taking to Twitter, Chief Minister Zoramthanga said, "ThankYouTawian for your continued generosity providing us much needed oxygen concentrators & cylinders. Kudos MP (LS) Pu C Lalrosanga and Chairman Jonathan Lalremruata @IndiaFormosaFoundation. Taiwan has achieved much in the battle against COVID-19.""Much needed Invacare 02 Concentrators (60 nos) from Ireland were airlifted from @IAF_MCC base in Jorhat to cater the needs of people from my state #Mizoram.

08-05-2021||India||Vanraj Bhatia, musician whose jingles were the soundtrack of ’80s, '90s, dies||Cable television was yet to arrive, and Doordarshan ruled. Through much of the 1980s, home entertainment meant watching Sunday feature films or teleserials, interspersed with a series of 30- or 60-second ads. It was in these bursts that most of India encountered Vanraj Bhatia’s genius.The music director, who died on Friday aged 93, had already made a mark in Shyam Benegal’s films. Most notable were his songs Mero Gaam Katha Parey in Manthan (1976), Tumhare Bin Jee Na Lage in Bhumika (1977) and Kya Hai Tera Gham Bata in Kalyug (1981). In fact, Mero Gaam… was even used to advertise Amul milk in 1976.The 1980s saw Bhatia return in a big way to jingles, where he had begun his career, and to television serials. In switching between parallel cinema, advertising and TV programmes, he became one of the men who gave us the soundtrack of the 1980s.In an interview with this writer, Bhatia once said, “In jingles, you get only 10 or 15 seconds to make an impact musically, unlike film songs which are three of four minutes long.” His most impactful jingle was perhaps the one he composed for the Liril ad, created by Lintas chief Alyque Padamsee with executive Neena Merchant. Featuring model Karen Lunel under a waterfall, its theme music was the still-used-in-snatches “La lalalalala” tune. It was made up of less than 20 notes, but it was fresh, youthful, and it still takes you straight back to the ’80s when you hear it.The other big name composing jingles at the time was Louis Banks, who began with the Four Square cigarette commercial and later tasted huge success with his Hamara Bajaj and Cadbury’s tunes. These short films were initially made for viewing in cinema halls, but with many people buying colour TV sets after the 1982 Asian Games, the focus shifted to the small screen. Bhatia was quick to adapt, and composed successful jingles for Dulux, Tata Salt and Garden Vareli, the last of which was composed in Raag Desh.Simultaneously, with Doordarshan looking for more content, many music directors got opportunities. Bhatia composed for Shridhar Kshirsagar’s Khandaan and Benegal’s travel-based series Yatra. In Govind Nihalani’s Tamas, set during Partition, the theme music has the chanting of “O rabba”. Bhatia recalled, “I received a National Award for it. I did everything except the gurdwara song. In fact, it was jury head Salil Chowdhury who insisted I should get the award when most other jury members felt I shouldn’t be given one because it was a television score.”In Benegal’s historical series Bharat Ek Khoj, based on Jawaharlal Nehru’s book The Discovery of India, he used a hymn from the Rig Veda. It was well-received, and it spurred his interest in spiritual music. He later recorded albums based on the Upanishads and the Bhagavad Gita.Bhatia’s last major project was the opera Agni Varsha, based on a Girish Karnad play. “That was always a dream project, and when I stopped all other projects, I would spend three hours a day on the opera. It required a completely different approach,” he said.The composer was ailing for three years, and was undergoing financial difficulties. Musicians and well-wishers came out in support to help fund his medical treatment. He passed away at his residence in Mumbai, leaving behind a legacy of music that was pure, enriching and memorable.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/vanraj-bhatia-musician-whose-jingles-were-the-soundtrack-of-the-80s-and-90s-dies-at-93-101620411481321.html
08-05-2021||India||Consider urgent hearing of plea against Central Vista project: SC tells Delhi HC||The Supreme Court on Friday observed that the Covid-19 situation is “very serious”, as it requested the Delhi high court to consider hearing urgently a plea that has sought suspension of the ongoing construction activity in some stretches of the Central Vista area of New Delhi due to spurt in Covid-19 cases.Taking note of the fact the high court had given a long adjournment, the bench of justices Vineet Saran and Dinesh Maheshwari observed that it would not be proper to issue any directive to another constitutional court to hear the case on an earlier date but it was certain that the chief justice of the high court will consider the request for an urgent hearing for the plea.“Since the matter is pending before the high court and the appeal is against the order of adjournment, we are not inclined to enter into the merits of the case. In the given circumstance, we request Shri Sidharth Luthra (petitioner’s lawyer) or any other counsel to make request before the chief justice of high court on Monday to take up the matter as urgently as possible,” said the court order. It added: “We hope and trust that high court shall consider the prayer for early hearing.”Also Read | 20 heritage jamun trees may be uprooted in Central Vista revampThe Central government’s over ₹15,000 crore redevelopment plan for the historically significant Central Vista area of New Delhi envisages a new Parliament, Central Secretariat and union ministries’ offices.Petitioners Anya Malhotra and Sohail Hashmi had filed a petition before the high court, questioning the urgency in carrying on with the construction activity on three stretches of the Central Vista area during the subsistence of this peak phase of the pandemic in the capital when oxygen is in short supply and the healthcare system has collapsed.On May 4, a Delhi high court bench led by chief justice DN Patel adjourned the matter to May 17, saying he needed some time to read the Supreme Court judgment of January 5 giving a clearance to the Central Vista Avenue Redevelopment Project. Petitioners challenged this order of long adjournment before the top court in an appeal, drawn by advocate Ketaki Goswami.Arguing for the appeal, senior advocate Luthra began by saying the petitioners were not at all challenging the project after the Supreme Court’s nod to it but the public health emergency has prompted them to seek a temporary suspension of the work for stretches where labourers’ lives were in peril and the construction activity could turn out to be a super-spreader.“Between April and May, the positivity rate in Delhi has gone up from 2% to around 30%. Deaths have gone up many times. This is a matter that needs urgent consideration. We are concerned about 3.5 km stretch. We are in a stage where health infrastructure has completely broken down. People cannot get beds and deaths are going up,” submitted Luthra.The counsel pointed out that the plea was confined to stopping work which entailed construction activity on Rajpath and the surrounding lawns from India Gate to Rashtrapati Bhawan since there were no on-site accommodation facilities on these stretches and the workers were instead being ferried in buses every day.“My concern is that we are facing a humanitarian crisis of the greatest magnitude. No adverse consequences will happen if this is adjourned by three or four weeks. The ongoing construction activity have the potential of being a super spreader event since labourers travel from and back to their families from different parts of Delhi. The situation is already very alarming,” said Luthra.The bench replied: “We are well conscious of the situation. We are not making any observations because some other bench of this court is already hearing these matters...But the fact that you can see that we are wearing masks even inside our homes is a sign of how serious the situation is.”Solicitor general Tushar Mehta opposed the plea, raising doubts over the bona fide of the petitioners but the court said that all this could be argued before the high court.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/consider-urgent-hearing-of-plea-against-central-vista-project-sc-tells-delhi-hc-101620388499612.html
