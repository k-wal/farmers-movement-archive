Health ministry explains||The Union health ministry on Wednesday issued an advisory prescribing the treatment protocol for coronavirus disease (Covid-19) in adults, categorising them under three sections - mild disease, moderate disease and severe disease.Explaining the clinical guidance under moderate and severe category, the health ministry has specified the stage at which a patient can be discharged. The guidance has been issued by the members of AIIMS, ICMR Covid-19 National Task Force, Joint Monitoring Group, health ministry and Centre.Mild diseaseA mild form of Covid-19 is characterised with upper respiratory tract symptoms, with a fever or lack of it without shortness of breath or hypoxia, the advisory said.In home isolation and care, a mild case of Covid-19 patient should follow physical distancing, indoor mask use and strict hand hygiene. For symptomatic management, a patient can focus on recovering with hydration, anti-pyretics, anti-tussive, multivitamins.Moderate diseaseA patient with a moderate form of Covid-19 infection will show any one of symptoms like respiratory rate more than 24 per min, breathlessness, SpO2: 90% to < 93% on room air.Such a case may require the patient to be admitted to a hospital ward with oxygen support targetting SP02 between 92-96% and 88-92% in patients with COPD).The guidance says preferred devices for oxygenation in such a case will be a non-rebreathing face mask. Additionally, awake pruning is encouraged in all patients requiring supplemental oxygen therapy with sequential position changes every 2 hours, the guidance says.Severe diseaseA patient with a severe form of Covid-19 will show signs of respiratory rate less than 30 per minute or breathlessness or Sp02 < 90% on room air. Due to this severe impact, the patient will need admission to the Intensive Care Unit with respiratory support.In such a treatment protocol, the use of Non-Invasive Ventilation (NIV) like a helmet or face mask interface depending on availability is suggested in patients with increasing oxygen requirement, if work of breathing is low. Additionally, intubation in patients with high work of breathing should be prioritized, if NIV is not tolerated, the guidance advisory said.In this case of Covid-19 infection, a patient should be introduced to anti-inflammatory or immunomodulatory therapy.The guide also states that remdesivir may be considered only in patients with moderate to severe disease, requiring supplemental oxygen.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/how-to-manage-covid-19-clinically-in-adult-patients-health-ministry-explains-101621444589220.html

We have received some preliminary reports from IMD which predicted a possible cyclonic storm in Odisha-West Bengal coast on May 26," Jena told reporters after the meeting."There is also no information about which districts are likely to be hit by the possible calamity," he added.Jena said that he is in constant touch with IMD DG Mrutunjay Mohapatra and Regional Meteorological Centre Director HR Biswas.The collectors have been informed about the IMD's forecast and all are asked to remain vigilant on the emerging situation, he said."Some news channels are showing possible wind speed, the possible location of landfall and other related stories, which have no basis," he noted.A low-pressure area is very likely to form over North Andaman Sea and adjoining east central Bay of Bengal on May 22 and intensify into a cyclonic storm, the Met Department said.The system is very likely to move northwestwards and reach West Bengal-Odisha coasts around May 26 evening.The low-pressure area, after formation on May 22, is very likely to intensify into a cyclonic storm during the subsequent 72 hours."It is premature to forecast the place of landfall of the possible cyclone. The models now indicate that a cyclonic storm will be formed in West Bengal-Odisha coast," Mohapatra said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/odisha-alerts-coastal-districts-amid-cyclone-warning-101621445110847.html

The ruling Communist Party of India (Marxist) said she couldn’t be an exception since all ministers of the outgoing ministry were dropped to make way for new faces. Party policies were important, not individuals, it said. Many left camp followers, cine artists, writers and students have vented their anger at the government on social media, criticising the decision to drop KK Shailaja. Shailaja has also pleaded with her supporters not to get emotional over the decision and asked them to respect the party’s stand. “We stick to our decision. Once the party takes a decision it will be implemented,” said acting secretary A Vijayaraghavan.The high-profile health minister will be replaced by journalist-turned-politician Veena George, 44, according to the portfolios announced on Wednesday.“We respect their sentiments (over dropping KK Shailaja). But the party has taken a decision much earlier to induct new faces. It can’t give exemptions to some. It was a collective decision. All ministers of the outgoing government worked well and it reflected in the election also,” Pinarayi Vijayan said.To a question whether Shailaja should have been exempted from this decision, he said there were many other ministers in the outgoing council of ministers who also deserved similar exemptions but the party took a firm decision on this.“You may ask why the chief minister got an exemption then. It was also the decision of the party. In the party, there is no room for individual decisions; it is a collective one. Many are interpreting that I was behind the move but it is not right,” he said, adding the ongoing fight against pandemic will not be weakened by change in the ministry.“Our fight against pandemic is a collective one. It will continue with renewed vigour,” he said.Pinarayi Vijayan’s oath event to be held in state capital Thiruvananthapuram’s stadium on Thursday has also turned into a bit of opposition since the government relaxed the Covid-19 protocol that bars gatherings of more than 50 people.Kerala reported 32,763 cases after testing 1.40,545 persons with a test positivity rate of 23.3%. It also reported 112 deaths on Wednesday, the highest since the outbreak, taking the total fatalities in the state to 6724. Kerala has an active caseload of 3,31,860. The chief minister said there is a significant drop in the cases after a triple lockdown in four districts and a normal shutdown in the rest of the state.Pinarayi Vijayan, who announced portfolios of his new cabinet which will take oath on Thursday, has allocated the tourism and public works department for his son-in-law PA Mohammad Riyas. Much like his victory in the assembly elections - he is the first Kerala chief minister to get a second straight term in 40 years - Pinarayi Vijayan’s decision to induct his son-in-law in his cabinet is also a first in Kerala.PA Mohammad Riyas was the president of the Democratic Youth Federation of India, the party’s youth wing and was elected to the assembly from Beypore constituency in Kozhikode. Former member of the Rajya Sabha KN Balagopal is the new finance minister, succeeding Dr Thomas Isaac, an economist. Hailing from Kollam district, KN Balagopal has been in the party for more than three decades. Another former RS member, P Rajeev will be the new industry minister. Prof R Bindhu, acting secretary A Vijayaraghavan’s wife, is the higher education minister. The other ministers are MV Govindan, (excise and local self-government), K Radhakrishnan (devaswom), V Sivankutty (labour and education), VN Vasavan (co-operation), K Krishnankutty (power), Antony Raju (transport), AK Saseendran (forest), Roshi Augustin (water affairs), Ahmad Deverkoil (ports), Saji Cherian (fisheries), V Abdul Rehman (minority affairs), Chinju Rani (animal husbandry), K Rajan (revenue), P Prasad (agriculture) and J R Anil (civil supplies).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/respect-popular-sentiment-on-dropping-shailaja-but-it-s-final-pinarayi-vijayan-101621444356563.html

Covering the tube, two drops have to be added to the test kit by pressing. One has to wait for 15 minutes for the results to appear. Any result appearing after 20 minutes is considered invalid.At 15 minute, the app will ring and the result will be available on the app.The ICMR in its guideline said that the data on the mobile app will be centrally connected to a secure server that is connected with the ICMR Covid-19 testing portal. There is no threat to patient confidentiality, the ICMR said.All those who test positive do not require additional testing as this self-testing will be considered as true positives. Those who test negative may opt for RT-PCR testing. Such negative but symptomatic individuals may be treated as suspect Covid-19 cases.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/you-can-test-yourself-for-covid-at-home-icmr-issues-advisory-101621443773839.html
19-05-2021||India||'Khan Chacha' owner Navneet Kalra booked by ED for money laundering||The Enforcement Directorate (ED) on Wednesday registered a money laundering case against businessman and restaurateur, Navneet Kalra, who was arrested by Delhi Police on Sunday evening for allegedly hoarding oxygen concentrators and selling them at inflated prices, officials said on Wednesday.The money laundering probe against Kalra can get him in trouble as the ED is likely to dig out all his suspected financial transactions in the past.Kalra’s dramatic arrest from a farmhouse in Gurugram took place on Sunday even as a battery of lawyers was trying to obtain anticipatory bail for him from the Delhi high court throughout the week. He was being looked for since the recovery of 524 oxygen concentrators from three of his restaurants – Khan Chacha, Town Hall and Nege & Ju – and from the office of Matrix Cellular on May 7.As part of its probe under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA), the ED will look into the money trail of sale and purchase of oxygen concentrators, whether the hoarded concentrators were being given to the Covid-19 patients family members and caregivers at exorbitant prices and others who are involved with him, said an ED official who didn’t want to be named.The federal anti-money laundering probe agency has powers to attach properties if established that money made by the accused is proceeds of crime.Another officer said that they have already taken all documents relating to the case from the Delhi Police and an investigation has already begun after registering an ECIR (Enforcement Case Information Report) – equivalent to the First Information Report (FIR) – a few days ago.Delhi Police has claimed that it has evidence to prove that oxygen concentrators, which were bought for ₹14,000 to ₹15,000, were being sold for over ₹75,000.The demand for oxygen concentrators swelled during the fourth wave of the Covid-19 pandemic in the national capital with many hospitals running out of medical oxygen as the number of critically ill patients rose. Such concentrators, which can derive 80-90% pure oxygen from ambient air, were also a crucial part of the medical supplies and aids provided by many foreign countries to help India’s efforts against the pandemic.Four employees of Matrix Cellular Company, including its CEO and vice president, were also arrested in this case by the police. They were, however, granted bail by the court.Kalra is alleged to have purchased the concentrators from Matrix Cellular which had imported them.A lawyer, who represented Kalra in Delhi high court, refused to comment saying they have not been informed by the ED about the probe.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/khan-chacha-owner-navneet-kalra-booked-by-ed-for-money-laundering-101621441725275.html

"Though States like West Bengal and Tamil Nadu, with more number of Legislators in the Assembly have performed the swearing-in ceremony with lesser number, Government of Kerala, a forerunner in Covid-19 management, should restrict the number to the maximum to avoid the widespread COVID-19," the court said.The court gave the verdict in a plea filed by Dr K J Prince from a Thrissur-based NGO, 'Chikithsaneethi'. The petitioner alleged that the swearing-ing was to be conducted physically with the participation of more than 500 people and sought the court's intervention.The petitioner, a social activist, alleged that the function was going to be conducted in a situation where the disaster management authority had declared Triple Lockdown in four districts in Kerala including Thiruvananthapuram.Imposing further restrictions on the function, the court said, "Political parties shall take a decision as to whether all the MLAs are required to be present in the swearing-in ceremony." "The spouses and relatives of all the MLAs, except the designated ministers, are not required to participate in the swearing-in ceremony. The ceremony can be viewed from the residence of the respective MLAs," it said.The court said government officials required for the performance/participation in the ceremony alone shall be permitted.It directed the state government to consider whether the presence of all the special invitees, including the members of the state committee of the political parties, are required to be present, in view of the utmost adverse situation prevailing due to the pandemic.It said this direction applies to all the special invitees including persons who have contributed to the Chief Minister's Disaster Relief Fund (CMDRF).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-hc-allows-physical-swearing-in-of-pinarayi-government-says-exercise-utmost-caution-101621441008363.html
19-05-2021||India||On Kejriwal's Covid strain comment, Singapore says 'reserve right to invoke fake news law'||Singapore’s high commissioner Simon Wong told a virtual news conference that his country was satisfied with the Indian government's clarification on Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal’s remarks about a new Covid-19 strain allegedly being detected in Singapore. Wong said the country reserves the right to invoke a domestic fake news law to prevent the spreading of misinformation.High commissioner Wong said Singapore wants to put aside the “unfortunate chapter” caused by Kejriwal’s remarks and focus on the shared fight against the pandemic. Referring to the law called Protection from Online Falsehoods and Manipulation Act (POFMA), he added, “So, we reserve the right to invoke POFMA on some of the comments and assertions made by the honourable chief minister on this topic.”Kejriwal’s remarks triggered a diplomatic spat on Wednesday, with the Southeast Asian country calling in the Indian envoy to lodge an objection.Also read | From Jaishankar to Singapore minister Vivian Balakrishnan: Who said what on Kejriwal's Covid variant claimIndian high commissioner P Kumaran clarified Kejriwal had “no competence” to comment on Covid-19 variants, external affairs ministry spokesperson Arindam Bagchi said in a tweet. External affairs minister S Jaishankar described Kejriwal’s remarks as “irresponsible” and said the chief minister didn’t speak for India.It is rare for the external affairs ministry to acknowledge that an Indian envoy has been called in by a foreign government to lodge a protest, and also to publicly criticise an elected Indian official.Hours after Kejriwal tweeted on Tuesday about the alleged new Covid-19 strain in Singapore and asked the Centre to immediately suspend flights from that country, Singapore’s health ministry dismissed his assertions and said the variant prevalent in many Covid-19 cases in recent weeks was the “B.1.617.2 variant, which originated in India”.“Singapore Government called in our High Commissioner today to convey strong objection to Delhi CM's tweet on ‘Singapore variant’. High Commissioner clarified that Delhi CM had no competence to pronounce on Covid variants or civil aviation policy,” Bagchi tweeted.Jaishankar tweeted that Singapore and India are solid partners in the fight against Covid-19, and appreciated Singapore's role as a logistics hub and oxygen supplier.“However, irresponsible comments from those who should know better can damage long-standing partnerships. So, let me clarify – Delhi CM does not speak for India,” he added.Also read: Coronavirus variant found in Singapore can be India's 3rd wave, extremely dangerous for kids, warns Arvind KejriwalEarlier on Wednesday, Singapore foreign minister Vivian Balakrishnan quoted Kejriwal’s original tweet and wrote on Twitter: “Politicians should stick to facts! There is no ‘Singapore variant’.”Balakrishnan included in his tweet a link to an article in the publication Nature with the headline “Coronavirus variants are spreading in India – what scientists know so far”. The article said Covid-19 variants, including B.1.617, have been linked to the massive surge in infections in India in recent weeks.Singapore’s foreign ministry rejected “unfounded assertions” on social media by Kejriwal and expressed its disappointment “that a prominent political figure had failed to ascertain the facts before making such claims”. These concerns were conveyed to the Indian envoy, the ministry said.People familiar with developments said on condition of anonymity that the Singapore government reacted so strongly because Kejriwal’s assertions had not gone down well with the public. Many people had taken umbrage at his remarks and publicly complained about them, the people said.The Singapore health ministry’s statement of Tuesday cited Indian media reports quoting Kejriwal and said, “There is no truth whatsoever in the assertions found within the reports.”The statement added, “There is no ‘Singapore variant’. The strain that is prevalent in many of the Covid-19 cases in recent weeks is the B.1.617.2 variant, which originated in India. Phylogenetic testing has shown this B.1.617.2 variant to be associated with several clusters in Singapore.”Kejriwal had asked the Centre to immediately suspend flights from Singapore because the alleged new strain was suspected to affect children. Union aviation minister Hardeep Puri responded to Kejriwal’s remarks by saying there were no regular flights between India and Singapore, except for a few under the Vande Bharat mission to repatriate Indian nationals.Kejriwal had said in his tweet in Hindi, “The new form of Covid-19 that has come to Singapore is being said to be extremely dangerous for children. In India, it may come as a third wave. My appeal to the Central government: 1. Air services with Singapore be cancelled with immediate effect 2. Priority on vaccine options should be worked out for children too.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/on-kejriwal-s-covid-strain-comment-singapore-says-reserve-right-to-invoke-fake-news-law-101621439786020.html

Govt's principal scientific advisor explains||Apart from adhering to social distancing and mask rules, ventilation plays a key role in stopping the transmission of the Covid-19 virus, the office of the principal scientific adviser to the government of India said issuing a detailed guideline on stopping the transmission. Advisor Dr K VijayRaghavan recently tweeted that whether vaccinated or not, one must not forget the three principles of crushing the pandemic — masks, physical distancing and ventilation. The detailed guideline comes as an extension of the advice."Just as smells can be diluted by ventilation, the dangerous concentration of the virus can be reduced by ensuring that outdoor air flows in," the guideline said adding that the placement of the fan is also crucial as the fan should not be at a place where it can cause contaminated air to flow directly to someone else. If the windows and doors of a room are shut, the exhaust fans should keep running. "Add an exhaust fan OR turn a pedestal fan into an exhaust fan by turning it to face outdoors, to create the ideal airflow for maximum protection from indoor infection," the guideline said.'Vaccinated or not': Government's scientific advisor has 3 tips against Covid-19For workspaces, the guideline suggests keeping windows and doors ajar with the air-conditioners running so that clean air can enter and dilute virus particles. For maximum air circulation, the addition of an exhaust fan has also been suggested.Lack of windows, cross-ventilation creates excessive viral load and increase the chances of infection inside poorly ventilated spaces, the guideline said.Explaining why utmost caution is the need of the hour, the guideline reiterated that some infected people may never show any symptoms but can release enough droplets to create a "viral load" that can infect many others."Saliva and nasal discharge in the form of droplets and aerosols carry the virus from one person to another. Larger size droplets fall to the ground and on surfaces, and smaller aerosol particles are carried in the air to greater distances. In closed un-ventilated indoor spaces, droplets and aerosols become quickly concentrated and greatly increase the risk of transmission to people in the area," the Centre said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/how-does-bad-ventilation-spread-covid-govt-s-principal-scientific-advisor-explains-101621440662571.html

Government's principal scientific advisor Dr K VijayRaghavan, early this month, said that a third wave of the pandemic is likely to strike India again. It can be avoided if by that time a large number of people are vaccinated, he said, adding that social distancing and wearing of the mask will remain equally important.That the third wave will be dangerous for children has not been scientifically claimed anywhere but doing the rounds for quite some time. Justice DY Chandrachud, while hearing a case on Covid-19 management in the Supreme Court, commented that the third wave will affect children. The Maharashtra government said it was setting up paediatric covid wards, in preparation for the third wave.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/what-we-know-so-far-about-new-covid-strain-in-singapore-101621434435955.html

19-05-2021||India||Kejriwal's remarks would not impact India-Singapore ties, says High Commissioner||Simon Wong, Singapore High Commissioner to India, said on Wednesday that Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal’s recent comment regarding the new Covid variant reported in Singapore would have no impact on India-Singapore’s efforts to fight Covid-19 “hand-in-hand”. Wong also said that Singapore has continued to transport medical aid in a spirit of working together to combat the pandemic, which knows no political colour or boundary.“It (Delhi CM's remarks) would not impact our (India-Singapore) hand-in-hand fight against Covid. As witnessed yesterday and today with transportation of medical aid, we're working together. Pandemic knows no boundary or political colour,” ANI said quoting Wong.Arvind Kejriwal’s remark on a new variant of Covid-19 found in Singapore and affecting children had set off a political storm. Arindam Bagchi, the ministry of external affairs spokesperson, said on Twitter that the Singapore government has registered a strong objection to Kejriwal’s remarks. The Indian High Commissioner clarified that Kejriwal has no authority to make such remarks, a point reiterated by external affairs minister S Jaishankar.The High Commissioner also said that the Singapore government had deliberated invoking their Protection from Online Falsehoods and Manipulation Act to counter online misinformation but the Government of India’s clarification had been satisfactory hence the Act was not invoked.“In Singapore, we have Protection from Online Falsehoods and Manipulation Act (POFMA) to mitigate misinformation and we reserve the right to invoke POFMA on assertions made by CM (Delhi). However, we're satisfied with GoI's clarification,” said Wong.As per World Health Organization’s practice, a strain does not get geographical names, as the practice focuses only on the scientific aspects of combating a pandemic rather than pointing fingers at anyone.“The Singapore Government prefers to deal with viruses and its variants in scientific terms. We abide closely with WHO’s recommendation of not giving the virus any geographical name. We focus more on the scientific aspect rather than to put a finger on anyone” he added.WHO had released a guideline in 2015 which advised against naming diseases, viruses or variants after the countries from which they originate as it could stigmatise the people living there.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kejriwals-remarks-would-not-impact-india-singapore-ties-says-high-commissioner-101621430535127.html

The head of the neurology department of All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) Delhi, Prof MV Padma Srivastava, on Wednesday said that the number of black fungus infections has crossed the 3-digit mark at the hospital and are increasing rapidly, reported the news agency ANI.More than 20 cases of black fungus are reported daily, said Prof Srivastava, adding that mucor wards have been made separately at AIIMS Trauma Centre and AIIMS Jhajjar, reported ANI.Also read: Karnataka forms task force on black fungus, so far identifies 97 cases in state"The number of Black fungus cases is increasing rapidly.

Currently, 69 patients are admitted in the hospital with mucormycosisThe risk of contracting black fungus is very high because of the low immunity caused due to the use of steroids in the treatment of Covid-19 infections.

The previous deadline expired on March 31 and many NGOs argued this was hampering their work related to Covid-19 relief. Several NGOs approached Delhi and Gauhati high courts seeking exemption from opening bank accounts in New Delhi.The amended Foreign Contribution Registration Act (FCRA), enacted in September 2020, made it mandatory for all office bearers of NGOs to register their Aadhar details and open designated accounts in Delhi if they wished to receive foreign funds.Also Read | RBI’s reading of the economy“Existing FCRA holders have now to open the FCRA account in SBI New Delhi up to June 30,” said a ministry order on Tuesday. It said that post July 1, the NGOs not having an account in SBI will not be able to receive any foreign funding.The ministry also issued another order on Tuesday saying that the validity of FCRA licences that expired or have been expiring since September 2020 will now remain valid till September end this year.The government made the FCRA stringent last year by including clauses that prohibit public servants from receiving any funds from abroad. It also made Aadhar registration mandatory for NGOs, prohibited transfer of foreign funds to another person and designated the SBI branch in New Delhi as the only one where such funds can be received.The amended law also does not allow NGOs to use more than 20% of foreign funds for administrative purposes, a limit which was 50% earlier.Advocate Abishek Jebaraj, who is representing an Andhra Pradesh NGO in Delhi high court, said: “We are happy that it gives us immediate relief, but 40 days exemption is not enough, especially for NGOs working in states like Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu and have to submit documents in New Delhi. ...opening a bank account and actually operationalising it takes time...”Jebaraj said around 12 NGOs have challenged the FCRA rule in the high court.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-relaxes-deadline-for-opening-account-in-sbi-for-foreign-funds-by-ngos-101621428152987.html

From mask and sanitiser distribution in the early days of Covid-19 in 2020, the activists are now involved in the daily struggle for getting hospital beds, oxygen cylinders and plasma since the second wave of the pandemic hit the country and overwhelmed its health infrastructure.Also Read | BJP leader names ‘author’ of Congress ‘toolkit’“We have a dedicated team of workers who track the availability of beds and when someone calls us for admission to hospitals, we try to send them to hospitals where beds are available. While the bigger hospitals are entirely occupied, we often locate beds in smaller hospitals,” said Srinivas BV, the president of the IYC, who was among the nine politicians questioned by the Delhi police for allegedly hoarding oxygen cylinders and medicines.Congress functionaries said they are now singularly focused on Covid relief activities as no elections are round the corner. The party has sought donations from resourceful leaders and asked its lawmakers to provide at least two ambulances in their areas. The party has also formed Covid-19 control rooms across the country.A committee, headed by former Union health minister Ghulam Nabi Azad, has held at least four meetings to discuss the Covid situation.The Youth Congress has been equipped with five ambulances and three hearses. “Ambulances were quoting exorbitant amounts to ferry patients. That is why we decided to have our own ambulances,” said Srinivas.The funds for the relief measures are coming from states such as Punjab, Chhattisgarh and Karnataka, the functionaries said. “The state Congress committees are raising resources themselves. We know for sure Karnataka, Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh, Punjab, Telangana, Kerala and Jharkhand are doing it themselves,” said a Congress leader.The party has its main Covid control room on New Delhi’s Gurdwara Rakabganj Road. It has asked its state units to established state command centres for relief works.The IYC has asked all its members to donate money for the cause. “Many of our members have also donated blood,” said Srinivas.The Congress’s relief works are not entirely without their share of problems. “Sometimes, people demand that we get them admitted to big, south Delhi hospitals. We tell them, not possible but they refuse to listen,” said Srinivas.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/singularly-focused-on-covid-relief-activitiescongress-101621424672295.html

It reiterated that the document on Central Vista was genuine, but that the BJP had concocted the other one on Covid-19 to defame the Congress. “...We made a research note on Central Vista for the party It’s genuine and fact-based.

The document also spoke about briefing foreign journalists over India’s mismanagement of the second wave of the pandemic.The Congress maintained the document on Covid is fake and has been concocted and lodged a complaint of forgery and cybercrime with the Delhi Police.

He also urged the Centre to immediately cancel all air services with Singapore. The claim triggered reactions from Union ministers, the Singapore government as well as Singapore people.Here is who said what contributing to the ongoing controversy.Union civil aviation minister Hardeep Singh Puri said India does not have an air bubble with Singapore and so all international flights between India and Singapore are already suspended. Only flights under Vande Bharat are operational.Niti Aayog (health) member VK Paul said experts are looking into the issue.Singapore's health ministry said there is no Singapore variant. The strain is B.1.617.2, which "originated" in India.Spokesperson of the ministry of external affairs Arindam Bagchi said Delhi's chief minister does not speak for India. Bagchi said the Singapore government called in Indian High Commissioner to convey the government's objection to Kejriwal's claim of 'Singapore variant'.

The study by North Eastern Tea Association (NETA), an organisation of tea producers, says the crop deficit from January to May this year will be about 60 million kgs, or about 40%, in comparison to that of the same period in 2019. “We have not compared crop figures with 2020 because last year, the crop deficit from January to May was 78 million kgs due to Covid lockdown,” said NETA advisor Bidyananda Barkakoty. While in 2019, the annual tea production in Assam was 716.49 million kgs, it was down to 618.20 million kgs in 2020, a 14% drop owing largely to the lockdown.According to NETA, the average rainfall deficit is about 45% between January and April this year in comparison to that of the same period last year in the main tea growing districts of Assam. Even in 2019, the state did not report poor rainfall. “Nowadays, rainfall is highly localised and there is a difference in the quantum of rainfall within few kilometres of distance. The study assessed crop loss due to the impact of prolonged drought-like situation. It took into account rainfall received in the last few days,” said Barkakoty.

The state’s average annual tea production is between 630-700 million kg. “Tea industry of Assam is facing tough times again this year. This year, a severe deficit of rainfall in the early part of the season has wreaked havoc in tea production,” said NETA chairman Sunil Jallan. “Extreme weather fluctuations, both in terms of temperature and rainfall, have impacted growth of tea leaves severely. Temperature drop from 34 to 19 degrees centigrade (°C), coupled with hardly any sunshine for the last one week, is playing havoc with the crop,” said Mrigendra Jalan, adviser, Bharatiya Cha Parishad . The second wave of Covid-19 has also affected several tea gardens in Assam. Earlier this month, three gardens in Tinsukia and Biswanath districts were declared containment zones after over 300 Covid cases were detected there. Last week, the state government announced a set of SOPs for management of Covid in tea gardens.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/assam-tea-industry-looks-at-major-crop-loss-now-due-to-poor-rainfall-101621420217741.html

The snow-free axis is expected to be completed by 2024.According to South Block officials, defence minister Rajnath Singh and top officials decided in favour of the BRO proposal instead of National Highways and Infrastructure Development Corporation Limited (NHIDCL), which was recommending an altogether new road alignment with a 13.5km tunnel under Shinkun La.ALSO READ: One year after Galwan clash, defence ministry to decide on Shinkun La tunnel“Both BRO and NHIDCL made presentations before the minister in March 2021. After studying both the proposals, the defence ministry has decided in favour of shorter tunnel. The decision could not be put on the paper as a number of senior officials involved in this project were hit by Covid-19 infection,” said a top official. The NHIDCL has been preparing detailed project report of the project since 2017, much before the Chinese Army transgressed into Ladakh in May 2020.It is understood that the total cost of the BRO tunnel construction will be around ₹1,000 crore due to simple design and requirement of basic electromechanical fittings. The 4.25km tunnel will have longitudinal ventilation using banana fans, which require minimum electricity and operational costs.The Darcha-Padum-Nimmu road is 297-kilometre long with 100km already converted into double lane and black-topped by the BRO last year at the height of India-China border skirmish. While the distance between Manali and Leh will remain the same with the new road, the axis will remain totally snow-free round the year allowing movement of both troops and equipment to feed Ladakh, Kargil and Siachen sectors.ALSO READ: The Galwan Valley face-off explained through 17 news reportsThe present Manali-Sarchu-Upshi-Leh road goes over four high mountain passes of around 5,000-metre in height even after construction of Atal tunnel under Rohtang pass and remains snowed for at least two to three months during winter.The four passes on present Manali-Leh route are: Baralacha La (16500 feet), Nakee La (15547 feet), Lachung La (16616 feet) and Tanglang La (17480 feet).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/defence-ministry-clears-the-bro-tunnel-under-shinkun-la-in-ladakh-101621414374031.html
19-05-2021||India||Govt asks WhatsApp to withdraw privacy policy||The government has again asked WhatsApp to withdraw its new privacy policy as it undermines “informational privacy, data security, and user choice” while warning the mobile messaging service provider it will take necessary steps in consonance with the Indian law if satisfactory action was not taken.In a notice issued on Tuesday, the government said the policy’s deferral beyond May 15 does not absolve WhatsApp from respecting values of informational privacy and data security. The company has been given seven days to respond.The contentious policy includes mandatory sharing of data with WhatsApp’s parent company Facebook and proposes to take away the choice for users to opt-out of it. It triggered a backlash and boycott calls over the concerns about data security. Many users moved to other messaging applications such as Signal and Telegram and prompted WhatsApp on January 16 to delay the introduction of the changes.Also Read | Users not accepting privacy terms to face limited functionality: WhatsAppIn the notice, the ministry of electronics and information technology said WhatsApp was treating users in India and Europe differently. “...many Indian citizens depend on WhatsApp to communicate in everyday life. It is not just problematic, but also irresponsible, for WhatsApp to leverage this position to impose unfair terms and conditions on Indian users, particularly those that discriminate against Indian users vis-à-vis users in Europe.”The notice said the policy violates several provisions of the Indian laws and rules.It added it undermines “the sacrosanct values of informational privacy, data security and user choice for Indian users and harms the rights and interests of Indian citizens”.India is Facebook-owned WhatsApp’s biggest market with about 400 million users.WhatsApp on Friday last said that its users will not lose functionality on May 15 if they do not agree to the policy as it confirmed that it had pushed back its deadline for its roll-out. The policy was initially meant to leave people with no option but to agree with the policy if they wanted to keep using the app.The confirmation came amid reports that indicated the company could gradually put some functionality out of users’ reach, before eventually leaving users with no choice but to delete the app. The company said a majority of users have approved the update as it reiterated it does not impact the privacy of personal messages.The Guardian on Friday last reported WhatsApp users will be unable to dismiss the screen asking them to accept the new terms beginning May 15. It said the users will still be able to receive calls and reply to messages through notifications. “In time, however, even that will be disabled, leaving users with no choice but to accept the new rules, or delete their accounts entirely.”An official, requesting anonymity, said WhatsApp earlier claimed that it officially deferred its new privacy policy beyond May 15. “However, the ministry, in its communication, today [Tuesday] stated that deferral of the privacy policy...does not absolve WhatsApp from respecting the values of informational privacy, data security and user choice for Indian users,” said the official. The official cited the government’s sovereign responsibility to protect the rights and interests of Indian citizens and added it will consider options available under the laws in India.In a letter dated January 18 to WhatsApp chief executive officer Will Cathcart, the government earlier said the proposed changes to the privacy policy “raise grave concerns regarding the implications for the choice and autonomy of Indian citizens”. The policy has also been challenged in the Delhi high court.HT reached out to WhatsApp for a response to the ministry’s notice but did not receive one immediately.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-asks-whatsapp-to-withdraw-privacy-policy-101621418658055.html

19-05-2021||India||IPS officer charge sheeted for sexually assaulting colleague’s daughter in Assam||The Assam police have charge-sheeted an Indian Police Service (IPS) officer for allegedly sexually harassing and assaulting a colleague’s 14-year-old daughter. “The charge sheet was filed after investigation and evidence revealed [Gaurav] Upadhyay’s involvement in the case. The allegations against him have been established,” said criminal investigation department (CID) deputy superintendent Pradip Kumar Das.The charge sheet, under Indian Penal Code’s Sections 354, 354 A (assault or criminal force to outrage modesty, sexual harassment) and the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, was filed in March but its details were earlier unavailable. The trial in the case is yet to begin.Upadhyay, a 2012 batch IPS officer from Uttar Pradesh, was Karbi Anglong police superintendent when he allegedly sexually assaulted the girl in December 2019. He was transferred to Chirang last week as part of mass transfers of police officers after the new government took office this month.Also Read | Assam professor arrested for raping minor, abetting her death by ‘suicide’According to the charge sheet, the girl’s mother, a senior police officer, had gone to Diphu, headquarters of Karbi Anglong, along with her daughter and nine-year-old son in December 2019 to attend the birthday party of Upadhyay’s son. After the party, Upadhyay took the senior officer and her children to show them his office building near his official residence. Upadhyay allegedly forcibly kissed the girl on her lips twice in presence of her brother when their mother excused herself to go to the washroom.Around 2.30am, Upadhyay dropped the three at a hotel where he had booked a suite for them. Upadhyay allegedly touched the girl inappropriately on the pretext of showing her a video on his mobile phone in the sitting room of the suite while her brother and mother were in the bedroom. Upadhyay tried to kiss the girl, but she rushed to the bedroom and closed the door. He apologised for his behaviour when the mother confronted him over it the following day after coming to know about it.The mother filed a case on January 3, 2020, at a women police station in Guwahati before the case was transferred to the CID. “During the investigation, sufficient evidence has been found to prove that the accused police officer...committed aggravated sexual assault. The accused person used criminal force on the minor victim girl to outrage her modesty, sexually harassed her... ,” said the charge sheet, a copy of which HT has seen. It has cited a psychiatrist’s report saying the girl suffered from depression and anxiety as a result of the “mentally traumatic experience”.Upadhyay was unavailable for comments.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ips-officer-charge-sheeted-for-sexually-assaulting-colleague-s-daughter-in-assam-101621416737517.html
19-05-2021||India||Nitin Gadkari says he was 'unaware', a day after his vaccine ramp-up suggestions||Union minister Nitin Gadkari on Wednesday said he was not aware that the government already spelt out the vaccination ramp-up plan in which different vaccine makers are being invited to boost the manufacturing. This comes a day after the minister, in a video address on Tuesday, suggested that more companies should be given the licence to manufacture the vaccine. The Union minister's comment met criticism as Congress leader Jairam Ramesh said this suggestion was given by Dr Manmohan Singh. "But is his Boss listening?" the Congress leader said in an apparent jibe to Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Not only Dr Manmohan Singh, but several chief ministers also suggested this knowledge sharing to increase India's vaccine production.I was unaware that his ministry has started these efforts before I had given suggestion yesterday. I am glad and congratulate he and his team for this timely intervention in the right direction. I feel important to put this on record."If the demand for vaccine is more than the supply, it creates the problem. So, instead of one company, let 10 more companies be given the license to manufacture the vaccine," Gadkari said. This is something the government has already started doing as three public sector undertakings — Hyderabad's Indian Immunologicals Limited, Uttar Pradesh's Bharat Immunologicals and Biologicals Corporation and Mumbai's Haffkine Institute for Training — will start manufacturing Covaxin.But is his Boss listening? This is what Dr. Manmohan Singh had suggested on April 18th. https://t.co/iqgPgJJ6Y7Gadkari on Wednesday took to Twitter and admitted that he was "unaware" that efforts have started towards ramping up vaccine production before he gave his suggestion on Tuesday."Yesterday while participating at the conference organised by Swadeshi Jagaran Manch, I had made a suggestion to ramp up vaccine production. I was unaware that before my speech Minister for Chemical & Fertilizers Shri @mansukhmandviya had explained government’s efforts to ramp up vaccine production. After conference, he also informed me that, GoI is already facilitating vaccine manufacturing by 12 different plants/companies and rapid ramp up of production is expected in near future as a result of these efforts," Gadkari wrote on Twitter.The Centre has recently decided to allow more pharma companies to take up vaccine production. Defending that the idea to rope in more pharmacies was not an overnight decision, prompted by the suggestions of state chief ministers and opposition leaders, Niti Aayog (health) member VK Paul recently said that such complicated knowledge transfer does not take place in a week.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nitin-gadkari-says-he-was-unaware-a-day-after-his-vaccine-ramp-up-suggestions-101621415897281.html
19-05-2021||India||Centre concerned only about global image: Delhi govt on Singapore controversy||Delhi deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia on Wednesday said the Central government and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) are only concerned about their image globally and not about the well-being of the country’s children. His comment came a day after a tweet by chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on suspending flights between India and Singapore sparked controversy over a particular strain of Covid-19. Addressing a press conference on Wednesday, Sisodia said it is only Kejriwal who is worried about the risk of children contracting the infection and not the Central government. “Yesterday, Delhi CM Kejriwal had talked about the Covid-19 situation in Singapore. He had said that the danger of Covid-19 infecting more children is increasing. That is what it looks like going by the strain there, which is why it is necessary that we also remain alert... Singapore’s education minister had also given a statement that the risk of children getting infected is increasing. But, today BJP has started dirty politics on the issue,” he said. Kejriwal on Tuesday had talked about two things, Sisodia said. One, about the strain in Singapore and two, about children. “Today, from what the Central government and the BJP are saying, it has become clear that Kejriwal is worried about the children of our country. But, the BJP and the Central government are only concerned about Singapore. They won’t get vaccines for children, but they are worrying about Singapore,” he said. Also Read | No new Covid strain detected here, Singapore health ministry counters Kejriwal“A few months back, a new strain was detected in London as well. Despite several warnings, the Central government did not take necessary actions or measures in time because of which India is now reeling under such a terrible situation. Today, the entire country is suffering because of the Central government’s negligence. Thousands have died,” Sisodia said. “From scientists to even the Supreme Court is saying that children are in danger because of this strain of virus. They have warned that whatever the next strain is, it could affect children on a large scale leading to a potential third wave. But, we are not understanding this. The issue is not Singapore, the issue is the children of our country. Parents in India are worried about their children and not about India’s image before Singapore. They (Central government) sold vaccines meant for our children to other countries only to feel happy about a poster that was put up there. They are not worried about the children. The BJP and the Centre can keep worrying about their image across the world, but we will keep worrying about our children,” the deputy chief minister said. Kejriwal’s remarks about a new coronavirus strain allegedly being detected in Singapore triggered a diplomatic spat on Wednesday, with the Southeast Asian country calling in the Indian envoy to lodge an objection.Indian high commissioner P Kumaran clarified Kejriwal had “no competence” to comment on Covid-19 variants, external affairs ministry spokesperson Arindam Bagchi said in a tweet. External affairs minister S Jaishankar described Kejriwal’s remarks as “irresponsible” and said the chief minister didn’t speak for India.It is rare for the external affairs ministry to acknowledge that an Indian envoy has been called in by the government of another country to lodge a protest, and also to publicly criticise an elected Indian official.Hours after Kejriwal tweeted on Tuesday about the alleged new coronavirus strain in Singapore and asked the Centre to immediately suspend flights from that country, Singapore’s health ministry dismissed his assertions and said the variant prevalent in many Covid-19 cases in recent weeks was the “B.1.617.2 variant, which originated in India”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-concerned-only-about-global-image-delhi-govt-on-singapore-controversy-101621415957443.html

He added it now costs ₹1,900. “This is the first time in 74 years that a government has increased the prices of fertilisers so drastically.” He asked the government to slash the prices of the fertilisers and stop exploiting the 620 million farmers.Also Read | Rajasthan BJP MLA Gotam Lal Meena dies due to Covid-19Surjewala said the Centre is currently levying 5%, 18%, 12%, and 12% Goods and Services Tax on fertilizers, pesticides, agricultural equipment and tractors. He also slammed the government for increasing the price of diesel by ₹21.22 in a year. “Apart from the raw material, what farmers need the most is diesel. By increasing the prices and imposing ₹28-37 as excise duty, the government is really torturing the farmers.” Surjewala cited estimates and said the price increase has put an additional burden of ₹20,000 crore on the farmers.He said by increasing the prices of all raw material, passing three “black” farm laws last year, increasing the price of diesel and levying tax on agriculture, the government is proving that its DNA is anti-farmer. “The government is destroying the agricultural sector. This is a conspiracy to make the farmers slaves.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/governments-dna-anti-farmer-says-congress-101621413737406.html

So far, over 16 BJP workers have been killed in the post-election violence and property of several families associated with BJP has been destroyed with their lives under threat. Governor Jagdeep Dhankar had last week claimed that lakhs of such persons affected by violence are staying in camps in Assam. Also Read | Is apprehension of death due to Covid ground for bail? SC to hear next weekUpadhyay made out a ground for imposition of President Rule in the state as he claimed that the violence or massacre of BJP workers by alleged TMC goons enjoyed the patronage of the state leadership. His petition said, “The petitioner prays for issuance of direction to the Governor (Respondent No.5) to submit his report to this court under Article 356 of the Constitution of India so as to enable this court to ascertain as to whether there is complete failure and break down of constitutional machinery in the State. If upon such report so submitted, this court is satisfied that there is complete breakdown of constitutional machinery in the state, then this court may be pleased to hold and declare so.”Alternatively, the petition has also requested the court to consider passing directions to the Union Government to invoke Article 355 of the Constitution of India and give advice to the President of India to issue a proclamation for West Bengal under Article 356(1) of the Constitution of India. According to Upadhyay, the actions of the party in power have created “disunity and disaffection” among the people of the state, threatening to “disintegrate the democratic social fabric” which forms a basic feature of the Constitution.Article 356 is an Emergency Provision contained in the Constitution by which President can assume all functions of the state government after being satisfied on a report by the Governor that “a situation has arisen in which the government of the state cannot be carried on in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution.”Citing media reports, Upadhyay said that violence against BJP workers continues till date and the state has witnessed complete anarchy under the leadership of CM Mamta Banerjee. Accusing the state government of abdicating its duty to protect the lives and liberties of the people in the state, particularly those who voted for the rival party, BJP, in the 2021 Assembly polls, the petition found sufficient grounds to accuse the TMC and the state led by the chief minister of setting up a “party dictatorship” leading to complete “chaos and anarchy in the state”.As the state agencies are involved in perpetrating the violence, the petition demanded the West Bengal government to immediately disassociate itself from investigation of these cases and sought an independent probe by SIT into the killings and violence. This SIT should be headed by a retired Supreme Court judge and comprise retired officials drawn from Central Bureau of Investigation, National Investigation Agency, Research and Analysis Wing and should submit periodic reports to the top court, the petition added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/plea-in-sc-demands-prez-rule-in-bengal-seeks-sit-probe-in-bjp-workers-deaths-101621413137145.html
19-05-2021||India||India makes the first move on trade and investment agreement with EU||Union commerce and industry minister Piyush Goyal has written to his counterpart Valdis Dombrovskis last week to initiate the process for resumption of trade and investment negotiations following a decision in this regard arrived at the India-EU Leaders' Summit on May 8. This would involve setting up negotiating groups on different tracks and to begin formal engagement by the two sides.The negotiations towards India-EU Bilateral Trade and Investment Agreement (BTIA) were started in 2007 but suspended in 2013 after 16 rounds of talks. A decision to resume negotiations was a key deliverable of the Porto Summit on 8 May.ALSO READ: Can India and the EU operationalise their natural partnership?According to officials in Delhi, Union minister Goyal has always emphasised that negotiations on both investment and free trade agreement should be pursued parallelly and that both sides should seek their conclusion simultaneously.The EU had always been in favour of a stand-alone investment agreement and agreed to a resumption of FTA negotiations only after a series of engagements held under the High Level Dialogue led by minister Goyal and Vice-President Dombrovskis. These engagements demonstrated considerable common ground for both sides to agree to pursue the two agreements on separate yet parallel tracks. In the post-summit pubic engagements, leaders on both sides had also acknowledged this understanding with Dombrovskis underlining the need for early conclusion of both agreements which were mutually reinforcing.ALSO READ: India and EU to seal connectivity agreement, revive negotiations on tradeGoyal’s letter to Dombrovskis clearly sets the stage for the two sides to appoint senior officials on both sides to begin negotiations for the investment and trade agreement. These negotiations, as the India-EU Joint Statements points out, will be carried out under the supervision of the two ministers. It is likely that an additional secretary from the Commerce Ministry will lead the negotiations from the Indian side.Various studies in the past have indicated that both India and the EU would benefit significantly through an FTA. The EU is India’s second largest export market and for the EU, India’s rapidly growing economic size should make India an attraction for the EU.A GED Study in September 2016 had indicated that an FTA could increase India’s economic performance measured by GDP by 1.3 percent annually. A more recent study by a European Parliament think-tank has similarly brought out substantial benefits for both sides, though the extent of benefits would also depend on the depth of openings and extent of liberalisation brought in both sides.While Dombrovskis reply is awaited by the commerce ministry, both the sides have decided to work towards resilient global supply chains and share their perspectives on the Indo-Pacific. Already, the EU under pressure from Greens and Liberals have suspended the comprehensive trade and investment with China, which was primarily pushed by German Chancellor Angela Merkel and France to some extent.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-makes-the-first-move-on-trade-and-investment-agreement-with-eu-101621412090154.html

State health minister K Sudhakar said in Bengaluru that vaccination was the way forward for the state in its fight against Covid-19. “Karnataka received 200,000 doses of Covishied today as part of the order placed by the state government. So far, the state has received 1,094,000 doses (950,000 Covishield & 144,000 Covaxin) as part of direct procurement from manufacturers in addition to 11,124,470 doses received from GoI,” the minister also posted on Twitter.The state government has placed orders for at least 30 million doses of vaccines from both SII and Hyderabad-based Bharat Biotech that produces Covaxin.The state had to suspend its vaccination drive of the first dose for 18-44 age group as well as those above 45 due to late delivery of vaccine.This shortage brought down the daily inoculations to 65,181 on Tuesday (till 3.30pm) that takes the total to 11,348,708. Only 2.5 million people have received both the doses which accounts for less than 4% of the state’s entire population estimated at 65 million.Also Read | Data reveals Karnataka Police lost almost 1 cop daily to 2nd wave of Covid-19Karnataka remains one of the most impacted regions in the country as cases continue to surge in most places even though it has shown signs of letting up in Bengaluru. However, experts also say that a drop in testing could also be the reason for fewer cases being reported.Sudhakar said though the state is seeing a higher recovery rate, the next challenge is to bring down the fatality rate, identifying new infections and giving appropriate treatment at the earliest.“The second way forward for the state is that everyone in Karnataka should be administered the vaccines at the earliest. The government is striving towards ensuring 100% coverage to the entire population by October or November-end,” Sudhakar said in Bengaluru on Wednesday.He said that the Centre has so far provided the state with 11,126,340 doses. Of the purchases made directly by the state government, it has so far received 950,000 doses of Covishield and 144,170 doses of Covaxin. These, he said, bring the doses received by the state so far to 12,220,510.“We are looking to import vaccines from abroad,” the minister added. He said Russian-developed Sputnik will have a manufacturing plant in Karnataka which raises hopes of completing the vaccination drive in the state “before the entire country”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/karnataka-aiming-to-achieve-100-covid-vaccination-by-nov-end-health-minister-101621411819910.html

Even as the process of identification of the deceased is ongoing it is not yet clear as to which vessels they were from.A tug boat has reportedly sunk in the Arabian Sea during cyclone Tauktae. It had 13 members on board, two of whom have been rescued by the Navy and search is on for the remaining 11 individuals.Ships and aircrafts of the Indian Navy had been searching the waters off the coast of Mumbai for the missing 89 individuals who were onboard the barge that sank 35 nautical miles off Mumbai, in the aftermath of cyclone Tauktae. Barge P305, which was engaged by Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) in contractual work, sank around 7pm on Monday night with 273 crew members on-board. All of whom were forced to jump into the choppy water of the Arabian Sea as the barge sank.The navy has rescued 184 of the 273 crew members, some 20 hours after they were forced to brave the rough water of the sea. The subsequent rough weather conditions made it difficult to conduct search and rescue operations. Naval warship INS Kochi arrived in Mumbai on Wednesday with 125 crew members rescued from the barge.Navy and coast guard have also rescued 137 crew members of GAL Constructor, another barge that ran aground north off Mumbai.Deputy chief of Naval Staff Vice Admiral Murlidhar Sadashiv Pawar told reporters that the ongoing search and rescue operation is among the most challenging ones in the last four decades.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/indian-navy-retrieves-14-bodies-after-barge-sinks-into-arabian-sea-due-to-cyclone-tauktae-184-rescued-101621408631850.html

19-05-2021||India||Rajiv Gandhi assassination: Convict Nalini donates to CM’s relief fund||One of the seven convicts in former prime minister Rajiv Gandhi’s assassination case, Nalini Sriharan, who is presently serving life term in the Vellore women’s prison in Tamil Nadu, donated ₹5,000 to the Chief Minister’s Public Relief Fund (CMPRF) on Tuesday.On May 11, state chief minister MK Stalin introduced the fund and appealed to people to make donations that would be used for Covid-19 control. According to a government statement released on Tuesday, CMPRF has already collected ₹69 crore in a week. Of this, ₹25 crore has been earmarked to source Remdesivir and other drugs for Covid-19, and another ₹25 crore will be utilised to buy containers to transport liquid oxygen from other states. The donations came from industrialists, actors such as Rajinikanth, and Opposition AIADMK that donated ₹1 crore. Nalini’s lawyer Pugazhendhi Pandian said she donated the amount from her savings in the prisoners’ cash property account. According to Tamil Nadu prisons guidelines, the wages earned inside the prison and the money given to them by their family is kept in this account. Nalini earned inside the prison by stitching but stopped after the first wave of Covid-19, Pandian said. “She wrote to the police superintendent on Monday that she wants to donate and it was processed today,” he said. “She didn’t give any reason for her donation.” Also Read | Tamil Nadu invites bids for production of oxygen, concentrators and vaccinesPandhian said he planned to meet the chief minister and appeal for the release of life convicts, including Nalini, who have spent more than 10 years in prison. Nalini has spent 30 years in jail.She was sentenced to death for Rajiv Gandhi’s assassination in Sriperumbudur in Tamil Nadu on May 21, 1991, by a suicide bomber belonging to the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE). The sentence was reduced to life term on Sonia Gandhi’s intervention. The Gandhi family has, on several occasions, said that they have forgiven the convicts. In March 2008, Priyanka Gandhi Vadra went to meet convict Nalini in Vellore jail. The Supreme Court had commuted the sentence of the other six convicts in the case. Nalini’s donation comes on the same day as fellow convict AG Perarivalan’s mother appealed to Stalin to grant parole to her son who has comorbidities and is at a high-risk of contracting the virus inside Chennai’s Puzhal Central Prison. She has been fighting for the release of all the convicts for decades now. In 2018, the Tamil Nadu Cabinet unanimously passed a resolution for the release of all seven convicts and sent it to Governor Banwarilal Purohit. Three years later, Purohit declined to take a decision, saying it was the President who was the competent authority.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rajiv-gandhi-assassination-convict-nalini-donates-to-cm-s-relief-fund-101621405877210.html

Search operations were going on for the remaining 89 workers on the barge that sank about 35 nautical miles off Mumbai.The navy earlier until Tuesday evening rescued 180 of the 273 crew members from the barge, about 20 hours after they were forced to jump in the extremely rough sea after the barge sank.

It got de-anchored on Sunday night and according to deputy chief of naval staff, vice-admiral Murlidhar Sadashiv Pawar, the barge sank at 7pm on Monday in a very choppy sea and rough weather which made the subsequent search and rescue operation one of the most challenging operations the navy has undertaken in four decades.Karnik said INS Kochi and INS Kolkata are returning to Mumbai with rescued crew members. INS Beas, Betwa, and Teg, which joined the search and rescue for the barge on Tuesday, will continue the search with the help of P-8I aircraft and naval helicopters.The navy and coast guards have rescued all 137 crew members of GAL Constructor, another barge that ran aground north off Mumbai, near Satpati in Palghar district. The barge was being brought to Mumbai, when it got off from the tugboat that was toeing it to the Mumbai harbour on Sunday evening. The crew members tried to hold the barge in place by putting all its four anchors, but the cyclonic storm cut off the anchor, setting it adrift.Search and rescue were also conducted by the navy on Tuesday off the coast of Gujarat for three vessels, Support Station (SS) 3, Great Ship Aditi and Drill Ship Sagar Bhushan, which were 15-20 nautical miles south-east off Pipapav on the Gujarat coast.Karnik said the 196 personnel on SS 3 and 101 personnel on Sagar Bhushan are safe and they were being towed to safety.INS Talwar is anchored in the area as a precautionary measure.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cyclone-tauktae-navy-rescues-four-more-from-sunken-barge-101621404856884.html

External affairs minister S Jaishankar described Kejriwal’s remarks as “irresponsible” and said the chief minister did not speak for India.Kejriwal’s deputy, Manish Sisodia, hit out at the response to Singapore’s objection to the chief minister’s comments and added the Centre and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) were only concerned about their image globally and not about the well-being of the country’s children. Sisodia added only Kejriwal is worried about the risk of children contracting the infection and not the Centre. “[Kejriwal] said that the danger of Covid-19 infecting more children is increasing. That is what it looks like going by the strain there [Singapore]... which is why it is necessary that we also remain alert... Singapore’s education minister had also given a statement that the risk of children getting infected is increasing. But today the BJP has started dirty politics on the issue,” said Sisodia.Sisodia said the BJP and the Central government are only concerned about Singapore. “They won’t get vaccines for children, but they are worried about Singapore.” He added a few months back, a new strain was detected in London as well and despite several warnings, the Central government did not take necessary actions or measures in time because of which India is now facing a terrible situation. “Today, the entire country is suffering because of the Central government’s negligence. Thousands have died.”It is rare for the external affairs ministry to acknowledge that an Indian envoy has been called in by the government of another country to lodge a protest, and also to publicly criticise an elected Indian official.Hours after Kejriwal tweeted on Tuesday about the alleged new Coronavirus strain in Singapore and asked the Centre to immediately suspend flights from that country, Singapore’s health ministry dismissed his assertions and said the variant prevalent in many Covid-19 cases in recent weeks was the “B.1.617.2 variant, which originated in India”.“Singapore Government called in our High Commissioner today to convey strong objection to Delhi CM’s tweet on ‘Singapore variant’. High Commissioner clarified that Delhi CM had no competence to pronounce on Covid variants or civil aviation policy,” Bagchi tweeted.Jaishankar tweeted that Singapore and India are solid partners in the fight against Covid-19. He appreciated Singapore’s role as a logistics hub and oxygen supplier.“However, irresponsible comments from those who should know better can damage long-standing partnerships. So, let me clarify – Delhi CM does not speak for India,” he added.Earlier on Wednesday, Singapore foreign minister Vivian Balakrishnan quoted Kejriwal’s original tweet and wrote on Twitter: “Politicians should stick to facts! There is no ‘Singapore variant’.”Balakrishnan included in his tweet a link to an article in the publication Nature with the headline “Coronavirus variants are spreading in India – what scientists know so far”. The article said Coronavirus variants including B.1.617 have been linked to the massive surge in infections in India in recent weeks.Singapore’s foreign ministry rejected what it said were “unfounded assertions” on social media by Kejriwal and expressed its disappointment “that a prominent political figure had failed to ascertain the facts before making such claims”. These concerns were conveyed to the Indian envoy, the ministry said.People familiar with developments said on condition of anonymity that the Singapore government had reacted so strongly because Kejriwal’s assertions had not gone down well with the people of Singapore. Many people had taken umbrage at his remarks and publicly complained about them, they added.The Singapore health ministry’s statement of Tuesday had cited Indian media reports quoting Kejriwal and said: “There is no truth whatsoever in the assertions found within the reports.”The statement added: “There is no ‘Singapore variant’. The strain that is prevalent in many of the Covid-19 cases in recent weeks is the B.1.617.2 variant, which originated in India. Phylogenetic testing has shown this B.1.617.2 variant to be associated with several clusters in Singapore.”Kejriwal had asked the Centre to immediately suspend flights from Singapore because the alleged new strain was suspected to affect children. He also contended that the alleged new strain could lead to the third wave of infections in India and said the Centre should focus on identifying vaccines for children.Union aviation minister Hardeep Puri responded to Kejriwal’s remarks by saying that there were no regular flights between India and Singapore, except for a few under the Vande Bharat mission to repatriate Indian nationals.Kejriwal had said in his tweet in Hindi: “The new form of Covid-19 that has come to Singapore is being said to be extremely dangerous for children. In India, it may come as a third wave. My appeal to the Central government: 1. Air services with Singapore be cancelled with immediate effect 2. Priority on vaccine options should be worked out for children too.”Sisodia maintained scientists and even the Supreme Court are saying that children are in danger because of this strain of the virus. “They have warned that whatever the next strain is, it could affect children on a large scale leading to a potential third wave. But we are not understanding this. The issue is not Singapore. The issue is the children of our country. Parents in India are worried about their children and not about India’s image before Singapore.”Sisodia said the Centre sold vaccines meant for Indian children to other countries only to feel happy about posters that were put up there. “They are not worried about the children. The BJP and the Centre can keep worrying about their image across the world, but we will keep worrying about our children,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/singapore-calls-in-indian-envoy-objects-to-delhi-cm-s-comment-on-new-covid-strain-101621403776803.html

He was arrested on November 30 in the same year, but later released on bail in May 2014. He has denied the allegations.The court was earlier going to pronounce the verdict on April 27, but it was adjourned to May 12. On May 12, it was further deferred to May 19 because of a lack of staff members due the coronavirus pandemic, the court said.Tarun Tejpal faced trial under IPC sections 341 (wrongful restraint), 342 (wrongful confinement), 354 (assault or criminal force with intent to outrage modesty), 354-A (sexual harassment), 354-B (assault or use of criminal force to woman with intent to disrobe), 376(2)(f) (person in position of authority over women, committing rape) and 376(2)k) (rape by person in position of control), according to PTI.In 2017, the former journalist moved the Bombay High Court, seeking a stay on an order by the Mapusa sessions court which gave a nod to the framing of charges against him in the case. However, his petition was dismissed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/verdict-in-rape-case-against-former-tehelka-editor-tarun-tejpal-on-may-21-101621401170093.html

As many as 75% air passengers have registered their complaints against airlines in April.These passengers are either those who could not fly to their destination states due to travel restrictions there, or the those who failed to board their flight after testing positive for Covid-19 themselves. In both such cases, airlines have reportedly deducted a huge amount as cancellation charges. According to previous DGCA reports, November 62.4%; December 61.4%; January 41.%; February 54.6%; and March saw 65.7% refund-related complaints. According to the report, domestic carriers together registered 5.72 million air travellers in April compared to 7.8 million in March. Also Read | How Mumbai’s city officials made their city more Covid-ready than DelhiThe Indian aviation industry is still recovering from suspension of commercial flight operations last year due to the nationwide lockdown. The second wave of the pandemic hit the country hard in April, resulting in a decline in air traffic across the country,especially after foreign countries banned India flights. While the government has allowed airlines to operate at 80% of their seating capacities, fear of contracting the virus has seen poor footfall. The second wave of the pandemic has also brought in several travel restrictions and lockdowns in various states,forcing people to stay at home. Moreover, a significant number of passengers is also avoiding travel voluntarily. Due to these, passengers are demanding full refund,whereas few airlines allegedly are charging cancellation amounts from them,leading to an increase in such complaints.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/passenger-complaints-for-refund-highest-in-aprildgcareport-101621401976600.html
19-05-2021||India||One year after Galwan clash, defence ministry to decide on Shinkun La tunnel||A year after the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) transgressed into Gogra-Hot Springs and Pangong Tso area of eastern Ladakh, the Union defence ministry is on the verge of deciding the alignment of strategic Nimmu-Padum-Darcha road to feed supplies to Indian military formations in Ladakh sector. The new alignment will be the third axis to Ladakh and will be least exposed to the adversary as compared to Srinagar-Zoji La-Kargil axis and Manali-Upshi-Leh axis.According to officials in roads and highways and defence ministries, the Border Roads Organization (BRO) and the National Highways and Infrastructure Development Corporation (NHIDCL) have already made separate presentations before the top officials of the defence ministry last March and left the latter to decide on the alignment.Key to this new alignment is a proposed tunnel under 16,703-feet Shingo or Shinkun La, which gets snowed in and blocks traffic movement during at least three winter months. Situated on the border between Himachal Pradesh and Ladakh, the high mountain pass has snow round-the-year with BRO constructing motorable roads on both sides of the pass.According to geology study conducted by Snow and Avalanche Study Establishment on behalf of the BRO, the Manali based institute recommended three options of constructing tunnels to obviate the pass. The first option was a 4.25km tunnel located at an distance of 36.5km from Darcha (99 km stone on Manali-Sarchu road). The north portal of the proposed tunnel is 41km from Darcha. The other two proposed options are 7km tunnel and a 13.81km tunnel.For the BRO, the 4.25km tunnel is a preferred option as it addresses the most difficult portion of the road and remaining road could be kept open with snow clearance effort and some avalanche structures. The time for construction of this tunnel, which is already on the road axis, will be three working seasons and the road-tunnel will be completed by 2024.According to BRO, this option offers the best gradient, least overburden and least support requirements with Afcons, who constructed the Atal Tunnel, moving their equipment to build the tunnel under Shinkun la on a war footing.The NHIDCL, under the ministry of surface transport, on its part has suggested an altogether new road alignment, north-east of the present axis with a 13.5km tunnel under Shinkun La. Projecting this as a shortest route linking Atal Tunnel to the Darcha-Padun-Nimmu road, the NHDCL proposal involves building access roads on both sides to the proposed 13.5 km tunnel, which will take many a season to complete. The NHIDCL is preparing a detailed project report on the new route.While the defence ministry is still to take a decision on the two proposals, fact remains is that the third route is an urgent requirement given the Chinese Army seriously ramping up military infrastructure all along the 3,488km Line of Actual Control (LAC).Although the disengagement is completed between the two armies in Pangong Tso, the Western Theatre Command of PLA continues to remain deployed in eastern Ladakh and depth areas. The disengagement at Gogra-Hot Springs is still work in progress and any possibility of a LAC flare-up is not beyond the realms of military possibility. Time is running out on the Shinkun La tunnel.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/one-year-after-galwan-clash-defence-ministry-to-decide-on-shinkun-la-tunnel-101621399943200.html

He used to work at a local shop in Rangirkhari area in the town and was living with his 65-years old sister in a single room flat. His death has led to people questioning the district administration’s decision to allow the senior citizen to recover at home against the Covid-19 guidelines.The locals said they learnt about the incident around 4:45pm when the victim’s sister cried out for help. “When we went closer to the house, we saw she was crying and saying that her brother had died by suicide. He was a Covid positive person, so we could not help the family. We immediately informed the police and the health department,” said a neighbour.The victim’s sister said her brother was depressed about the restrictions imposed in the state to contain the infection as it had impacted the family’s income. “He had tested positive for Covid-19 last Friday and since then we have been in home isolation. Today at around 4:30 pm, I went to the washroom and when I stepped out, I saw him hanging. I don’t know why he took such a step and left me alone in this situation,” she said.She said she understood why her neighbours were reluctant to help. “It was not safe for anybody to come closer to a Covid-infected body.”Following his death, locals are questioning the administration’s decision to allow him to stay in home isolation despite his age and lack of mandatory space for the purpose. “Both of them were aged and ailing. At a time when the government has said a Covid positive person aged above 50 cannot stay at home, on what grounds did the local administration grant permission for home isolation?” asked Uttam Roy, a neighbour.Assam chief minister Himanta Biswa Sharma recently instructed deputy commissioners of all districts in the state to monitor the health of senior citizens in their jurisdictions. According to Covid-19 treatment guidelines, home isolation can only be granted to persons with adequate resources at home, however, the deceased was living in a one room kitchen unit with no separate toilets. It has one small access and an iron staircase.Officer in charge of Silchar Sadar police station Ditumoni Goswami said the body had been sent to Silchar Medical College and hospitals for post-mortem.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/assam-70-year-old-covid-patient-s-death-by-suicide-during-home-isolation-raises-questions-101621400536677.html

Some netizens called Shailaja’s omission a mistake amid the second Covid-19 wave as her work was appreciated during the first wave. Others compared her to another communist leader, late KR Gouri Amma, who was denied Kerala’s chief ministership in the 1980s. On Twitter, some questioned whether “ego and sexism” was behind Shailaja’s omission and said she merits an exception even if the ruling Communist Party of India (Marxism), or CPI(M), was inducting new faces.Shailaja, who also led Kerala’s fight against the Nipah virus in 2018, was re-elected to the Kerala assembly by a margin of 61,035 votes from Mattannur. Her victory margin was bigger than that of chief minister-elect Pinarayi Vijayan.Watch | KK Shailaja speaks after Left govt drops her from new Kerala Cabinet﻿﻿MB Rajesh, who is due to be sworn in as the Kerala Speaker, said those who are surprised or shocked or feel Shailaja’s exclusion was unexpected are unaware of the norms of CPI (M). “They compare us to other bourgeois parties, for whom parliamentary responsibilities are the sole responsibilities. For communists, parliamentary responsibilities are not the sole political activity. That is why Shailaja... has been replaced and given new responsibility of the party’s chief whip.”PA Muhammad Riyas’s inclusion into the ministry has also come under scrutiny as the head of the CPI(M)’s youth wing is also Vijayan’s son-in-law.Rajesh rejected allegations of nepotism. “You should not undermine Riyas’s contributions to the party by merely referring to him as the chief minister’s son-in-law. He is the DYFI [Democratic Youth Federation of India] president and his contribution to the party has been invaluable.”Rajesh also defended the invitation to 5,000 people for Vijayan and his ministry’s swearing-in on Thursday despite the pandemic. “The venue has a seating capacity of 50,000 people. So, all the Covid protocols and social distancing would be strictly followed. Also, 500 is the maximum number of people we are expecting. The actual number might be lower.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/shailajas-exclusion-from-kerala-cabinet-triggers-debate-cpi-m-defends-move-101621397716285.html

19-05-2021||India||Covid-19 stabilising in many states, says Centre||Coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic was stabilising in many states in India, said VK Paul, member (health), Niti Aayog, even as the country continues to report close to 300,000 daily new cases.“In many states the pandemic curve is stabilising, as a result of comprehensive efforts at containment, at testing, restrictions, and all the other efforts that people of those states are carrying out. States such as Maharashtra, Kerala, Karnataka, Telangana, Uttar Pradesh, Delhi, Rajasthan, Bihar, Chhattisgarh, and Madhya Pradesh,” said Paul during the weekly briefing on Covid-19 updates.Lav Agarwal, joint secretary, Union health ministry, presented a comparative data in the briefing to show how a lesser percentage of India’s population was infected with Covid-19 as compared to that in other countries.“The continued efforts made by the medical fraternity, by states and districts, in coordination with Union government, during the past one year and four months have ensured that there has been limited infection spread in the country. If you look at data, only 1.8% of country’s population has been affected with Covid-19 that was found to be laboratory confirmed positive case,” he said.Also Read | Consumption revival hit as Covid jolts middle classComparing the figures with other countries, Agarwal said that in United States about 10.1% of the population has been infected, in Brazil the percentage increased to 7.3%, in a developed country like France it is around 9%, in Russia about 3.4%, about 7.4% in Italy ...which goes on to show our efforts on ground, wherein we involved people at the community level, have resulted in the disease transmission having been curtailed to a large extent.They also said that there were still a few states where there continues to be concern in terms of the trajectory such as Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, West Bengal, Odisha, and to some extent, Punjab.“It is a mixed picture but there is overall stabilisation, and what we know from scientific analysis that the reproduction number (R0) is overall below 1 now,” said Paul.Experts, however, say it is too early to predict a trend.“It is not a good time to celebrate decrease in numbers as we are dealing with an infectious disease and it is way too early to say which direction the spread is going to take, especially since the disease has reached rural and tribal areas where health infrastructure is skeletal,” said a senior public health expert, requesting anonymity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid19-stabilising-in-many-states-says-centre-101621397056462.html

Her family was prevented from conducting her last rites since they didn’t inform the police after she was found dead on Monday at the Tukrajhar residence of Bengtol College’s assistant professor of philosophy, Prabin Narzary. The minor girl was pursuing her studies while staying at Narzary’s house for the past one year, police said. An inquest in the case began in the presence of a woman executive magistrate and the victim’s body was sent to Barpeta Medical College Hospital for post-mortem examination. “Credible information was received on Monday night that the victim had sent a WhatsApp message to her friend, informing she was subjected to [a] sexual assault and didn’t want to live anymore,” a police release said. Following the lead, Narzary was arrested for raping someone under 16 years of age, causing disappearance of evidence and abetment of suicide, along with Section 4 of Pocso Act. “Based on the evidence collected so far, Prabin Narzay has been arrested in connection with the case and remanded to police custody for three days,” said the release. Last month a father-son duo was arrested after the burnt body of a 12-year-old domestic help was found from their residence in Nagaon district’s Raha. Preliminary police investigation revealed that the minor might have been burnt to death. It has been alleged that the victim was raped and was pregnant.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/assam-professor-arrested-for-raping-minor-abetting-her-death-by-suicide-101621395196231.html

The subsequent search and rescue is one of the most challenging operations in four decades, he said.Indian Naval Ships (INS) Beas, Betwa and Teg have joined INS Kochi and INS Kolkata in the search and rescue (SAR) operations for the barge. The SAR had also been augmented with P-8I and naval helicopters, which held an aerial search, and since the commencement of the SAR from May 17, 180 have been rescued so far, said commander Mehul Karnik, chief public relations officer, Western Naval Command. Karnik, however, clarified that helicopters cannot be used for aerial search at night and the search will continue by naval ships after ascertaining the distance and direction the survivors could have drifted into the sea. P305, according to some rescued workers, got disconnected from the rig around 10.15pm on Sunday and went adrift as Tauktae struck the Konkan coast. Survivors said water started entering the accommodation barge from Monday morning and they were forced to get out of their compartments and move to the deck of the barge.The GAL constructor barge was out of control for three days before the cyclonic storm led to its sinking, Avinash Aadke, a rescued worker said after being flown to Mumbai.

19-05-2021||India||India’s Covid-19 hot spots on recovery road: Data||The punishing second wave of the coronavirus disease is receding in 19 Indian states and Union territories, some of which were its early epicentres, although some new hot spots have emerged in the south and the North-East where infections continue to surge, HT’s analysis of nationwide positivity rates shows.Seven out of every 10 Indians live in the regions seeing an improvement. Among the 19 are Delhi, Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Bihar and Uttar Pradesh, some of which were ravaged by the second wave with the health care systems of most being overwhelmed by a rush of hospitalisations.This trend comes as a glimmer of hope even as the Covid-19 toll continue to rise to grim new records. Daily deaths from the disease have remained above the 4,000 mark in the last four days despite a drop in new cases over the past week. To be sure, any drop in case trajectory generally take 14 days to reflect on daily deaths as studies have shown that the median time between someone testing positive for Covid-19 and dying from it is around 13.8 days.Also Read| Covid-19: What you need to know todayThe average weekly positivity rate – proportion of samples tested that return positive for Covid-19 – has gone down in states and UTs that are home to 69% of the country’s population, while 15 states and UTs, home to the remaining 31%, have seen an increase between May 7 and May 17, data shows.Experts said that this drop in positivity rate is largely due to the application of non-pharmaceutical interventions like lockdowns, and that while cases are declining in most regions, actions taken to control the spread of the disease cannot be weakened just yet.Areas in the country’s south and North-East, which fared relatively better than the rest of the country during the worst of the second wave though April, are now seeing positivity rate climb the most. Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu and Karnataka, along with north-eastern states such as Meghalaya, Manipur, Sikkim, Tripura and Arunachal Pradesh, feature among the regions that have seen positivity rate rise the most between May 7 and 17.The analysis took the positivity rate data from the first week of May (week ending May 7) as the base for comparison as it was perhaps India’s worst week in terms of cases – the seven-day averages of positivity rate and daily infections both peaked around this time in the country. At the government’s Covid briefing on Tuesday, health ministry joint secretary Lav Agarwal said that daily cases have been declining since May 7.All positivity rate figures mentioned here are seven-day averages as it evens out inaccuracies in testing over weekends.A rising positivity rate in a region indicates that the virus is spreading fast within the community. As a rule of thumb, tracking a region’s positivity rate serves as a good barometer for whether cases are going to increase or decrease in the coming days: a rising positivity rate generally means cases will rise in the immediate future, while a dropping positivity rate tends to precede a drop in new infections.Importantly, this trend has sustained without daily tests going down in the majority of the country. In fact, the number of daily tests in the country have increased 5% between May 7 and May 17 – on average, a total of 1,813,242 samples were tested every day in the country in the past week, against 1,724,665 on May 7.Regions with best improvementDelhi saw India’s biggest change in average positivity rate in the past 10 days – there was a 14.3 percentage point drop between May 7 and May 17 (from 27.4% to 13.1%). It was followed by Chhattisgarh, where the positivity rate dropped 13.2 percentage points, from 25.4% to 12.2% in the same time period, and Haryana, where it dropped 10.4 percentage points.Goa features in the fourth spot in terms of most improved positivity rate (drop of 9.8 percentage points), but despite the drop, the state still has the highest positivity rate in the country. In the past week, more than a third (36.5%) of all samples tested in the state have returned positive for Covid-19. The coastal state has been in the news over the past two weeks due to severe shortage of hospital beds and medical oxygen resulting in dozens of deaths. But a drop in positivity rate offers the region some much-needed light at the end of the tunnel.Also Read| 269 doctors died of Covid-19 in second wave: IMAOther regions that have seen significant improvements in positivity rate are Jharkhand (a fall of 8 percentage points, from 15% to 7.0%), Bihar (down 7.5 percentage points, from 14.8% to 7.2%), Madhya Pradesh ( 19.3% to 12%), Maharashtra (down 6 percentage points from 21.7% to 15.6%) and Uttar Pradesh (down 6 points, from 11.9% to 5.9%). Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, Bihar and Madhya Pradesh are four of India’s five most populous states – together housing more than 40% of the country’s population.This phenomenon is clearly reflected in the drastic reduction on the load on India’s health care system in these regions. Pleas for help on social media for life-saving resources like hospital beds, medicines, oxygen, even ambulances had become commonplace towards the peak of the outbreak in regions such as Delhi, Maharashtra and UP. Over the past 10 days, the shortage of supply in these regions have dropped.Nagaland, meanwhile, is the only north-eastern state where positivity rate is dropping (down 0.9 percentage points, from 21.7% on May 7 to 20.8% on May 17).States and UTs with rising transmissionA majority of India’s south and the northeast, meanwhile, is at the other end of the spectrum. In Meghalaya, the positivity rate rose from 11.1% to 17.7% between May 7 and May 17 – a rise of 6.7 percentage points, the highest in India. It was followed by Andhra Pradesh, where positivity rate jumped from 18.7% to 24.4% (up 5.8 percentage points), and Tamil Nadu (from 15.2% to 19.8%, up 4.7 percentage points). Manipur (14.2% to 18.3%) and Karnataka (28.4% to 32.4%) both saw positivity rate go up 4.1 percentage points. Sikkim and Karnataka registered the second and third highest positivity rate in the past week – 32.6% and 32.4% respectively. Sikkim has seen the sixth highest rise in positivity rate in the past 10 days – of 3.4 percentage points.Other states with high positivity rate (and rising) are Kerala (up 0.4 percentage points to 26.9%) and Odisha (up 0.4% to 20.9%).One state and two UTs – Mizoram, Lakshadweep and Daman and Diu, Dadra and Nagar Haveli – were excluded from the analysis due to unavailability of consistent testing data.During health ministry’s weekly Covid-19 briefing on Tuesday, Niti Aayog member (health) VK Paul said, “We have to be very mindful that when we are achieving declining positivity rate it is because of the results of what we are doing and that cannot be slackened. We cannot again let this go out of hand again.”Also Read| Efforts on to ramp up Covid vaccine supply: PM Modi to states“In many states the pandemic curve is stabilising, as a result of comprehensive efforts at containment, at testing, restrictions, and all the other efforts that people of those states are carrying out -- the states such as Maharashtra, Kerala, Karnataka, Telangana, Uttar Pradesh, Delhi, Rajasthan, Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh and so on,” he said. He added that there were still a few states where there continues to be concern such as Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh and West Bengal, among others. “It is a mixed picture but there is overall stabilisation, and what we know from scientific analysis that the reproduction number (R0) is overall below 1 now,” said Paul.Experts, however, say it is too early to let the guard down. “While most governments were reluctant to enforce lockdowns, it appears those measures are now starting to yield results... It is not a good time to celebrate decrease in numbers as we are dealing with an infectious disease and it is way too early to say which direction the spread is going to take, especially since the disease has reached rural and tribal areas where health infrastructure is weak and it won’t be able to test each and every individual there,” said Dr Lalit Kant, former head of epidemiology at the Indian Council of Medical Research.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/indias-covid-19-hot-spots-on-recovery-road-data-101621378119912.html
19-05-2021||India||Efforts on to ramp up Covid vaccine supply: PM Modi to states||Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on Tuesday efforts were being made to ramp up the supply of Covid-19 vaccines in the country, and added that the Centre was trying to provide states with a 15-day advance schedule of the vaccination programme so they could prepare accordingly.During a virtual interaction with state and district officials, the Prime Minister described the local administration officials as “field commanders” in the fight against the Covid-19 pandemic, the second wave of which has hit the country’s health care infrastructure. He reiterated that localised containment zones, aggressive testing and sharing correct and complete information with the people were crucial weapons to defeat the infectious disease. “All of you have an important role in this war against Corona. You are the field commander of this war in a way, who give shape to the policy, and fight on the ground and take decisions according to the situation,” he said.The interaction was aimed at receiving feedback from the states on the measures taken to reduce the spread of the infection, ramp up medical infrastructure and other initiatives taken by the administrations. The PM also told the administrators that they have the freedom to make changes to any policy announced by the government to make it more effective on the ground. “I want to tell you… if you think that the government policy at the district level needs innovation in the policy to strengthen it, you have the freedom to do so. If you think the innovation that you have done is good for the whole district or the country, it should be sent to the government. If you think there is a need to make any change in the policy, give us that feedback also without any hesitation because the war is such that we all need to think together and innovate together,” the PM said.In the wake of complaints from states over the availability of vaccines, the PM said efforts were being made to ensure that the vaccination drive was strengthened and that a plan was underway to ensure that states get a 15-day advance schedule on how many vaccines doses are available. “Vaccine wastage at all districts must be stopped and optimum utilisation is a must,” he said, adding that all states must alleviate fears about the vaccines, which are a medium of fighting the pandemic. The PM also cautioned that while Covid-19 cases were going up in several states and down in some others, there was a need to remain vigilant even in places where the infections were dipping. “We have to stop the scale of infection from spreading by taking the correct steps such as testing, tracking, isolation and adopting Covid-appropriate behaviour,” he said.Union home minister Amit Shah and health secretary Rajesh Bhushan were also present at the meeting with chief ministers from states such as Himachal Pradesh, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh and Uttarakhand. The district magistrates represented Patna, Bengaluru urban, Indore, Coimbatore, Dehradun, Shimoga and Kolar.Modi also called for more attention in rural areas as well as in far off places. “We have to ensure that there is health infrastructure to meet increasing challenges and increase in cases; this should be done on a priority basis,” he said. He also instructed the administrators to keep up the morale of those on the frontline of the Covid-19 fight and of those in home isolation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/efforts-on-to-ramp-up-covid-vaccine-supply-pm-modi-to-states-101621375967415.html

And unlike India’s social-media literate urban population, residents can’t appeal on Twitter to an army of strangers willing to help.“Most deaths in the village have been caused because there was no oxygen available,” said Sanjeev Kumar, the newly elected head of the farming community. “The sick are being rushed to the district headquarters and those extremely sick patients have to travel about four hours,” he said, adding that many don’t make it in time.It’s a scenario playing out all over India. In interviews with representatives from more than 18 towns and villages in different parts of the country, officials outlined the scale of the carnage — from entire families wiped out to bloated bodies floating down the Ganges River to farmland left untended due to a lack of workers.Many people said the scale of the crisis is much bigger than official numbers reveal, with villagers afraid to leave their homes even if they have fevers and local authorities failing to properly record virus fatalities. India reported a record 4,329 deaths on Tuesday while its total reported cases topped 25 million, according to figures from the Health Ministry.Anger is building both at Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s administration and local authorities for failing to bolster medical infrastructure following a virus wave last year, including securing sufficient supplies of oxygen and vaccines. The ruling Bharatiya Janata Party last month lost local elections in Basi and other parts of Uttar Pradesh — India’s most populous state — just as the country started recording almost 400,000 new cases a day.The sentiment on the ground suggests broader troubles for Modi and fellow BJP leader Yogi Adityanath, the chief minister of Uttar Pradesh who has been mentioned as a possible successor to the prime minister. The state holds elections next year.“We had complete support for Modi and Yogi, but now whatever happens we will vote the BJP out,” Sahab Singh, 72, said in the center of Basi, which was virtually empty. He noted people were too scared to leave their homes.During the recent election to appoint village heads, many poll workers became infected — including Kumarsain Nain, 59, who caught the virus along with his 31-year-old son. Unable to walk and gasping for breath, Nain’s family rushed him last month to a nearby hospital after they were unable to find an ambulance with oxygen support, said another son, Praveen Kumar.“After we reached the hospital, the doctors said he had died, but instead of recording Covid-19 as the cause of death they put cardiac arrest,” Kumar said. “The doctor told us there was no need to check whether my father was Covid-19 positive since he was already dead.”His brother died soon afterward in another clinic about 30 minutes away, at the same time as six other patients who were also on oxygen support. “My suspicion is that hospital ran out of oxygen, which led to the deaths,” Kumar said. “Holding the elections when the government knew that cases were rising and the infection was spreading is a criminal act.”Representatives from both the prime minister’s office and the Health Ministry have not responded to request for comment. Modi addressed the issue on May 14 following a meeting with several chief ministers. “I want to warn you about corona. The infection is spreading fast in villages,” the prime minister said. “Efforts are being taken to deal with this.”Baijayant “Jay” Panda, a senior official with Modi’s BJP, told Bloomberg Television on Monday the latest virus wave has been a “humbling experience,” but pointed to a significant vaccination rollout and the provision of shots to more than 80 countries in a global outreach effort.He defended Modi’s response, saying election authorities made the decision to proceed with polls and states were responsible for building oxygen plants that received federal funding.“It’s not just the prime minister who thought we had overcome the biggest ravages of corona — the consensus in India by early January was that we had done so,” Panda said. “Many of the epidemiologists who are today criticizing are on the record back in October saying the worst was over and that we should not have as many restrictions.”Covid-19 is adding to Modi’s troubles along with a severe economic downturn, rising unemployment and farmer protests against a law perceived to favor big business, according to Nikita Sud, an associate professor in international development at the University of Oxford and author of a book on Hindu nationalism.“It is too simplistic to say that Covid mismanagement spells the turning of the tide for the Modi regime,” Sud said. “However, the regime looks out of its depth for the first time since coming to power in 2014.As leaders in Delhi struggle to contain the crisis, horrifying scenes are playing out across India. Last week in the eastern state of Bihar, residents woke up to find as many as 70 bloated bodies floating in the Ganges River. With crematoriums overflowing as the death toll surges, they feared these bodies were Covid victims whose families could not properly lay them to rest. More corpses have since been reported along the river.Both the federal and state governments “have failed us all,” said Rajesh Sharma, who owns a travel company in the Hindu pilgrimage city of Ujjain in the central state of Madhya Pradesh.“India had a full year to prepare, but except for sending vaccines out of the country for personal credit and glory nothing much was done,” he said. “There are no hospital beds, no medicines. People have been left to die. In Ujjain and around, entire families died in the last two weeks.”In Punjab, a northern state bordering Pakistan, local authorities are asking volunteers among India’s one-million-strong Accredited Social Health Activists to visit every house to urge people to get vaccinated and see if anyone has a fever. While the group is well known for working in harsh conditions to deliver childhood immunizations and basic first aid to villages, the scale of the current crisis is unprecedented, said Balbir, one of the workers.“Many people are so scared they are not even telling anyone about their fever,” she said, asking to be identified by only her first name due to fear of a backash from local authorities in Ludhiana district, where infections are spreading rapidly. “Despite such a huge surge they have still not given us adequate protection: no masks, no gloves, nothing.”Uttarakhand has also been hit hard. The state in the Himalayan foothills saw virus cases jump almost 20 times after it hosted more than nine million people for the Hindu religious festival known as the Kumbh Mela between March 31 and April 24.“There isn’t a house in Rishikesh where people aren’t sick — Haridwar is also in a similar condition,” said Navin Mohan, who helps arrange tours to the holy towns on the banks of the Ganges.“The pandemic is now truly beyond control,” Mohan said. “Thousands are dying and will die in the next few weeks. The government is fudging numbers, but the reality is visible to everyone.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid19-wiped-out-entire-families-in-rural-india-101621362215330.html
19-05-2021||India||Indian embassy urges students in US to counter ‘bias’||The Indian embassy in Washington reached out to Indians studying in the US in an effort to help counter the purported “biased and negative narrative” against the country in the international media amid a devastating second wave of Covid-19 infections.The outreach was made through the embassy’s “Student Hub”, an official initiative that is meant to “engage Indian students studying in the United States in India’s development”. The Student Hub’s website describes it as a platform for students to “connect, collaborate, and converse” with each other and the embassy.In the section of the website detailing how the students can get involved, the embassy has invited Indian students in the US to “contribute their time and ideas for the upcoming Fall 2021 Verticals in the three core areas” – climate action, India in the news, and grassroots learnings.According to screenshots of the website tweeted by several persons on Tuesday, including Shiv Sena leader and Rajya Sabha MP Priyanka Chaturvedi, the section seeking volunteers for “India in the news” stated: “If you are into current affairs or international affairs, if you are concerned about how India is portrayed in the media whether in print, online, or social media platforms, if you would like to bring to light such portrayals and course correct the current biased and negative narrative against India in the global scenarios, this is where you click.”However, after the screenshots were widely shared on Tuesday, the text in this section read: “If you are into current affairs or international affairs, are interested in how India is portrayed in the media – whether in print, online, or social media platforms and would like to bring to light such portrayals and understand the story behind the news, join us.”There was no word from Indian officials on the outreach to Indian students regarding foreign media’s portrayal of the country.Clicking on the link for volunteers interested on working on “India in the news” leads to a Google Documents form that includes the question: “List any study or project that you may have been involved with regarding India in the News, Bias in the US Media viz India.”Other questions in the form focus on how much time students can devote to volunteering, and their interest in “being a Campus Lead and motivating other students from your campus and bringing them onboard to the Student Hub”.The government has been critical of the foreign media’s coverage of its response to the second wave of Covid-19 infections.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/indian-embassy-urges-students-in-us-to-counter-bias-101621364474130.html
19-05-2021||India||Row in UP after govt razes ‘mosque’, Waqf board to move HC||Controversy broke out in Uttar Pradesh’s Barabanki town on Tuesday over the demolition of a decades-old structure, with Muslim groups saying it was the illegal razing of a mosque and the local administration claiming it was residential encroachment on government land.The structure was razed in Ram Sanehi Ghat tehsil area of Barabanki on Monday amid police deployment. The tehsil is located on a highway on the Barabanki-Ayodhya border.Barabanki district magistrate Adarsh Singh said the structure was constructed illegally on government land by unidentified people who escaped when a notice was sent on March 15. The administration took possession of the structure on March 18 and it was demolished on Monday after due orders from the sub-divisional magistrate’s court, he added.But the UP Sunni Central Waqf Board said it was a 100-year-old mosque and said it will approach the Allahabad high court demanding restoration of the mosque, a high level judicial inquiry and action against the officers concerned.“It is high handedness of the local administration,” said board chairman Zufar Ahmad Faruqi. A Barabanki resident and lawyer, Iqbal Naseem Nomani Dariyabadi, said he was offering namaz at the mosque for the past three decades. Dariyabadi said he was unable to understand the motive behind the hurried action during the pandemic.A district official said the “illegal structure” was first flagged during a verification drive in March. “Three people living there escaped when asked to show their identity proof,” he added.In a video, Barabanki district magistrate Adarsh Singh called the demolished structure as a “residential place that was constructed illegally” on the tehsil premises in front of the house of SDM (Ram Sanehi Ghat).“The occupants escaped from there when a notice was sent to them to prove their ownership on March 15, 2021. The administration took possession of the structure on March 18, 2021,” he added.He said the occupants were provided sufficient time to prove their ownership after which the SDM court issued that the structure was constructed illegally and subsequently the illegal structure was removed on Monday (May 17, 2021) as per the legal proceedings.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/row-in-up-after-govt-razes-mosque-waqf-board-to-move-hc-101621364414653.html

The body had been fished out of the Ganga in Maldepur village of Ballia town days ago, the officer added.A group of locals had seen the body and informed the police. Thereafter, a police team reached the spot and performed the last rites. The video showing the cremation of the body in the presence of five police constables went viral on Sunday. “A man was pouring petrol on the pyre,” said the officer.“Taking cognizance of the video exposing the insensitive act of the five police personnel, action was taken. A probe has been ordered into the matter,” said Vipin Tada, SP (Ballia).He said additional superintendent of police (Ballia), Sanjay Kumar, has been instructed to conduct the probe and submit a report.Last week, over two dozen bodies were found floating in the Ganga in Bharauli and Ujiyar areas of Ballia.

19-05-2021||India||E-registration for travelling causes traffic chaos on Chennai roads||Chennai: Anna Salai, the main arterial road in Chennai, witnessed traffic jams and chaos on Tuesday as police were stopping motorists to check if they had e-registration, which has been made mandatory for travel by the Chennai Police during the ongoing lockdown. The Tamil Nadu government has also made e-registration mandatory for inter and intra district travel as well as for those entering the state during the lockdown, which is in force amid rising Covid-19 cases. In an attempt to intensify the implementation of the lockdown, the Greater Chennai Police issued a notice late Monday night making e-registrations (auto generated) mandatory for people to commute from one sector of a police station limit to another between 6 am and 10 am when people are allowed to step out to buy essentials. Each police station has been divided into three sectors, with a total of 348 sectors being demarcated for Chennai. Barricades were put up on roads to demarcate sectors, said police. While people can move around to buy essentials within their own sector, they require an e-registration to enter another sector. According to police, 153 vehicle checks were established to connect all important junctions and cover all police limits. “There were at least a thousand vehicles, and many weren’t aware about the e-registration,” an essential service worker, who didn’t wish to be named, said, adding, “We don’t know why so many are on the road and where they’re going but before the rule came into effect some notice time should have been given.” Shankar Jiwal, commissioner of police, Chennai, said the rationale behind rolling out the new rule was to prevent people using the 6-10 am window as a loophole to commute to faraway places defeating the purpose of a lockdown. He, however, admitted that the order came in late. “After studying which area is self-sufficient where all services of purchasing essentials like vegetables, groceries, and meat are available, we divided a police station into two or three (sectors),” Jiwal said. “In the last three days, we studied about 20 junctions for one hour in the morning and one hour in the evening to ascertain the purpose of people’s commute. Under the pretext of buying essentials, people were going to faraway places. This is causing a lot of movement. The infection spreads because they communicate and mingle with people in one area and bring it back to their communities. Our cases aren’t going down. So we segregated these areas. We advise people to purchase within their own areas,” Jiwal said, adding that the traffic seen on Tuesday will slowly come down as people will realise the importance of not commuting without purpose. “Since there is crowding in a place that has more sectors, we are going to make traffic two-lanes. One will be for ambulances and essential service providers while the other will be for people with valid e-registrations. Defaulters will be sent back. If people unnecessarily loiter, we will also seise vehicles,” the commissioner said. While ambulances are exempted from any restrictions, Jiwal said, food delivery executives, state and central government staff, bank employees will not be restricted to their police-marked sectors. “Those who are exempted in the government order can move anywhere with their ID cards,” he said. “E-registration is only for three categories: death-related, medical emergencies, elderly care. For instance, if one has to commute to take care of their kin in the hospital in another locality, they have to apply for e-registration.” E-commerce like Swiggy, Zomanto, Dunzo are registered under the industry category. Media requires an accredited DIPR card to be allowed. Tamil Nadu will remain under lockdown till May 24 amid a Covid-19 surge across the state. On Tuesday, the state reported 33,059 new infections, taking the active caseload to 242,929. Chennai accounted for 6,016 new cases, which pushed its active caseload to 48,455. A total of 364 and 85 fatalities were reported in Tamil Nadu and Chennai, taking the toll to 18,369 and 5,939, respectively, according to the state health department.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/eregistration-for-travelling-causes-traffic-chaos-on-chennai-roads-101621364173999.html
19-05-2021||India||Covid-19: What you need to know today||It’s important to remember that till late 2019 or early 2020, the world really didn’t know of the existence of the Sars-CoV-2 virus that causes the coronavirus disease. Since then, our knowledge of this virus has expanded at an unprecedented rate.Pharma companies, scientists and researchers have not had much luck with therapeutics, either new or repurposed. They have, however, made up for this by coming up with a handful of vaccines that work – and in record time. Still, the absence of therapeutics (so far) means a continued search – and a bunch of traditional, homegrown, and experimental therapies are being pitched, not just by those who learn at the shiny altar of WhatsApp University, but even doctors who should know better, and lawmakers and administrators who have a responsibility to not pitch or endorse (if only by their silence) miracle cures that are often packaged snake oil.It’s easy to criticise a lawmaker who says a regular dose of cow urine keeps her safe from Covid-19, just as it is a government department that claims a repurposed decades-old malaria drug (that didn’t work on malaria) actually cures Covid-19. But most people have been worst served by allopathic drugs. A preamble on how drugs are tested for efficacy and safety may be required here. They can be tested in silico (or through a computer simulation); in vitro (in a petri dish in the lab); and in vivo (in a human body).Also Read| No new Covid strain detected here, Singapore health ministry counters KejriwalThe fact that Covid-19 was a new disease, and the intensity of the first wave in some countries (subsequent waves would go on to be worse, but no one knew this back then) prompted a desperate search for drugs, in some ways made it acceptable to lower the bar for them. For instance, it is highly unlikely that a drug that works only in vitro will ever be allowed for widespread use (even under an emergency use authorisation), but that’s just what has happened with ivermectin (especially in India). This is one of those drugs that does very well in vitro (against the dengue, Zika, and yellow fever viruses, among other pathogens), but fails to replicate that in vivo (there can be countless reasons for this, including the body’s ability to absorb the drug). Think of it as a Ranji Trophy player pushed into Test cricket (and on a wet and windy morning at Trent Bridge). Unfortunately, subsequent in vivo studies have shown that ivermectin does not seem to help someone infected with Covid-19. That’s also true of Favipiravir, Itolizumab, Doxycycline, even 2-DG.There may eventually emerge well-conducted human clinical trials that show that some of these do actually work, but current scientific evidence (and I use the term carefully, because in this era of alternative facts, there is also alternative scientific evidence) does not justify the enthusiasm with which these drugs are being prescribed, and consumed. More worryingly, drug regulators around the world (and in India) are being far too quick (and worse, inconsistent) in their approval of such therapies, even if for emergency use.Also Read| Biden pledges US support as COVAX faces shortfall of 140 million dosesThere’s usually a price to pay for the misuse of drugs, even if this isn’t immediate. One study has shown that there is a link between the use of convalescent plasma – the Indian Council of Medical Research finally removed it from the treatment protocol on May 17 – and mutations in the Sars-CoV-2 virus (more research is needed before this can be conclusively said, though). And many doctors believe (as do I) that there is a clear link between the overuse of steroids in Covid treatment and the growing incidence of mucormycosis, or the black fungus.The damage caused by Covid-19 is significant, but it would be a pity if, in our justifiable urgency to get the better of the coronavirus disease, science- and evidence-based medicine is a casualty.Also Read| Less than 2% population affected by Covid-19, 98% still vulnerable: GovtPS: There’s been a lot of talk about the third wave of Covid-19 in India affecting children more than it does any other segment of the population. It’s important to point out that this is a generic threat assessment. Since it is unlikely that children (those under the age of 18 years) will be vaccinated by the time a third wave breaks, it is obvious that they are as much at risk as any other unvaccinated group. There’s also no data or research that suggests that children are suddenly more vulnerable to the SARS-CoV-2 virus that causes Covid-19, or any of its variants, than they always were (so, the bit about children rarely dying from Covid-19, or even needing to be hospitalised remains true) . That said, it makes sense to vaccinate them, and as early as possible.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid19-what-you-need-to-know-today-101621363602291.html
19-05-2021||India||Videos, witnesses in Narada case show 4 TMC leaders took cash: CBI sleuths||Videos made during the sting operation, voice samples, and statements from witnesses ostensibly confirmed that Trinamool Congress leaders Subrata Mukherjee, Firhad Hakim, Madan Mitra and former Kolkata mayor Sovan Chatterjee took cash from journalist Mathew Samuel (who was pretending to be a businessman seeking to further his interests) in 2014, according to details of the investigation and the charge sheet shared with HT by two Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) officials.The four were arrested on Monday by the federal agency. TMC has raised questions about the lack of action against Mukul Roy and Suvendu Adhikari, formerly with the party, who have since defected to the Bharatiya Janata Party, but CBI officials said there was no clear evidence against the former, and that the agency is still awaiting the Lok Sabha speaker’s permission, sought in 2019 (Adhikari was elected to the Lok Sabha in 2014, but resigned in 2016) to proceed against him.Also Read| Narada sting: Two Bengal ministers spent night in jail as HC stayed bailCBI began investigating the sting, which came to light in 2016, just ahead of the assembly elections in the state, in April 2017 by registering an FIR against Mukul Roy (now a BJP vice president), Madan Mitra, Sultan Ahmed, Iqbal Ahmed, Firhad Hakim, Sougata Roy, Kakoli Ghosh Dastidar, Prasun Banerjee, Suvendu Adhikari (now in the BJP and the leader of the Opposition in West Bengal), Sovan Chatterjee, Subrata Mukherjee, IPS officer SMH Meerza, and Aparupa Poddar.The investigation was around whether, as shown in the sting, these people took bribes from Samuel, who approached them in 2014 posing as Santosh Shankaran, representative of M/s Impex Consultancy, Chennai, a fictitious firm, seeking favours from them to further the business interests of the company in the state.During investigation, CBI said it found two video files on Madan Mitra, dated April 24 and April 25, 2014. “In the second video file, it is found that Samuel offered money to Mitra in the presence of Syed Tazdar Ali Meerza, and kept the bundle of currency notes on a bed in front of Mitra, and said it was ₹5 lakh. Mitra then asked somebody to pick up the money,” said one of the CBI officers cited in the first instance, quoting details of the charge sheet filed on Monday. This person asked not to be named.Similarly, a video of Firhad Hakim from May 2, 2014 ostensibly revealed that Samuel offered him ₹5 lakh. “Hakim asked him to keep that with himself and then called Sudhendu Samanta, joint secretary of Chetala Agrani Club, who was present in the adjoining room. When Samanta arrived, Hakim directed him to accept the money in another room and deposit it in an account,” said a second officer who asked not to be named, also citing details from the charge sheet.This money, according to a CBI investigation, was deposited in the account of Chetala Agrani Club by Samanta on May 11, 2014, showing the donation in the name of “a well wisher from Chennai”. It also reflects in the Income Tax Return of the club for financial year 2014-15, the agency’s officers said.On Sovan Chatterje, the CBI officers said it has two video files, dated April 16 and May 1, 2014. In the video from April 16, Sovan Chatterjee is apparently seen sitting in his office chamber when Samuel approaches him and offers to support TMC in the elections. “During conversations, Samuel offered him ₹4lakh in bundles of currency notes which Chatterjee accepted and wrapped in a small towel and kept it on his side,” the second officer added. Chatterjee quit TMC to join BJP last year but left in March.Also Read| Narada case: TMC targets Bengal Guv Dhankhar over prosecution sanctionSimilarly, Samuel approached Subrata Mukherjee on April 13, 2014 and introduced himself as liaison agent of some companies and offered to help in the election, the officer added. “Samuel handed over ₹4 lakh to Mukherjee who accepted the same in the presence of a party worker,” he said.The CBI charge sheet mentions that all four have been identified by their pictures and voices from the corresponding video files by independent witnesses. CBI took voice samples of all the accused, except Iqbal Ahmed, who declined to cooperate.All the four arrested leaders have denied any wrongdoing.According to the officers cited above, the agency, however, has not found any direct evidence that Mukul Roy, a former TMC leader who switched to Bharatiya Janata Party in 2017, took a bribe.“We have 2-3 videos in which Samuel is seen offering him money, but Mukul Roy didn’t take it. He asked Samuel to meet IPS officer Meerza. We have videos of Meerza taking the money but he never admitted that it was on behalf of Mukul Roy. Unless we have fresh evidence which can prove otherwise, there is only suspicion against Roy but no hard evidence,” said a third CBI officer, who didn’t want to be named.On Monday, following the arrest of the four TMC leaders, party spokesperson Kunal Ghosh had said: “Why isn’t Mukul Roy, vice president of BJP, being arrested? He was also seen in the Narada sting operation video saying that the money be given to an IPS officer.”As for Adhikari and three other TMC leaders, Saugata Roy, Kakoli Ghosh and Prasun Banerjee, CBI officials said the investigation is over but that they are waiting for a prosecution sanction from the Lok Sabha speaker. Roy, Ghosh and Banerjee are all Lok Sabha members.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/videos-witnesses-in-narada-case-show-4-tmc-leaders-took-cash-cbi-sleuths-101621364054751.html
19-05-2021||India||Rebel YSR Cong MP, held by CID, to remain in hospital till Friday||Hyderabad: Rebel YSR Congress party Member of Parliament Kanumuri Raghurama Krishnam Raju, who complained of cardiac issues and alleged police torture after he was arrested by the Andhra Pradesh Crime Investigation Department (CID) last week, will remain under supervision of doctors at Military Hospital in Secunderabad till Friday, officials said.Last Saturday, the MP from Narasapuram constituency in West Godavari district was sent to a 14-day judicial custody by a local court in Guntur after he was arrested on sedition charges. On Monday, the Supreme Court directed that Raju be medically examined at the army hospital and kept his bail plea for hearing on Friday. According to a defence medical officer familiar with the development, Raju underwent a medical examination by a board of three doctors constituted by the commandant of the medical hospital. The medical examination was conducted under the supervision of Telangana high court registrar D Nagarjuna who was appointed as a judicial officer by the high court chief justice as per directions of the top court. “The medical examination was videographed. His blood samples were taken for conducting various tests. His health condition is stable. After obtaining all medical examination reports, the medical board will submit a report on Raju’s health status to the Supreme Court in a sealed cover,” the official cited above said. The official said that Raju had complained of difficulty in walking due to alleged custodial torture by Andhra police. His statement was recorded by the doctors. “He had swelling on his right leg and he was administered painkillers for treating the inflammation,” the official said. The official added that Raju would have to remain in the hospital till Friday for observation and medical care. His period of stay in the hospital would be treated as judicial custody which would end on May 28. In his plea to the Supreme Court, Raju claimed that he was suffering from cardiac issues after having undergone a bypass surgery recently. The legislator also alleged that he was beaten and tortured in police custody.Following a direction from the apex court, the Andhra Pradesh government shifted Raju to the Military Hospital in Secunderabad around midnight on Monday. Meanwhile, military officials in the hospital refused permission to Raju’s son K Bharat to visit his father. The officials categorically told him that there was no permission for Raju’s family members to meet or see him. “It is unfortunate that I was not permitted to see my father. Since it was the Supreme Court order, I have to follow it,” Bharat said. Raju was arrested on May 14 and a day later, his bail plea was dismissed by the Andhra Pradesh high court on the ground that the same ought to be moved before the sessions court. The Crime Investigation Department (CID) has accused him of delivering hate speeches against certain communities and promoting disaffection against the government.Although Raju is an MP representing the YSR Congress Party from Narasapuram constituency, he has been critical of the party leadership and the state government and even demanded cancellation of bail granted to chief minister Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy in a corruption case. Last year, the Delhi high court ordered Y-category security cover for the MP in view of threats that followed his anti-party rant.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rebel-ysr-cong-mp-held-by-cid-to-remain-in-hospital-till-friday-101621363935137.html
19-05-2021||India||Rebel Cong MLA resigns from Raj assembly||Jaipur/Barmer: Disgruntled Congress MLA from Gudamalani in Barmer, Hemaram Choudhary, who belongs to former deputy chief minister Sachin Pilot’s camp, on Tuesday sent his resignation to assembly speaker C P Joshi.While the reason behind his resignation could not be immediately ascertained, it is learnt that he was upset for being sidelined in the party. “I have submitted my resignation to the Speaker, C P Joshi and chief minister Ashok Gehlot. I had resigned earlier, but it was not accepted. I have been an MLA for 2.5 years, and have done enough politics. I will speak on the reason behind the resignation once it is accepted,” he told reporters.The six-time legislator was among the 19 MLAs who had rebelled against the leadership of chief minister Ashok Gehlot last year.A senior Congress leader familiar with the development, on condition of anonymity, said Choudhary was having differences with local leaders and had raised the issue of transfer and posting of officials on request of other MLAs with the state leaders. In 2019, Choudhary had tendered his resignation in the first assembly session which was called after the government formation. The Congress believed that he was miffed for not being included in the Gehlot cabinet but was pacified by senior leaders later. When he was the revenue minister in 2013, Choudhary had tendered his resignation from the Cabinet, apparently after he was upset over the shifting of an oil refinery site from Lilala to Pachpadra in Barmer. Political analyst Manish Godha said since Choudhary had tendered his resignation on earlier occasions too, it is better for him to clear the reason behind the move – is it the local problem or is it to begin another political crisis. “The possibilities of pressure politics cannot be ruled out as the disgruntled faction is asking for a cabinet shuffle and political appointments,” he said. Deputy leader of opposition Rajendra Rathore said the resignation showed that there is no internal democracy in the Congress. “Such is the situation that they don’t know when the government’s ship may sink. This government has also failed to manage corona,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rebel-cong-mla-resigns-from-raj-assembly-101621363754561.html
19-05-2021||India||Data reveals Karnataka Police lost almost 1 cop daily to 2nd wave of Covid-19||In the second wave of the pandemic, Karnataka Police has lost 40 personnel to Covid-19 between April 1 and May 13, almost a death every day, according to the state police documents accessed by Hindustan Times. The latest among those who succumbed to the infection was 28-year-old police sub-inspector Shamili, attached to the Dakshina Kannada police department, who died on Tuesday while undergoing treatment at a hospital, taking the total deaths to 41. Shamili was seven months pregnant.Dakshina Kannada Superintendent of Police Rishikesh Sonwane said she was undergoing treatment at RM Jalappa Hospital in Kolar. “She was seven months pregnant. Due to pregnancy, she was not vaccinated,” he said.Shamili was the youngest police officer to die due to Covid-19 in the second wave, which has wreaked havoc in Karnataka and across the country. A closer look at the document shows that in the second wave, out of the 41 police officials who died, four were under the age of 35 while 27 did not have any comorbidities.According to the internal document of the police department, a copy which is available with Hindustan Times, 4,203 personnel, or 4% of the total police force, have contracted the virus in the 48 days. Of these, 1,508 are active cases.In the second wave, the maximum number of Covid-19 cases among police personnel were reported in Bengaluru (1,439), followed by Mysuru (257) and Tumkur (216). Ballari, Kalburgi, Hassan police departments reported 148, 140 and 123 cases, respectively. Bengaluru Police also reported the highest number of deaths. Of the 41 deaths among police personnel, 13 were reported in Bengaluru alone.The state police chief, DG&IGP Praveen Sood told HT that because of vaccination they have been able to control the number of cases and fatalities in the second wave. “In the first wave last year, we lost 103 police officials and more than 9,600 policemen and women were infected. However, this time, we have made an effort to ensure the entire department is vaccinated,” said Sood.According to Sood, out of the 87,917 police officials in the state, 96% (84,924) have received the first dose of the vaccine, while 82% (72,648 police personnel) have received the second dose. Out of the 2,993 remaining, 2,557 are medically unfit for vaccination and 436 personnel are yet to get the vaccine.The state police chief admitted that among those who are yet to receive the vaccine, some have reservations. “Some don’t want to get the vaccine because of the forwards they have seen on social media. We are trying to convince them to get the vaccine at the earliest,” he added.On Tuesday, paying tribute to the 28-year-old sub-inspector, Sood tweeted: “Youngest member of the police family to succumb to Covid. 28-year-old, PSI Shamili of Kolar, attached to DK district lost her battle with COVID. May her soul rest in peace. But it could be any of us. Please cooperate with the police, stay home and stay safe.”At the same time, data released by the Indian Medical Association (IMA) said the state has lost eight doctors to Covid-19 during the second wave of the pandemic. IMA said on Tuesday that the country has lost 270 doctors in the second wave, which has been more deadly and fast-spreading.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/41-cops-died-of-covid-in-2nd-wave-karnataka-police-data-101621363753987.html
19-05-2021||India||Will carry out PM’s advice on Covid-19: K’taka CM||Bengaluru: The Karnataka government on Tuesday said it will look to implement suggestions made by Prime Minister Narendra Modi to localise solutions and ensure all important officials in the district work as “field commanders” to fight the coronavirus pandemic.After a video conference with the Prime Minister, Karnataka home minister Basavaraj Bommai told reporters here that the main intent is to localise and implement guidelines with any improvisations, if required. “All important people in the district, it could be officials, politicians, representatives of the people, DCs (deputy commissioners), DHO (district health officer) among other officers, you have to work as the field commander,” Bommai said.The minister said officials must give a local context to orders from above and implement it. “Localise the main intent with any small changes. Make some small changes as per requirements,” he said.Modi on Tuesday interacted with various officials from district administration across several states, including Karnataka, and proposed to localise solutions to keep the virus at bay.“The number of districts in our country are equally different. In a way, every district has its own different challenges. You understand the challenges of your district much better. So when your district wins, the country wins. When your district beats corona, the country defeats corona,” he said in his interaction.Modi also interacted with the local administration of 46 districts across 10 states, of which 17 districts were from Karnataka, according to the chief minister’s office (CMO).“What are our weapons against this virus? Our weapons are local containment zones, aggressive testing and correct and complete information to the people,” Modi said.The prime minister also suggested that children be made aware of the coronavirus through cartoons and comic books in the local language.Experts have indicated that the imminent third wave of infections is likely to impact children more since this section is yet to be vaccinated.The meeting with the Prime Minister comes at a time when the Covid-19 surge in Karnataka has witnessed a shift towards rural and semi-urban areas where the healthcare infrastructure is comparatively far more inadequate.The 29 districts of Karnataka, excluding Bengaluru, reported 21,633 new infections of the total 30,309 across the state on Tuesday, according to the daily health bulletin of the state health department.The focus of successive governments on Bengaluru, Karnataka’s biggest revenue and employment generator, has left a significant portion of the state backward. The northern districts in the state are among the most backward in the country and also comprise the most arid regions after Rajasthan.Bommai said Modi asked the administration’s to use their healthcare infrastructure “judiciously” while also taking steps to increase capabilities.The district administration in Karnataka have tried to implement localised solutions to contain the spread of the pandemic in their respective regions to avoid any disaster like in Bengaluru, where shortage of oxygen, hospital beds, medicines and space in crematoriums have only added to the miseries.Several villages in Karnataka have decided on their own not to allow outsiders as means to keep them insulated from any chance of exposure to the virus.Meanwhile, the state’s vaccination drive has also hit a roadblock amid acute shortage of doses of both Covishield and Covaxin.“We have brought the issue of shortage of oxygen and vaccines to the government’s attention,” Gaurav Gupta, chief commissioner of Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (city’s civic body), said, after participating in the video conference.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/will-carry-out-pm-s-advice-on-covid-19-k-taka-cm-101621363634096.html
19-05-2021||India||INX case: Delhi HC stays trial court proceedings||New Delhi: The Delhi High Court on Tuesday stayed the trial court proceedings in the CBI’s INX Media corruption case where Congress leader P Chidambaram and his son Karti have been named as accused along with others.Justice Suresh Kumar Kait sought the response of Chidambaram and others on CBI’s plea challenging the trial court order of March 5 directing supply of certain documents to all the accused. The city court in that order also allowed the accused to inspect records pertaining to the case in CBI’s repository.“Proceedings in the present case in the trial court shall remain stayed,” Justice Kait said while posting the matter for August 9.The agency said the trial court’s order was likely to subvert the probe by allowing the acused to interfere in the agency’s processes.Advocate Anupam S Sharma, appearing for CBI, told the court that there is no provision in CrPC which “casts a duty upon the investigating agency to forward to court documents on which it does not rely upon”.He said that the trial court has got beyond its jurisdiction as there is no provision in CrPC which empowers the Magistrate to allow the accused to inspect the documents which are neither filed in court nor relied upon by the prosecution.CBI registered its case on May 15, 2017, alleging irregularities in a Foreign Investment Promotion Board clearance granted to INX Media group for receiving overseas funds of ₹305 crore in 2007 during Chidambaram’s tenure as finance minister. Thereafter, ED had lodged the money laundering case.P Chidambaram was arrested by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) in the INX Media corruption case on August 21, 2019. On October 16, 2019, ED arrested him in a related money-laundering case.Six days later, on October 22, the apex court granted bail to Chidambaram in the case lodged by CBI.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/inx-case-hc-stays-trial-court-proceedings-101621363575559.html
19-05-2021||India||Did not export Covid-19 vaccines at cost to India: SII||The Serum Institute of India (SII) did not export vaccines “at the cost of the people in India”, its chief executive officer (CEO) Adar Poonawalla said in a statement on Tuesday, amid growing criticism aimed at the government and vaccine makers for the million of doses that were exported before the second wave hit.Poonawalla also said SII may resume the export of coronavirus vaccine Covishield by end of the year.“SII has delivered more than 200 million doses, even though we received EUA (emergency use authorisation) two months after the US pharma companies. If we look at total doses produced and delivered, we rank amongst the top three in the world. We continue to scale up manufacturing and prioritise India. We also hope to start delivering to COVAX and other countries by the end of this year,” the statement read.“We would like to reiterate that we have never exported vaccines at the cost of the people in India and remain committed to do everything we can in support of the vaccination drive in the country,” the statement added.The SII statement came amid intense discussions between the Centre and Indian vaccine manufacturers on the decision to export the vaccines.SII locally manufactures Oxford-AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine under the brand name Covishield. The company currently has the capacity to produce about 60 million doses a month and intends to ramp it up to about 100 million doses a month in the next couple of months.According to SII, there was a large stockpile of vaccine doses in January. India’s vaccination drive began successfully and the number of daily cases recorded then were at an all-time low. At that stage, most people, including health experts, believed that the country was turning the tide on the pandemic.Around the same time, several other countries in the world were facing an acute crisis and were in desperate need of help.“Our Government extended support wherever possible during this period. It is this spirit that had initially led to cooperation between countries when the virus first emerged in the beginning of 2020. The cooperation between countries also forms the basis for us getting access to technology and aid for healthcare. Today, it is this reciprocity, where India has helped other countries with the supply of HCQ and vaccine exports, that has in turn led to support from other countries. There has been intense discussion,” the statement read.“We must also understand that this pandemic is not limited by geographic or political boundaries. We will not be safe until everyone globally is able to defeat this virus. Further, as part of our global alliances, we also had commitments to COVAX, so that they could distribute the vaccines around the world to end the pandemic.According to Poonawalla, another important factor that people failed to realise is that India is amongst the two most populous countries in the world, and that a vaccination drive for such a large population cannot be completed in a span of two to three months as there are several factors and challenges involved.“That said, it would take two-three years for the entire world population to get fully vaccinated… We have been working with the government tirelessly to do our best for humanity and will continue in the same spirit…,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/did-not-export-vaccines-at-cost-to-india-sii-101621363514724.html
19-05-2021||India||Govt procures 30% more wheat from farmers than last year||The government has procured 36.6 million tonne of wheat so far in the current season, which is nearly 30% more than the quantity bought from farmers during the corresponding period last year, food ministry data shows. This trend suggests that foodgrain stocks are poised to be more than what is required for subsidised distribution among the poor through the public distribution system or PDS.The government’s procurement operations have covered nearly 3.7 million farmers, who have been paid a total minimum support price (MSP) of ₹72,406 crore, the government figures show. Procurement operations refer to the state-run food agencies’ buying of farm produce at federally fixed floor prices.Procurement of rabi, or winter-sown, produce opened on April 1 with the government setting a target of buying 42.7 million tonne of wheat during the current season to be held in state-owned granaries. The wheat procurement target is about 9.5% higher than quantity procured during the last rabi season.In a normal year, nearly 25-260 million tonne of wheat is required for PDS. In 2020, 10 million tonne was additionally given for free under the Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana (PMGKAY) to alleviate distress caused by the pandemic.Nearly 800 million people qualify for subsidised foodgrains under the PDS, who are also being given additional free grains of 5 kg per person under the PMGKAY.Wheat procurement is still under way in states such as Punjab, Haryana and Madhya Pradesh. To be sure, wheat production is projected to be a record 109.2 million tonne during 2021-22, according to agriculture’s ministry second of the four quarterly advance estimates issued in February. The government has also procured about 74.2 million tonne of paddy in the current season.Given the increasing levels of procurement, activists say the government ought to expand the PDS to cover more beneficiaries.“The government is successively procuring more wheat. Population has increased since the National Food Security Act was passed in 2013, which made 67% of the population eligible for PDS grains. We therefore want a universalised PDS,” said Aysha, a Right to Food activist, who goes by one name.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-procures-30-more-wheat-from-farmers-than-last-year-101621363515290.html
19-05-2021||India||After Tauktae, IMD warns of cyclone in Bay of Bengal||After Tauktae, India could see another cyclone next week, this time in the Bay of Bengal region. A low-pressure area is likely to form around May 23 that might intensify into a depression and a cyclone, India Meteorological Department (IMD) has warned.Sunitha Devi, who monitors cyclones at IMD, said a bulletin to this effect has been released, but a forecast will be made only after there is more clarity.Devi said the atmospheric and oceanic conditions in the Bay of Bengal are also favourable for cyclone formation just like in the Arabian Sea, with the sea surface temperature in the former being around 31 degrees Celsius, which is above normal by 1-2 degrees Celsius.Earlier on May 13, Regional Specialised Meteorological Centre in Delhi had talked about the “low probability” of cyclone formation “over east central and adjoining northeast Bay of Bengal” towards the latter half of the second week following it.But Mahesh Palawat, vice president, climate change and meteorology at Skymet Weather (a private company that’s into weather forecasting) thinks India may be spared another devastation. “A low-pressure area is developing. It may intensify into a depression or a cyclone. As of now, the models are indicating that it is likely to move towards Myanmar and not towards the Indian coast,” he said.If a cyclone indeed forms, it will be called Yaas, a name coined by Oman.Meanwhile, Tauktae has weakened to a cyclonic storm after ravaging the west coast. On Tuesday afternoon, it lay centred over Saurashtra, 190 km south-southwest of Dessa and 105 km south southwest of Ahmedabad. Its intensity at the centre, or the ‘eye’, remained between 75 and 85 km/hr, with gusts of up to 95 km/hr. When it had made landfall on Monday night, the intensity at the centre was between 160 and 170 km/hr with gusts of up to 190 km/hr.But the weakened system is now likely to interact with an approaching western disturbance and cause widespread rain and thunderstorms over the western Himalayan region and adjoining plains of northwest India between May 19 and 20. There will be isolated heavy to over heavy rain over Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Haryana, Chandigarh, Delhi and West Uttar Pradesh on May 19, and heavy rain at isolated places in Punjab on the same day. Isolated extremely heavy showers are also likely over Uttarakhand on May 19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/after-tauktae-imd-warns-of-cyclone-in-bay-of-bengal-101621363454012.html
19-05-2021||India||Cyclone Tauktae will cause rain, no serious damage now: NDRF||Cyclone Tauktae has died down from very severe storm to a depression scattered over Gujarat and Rajasthan which will mainly cause rains now and no other serious damage, S N Pradhan, director general of National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) said on Tuesday evening.Asserting that the worst is over, Pradhan said 46 teams of NDRF are still stationed in the region to clear the debris, fallen trees, and poles and assist the authorities in restoration of tracks.The Gujarat government has informed the NDRF that there have been no deaths.“It was very important to clear the roads and vital arteries of communication during these troubled times of Covid-19. We have sent troops and personnel who have been vaccinated with both doses,” he told news agency ANI earlier in the day, adding that they were equipped with special suits and accompanied by paramedics, doctors and attendants while sharing his hope that the forces will come out unscathed by the pandemic.“Initially there were reports in the morning of hundreds of villages losing electricity but within an hour the electricty has been restored. These are good signs of the disaster response capabilities of India and the states. It will take some more time to complete the restoration,”he told news agency ANI.Meanwhile, Union home minister Amit Shah spoke to chief ministers of Maharashtra, Gujarat and Rajasthan and took stock of the situation on Tuesday after the landfall of Cyclone Tauktae, ministry officials said.They said the minister talked to the CMs over the telephone and extended support of the Centre in aiding and mitigating challenges that arose in the aftermath of the ‘extremely severe cyclonic storm’ battering the costal areas on the country’s western shore along the Arabian Sea. They said that while Rajasthan did not face the direct brunt of the cyclone, a number of districts were stated to have witnessed rains and strong wings as an after effect of the furious sea storm.(with agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cyclone-will-cause-rain-no-serious-damage-now-ndrf-101621363394059.html
19-05-2021||India||269 doctors died of Covid-19 in second wave: IMA||As many as 269 doctors have so far succumbed to Covid-19 in the second wave of the pandemic, the Indian Medical Association (IMA) announced on Tuesday.At least four states, Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Delhi and Andhra Pradesh have reported more than 20 deaths. These states reported 78, 37, 28 and 22 deaths, respectively.According to the IMA Covid-19 registry on the official website, 748 doctors died of Covid-19 in the first wave of the pandemic.“The numbers could be actually more but we only put out numbers after thoroughly verifying the details. Health care workers are always at the forefront, hence, more prone to contracting the disease,” Dr Rajan Sharma, former IMA president, said.Deaths in other states include: Telangana (19), Maharashtra (13), Tamil Nadu (10), Karnataka and Odisha (8 each), Madhya Pradesh (5), Chhattisgarh and Jammu and Kashmir (3 each), Assam, Gujarat, Haryana and Kerala (2 each) and Goa (1).According to the association, only 66% of the doctors have been vaccinated so far. The IMA has been regularly conducting awareness generation drives among health care professionals to encourage them to get vaccinated.“Even though some doctors among the dead were vaccinated, that percentage (about 3%) is very small. It has been fairly well established that the vaccines lessen the severity of the disease, and stop the disease from progressing to serious illness. All should get vaccinated at the earliest,” Dr Sharma said..On the list of doctors who succumbed to the disease in the second wave was former IMA national president Dr K K Aggarwal.The 62-year-old, who was awarded Padma Shri in 2010, died of Covid-19-related complications at 11.30 pm on Monday at New Delhi’s All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS).A statement uploaded on his Twitter profile confirmed the news: “It causes us immense pain to inform you that our dear Dr KK Aggarwal passed away at 11.30pm on May 17, 2021, in New Delhi, after a lengthy battle with covid-19...”“Even during the pandemic, he made constant efforts to educate the masses and was able to reach out to 100 million people through numerous videos and videos and educational programmes and saved countless lives. He wanted his life to be celebrated and not mourned,” the statement read.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/269-doctors-died-of-covid-19-in-second-wave-ima-101621362193975.html
19-05-2021||India||Row as BJP says Congress ‘toolkits’ defame India||Pandemic politics intensified on Tuesday with the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) alleging that the Congress prepared elaborate “toolkits” to defame Prime Minister Narendra Modi, build a biased narrative over India’s Covid-19 management, politicise religious events, and link the medical crisis to the Central Vista project.The Congress responded by dismissing the charges as fake, and lodging a complaint of forgery and cyber crime with the Delhi Police.A document circulating on the social media -- with Congress party symbols and markings on it -- was shared and cited by BJP leaders as an alleged call to arms by the Congress to its supporters. The document asked its readers to tarnish Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s image and “erode his popularity”; suggested using phrases such as “Indian strain” and “Modi strain” for the variants of the Sars-CoV-2 virusthat were first detected in the country; and cited briefing foreign journalists over India’s mismanagement of the second wave of the coronavirus disease.The Congress, however, maintained that the documents on Covid wereconcocted, and its leaders slammed the BJP, calling it “Bikul Jhooth Party”.The BJP attack on Tuesday was led by party president JP Nadda, who accused the Congress of “dividing society” and “spewing venom”. “Congress is a master at this. India is seeing Congress’s antics, while the nation is fighting Covid-19, I would urge Congress to go beyond ‘toolkit models’ and do something constructive,” he tweeted, citing the documents.Hours earlier, the ruling party’s Rajya Sabha member Sambit Patra first posted the documents on Twitter, and said: “Disgusting to say the least ... Rahul Gandhi wanting to use this opportunity of pandemic to destroy the image of PM Modi. No stone left unturned to scar the name of India with the help of foreign journalists.”Patra added the documents referred to liaising with journalists who write in foreign publications and briefing them on talking points. He said that the documents showed the Congress also wanted to promote dramatic photographs of funerals and dead bodies in order to malign India.Patra also said that the alleged toolkit spoke of giving a religious tone to the Covid spread by asking that the Kumbh mela in Haridwar -- which was visited by 9.1 million pilgrims before it was effectively curtailed -- be always described as a a “superspreader”.Rajeev Gowda, chairman of the Congress party’s research department, responded by saying that the BJP was propagating a “fake toolkit on Covid-19 mismanagement” and attributing it to the Congress. “When our country is devastated by Covid, instead of providing relief, the BJP shamelessly concocts forgeries,” he said, adding that the party was filing charges against Nadda and PatraOther Congress leaders said that the document prepared on the Central Vista project was genuine, and that it simply highlighted problems associated with the revamp of the central avenue in Delhi, and the expenses involved in it. They alleged that this document was used as a template to create the fake documents and alleged action plants on Covid-19.“The toolkit is a fabricated document. It is a forged document on Congress letterhead. It is another façade created by the Modi government to distract people’s attention from the real issues. How much time and efforts would you spend in covering the truth and spreading lies. If you had invested half that time and energy, India would not be struggling this much,” Congress leader Pavan Khera said.The purported Congress document also mentioned mobilising “former civil servants to raise questions about PM CARES Fund” and to “aggressively question or embarrass” celebrities wanting to donate to it. The purported document also suggested the use of phrases such as “missing [Union home minister] Amit Shah”, “quarantined [external affairs minister S] Jaishankar”, “sidelined [defence minister] Rajnath Singh”, and “insensitive [finance minister] Nirmala Sitharaman”.Toolkits first hit the news in February this year after Delhi Police linked a social media toolkit on farm protests to clashes that rocked the Capital on Republic Day, saying the document aimed to spread misinformation and incite unrest. Police also arrested climate activist Disha Ravi from Bengaluru and charged her with sedition, intending to riot and criminal conspiracy for allegedly editing the online document that Swedish Nobel laureate Greta Thunberg first publicised in support of farmers agitating against three central laws.Toolkits are essentially documents detailing social media strategy and digital campaign plans for a particular body. Ravi was granted bail on February 23.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/row-as-bjp-says-congress-toolkits-defame-india-101621361235601.html

He completed his MBBS from MGIMS, Sevagram under the Nagpur University in 1979.Members of the medical fraternity remembered Aggarwal as “very hard working, innovative and pragmatic” and hailed him as an “iconic figure in mass education and awareness”.“He was a medical activist who worked for 18 hours every day and in the last 16 months, the kind of work he did for creating awareness on the virus was phenomenal,” said Dr Vinay Aggarwal, former national president of IMA who had an association of nearly 35 years with the late doctor.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/former-ima-chief-dr-kk-aggarwal-dies-of-covid-101621357573828.html
19-05-2021||India||Tamil Nadu invites bids for production of oxygen, concentrators and vaccines||Tamil Nadu government on Tuesday invited expressions of interest (EOI) from companies to produce oxygen, vaccines and drugs to make the state self-sufficient in the fight against the Covid-19 pandemic.In a statement, the government said that the state would take efforts to develop infrastructure to manufacture oxygen, vaccines and Covid-19-related drugs. The MK Stalin-led government called for joint ventures to manufacture oxygen, oxygen concentrators, vaccines and high-tech medical equipment.“To reduce the oxygen shortage in the state and to bring a permanent solution, Tamil Nadu chief minister has ordered starting oxygen production units,” the statement said. “Orders have been issued to produce high-end medical equipment, oxygen, vaccines and medicines for Covid-19 within the state.”Tamil Nadu Industrial Development Corporation (TIDCO), a state government agency, would extend support for the joint venture to private Indian and foreign companies who invest a minimum of 50-crore. Interested firms can respond to the expression of interest before May 31.“This announcement is more significant in the present situation because the state government’s action plan here is to also encourage start-ups, though the EOI is open to everyone willing,” said Thangam Thennarasu, minister for industries, Tamil Nadu. “We want to be self-reliant, self-sufficient and self-contained so we will be in a position to rise to the occasion if the need arises in the future. The main incentive is the capital expenditure subsidy of 30%,” he added.The government offered the incentive package a week ago, as per which investors who can establish manufacturing facility and commence commercial production of oxygen concentrators, oxygen cylinders and medical oxygen can avail capital subsidy of 30% provided they start production by August 15, 2021. Investors who can establish a large liquid oxygen plant with a minimum capacity of 10 MT daily can avail the same over five years if they can commence before November 30. A nodal agency of the state’s industries department would give single-window clearance free of cost.The announcements come in the backdrop of a new government that was formed on May 2. As the government is trying to tackle the state’s rising Covid-19 cases, the demand for liquid medical oxygen has also shot up. The state is also facing a shortage of vaccines and has called for a global tender to procure 3.5 crore doses of vaccines. The integrated vaccine facility at Chengalpet district is also awaiting interested players after issuing a tender.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tamil-nadu-invites-bids-for-production-of-oxygen-concentrators-and-vaccines-101621357154207.html

19-05-2021||India||Cyclone Tauktae: Rapid intensity takes experts by surprise||Tauktae wasn’t supposed to become an extremely severe cyclonic storm, but favourable conditions reigning in the Arabian Sea helped it become that -- once again highlighting the potential impact of the climate crisis on India.Tauktae intensified from a very severe to an extremely severe cyclonic storm rapidly on Monday, taking weather experts and scientists by surprise. “Tauktae intensified very rapidly this morning. We did not state that it would intensify to an extremely severe cyclone in our forecast. But it did because of extremely favourable oceanic and atmospheric conditions,” said M Mohapatra, director general, India Meteorological Department (IMD).While forecasting the trajectory of Tauktae at 2.20am on Monday, IMD said it would intensify into a very severe cyclonic storm and cross the Gujarat coast on May 18 (Tuesday). But, by 8.15 am, another IMD bulletin said Tauktae already intensified to an extremely severe cyclonic storm with a maximum wind speed of 180-190 kmph gusting to 210 kmph and that it would cross the Gujarat coast on Monday night.Tauktae is in keeping with the trend of an increasing number of cyclones in the Arabian Sea. Time was when most of those affecting India were on the other side, in the Bay of Bengal. Scientists have no doubts as to why this is happening -- warmer seas on account of the climate crisis. “Rapid intensification of cyclones is a response to climate change and ocean warming, and cyclone forecast models have a hard time in picking them up. We need to incorporate this in forecast models and be prepared on the ground for future...,” said Roxy Mathew Koll, a climate scientist at the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology.Tauktae also intensified very rapidly from a depression to a cyclone on Friday. “With Cyclone Tauktae, this will be the fourth consecutive year of a pre-monsoon cyclone over the Arabian Sea. This is also the third consecutive year when a cyclone has come very close to the west coast of India. Sea surface temperatures in Arabian Sea have increased rapidly during the past century and this has led to an increase in the frequency and intensity of cyclones in the Arabian Sea… global warming has presented us with new challenges... Improving the Indian Ocean Observing System and incorporating global warming signals in the weather models can help us tackle the challenges,” Koll added.Still, some experts warned of this. “Conditions are extremely favourable for its (Tauktae’s) rapid intensification. Ocean heat potential is above normal; sea surface temperatures are 1-2°C above normal… We should be prepared,” Sunitha Devi, who studies cyclones at IMD, said on Thursday when a low pressure area formed over Arabian Sea.“We are seeing very intense cyclones form over Arabian Sea, they also intensify rapidly... It happens because ocean heat content is higher and sea surface temperatures are also higher... Sometimes our models are able capture this but not always,” said M Rajeevan, secretary, ministry of earth sciences.According to “Assessment of Climate Change over the Indian Region,” a report released by Union ministry of earth sciences last year, observations indicate that frequency of extremely severe cyclonic storms over the Arabian Sea has increased during the post-monsoon seasons of 1998–2018. Most models are projecting a higher sea surface warming in the Arabian Sea than the Bay of Bengal.Koll said ocean warming has made some new challenges for weather agencies. “Cyclones are now intensifying rapidly since warm ocean waters act as fuel for them. Extremely severe cyclones like Fani and Amphan intensified from a weak to severe status in less than 24 hours due to warm ocean conditions. That gives us less time to be prepared...”“Compared to the Bay of Bengal, there has always been a greater probability for a depression (a low-pressure system) forming over the Arabian Sea to intensify into a severe cyclonic storm or a stronger tropical cyclone. This climatological trend seems to be fuelled by the warming of the Arabian Sea and atmospheric support, which have triggered some powerful tropical cyclones such as Tauktae and Kyarr (2019),” said Akshay Deoras, Independent meteorologist and PhD researcher at the University of Reading, United Kingdom.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cyclone-tauktae-rapid-intensity-takes-experts-by-surprise-101621301368272.html
