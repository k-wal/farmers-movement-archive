Know everything about Black Fungus||Union health and family welfare minister Harsh Vardhan on Friday said awareness and early detection of Mucormycosis, or ‘Black Fungus’, as a way to help curb the spread of the deadly fungal infection.Hospitals across the country have been reporting cases of a rare coronavirus-linked fungal infection that affects the sinuses, the brain, and the lungs and can be life-threatening in diabetic or severely immune-compromised individuals such as cancer patients or people with HIV/AIDS.#Mucormycosis, commonly known as '#BlackFungus' has been observed in a number of #COVID19 patients recently. Awareness & early diagnosis can help curb the spread of the fungal infection. Here's how to detect & manage it #IndiaFightsCorona @MoHFW_INDIA pic.twitter.com/lC6iSNOxGFWhat is Mucormycosis?It is a fungal infection mainly affecting people with medical health problems that reduces their ability to fight environmental pathogens.What does Mucormycosis do?The fungal infection mainly affects people who are on medication for other health complexities that impair the ability to fight environmental pathogens, according to the Indian Medical Council of Medical Research (ICMR). The inhalation of fungal spores from the air affects the lungs and sinuses of such individuals.How do patients get infected with Mucormycosis?Patients with comorbidities or uncontrolled diabetes and those who are on voriconazole therapy or immunosuppression by steroids or even prolonged stay in Intensive Care Units (ICU) can get predisposed to the fungal infectionWhat are the symptoms of Black Fungus or Mucormycosis?Mucormycosis begins to manifest as skin infection in the air pockets located behind our forehead, nose, cheekbones, and in between the eyes and teeth. It then spreads to eyes, lungs and can even spread to the brain. It leads to blackening or discoloration over the nose, blurred or double vision, chest pain, breathing difficulties and coughing of blood.How to prevent Mucormycosis?Some of the preventive measures that needs to adopted to prevent contracting Mucormycosis are:• Use of masks while visiting dusty construction sites.• Wearing shoes, long trousers, long sleeve shirts and gloves while handling soil (gardening), moss or manure• Maintaining personal hygiene, including thorough scrub bath• The disease can also be managed by controlling diabetes, discontinuing immunomodulating drugs, reducing steroids and extensive surgical debridement to remove all necrotic materials.The ICMR has issued a guideline to doctors on the steps to follow in preventing the fungal infection from afflicting immunocompromised individuals. In order to spread awareness around the disease, the government also released a set of instructions to follow the prevent infections. Here are the dos and don'ts to reduce the risk of infections, as released by the ICMR:Dos:• Control hyperglycemia,• Monitor blood glucose level post-Covid-19 discharge and in patients with diabetes,• Use steroids judiciously. Timing, doses and duration should be correct,• Use clean, sterile water for humidifiers during oxygen therapy,• Use antibiotic or antifungals judiciously,Don’ts:• Miss warning signs and symptoms,• Consider all the cases with a blocked nose as cases of bacterial sinusitis, particularly in the context of immunosuppression and/or Covid-19 patients on immunomodulators,• Hesitate to seek aggressive investigations, as appropriate (KOH staining & microscopy, culture, MALDI-TOF), for detecting fungal etiology,• Lose crucial time to initiate treatment for mucormycosis.Evidence based Advisory in the time of #COVID-19 (𝐒𝐜𝐫𝐞𝐞𝐧𝐢𝐧𝐠, 𝐃𝐢𝐚𝐠𝐧𝐨𝐬𝐢𝐬 & 𝐌𝐚𝐧𝐚𝐠𝐞𝐦𝐞𝐧𝐭 𝐨𝐟 𝐌𝐮𝐜𝐨𝐫𝐦𝐲𝐜𝐨𝐬𝐢𝐬) @MoHFW_INDIA @PIB_India @COVIDNewsByMIB @MIB_India #COVID19India #IndiaFightsCOVID19 #mucormycosis #COVID19Update pic.twitter.com/iOGVArojy1ALSO READ: Govt ramping up availability of anti-fungal medicine for mucormycosisHealth experts said if it is left untreated, Mucormycosis might kill as many as 80% of the people who get it. If not detected early, it affects the orbit of the eye and the mouth, resulting in people losing their vision or jaw during debridement, the process of removing dead tissue from an infection or wound.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/what-is-mucormycosis-and-how-deadly-is-it-know-everything-about-black-fungus-101621015917469.html

14-05-2021||India||Forensic tests to reveal exact cause of deaths of 18 elephants in Assam, experts point to lightning||The Assam government on Friday decided to conduct forensic tests of the 18 elephants that reportedly died due to lightning two days ago in Barhampur area of Nagaon district. The bodies of the elephants, all adults and sub-adults, were buried on Friday after a team of veterinarians conducted the post-mortem. Some remains have been sent to the state forensic laboratory in Guwahati for further tests. The incident took place at Bamuni Pahar under Kothiatoli forest range of Nagaon district. Bodies of the pachyderms were found on Thursday-- four were found at the bottom of a hillock and 14 others on top of it. Though initial inquiry had revealed lightning to be the likely cause of the deaths, wildlife experts had suspected that mass poisoning could also be a reason as Assam had earlier witnessed deaths of elephants due to poisonings. “From what we saw, it appears the deaths were caused due to lightning as there were no visible signs of struggle before the elephants died. But the exact cause will be known only after reports of post mortem and forensic examinations,” said forest and environment minister Parimal Suklabaidya. The Assam government has constituted a team to be headed by a senior forest officer and seven veterinarians to probe the incident. They will submit their preliminary report within three days and a detailed one in 15 days. On Friday, almost the entire day was spent on conducting post-mortems, bringing the bodies of the pachyderms down from the hillock and burying them in open grounds. “The post-mortem reports will be available in a day or two, but we may have to wait a little longer for outcome of the forensic tests. A visit to the area had revealed that some trees near the bodies of the elephants were burnt, which suggested that lightning may have struck the area,” P Sivakumar, director, Kaziranga National Park and Tiger Reserve (KNPTR) said. Elephant experts and CEO of Aaranyak, a wildlife NGO, Bibhab Talukdar, said that though it initially appeared unlikely that lightning could have resulted in the deaths, but evidence now suggests that it was the most probable cause. “Our studies have revealed that in Assam, the most intense lightning strikes happen prior to dawn and in the period between April-May, our region is the third most prone to lightning after parts of Central Amercia and Australia. An international weather website had also shown lightning strikes happening in the area where the elephants died on Wednesday,” said Rahul Mahanta, professor of Physics at Cotton University. “There have been previous instances in the past where large numbers of animals have died due to lightning. In 2016, over 300 reindeer died in Norway in a lightning strike. Photos and videos of the incident at Nagaon suggest that the elephants died in an instant after their nervous system got severely affected by the lightning strike,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/forensic-tests-to-reveal-exact-cause-of-deaths-of-18-elephants-in-assam-experts-point-to-lightning-101621013700349.html

Adding that provision for more beds will be made as and when the need arises.“296 patients with Mucormycosis admitted here, a separate ward has been opened. If needed, we'll increase beds,” said Dr Modi“Government provides us medicines -- amphotericin & oral antifungal drugs -- for its treatment, daily as per need,” he added.Mucormycosis, which is caused by a black fungus called mucor, has been on the rise all over the country. Symptoms for which include blurred vision, shortness of breath, discolouration over the nose, chest pains, coughing etc. Covid-19 afflicted patients who are diabetic have a higher chance of catching this infection.Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) has issued a guideline to doctors on the steps to follow in preventing the fungal infection from afflicting immunocompromised individuals. Pune district, which recorded around 270 cases of Mucormycosis so far, has framed a set of Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for treating patients.Niti Ayog member Dr VK Paul told reporters on May 7 that there is no major outbreak of Mucormycosis in the country, and that the government is monitoring the situation.“There are reports of this fungal infection among Covid-19 patients. But I want to reassure you that there is no major outbreak and we are monitoring the cases at our level," Paul had said.State governments have however begun to voice their concern over this fungal infection affecting recovered Covid patients. Rajasthan chief minister Ashok Gehlot urged the Central government to take the disease seriously and conduct research on it. Maharashtra health minister Rajesh Tope asked the Centre to bring down prices of the drugs used to treat the infection so as to prevent black marketing. Maharashtra has reported 1,500 cases of the infection so far, said Tope.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ahmedabad-hospital-creates-separate-ward-for-mucormycosis-as-cases-continue-to-be-reported-across-india-101621012409076.html

14-05-2021||India||Govt says media reports on 'Make in India' ventilators in Aurangabad not working 'baseless, incorrect'||The Union Health Ministry on Friday dismissed as "baseless and incorrect, and not supported by full information on the matter" some media reports suggesting that 'Make in India' ventilators in Maharashtra's Aurangabad district were not functioning optimally.  Ventilators were available in very limited numbers in government hospitals across the country at the beginning of the pandemic last year. Moreover, very limited manufacturing of ventilators was taking place in the country and most of the suppliers abroad were not in a position to make supplies of ventilators in large quantities to India.That is when the local manufacturers were encouraged to produce "Make in India" ventilators to address the huge projected demand of the country and orders placed on them. The ventilator models went through rigorous screening, technical demonstration and clinical validation process in a very limited time available, through domain knowledge experts, and after their approval, these were put into supplies.There are a few states which received the ventilators but are yet to get these installed in their hospitals. The Union health secretary wrote to seven such states on April 11 which still have more than 50 ventilators lying uninstalled with them for the last 4-5 months, the ministry said. They have been requested to get the installation expedited so that the ventilators can be put to optimal use.Ventilators manufactured by Jyoti CNC were supplied to Aurangabad Medical College. Jyoti CNC is one of the manufacturers of "Make in India" Ventilators. They have supplied ventilators centrally for Covid-19 management, as per the directions of Empowered Group-3, a statement said. These ventilators were then made available to states as per their requests. This supplier is not funded under PM CARES fund.In Aurangabad Medical College, 150 ventilators were supplied by Jyoti CNC. The first tranche of 100 ventilators reached Aurangabad on April 19, 2021 and their installation was carried out as per the allocations received from the state authorities. Forty-five out of 100 in the first lot were installed in the medical college. Installation and successful commissioning certificate in respect of all these ventilators was issued by the hospital authorities after their successful commissioning and demonstration, the ministry said.Out of these 45 installed ventilators, three were reinstalled in a private hospital (Cigma Hospital) by the state authorities. These were installed again by engineers of Jyoti CNC at the said private hospitals. The installation and commissioning certificate was issued by the hospital authorities also after their successful commissioning and demonstration, the statement said.Twenty ventilators out of the above 45 were reallocated to another private hospital (MGM Hospital) by the states authorities. No formal information was provided about this to Jyoti CNC, the statement said.Therefore, Jyoti CNC engineers had no part in the reinstallation of these ventilators. Therefore, the installation of these ventilators at the new location was done by the state authorities at their own responsibility.The ministry said 55 ventilators of the first tranche were diverted to other locations (four locations namely Civil Hospitals at Beed, Usmanabad, Parbhani and Hingoli). Installation and commissioning certificates for 50 ventilators were issued by the hospital authorities after their successful commissioning and demonstration. Five ventilators are lying uninstalled at the Beed Civil Hospital waiting for directions from the hospital authorities, the statement said.The second tranche of 50 ventilators was sent to the Aurangabad Medical College and Hospital on April 23, 2021. Only two ventilators were installed in a private hospital by the authorities (Cigma Hospital). Installation and commissioning certificates for these two ventilators have also been issued by the hospital authorities after their successful commissioning and demonstration. Directions are awaited by Jyoti CNC & HLL for further installations of 48 ventilators lying packed in Government Medical College, Aurangabad, the statement said.On April 23, (i.e. four days after successful installation of ventilators the hospital authorities at GMC Aurangabad, a complaint was received telephonically informing that eight ventilators were not functioning, the statement said.The engineers went to the site and found that flow sensor (proximal) had not been installed in three ventilators by the hospital. All eight were recalibrated by the service engineers of the vendor. One ventilator had an oxygen cell which was not functioning, the statement said.A fresh oxygen cell was reinstalled and this ventilator also made functional and commissioned subsequently, it said.Jyoti CNC received a call on May 10, 2021 informing that two ventilators have been used in ICU. Out of these, one on NIV (Non-Invasive (BiPAP) mode), is not being able to ensure saturation of the patient. The authorities said that this may be checked outside the ICU, the statement said.The same was examined by the team of service engineers and was found to be in functional condition and the team returned after satisfying the Hospital authorities. This was put back in operation on a patient on night of May 12 on NIV mode, the statement said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-says-media-reports-on-make-in-india-ventilators-in-aurangabad-not-working-baseless-incorrect-101621008716881.html

It’s the first in India||Thirty members of the transgender community got their first Covid-19 vaccination dose in Guwahati on Friday as part of a special drive — the first such in the entire country. A vaccination centre was set up at a shelter home for transgenders in the city with the support of the state’s health department. The drive will continue and cover other districts of the state in the next few weeks. “The main source of income of most transgender people is begging. Since they come into contact with other people, they are very vulnerable to getting infected,” said Swati Bidhan Baruah, founder of the All Assam Transgender Association and associate vice-chairperson of Assam government’s transgender welfare board. “As a marginalized group, they were getting left out of the vaccination process and when we requested the health department, we got a very positive response. They helped with the logistics and we were able to start the vaccination drive without any glitch,” said Baruah. Since, it was Eid-ul-Fitr on Friday the number of participants was limited. Over 200 people are expected to get vaccinated in the second round of the drive, to be conducted next week. “I have been interacting with transgender activists from other parts of the country and they were saying that no such vaccination programme has been launched for the community in other states. We are happy that we have been able to do it in Assam for the first time,” said Baruah. According to the 2011 census, Assam has a transgender population of 11,374. In June last year, the state government set up a welfare board for the transgender community. A separate gender category was introduced for transgender people in the state civil services examination in October last year. “We decided to start the special drive for the community to ensure they don’t get left out of the vaccination process. We will continue to provide them with the required doses so that the drive can continue and cover every transgender person in the state,” said Munindra Nath Ngatey, director, health services (family welfare).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/assam-starts-special-covid-19-vaccination-drive-for-transgenders-it-s-the-first-in-india-101621008241525.html

Addressing the media through a virtual meet he said the state was passing through a critical phase and the government had been compelled to extend the lockdown. The eight-day lockdown was due to end on May 16 but now it will be in force till May 23. The CM said triple lockdown (strict restrictions like curfew) will be in force in four worst-hit districts of Thiruvananthapuram, Ernakulam, Thrissur and Malappuram. Earlier the core committee on the pandemic and the Indian Medical Association had sought extension of the lockdown in view of the high test positivity rate in the state. On Friday, Kerala reported 34,696 new Covid-19 cases with a TPR of 26.41 per cent after 1,13,375 people were tested. It also reported 93 deaths taking the death toll to 6243. The active caseload also climbed to 4,42,194 in the state. Thiruvananthapuram district topped the list with 4,567 cases followed by Malappuram with 3,997 cases and Ernakulam with 3,855 new infections. Among those infected, 112 are health workers. Though most of the frontline warriors including health workers have been vaccinated, the second bout of infection has raised worries among medical experts. In some areas the second bout of infection is more than 10 per cent, they said. “Experts say the remaining two weeks are critical for the state. So we need extra caution. We have to rise up to the occasion and we will overcome this also,” said the CM adding that in the four worst-affected districts curbs will be strengthened further to reduce the high TPR. The government has also capped the price of essential products and warned strict action against offenders and hoarders. N-95 masks will be priced at ₹22, triple layer surgical mask ₹4, a PPE kit for ₹273, face shield for ₹21 and fingertip pulse oximeter for ₹1500. Earlier the government had capped charges of private hospitals after many cases of fleecing patients were reported.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-extends-lockdown-till-may-23-amid-continuing-spike-in-covid-19-infections-101621005720017.html

Rules stand in the way||The House committees of Parliament will not be able to meet online amid the raging second wave of Covid19 pandemic as the relevant rules have not been amended, a Rajya Sabha communique to Leader of the Opposition Mallikarjun Kharge said on Friday.Nearly all meetings of the standing committees have come to a standstill in the past few weeks as lawmakers are unable to come to Delhi due to the ongoing Covid pandemic. Last week, Kharge appealed to Rajya Sabha chairman Venkaiah Naidu to allow online meetings as many key subjects and issues are pending for discussion.On Friday, the secretariat wrote back saying that the amendments of rules to allow virtual meetings can be taken up only during the next parliament session. “The issue of confidentiality can be resolved during the session as any amendment to the Rules can be approved by the respective Houses only after the matter is considered by the Rules Committees.”The reply, however, also acknowledged that authorities did consider suggestions to amend the rules during the first Covid wave but the move lost momentum.The letter, signed by a joint secretary-rank official in the secretariat, said: “In a similar situation during the first wave of the Covid-19 pandemic, Hon’ble Chairman and Hon’ble Speaker (Om Birla) had decided in a meeting that the mater regarding holding of virtual meetings of the parliamentary committees vis-à-vis existing provisions and confidentiality of the proceedings of the committees may be referred to the committee on Rules in both the Houses.” “As physical meetings of the committees were being held regularly, following the guidelines strictly, the matter rested there and the situation had not arisen for considering the matter by the Rules Committees,” the letter added.The communication also suggested that the chances of the House panels meeting online now amid this pandemic are slim. “The meetings of the committees can be considered shortly once the situation improves for better”.Opposition leaders rejected this position of the secretariat and made a fresh demand for online meetings.“A wasteful new Parliament building is being constructed in the midst of a national catastrophe, and it is considered an “essential service”. But a simple rule cannot be changed to allow virtual meetings of Standing Committees. Come on Speaker Sir, Chairman Garu!,” tweeted Congress chief whip in Rajya Sabha Jairam Ramesh.Several key meetings including those of the Union cabinet and the PM’s meetings on Covid have been held digitally for the past many months. Recently, the entire council of ministers also held an online meeting.Authorities, however, pointed out these meetings can be easily held in different platforms, but Parliament has to amend its rule books to allow any deviation from the usual format of MPs gathering at one of the committee rooms to discuss issues, call witnesses or adopt a report.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rajya-sabha-committees-can-t-meet-online-oppn-told-rules-stand-in-the-way-101621005665276.html
14-05-2021||India||YSR Congress MP, who asked court to cancel bail to Jagan, arrested for sedition||YSR Congress lawmaker Kanumuri Raghurama Krishnam Raju was arrested in Hyderabad by Andhra Pradesh’s Crime Investigation Department (CID) on Friday on charges of sedition, disturbing communal harmony and attacking dignitaries of the Jagan Mohan Reddy government, the police said in a statement.A police statement issued after his arrest said a preliminary inquiry against the MP “found that through his speeches on regular basis Mr Raju was indulging in systematic, schematic effort to cause tensions among the communities and by attacking various government dignitaries in a way which will cause loss of faith in the government which they represent”.The arrest comes weeks after Kanumuri Raghurama Krishnam Raju, an outspoken critic of his party chief and Andhra Pradesh chief minister YSR Jagan Mohan Reddy over the last year, asked a special CBI special court on April 27 to cancel the bail granted to Jagan Mohan Reddy. He alleged that the chief minister, released on bail in an alleged disproportionate assets case pending since 2012, had been violating the bail conditions. This request is pending before the judge who asked the CBI and Jagan Mohan Reddy to respond to the charge.Raghurama Krishnam Raju, who represents Narasapuram parliamentary constituency in West Godavari district, was in Hyderabad to celebrate his 59th birthday on Friday when a CID police led by R Vijaya Paul, additional superintendent of police, Guntur, arrested him.The Andhra Pradesh CID statement said a case had been registered against the MP under Section 124-A (sedition) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC), for alleged comments against the Jagan Mohan Reddy government, damaging its reputation and inciting hatred among the people. The police have also invoked Section 153 (b) (making comments causing communal disharmony or affecting national integration) and Section 505 (making statements with public mischief) against the MP.Raghurama Krishnam Raju’s son K Bharat told reporters that the CID team forcibly took away his father without disclosing any reasons.“They didn’t even tell us where my father is being taken. How can the cops arrest an MP at a time when the coronavirus pandemic is so severe?” he asked.Bharat said he would file a petition in court against his father’s “illegal arrest”.This isn’t the first time that Raju, a well-known industrialist in the West Godavari district, has gone against Jagan Reddy. Raju quit the party in 2014 after he didn’t get a ticket to contest the Lok Sabha general elections and crossed over to the BJP. He exited the BJP in 2018 and switched to the Telugu Desam Party before returning to the YSR Congress in March 2019 in time for the Lok Sabha elections.Raghurama Krishnam Raju was elected to the Lok Sabha but had a falling out with Jagan Mohan Reddy again last year.

HT has reviewed the advisory.Asserting that Article 21 of the Constitution extends not only to living persons but also to the dead, the Commission said, “it is the duty of the State to protect the rights of the deceased and prevent crime over the dead body”.Although there is no specific law in India for protecting the rights of the dead, NHRC has pointed out that there are several international covenants, Supreme Court and high court judgements as well as guidelines issued by various governments from time to time emphasizing on maintaining Covid-19 protocol and giving decent burial/cremation according to respective religious customs and practices.The advisory asked authorities to urgently set-up temporary crematoriums in view of the large number of Covid-19 deaths and long queues seen at crematoriums.It said that use of electric crematoriums may be encouraged in order to avoid the health hazards emerging from the emission of smoke from burning pyres in large number; piling up of bodies during transportation or at any other place must not be allowed to happen and mass burial/cremation should not be allowed to take place as it is in violation of the right to dignity of the dead.“In order to ensure that dignity is upheld during handling of bodies, the cremation/burial ground staff must be sensitized about proper handling of the body. Further, they need to be provided necessary safety equipment and facilities so that they may perform their duty efficiently without any fear or risk,” the advisory said.It said the religious rituals that do not require touching of the body may be allowed such as reading from religious scripts, sprinkling holy water, etc, and in cases where the family members are not in a position to perform last rites as they themselves may be infected or are not willing for fear of getting infected, the state/local administration may perform the last rites of the body, taking into account the religious/cultural factors.As of May 13, there were over 2.62 lakh deaths in the country due to the pandemic.Not specific to Covid-19 victims, the human rights agency asked the Centre and states to maintain a district-wise digital dataset of (all) death cases for which it suggested that a dynamic web portal must be created.It also said that digital confirmation of all – Covid-19 or non-Covid19 deaths must be simultaneously updated in all documents such as bank account, Aadhar Card, insurance etc., wherever applicable, to prohibit the scope of any impersonation or illegal monetary transaction.The NHRC further recommended that accurate identification of the body must be done by using different criteria for identification and the state authorities must ensure proper handling of the information about the dead and missing persons in disasters.It said overcharging by ambulances must be regulated and staff handling such bodies must be fairly paid.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/enact-special-law-to-uphold-dignity-of-dead-nhrc-to-centre-states-on-covid-19-victims-101620999659559.html

This was in June last year when the first death was reported," the president of the facility, Bhai Naik told PTI.The institution is open to cremating deceased Covid-19 patients from all religions, he said.Last rites of deceased patients are performed between 5 pm to 6 pm every day, Naik said."You will see people queuing up with bodies for final rites. The scene is grim," he said.Considering the rush, the civic-run crematorium at St Inez in Panaji has roped in additional resources.An official in charge of this facility said the burden has increased manifold, but there is no other option."We can't send the bodies back. We conduct the final rites after observing all the necessary standard operating procedures," he said.The Corporation of City of Panaji (CCP) on Friday announced that it will waive of additional charges on providing hearse van services to relatives of patients who died of Covid-19 at the Goa Medical College and Hospital.CCP Mayor Rohit Monserratte said ₹100 would be charged for providing No Objection Certificates and ₹500 for ferrying bodies by hearse vans.The facility will be available only for residents of Panaji, he added.As on Thursday, the Covid-19 caseload in Goa was at 1,30,130 and the toll reached 1,937.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/goas-crematoriums-witness-rush-as-covid-19-cases-rise-101620997761981.html
14-05-2021||India||Ghazipur administration steps in to offer financial assistance to kin of deceased for cremation||Bihar police on Friday urged the people of Ghazipur not to immerse the mortal remains of the deceased in river Ganga and instead perform their last rites in a dignified manner, and added that those who cannot afford to bear the expenses of cremation must seek the help of the district administration. Police also asked the local residents to remain vigilant and report incidents of outsiders doing so, reported news agency ANI."Please do not perform water burial of bodies into Ganga river, but cremate them. If any person is unable to bear expenses of cremation, please inform us. We will make arrangements." cops announced to locals on a loudspeaker.Ghazipur administration capped the price of firewood at ₹650 per quintal and fixed the amount crematorium workers can charge the kin of the deceased at Rs. 500, adding that those who are unable to bear the expenses will be given a financial assistance of ₹5,000. Control rooms will be set up at crematoriums for police personnel and government clerks will be monitoring the situation.“Ghazipur administration has capped the price of firewood at ₹650/quintal and crematorium workers will not take more than ₹500 for cremating a body. We're setting up a control room at each crematorium where police personnel and lekhpal would be stationed,” said Ghazipur district magistrate MP Singh.“If any person is unable to bear expenses of cremation (of the body of their relative/family member) and goes to any crematorium, we will provide them with ₹5000 immediately and bear all expenses of cremation,” he added.As India faces a deluge of Covid-19 fatalities it led to an artificial increase in the price of firewood across the country. In Uttar Pradesh, firewood for the cremation cost twice the market rate, Reuters reported on Friday.Scores of dead bodies were fished out from the Ganga in Uttar Pradesh’s Ghazipur and Balia districts, and in Bihar’s Buxar. It is not known for sure if the deaths are due to Covid-19 since the bodies are too decomposed for RT-PCR tests. Locals of Buksar village, told Hindustan Times that those who cannot afford to cremate their dead bury them in the shallow banks of Ganga, and these burials have spiked since the panchayat elections in UP ended.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ghazipur-administration-steps-in-to-offer-financial-assistance-to-kin-of-deceased-for-cremation-101620996288819.html
14-05-2021||India||Centres under Digital India registered barely 170,000 for vaccination in May||A little over 170,000 citizens booked Covid-19 vaccine appointments from May 1-10 through Common Service Centres (CSCs), set up under the Digital India scheme to provide last mile access of internet services to people in rural and remote areas without smartphones. According to the official data accessed by HT, 90% of these are at the panchayat level. The numbers are low considering the CSCs provide access to digital services to 400,000-500,000 people on a daily basis, an official familiar with the matter said. Moreover, just a little over 500 million people in the country have access to smartphones. “The numbers are low because appointments slots are not available and, in many cases, centres are shut due to a lockdown in the state,” the official mentioned above said. “Barely 60,000 centres are functional at the moment.”According to the data, the highest number of appointments were made in Maharashtra, 23,699, followed by 18,244 in Bihar, 16,781 in Uttar Pradesh, 15,837 in Odisha, 14,666 in West Bengal and 10,722 in Rajasthan.There are 400,000 operational CSCs across the country, of which 250,000 are present at the panchayat level. In March alone in Uttar Pradesh, CSCs across the state collected over ₹1,000 crore in form of electricity payments alone. Last year, during the lockdown, over ₹10,000 crore was withdrawn from the CSCs across the country.Also Read | Jharkhand CM launches free vaccination drive for people aged 18-44 yrsNational Health Authority chief RS Sharma said that CoWIN, the government’s portal for vaccination registration, has been integrated with the CSCs to allow them to register people. “Most of these centres are located in rural areas and are helping provide services in terms of registration and appointment for vaccination,” he said.However, the trends on CoWIN also show a sharp decline in the number of registrations. From 13,283,056 on April 28, registrations dropped to 3,125,700 on May 12. The government has faced criticism from several sections for being unable to provide equitable access to vaccination, with 12 Opposition parties writing to the Prime Minister on April 12 to ensure vaccination for everyone. According to development economist and IIT professor Reetika Khera, most of the vaccine slots are being taken up by urban people. “Even in urban areas, slots are hard to get,” Khera said. “De facto, online registration has become a way to ‘manage’ vaccine shortage, by funneling them to the vocal urban tech-savvy population. Even if we quadruple the number of bookings per the CSC data, since one phone number can be used to register four people, barely 800,000 will have got a slot.” She added that Chhattisgarh was one of the few states trying to bypass the digital divide and enable access to vaccination for all. “According to national sample survey data 2017, internet facilities can be accessed by only 17% rural areas and 42% in urban areas. This creates a divide that by default puts a large part of the population at a disadvantage,” Khera said.Human rights activist Usha Ramanathan said that CoWIN and Aarogya Setu are privileging vaccination. “If the purpose of the whole exercise is that everyone gets access to vaccination, then this shouldn’t be the system. It seems it wasn’t about vaccination at all but asking people to come report to them.” She said that the disconnect between reporting to the system and not getting access to the service is something we have seen over the last few years. “For people who don’t have phones, it’s not just CSCs, four people can register from one phone number. This idea of nominating a person and conduct through a mobile phone has become the norm. It’s become a very strange space where one must have a smartphone, one must know how to use it and then you may be able to find time for a vaccination slot. This, in a country where a majority doesn’t understand how to use mobile phones, does not work.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centres-under-digital-india-registered-barely-170-000-for-vaccination-in-may-101620996539555.html

14-05-2021||India||Kerala HC directs Centre to set timeline for supply of vaccines to state||The Kerala High Court on Friday directed the Centre to inform when Covid-19 vaccines needed for the state could be supplied and also set a time-frame for it. Hearing a public interest litigation (PIL) questioning the manufacturing policy, transfer of technology, patent and supply of Covid-19 vaccines, the court expressed concern over the long wait to get jabs. “Give a time-frame within which vaccines can be supplied to the state. If you delay the whole thing, new mutations will come up and people will die. Give a timeline, so we will get a picture,” a bench of Justices Raja Vijayaraghavan and M R Anitha observed. The petitioner (Dr K P Aravindan) contended that there are at least 19 other vaccine manufacturers in the country and if the Centre agrees to transfer technology they can start manufacturing and many lives could be saved. He also questioned the different pricing of vaccines and said authorities should publish information regarding the intellectual property rights of vaccines for the knowledge of the people. He also argued that there is a violation of Article 14 of the Constitution (right to equality) which resulted in creating two classes in the vaccination policy, one price for the Union government and another for the state. He also said that the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) and the Centre own intellectual property rights of Covaxin. This can be transferred to other manufacturers to increase the production. He said it is possible to incorporate the required bio-safety levels into manufacturing units in a short span of time. At this point, the court observed that the Covid-19 situation in the state was really serious and at the present pace of vaccination it would take a minimum of two years for the whole state to be vaccinated. The lawyer appearing for the Union government said many intricacies were involved in such issues and sought time to file a detailed reply. The court agreed and the PIL will be heard again next Friday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-hc-directs-centre-to-set-timeline-for-supply-of-vaccines-to-state-101620996359297.html
14-05-2021||India||Pandemic has led to rise in poverty, inequality; don’t be complacent: JNU prof||As India battles the second wave of Covid-19 infections, questions about the pandemic’s economic impact have gained salience. Last year, in order to curb the spread of the pandemic, a 68-day long strict lockdown was imposed on March 25, 2020 — this led to the most severe GDP contraction in post independence-India. This year, while there is no national lockdown, a large number of states have imposed mobility restrictions and economic activity has taken a hit.To understand the possible impact of the pandemic’s second wave on the Indian economy, HT spoke to Himanshu, an associate professor of economics at Jawaharlal Nehru University. Excerpts:The second wave of Covid-19 is far more severe than the first one. There is a view among many economists and institutions that its economic impact will not be as bad as the first one. What do you think? It depends on where you are looking at the economy from. We had a very severe impact last year itself. So obviously compared to last year, the growth rate will not be so bad. But if you compare to 2019-20, we are in a situation where our economy will not recover, in terms of per capita income even to 2019-20 levels. The optimism that you see is based on the fact that we had a contraction of around 8.5%-9% last year, so a similar level of contraction is not possible. But it is a false optimism.Our aggregate GDP numbers are not reflecting the level of stress we are dealing with in the economy, whether in terms of health expenditure, normal expenditure of households or distress in rural areas. But there are pressure points, pain points which are very much visible.Also Read | Jharkhand CM launches free vaccination drive for people aged 18-44 yrsAny complacency on that front can be far more disastrous than the complacency which led us to believe that we have conquered the pandemic. Policymakers should be far more cautious than they are appearing that this time.If GDP numbers do not capture the real pain in the economy, what are the numbers we should we looking at? Let us take the GDP numbers first. If we have an 8.5%-9% contraction in 2020-21, which is what is expected, you need at least a 9.5% growth this year to bring per capita income levels to 2019-20 levels, because our population would have increased. We are certainly going below 9.5%.Everybody has started a downward revision of GDP projections and I think this process (of downward revision) will continue. Even these are overestimates, because we still do not have full data for 2020-21. For example, for non-banking financial companies, we still have data until September-October 2020. Once these numbers come in, we will see some kind of sharp downward revision in 2020-21 GDP estimates. This is a trend (downward revisions in GDP numbers) which has been seen in the last four-five years.What we are missing out is that wage recovery has still not happened. If you compare real wages in both agriculture and non-agriculture, real wages in March 2021 (latest available data) are still lower than March 2019 levels. That is the reality we are talking about. Even private surveys such as the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy (CMIE) show that employment has not recovered to pre-pandemic levels.In 2017-18, we had the last consumption expenditure survey (CES). But it was junked by the government. That (CES) data itself showed that poverty levels had gone up. After that, we have only gone backwards. Level of misery has increased. I think there are pressure points which are very much visible.As far as inflation numbers are concerned, and I have been pointing this out for some time, we are still not out of the woods. We need to be looking at it much more carefully. So, I think we are in a much more precarious situation than we were in April 2020. In April 2020, whatever you say, the economy was slowing down, but we still had positive growth. Today, the economy is not in a position to take two back-to-back years of stress.Last year, the rural economy provided an important cushion to aggregate demand. The pandemic has proliferated in rural areas in a big way. The terms of trade have moved against farmers due to increase in prices of diesel, fertilisers etc. Can we take rural demand for granted going forward? This is precisely the point I was talking about. The last time we were in a similar situation vis-a-vis the rural economy was in 2011-12. Even though food prices were increasing at a sharp pace, because input prices started rising at a faster pace, by 2013-14, agricultural incomes had collapsed. This is something the NITI Aayog has also pointed out.We are now seeing a situation now where demand has already contracted due to the pandemic’s distress. The ability of the government to pump-prime the rural economy through massive stimulus is also curtailed. And now, we have rising input prices. Last year, even though the benefit of fall in petroleum prices was not passed on to consumers, fertiliser and diesel prices did not go up. Since January 2021, there has been a massive increase in petroleum prices. Complex fertiliser prices have already gone up. Experience tells us that urea prices will also follow the same trend. Already fertiliser consumption has declined as per the daily tracker that we have from the Fertiliser Association of India data.Also Read | Uttar Pradesh reports 15,747 new Covid-19 cases, tally goes past 1.59 millionWe also need to remember the pandemic has led to a sharp increase in out-of-pocket health expenditure for a lot of households. Most of the rural households will start with a net debt, and the bulk of it will be from non-institutional sources at very high interest rates.I think rural areas are no longer being seen as something which will lead a recovery in the economy. The question is whether the urban sector can now pull-up the rest of the economy? My own understanding is that is not the case.The April Consumer Price Index (CPI) numbers show a 3% contraction in cereal prices. The government is claiming that it has done record procurement. What explains this trend?Remember that because of the lockdown we did not have proper inflation data in April 2020. What we had were imputed numbers. So that is one factor. But we also have to look at what is happening to international food prices. The Food and Agricultural Organisation’s (FAO) food price index shows a similar trend for cereal prices. But at some point, cereal prices will start firming up. As of now, disinflation in cereal prices is a result of demand deflation, but international factors are also playing a role. But we should not get complacent about it. Food inflation can go up.We do not have a Consumption Expenditure Survey after 2011-12. This means our GDP and CPI series etc. have not been updated. How bad is it from a policymaking perspective, in your view, to be dealing with the biggest ever economic disruption with a set of obsolete statistical database? The fact that most of the data is faulty led to a sense of complacency as far as the government’s response to the pandemic is concerned. The fact that data is not available makes it difficult to even formulate policy. We are not going to come out of this situation. The problem of lack of data is not going to be taken care of in the next year or so. The situation is so bleak because the government has stopped releasing data. A good example is the Situation Assessment Survey of farmers which was completed in 2019 but has still not been released. We are creating a feel-good situation, but the reality cannot be hidden. Just as dead bodies cannot be hidden even if you try and hide the number of infections and cases.Last year’s recovery was seen as profit-led rather than wage-led, where companies squeezed labour costs to maintain profits even though revenues fell. Is this sustainable anymore? No. You must also take into account that the profit-led recovery was also aided by the corporate tax cut in September 2019. So, profits had a god run for last two years. Whatever cost reduction could have been achieved with cutting employee costs has already been reached. With rising commodity prices (which will affect costs) this channel of profit-led growth is not feasible. It is just a matter of time before the chain breaks.There is a legitimate concern about rise in poverty due to the pandemic. What about its impact on the non-poor? They have a disproportionate importance in driving India’s consumption story. Overall, the pandemic has led to an increase in poverty. We might not have the official numbers about increase in poverty, but at least, nobody disagrees on that fact that poverty has increased. Similarly, the impact on inequality is also very clear. That in a way is coming from the nature of recovery. What is not documented is that a large number of middle class, regular employees have moved to the ranks of self-employed workers. Their incomes have declined. There is a shrinking which is happening in the middle (class).Also Read | From UP, a tale of the failure of the Indian stateIncome inequality is going to increase across all dimensions. This is not going to be a one-off impact. It will feed into inter-generational inequality. Access to education itself is determined by what kind of resources you have. A lot of students are falling behind on this count. The effects of this will show five or ten years down the line.What will suffer because of rise in inequality is not essential spending, but discretionary spending. Discretionary spending is what drives economic growth in the long run. It will create a vicious spiral of further generation of inequality.There is a view that the economy bottomed out in 2020-21. We have heard this logic earlier too. Are you saying that the pandemic’s impact could be structural rather than cyclical shock on India’s growth prospects? It is precisely the point that I am talking about. We had these structural factors building up, because the nature of demand itself was skewed in favour of a certain section of the population and their ability to drive the economy was limited.Those structural factors have been widened by the pandemic. We are in a situation where if we do not correct these structural bottlenecks, then we can forget about getting into a sustainable growth rate of 7% GDP growth. Unless of course, there is a big export boost. We should be worried about the policy response to these structural challenges, and if we do not do this, then any recovery might not be sustainable.Also Read | In its hour of need, Quad members stand with IndiaI do not think our policymakers are even thinking about these issues at the moment. We are just hoping against hope that anything that comes down has to go up. We are in a situation where the ship itself is sinking unless the loopholes are plugged in.Going forward, what do you think needs to be done? I can list three things.One, there here has to be a change in the policy paradigm. It is no longer a cyclical shock. It is something which has basically raised questions on the way the economy is structured. Those questions can no longer be avoided. For the last 30 years, most governments have basically tried to push the more difficult questions to subsequent governments and take easy decisions themselves and claim credit for reforms. We have to rethink where the economy is going. That will require an understanding of from where the revenue is to be generated, where demand will come from, what is the role of fiscal policy or inflation management etc. I am talking about broader questions. Many of us do not have the answers, but we have to start talking about these questions.Two, states have to be given their due share, and not just their due share in Goods and Services Tax but also the flexibility of taking their decisions to revive the economy. I think unlike the current centralised approach, a federal approach is needed.Third, the government should pump a lot of money in the economy, whether it is in rural or urban areas. Right now, the economy is in an ICU.Should we forget about the fiscal deficit at the moment? Forget about the fiscal deficit. I really think that monetary policy and fiscal policy do not have a contradiction as long as the objectives are not very clear. The problem with this government is its objectives are not very clear. And if that happens, then fiscal policy will keep on blaming monetary policy and monetary policy will keep on blaming fiscal policy.The objective should be ramp up income, create demand in the domestic economy and provide protection to large majority of the population. These sections will drive our growth in the next decade or the decade after that. We cannot simply hold the assumption that private corporate sector profits are going to drive the economy. That understanding has to change.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pandemic-has-led-to-rise-in-poverty-inequality-don-t-be-complacent-jnuprof-101620996059540.html
14-05-2021||India||Tauktae likely to be a very severe cyclonic storm: IMD||Tauktae, once formed, is likely to intensify into a ‘very severe cyclonic storm’ with wind speed of 150 to 160 kmph gusting to 175 kmph on May 17, according to the latest forecast by the India Meteorological Department (IMD).The depression over Lakshadweep area has moved north-north-eastwards with a speed of about 19 kmph and is now centred over Lakshadweep about 30 km south southwest of Amini Divi, 320 km west-southwest of Kannur (Kerala), 1120 km south southeast of Veraval (Gujarat) at about 11.30 am on May 14.It is very likely to intensify into a cyclonic storm during the next 24 hours and is also expected to intensify further during the subsequent 24 hours. Tauktae is likely to move north north-eastwards initially for some more time and then move north-north westwards and reach the Gujarat coast by May 18 morning.ALSO READ | ‘Tauktae’ likely to be an intense cyclone as oceanic conditions favourable, warn scientistsThere is no consensus among models yet on whether the very severe cyclonic storm will cross the Gujarat coast. “As on today we cannot say very clearly if it will cross the Gujarat coast. But the probability of crossing the coast cannot be ruled out. It may skirt the coast early on May 18. Because it’s a large system, it will bring a lot of heavy and extremely heavy rainfall in its path. It is also an intense system,” said Sunitha Devi, in charge, cyclones at IMD.Most cyclones develop in the Arabian Sea during May end and early June. “Vayu was a very severe cyclonic storm which formed over Arabian Sea in early June in 2019. The 1998 Gujarat cyclone also formed in early June. So, while cyclone formation in May in the Arabian Sea is rare, it often happens when monsoon sets in,” added Sunitha.According to “Assessment of Climate Change over the Indian Region,” a report released by the Union ministry of earth sciences last year, observations indicate that frequency of extremely severe cyclonic storms (ESCS) over the Arabian Sea has increased during the post-monsoon seasons of 1998–2018. Most models are projecting a higher sea surface warming in the Arabian Sea than the Bay of Bengal.ALSO READ | Cyclone Tauktae: NDRF teams deployed in five states“The frequency and intensity of cyclones in the Arabian Sea have increased in recent years. This is because of the rapid warming that has made the relatively cooler Arabian Sea (compared to the Bay of Bengal) a warm pool region that can actively support cyclone formation. Climate projections indicate that Arabian Sea will continue warming under increased carbon emissions, resulting in more intense cyclones in the future,” explained Roxy Mathew Koll, a climate scientist at the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology.“Ocean warming has made some new challenges also. Cyclones are now intensifying rapidly since warm ocean waters act as fuel for them. Extremely severe cyclones like Fani and Amphan intensified from a weak to severe status in less than 24 hours due to warm ocean conditions. That gives us less time to be prepared. State-of-the-art cyclone models are unable to pick this rapid intensification because they do not incorporate the ocean dynamics accurately,” he added.Light to moderate rain with extremely heavy rain (over 20 cm) is likely over Lakshadweep on May 13 and 14; over Kerala on May 13; over ghat areas of Tamil Nadu and Karnataka on May 15. It is likely to rain on May 13, 14, 15, 16 and 17 in all these places, the IMD said.In Konkan and Goa, light to moderate rainfall at many places with heavy rainfall at isolated places is very likely on May 15 and heavy to very heavy rainfall at a few places on May 16 and 17. In Gujarat, rainfall activity is very likely to begin from May 17 with a significant increase during the subsequent 2 days and heavy to very heavy rainfall at a few places over Saurashtra and Kutch on May 18 and 19.The major impact from the cyclone is expected over southeast, east-central and northeast Arabian Sea, Lakshadweep – Maldives area and Lakshadweep Islands and along and off Kerala, Karnataka, Goa, Maharashtra, Gujarat coasts. In these areas, very rough to high seas, squally weather and gales around the system centre will affect shipping vessels and fishing operations; inundation of low lying areas of the islands of Lakshadweep during May 14 to 16; very heavy to extremely heavy rainfall causing flash floods and landslides over the coastal districts of Kerala, Karnataka and Goa during May 14 to 16 and Saurashtra, Kutch during May 18; Thunder squalls and lightning could cause adverse impact on human settlements and livestock as well as damage to loose and unsecured structures along the coast line.Fishermen have been advised not to venture into the Arabian Sea during May 14 to 18. Ships too have been advised to avoid the area; ports along the west coast of India may take necessary precautions; naval base operations may maintain necessary precautions; tourism activities may be restricted over the area specified for squally weather and rough sea warning.Conditions are extremely favourable for the rapid intensification of Tauktae. “Ocean heat potential is above normal; sea surface temperatures are 1-2 degree C above normal and the Madden Julian Oscillation (MJO) is also favouring rapid intensification. We should be prepared,” Sunitha Devi had said on Thursday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tauktae-likely-to-be-a-very-severe-cyclonic-storm-imd-101620994259463.html

14-05-2021||India||India’s Covid-19 crisis pushes up the cost of living and dying||Ashok Khondare, a 39-year-old vegetable seller in the western Indian city of Pune, had already borrowed money to pay for his sister's treatment when she died in a private hospital two weeks after contacting Covid-19.While trying to overcome the tragedy, he also had to deal with money problems that increased with his sister's death.The only available hearse driver charged 5,000 Indian rupees ($68) for a 6-km (four-mile) journey to the nearest crematorium – five times the going rate. When Khondare reached there, there was a long queue of dead bodies and waits of more than a day. He agreed to pay another 7,000 rupees to jump the queue."I had been experiencing a terrible situation for a fortnight," he said. "I couldn't sleep or eat properly. I wanted to end this as early as possible and didn't mind paying an irrational amount."India’s second wave of the coronavirus has not only created shortages of oxygen, medicines and hospital beds, but also of wood for funeral pyres, hearses and crematorium slots, forcing people like Khondare to pay exorbitant amounts to perform the last rites of loved ones.India is reporting by far the highest number of new daily cases globally, and over 4,000 deaths per day – figures that are almost certainly under-reported, according to experts.India’s Hindu majority cremates its dead, and the huge numbers of deaths are creating backlogs at cremation grounds and shortages of manpower and raw materials."There is huge demand for firewood used for funeral pyres at crematoria, but supplies are not sufficient," said Rohit Pardeshi, a firewood merchant in Satara, a city in the western Indian state of Maharashtra.Due to a local lockdown designed to curb the pandemic, there is a shortage of people to cut trees and those workers who are available are asking for higher wages."This has created a shortage of firewood and lifted prices," Pardeshi said.Retail prices for firewood are up by at least 30 percent, and have more than doubled in some areas, said a second firewood seller in the same city.In the north Indian state of Uttar Pradesh, 24-year-old Mukul Chaudhary faced similar problems after his mother died in the state capital Lucknow.The ambulance driver who dropped his mother off at the hospital for 5,000 rupees charged even more to take her body to the crematorium."We had to beg him not to overcharge us further," Chaudhary said.Firewood for the cremation cost double the normal rate, while the priest who performed the last rites charged the family 5,000 rupees – two to five times the usual amount.Rohit Jangam, a Hindu priest in Satara, said many priests there were refusing to enter crematoriums out of fear, and those who were willing were charging higher prices."It is too risky to perform the last rites of those died because of coronavirus," he said. "If someone asks, I do, but I charge more since I am taking the risk."He declined to disclose how much more he was charging.Oxygen RacketFor Covid patients who manage to survive, black marketing of medical supplies is rampant, with desperate relatives paying huge sums in what is still a low-income country.In the capital New Delhi, oxygen cylinders have changed hands for as much as 70,000 rupees, according to interviews with relatives – twenty times the usual price and many times the monthly salary of the average Indian.Police there have made more than 100 arrests in cases connected with overcharging, including for drugs, ambulance services and hospital beds.Arveena Sharma, a 28-year-old lawyer from Noida, a satellite city of New Delhi, has helped more than a dozen Covid patients who are friends and relatives get oxygen and medical supplies in the last month. Almost all of them have overpaid significantly."They're like vultures," she said of those selling black market drugs."You are standing in front of me with something which might save me and you’re looking at my pocket."

Why are you blaming your sins on the states?” he added.The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) while campaigning for the Bihar legislative assembly elections had promised to provide vaccines to citizens free of cost. Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman had launched the election manifesto, promising free vaccination amongst other things, in Patna in October of last year. A similar promise was reiterated during poll campaigning in Bengal.Bihar has been in the news lately for a tragic incident where 82 bodies were recovered from the Ganga in the state’s Buxar district. The bodies are believed to have floated downstream from Uttar Pradesh. It spread panic amongst locals who feared Covid-19 might have led to the deaths.Buxar district magistrate Aman Samir told Hindustan Times that continuous patrols were being carried out in Chakki, Simri, Brahmpur and Chausa, and the people have been asked not to bathe in the river since it is not known why the deaths occurred.“People are being advised to avoid taking bath in the river. Since all bodies are floating downstream from the direction of Uttar Pradesh, it is not known what disease claimed them,” he said.Congress also reiterated its previous demand of doing away with the required 28% GST levied on medical supplies for corona and on ambulance rides, and urged the Prime Minister to vaccinate 60% of the population, through a “universal vaccination” programme, to stop a “third wave” of Covid-19 from happening.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/congress-brings-up-pre-poll-promise-of-free-vaccination-in-bihar-urges-centre-not-to-burden-states-to-procure-vaccines-101620987482109.html

Landing Ship Tank (LST) INS Shardul is already in Kuwait since May 12 and will depart for India on May 15 with 120 MTs of liquid oxygen.Just as India came to the aid of these countries during the first wave of the pandemic, the West Asian allies with countries like France adding to the heft, have established an “Oxygen Solidarity Bridge” with India since April 29. “The Indian Navy has established two logistics lines, one with the Gulf countries, other with South East Asian countries led by Singapore. The planned pick of medical oxygen from Gulf countries is highly dynamic and numbers can change. But the fact remains is that India’s Gulf Allies are standing with it in times of medical distress,” said an Admiral.In fact, the Indian Navy and Indian Air Force are working in a “jugalbandi” mode with the former ferrying filled 20 MT liquid medical oxygen containers from Gulf region and the latter facilitating the return of empty containers for refilling and consequent refilling again. “All the strategic lift ships that is LST and Landing Transport Docks have been deployed for lifting critical medical supplies. In fact, all the six ships deployed in the Gulf and Arabian Sea for Exercise Varuna with the French Navy were diverted to Bahrain, Qatar and Kuwait. INS Shardul was dispatched from Kochi to the Gulf region. As of now, 260 MTs of LMO and 2000 filled oxygen cylinders have been delivered to Indian shores from warships deployed in the western Indian Ocean region. For example:• INS Talwar picked up 40 MT of LMO from Manana, Bahrain on May 1.• INS Trikhand and INS Tarkash picked up 80 MT of LMO from Doha, Qatar on May 6 and 8 respectively. These supplies were facilitated by Air Liquide, France using their oxygen plant in Qatar.• INS Kochi and INS Tabar picked up 140 MT of LMO and 1400 oxygen cylinders from Kuwait on May 6.• INS Kolkata picked 200 oxygen cylinders from Doha on May 4 and 40 MT of LMO from Doha on May 5.Majority supplies of LMO secured from either West Asia or South East Asia are to decimate the Covid-19 infection in South, East and Western India as the positivity rate is expected to go up in the coming days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/navy-to-pick-2-000-tonnes-of-oxygen-from-uae-kuwait-and-qatar-to-battle-covid-101620986421330.html

While the snub from an actor who profusely endorsed BJP and PM Modi was a shocker, on Friday, the actor posted a cryptic tweet without clarifying the context. In his message, he said mistakes are made by those who work, while those who do not work spend their lives finding faults with others. His tweet comes across as praise for the BJP — an apparent attempt to offset his earlier comment.गलती उन्हीं से होती है जो काम करते हैं, निकम्मों की ज़िंदगी तो दूसरों की बुराई खोजने में ही ख़त्म हो जाती है..:)'More to life than image building': Anupam Kher says Centre 'slipped' in Covid-19 responseIn the interview, the former chief of the Film and Television Institute of India said that the government had slipped somewhere in its management of the pandemic situation, news agency PTI reported. He also emphasised that for opposition parties too, it was not right to capitalise on the pandemic situation."I think the criticism is valid in lots of cases... Only an inhuman person will not get affected by the bodies floating (in the rivers)," Anupam Kher said referring to the reports of bodies floating in the Ganga."But for another political party to use it for their gain, I think that is also not right. I think we should, as people, get angry. It is important to hold the government responsible for what's happening. Somewhere they have slipped. It is time for them to understand that there is much more to life than just image building maybe," he added."There are problems, pain, anger, frustration, that's obvious... Lot of people say 'You are always so optimistic', but I say there's no other way out for me. Our lives haven't been smooth sailing. It is just that this situation has happened on a world level," the actor said, as quotedby PTI.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/after-image-building-jibe-anupam-kher-says-those-who-work-make-mistakes-101620975129660.html

Resident doctors began reporting fluctuations around 9.30pm that went on till 2.30am in the wards assigned to Covid patients.GMCH, which has now seen 75 deaths owing to dropping levels over the past few days, has reported fluctuations for six nights in a row now.Patients’ relatives began sending out help messages on social media, prompting officials from the health department, including health secretary Ravi Dhawan, to rush to the hospital to ensure the supply is restored, which happened around 2.30am.“Health department officials have reached the site (and have) said they were trying the dura cylinders (new bigger cylinders that are being installed at GMC), which is why the drop happened,” Shruti Chaturvedi, who has filed a petition in the high court over Covid management in the state, said.Goa Forward Pary chief Vijai Sardesai claimed that 13 people succumbed during the ‘dark’ hours due to the low levels of oxygen on Thursday and 75 over four nights, a figure that was not independently confirmed by the health authorities. PTI cited a senior health official as confirming that 13 more patients, admitted in various Covid-19 wards in the GMCH, had died in the early hours.Also Read | How to vaccinate 10 million people a day“In all, 75 people have died during the dark hour, that is between 1am and 6am, in the last four consecutive nights. On the 10th (May) night, it was 26 people, on the 11th night, it was 21 people, on the 12th night it was 15 people and now, last night, it was 13 people. So, 75 people have died on four consecutive nights, because of oxygen shortage, basically mismanagement of oxygen supply at GMCH,” he said.The Goa government has claimed before the Bombay high court at Goa that is currently hearing a bunch of petitions concerning Covid management in the state, that the issues plaguing the GMCH are logistical rather than supply.“There were logistical issues involved in manoeuvring the tractor which carries the trolleys of oxygen, and in connecting the cylinders to the manifold. During this process there was some interruption, which resulted in fall of pressure in the supply lines of oxygen to the patients. It is basically on account of these factors some casualties may have taken place,” the state government told the court on Thursday.They assured the court that the issues would be sorted out.The Goa government has also set up an independent committee headed by IIT-Goa director Dr BK Mishra to inquire into the supply issues at the state’s premier research institute. The committee also consists of Dr VN Jindal, a former dean of the GMCH, and secretary, urban development, Tariq Thomas.The high court had earlier made it clear that the Goa government should not seek to hide behind logistic excuses for proper supply not being maintained.

Bhandari, Emeritus Consultant, Sir Ganga Ram Hospital, who delivered my brother, me, my son and my daughter passed away today.

When she learnt I was interested in infertility treatment, she said that you will have to put your whole and soul into it and you won''t be taking up general gynae cases. I was advised by so many other obstetrics and gynaecologists that how will you mange your bread and butter doing IVF? I give my full credit to Dr Bhandari because she pushed me," she said.She was so proud and there was a oration on her mother''s birth anniversary in Ranchi. She asked me to give a lecture there and it was proud moment "for me"."I went to the Covid ward to see her. Though she never taught me, but she was always proud.

14-05-2021||India||Singapore extends life-line to India in oxygen crisis||India’s mission oxygen with comprehensive partner Singapore began with a three sentence text message between external affairs minister S Jaishankar and foreign minister Vivian Balakrishnan on April 22 with the second wave of pandemic leaving afflicted Indians breathless.The SMS was followed by a telephone call between the two ministers as Jaishankar asked for medical oxygen and his Singaporean counterpart agreed with Prime Ministers of both countries kept in the loop. The Indian foreign minister asked his senior colleague defence minister Rajnath Singh to call in the Indian Air Force’s heavy transporters to pick the first four cryogenic tanks from Singapore which were needed to pick up liquid medical oxygen from east India to Covid-19 hit north and western parts of the country.Also watch | IAF aircraft with oxygen containers from Singapore lands in WB's Panagarh airbase﻿Defence minister Rajnath Singh called up Indian Air Force (IAF) chief Rakesh Kumar Singh Bhadauria, who was on a five-day official trip to France at that time, the same day in Paris. Leaving aside everything, Air Chief Bhadauria worked through the night to plan external and internal movement of transport planes. The entire transport fleet of IAF was placed on standby 24X7 with multiple sets of pilots as 'Mission Oxygen' began in earnest with a C-17 picking up four cryogenic containers from Changi in Singapore and reaching the transport hub of Panagarh in West Bengal.The cryogenic tanks picked up oxygen from several steel plants on the road and hitched on Railway flat wagons to reach their destinations. While industrial units largely in eastern India produce oxygen in large quantities, there was a global shortage of specialised cryogenic tanks needed to transport liquid oxygen. It was here that India’s trusted and tried ally Singapore came to aid at a critical time by acting as a logistics hub for crucial medical items that India wanted to source from abroad. Indian High Commissioner to Singapore P Kumaran played his part by taking an early initiative to identify good sources from key medical items in the city nation.On April 29, defence minister Rajnath Singh spoke to Singapore counterpart Ng Eng Hen about reinforcing capacities to fight the second wave of virus that had hit India. Two days later, Jaishankar again spoke to his Singaporean counterpart with the latter extremely forthcoming to help out India. Balakrishnan recalled how India had stood by Singapore in the first wave in 2021 and promised all support by sensitizing all other ministries in the city nation about national health emergency in India. In 2021, India had supplied critical items like hydroxy-chloroquinine, surgical masks, hand sanitizers and polypropylene material to Singapore.After a series of flights by IAF’s C-17, IL-76, C-130 aircraft, India procured 46 cryogenic or ISO containers from Singapore which were landed at Panagarh, Chennai and Hindon, Ghaziabad to enhance the liquid oxygen supplies to various destinations in India. In addition to the ISO tanks, India has procured thousands of oxygen cylinders, oxygen concentrators, BiPAP machines / ventilators and other items from Singapore. These have been ferried on IAF aircraft and Indian Navy ships.In a special gesture, Singapore sent two of its own Air Force aircraft on April 28 carrying oxygen cylinders and other material. Separately, Singapore’s Temasek Foundation, in partnership with a number of Singaporean companies, donated over 8000 oxygen concentrators, 51000 oxymeters, over 900 BiPAP machines and 27 ventilators.Joining hands with IAF, the Indian Navy played a key role in in evacuating medical supplies from Singapore by sending in amphibious warfare ship INS Airawat to Singapore. The Ship was in Singapore from May 2 to May 4 and loaded nearly 5000 oxygen cylinders of various capacities, eight ISO/cryogenic tanks, oxygen concentrators and even rapid antigen kits for supplies to South India as the virus was beginning to hit south of Vindhyachal.On May 15, landing warship INS Jalashwa is reaching Singapore bay for loading 15 filled cryogenic containers and nearly 5,000 oxygen cylinders for India to meet the expected rise in demand in east and southern India.The most encouraging part is that High Commissioner Kumaran has also been able to activate the large Indian community in Singapore, particularly the IIT, IIM alumni and TiE Singapore, as well as organizations like the Singapore Indian Chamber of Commerce and Industry and the Little India Shop Owners Association to help raise funds and assist in procuring medical support and facilitating logistics.For a country with a population of a Delhi suburb, Singapore, driven by active bilateral engagement, has turned out to be a critical lifeline to India in times of medical crisis.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/singapore-extends-life-line-to-india-in-oxygen-crisis-101620960897988.html

The remark came as the minister reviewed the Covid-19 situation with six states, including Maharashtra, Kerala, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Rajasthan and Delhi. All these states have been badly hit by the second wave of the pandemic.During the meeting, a common demand from all the states was to increase the quota of vaccines for the states. As vaccination for people in the age group of 18 to 44 years began from May 1, states have been reporting vaccine shortage as the present supply is not adequate for both the age group of above 45 years and below 45 years. Since the centre has asked states and UTs to focus on the population of 45+ as they are more vulnerable and many of them have already received one dose, states including Delhi, Maharashtra, Karnataka, Rajasthan have halted the vaccination of people below 45 years for the time being.WHO-approved Covid-19 vaccines can come to India, more than 2 billion doses to become available soon: GovtThe minister said that the production capacity of vaccines is being ramped up and the states have the non-government channel to procure vaccines for their population. While by non-government channel, he referred to the Centre's new strategy of allowing states to get vaccines directly for vaccine makers, health ministers present at the meeting requested the minister for a common policy for procurement of vaccines from foreign manufacturers.Contrary to the health minister's statement, Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Thursday said each state approaching foreign vaccine makers dents India's image in the world as states have been pitted against each other in this vaccine race where richer states and civic bodies will be ahead of others in getting foreign vaccines.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/harsh-vardhan-says-states-demanding-more-covid-vaccines-will-arouse-narrow-political-passion-101620957039813.html

Authorities in Kerala have sounded red alert in three districts on May 14 and five districts on May 15.“We cannot rule out intensification similar to Super Cyclone Amphan. At present it is difficult to say which category of intensification the cyclone will reach. But conditions are extremely favourable for its rapid intensification. Ocean heat potential is above normal; sea surface temperatures are 1-2 degree C above normal and Madden Julian Oscillation (MJO) is also favouring rapid intensification. We should be prepared,” said Sunitha Devi, in-charge of cyclones at India Meteorological Department.Authorities have sounded red alert in three districts of Kerala on May 14 and five districts on May 15, indicating the possibility of extremely heavy rains under the influence of a low pressure area over the Arabian Sea.In a tweet, Kerala chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan asked authorities and people to follow the guidelines issued by the state disaster management authority.“Red Alert! 14 May - Thiruvananthapuram, Kollam, Pathanamthitta, 15 May - Malappuram, Kozhikode, Wayanad, Kannur, Kasargod.

Kaun lagayega vaccination [Who will get vaccinated], when there is no vaccine? What is the point of the message,” observed a bench of justices Vipin Sanghi and Rekha Palli.“You should give it [the vaccine] to everyone. Even if you are going to take money, give it. That is what even children are saying,” the bench said and added that the government needs to be “innovative” in such things.The court said that the government should prepare more such messages instead of preparing just one and running it always.The bench said the government, whether at the state or the Centre, have to react to the situation on the ground.It also suggested using TV anchors or producers to create programmes, on making people aware about use of oxygen concentrators and cylinders or on vaccination. It also said celebrities may be asked to chip in, and that moves like these “need to be made soon”.The court said a lot of “publicity and propaganda” was put in place last year, on the importance of hand-washing and mask-wearing. It said there should be similar initiatives on the use of oxygen, concentrators, medication, and others.“We are losing time. There should be a sense of urgency,” the bench said, and directed the Centre and Delhi government to file their reports by May 18 on steps they are going to take to disseminate information on Covid-19 management through the print and TV media, as well as dialer tunes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhi-hc-slams-irritating-vaccine-dialer-tune-101620948523722.html
14-05-2021||India||High court rejects plea alleging food minister hussain was hoarding oxygen stock||The Delhi high court on Thursday disposed of a plea which claimed that state food and civil supplies minister Imran Hussain was hoarding oxygen, after the Delhi government submitted before the court that he was not provided the life saving gas by the state or from the quota allocated for Covid-19 patients.Amicus curiae and senior advocate Rajshekhar Rao told the court that the explanation tendered by Hussain that he got cylinders refilled from a dealer in Faridabad “appears to be credible”.In view of the submissions, a bench of justices Vipin Sanghi and Rekha Palli disposed of the plea. The petitioner, Vedansh Sharma, had alleged that Hussain was hoarding oxygen cylinders at a time when the city was in the midst of a crisis due to the short supply of oxygen.“We are not inclined to proceed any further in the matter,” the bench said.Hussain, MLA from Ballimaran, tweeted, “I was serving the people of my constituency by distributing free oxygen. Some people did not like it and levelled baseless allegations against me. Today, the honourable court has acquitted me. I will continue to serve people like this.”The submissions were made in response to the high court’s query to the Delhi government on May 10 as to whether the MLA was supplied oxygen by the state or through the designated refillers from the allocated quota.Senior advocate Rahul Mehra, appearing for the Delhi government, said due to the instant plea the reputation of Hussain, who is Delhi’s food and civil supplies minister, was adversely affected and all the good work he did was brought to nought.Mehra said it also deters the individual from doing any such work for the benefit of the people in the future and therefore, people filing such pleas without allegedly doing proper research has to be discouraged.He also questioned why such pleas were being filed only against one political party.The court, however, did not agree with Mehra’s contention as it said it was not going to stop people from coming to court.The court said it did not ask the MLA to stop distribution of oxygen, if he was not taking it from the quota allotted to Delhi.“He stopped it on his own,” the bench said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/high-court-rejects-plea-alleging-food-minister-hussain-was-hoarding-oxygen-stock-101620948357178.html
14-05-2021||India||Centre, NCR states must ensure food, transport for migrants: SC||Urging administrations to acknowledge the “harsh realities” facing migrant workers affected by the second wave of Covid-19, the Supreme Court on Thursday directed the Centre and the governments of Delhi, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh to provide dry ration and meals to labourers in the National Capital Region (NCR), apart from ensuring proper transportation back home.A bench of justices Ashok Bhushan and MR Shah issued the interim directives while seeking detailed replies from the state governments on steps being taken to ameliorate the misery of the stranded migrant workers.Starting immediately, the bench ordered that dry ration should be given to migrant workers in the NCR under Atmanirbhar Bharat scheme, or any other scheme be provided by the Centre or states utilising the public distribution system.“While providing dry ration, the authorities of the states shall not insist on an identity card for those migrant labourers who do not possess it for the time being. On self-declaration made by the stranded migrant labourers, dry ration be given to them,” it said.In order to make certain that the migrant workers and their families get at least two meals a day, the court directed the governments of Delhi, UP and Haryana to open community kitchens and advertise this.The bench asked the states to ensure that adequate transport is provided to stranded migrant labourers who wanted to return to their home. “The district administration, in coordination with police, may identify such stranded migrant labourers and facilitate their transport either by road transport or train. The Union of India may also issue necessary instructions to the Ministry of Railways...” it further directed.The migrant worker crisis came under sharp focus shortly after the nationwide lockdown was imposed on March 25 last year. Hundreds of thousands of workers spilled out on highways and began walking back home. In Parliament last year, the government said estimates put this number at around 11 million while activists say the number is much higher.The court order came on a plea moved jointly by activists Harsh Mander, Anjali Bhardwaj and Jagdeep Chhokar, who sought the court’s intervention to ensure that migrant workers were not deprived of food security and were also able to travel back to their homes at nominal cost.Solicitor general (SG) Tushar Mehta, representing the Centre, expressed his reservations to the idea of facilitating their travel, apprehending that this could incentivise their migration even though most of the industrial activities were open across the states. “Unlike the previous lockdown when everything was closed, efforts of all state governments this time is to ensure it is not a lockdown... By and large industrial activities where migrants are working have not stopped completely. All state governments are also responsible governments and are elected ones,” said Mehta.The bench, however, said that migrant workers may have their own apprehensions. “The mindset of the people is different. How will they survive if they don’t have money or food? Some sustenance must be provided by the states? Ration and community kitchen should be there. You have to consider the harsh realities,” it told the SG.Mehta, on his part, said that the court should wait for replies from the states to scrutinise the steps taken by them before passing any order. But the bench said that it would issue immediate directions for migrant workers in Delhi-NCR, while other states such as Maharashtra, Gujarat and Bihar can file their replies within 10 days.Advocate Prashant Bhushan, appearing for the activists, said he was amazed at the Centre’s law officer’s resistance to the interim directions in the interest of the migrant workers. “Last time they said there is nobody on the road. This time they are opposing orders to ensure they get food and transportation,” contended Bhushan. His reference is to court proceedings last year during which Mehta claimed that no migrants were on the roads, walking back home or trying to find any other mode of transport during the 68-day hard lockdown.The bench, while fixing May 24 as the next date to hear the suo motu case on the problems of migrant workers, also asked Delhi, Haryana, UP, Gujarat, Maharashtra, Bihar and Odisha to file their affidavits on the issues of food security and health insurance for migrant workers as well as their employment opportunities in the native states.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-ncr-states-must-ensure-food-transport-for-migrants-sc-101620945849883.html
14-05-2021||India||Centre asks SC to review order on state’s role in defining OBCs||The Union government on Thursday moved the Supreme Court for a reconsideration of its May 5 judgment, which ruled that after a constitutional amendment in 2018, state governments have no power to draw up their own lists of backward classes.By a 3-2 majority, the verdict -- which also unanimously struck down a state law granting reservation to the Maratha community in government jobs and education in Maharashtra -- had held that state governments must rely on the Centre to include or exclude any community for granting reservation to socially and educationally backward classes (SEBCs).In its review petition, the Centre has contended that the judgment required a relook because there were errors apparent on the face of the record.Since a review petition is usually decided by the judges in their chambers under the Supreme Court rules, the central government has asked for an open court hearing so as to be able to make oral submissions on the grounds of review.A statement by the Union ministry of social justice and empowerment said: “The Constitution Bench of the Hon’ble Supreme Court has pronounced judgement dated May 5, 2021, involving interpretation of the provisions of the Constitution 102nd Amendment Act, 2018. As provided in the Supreme Court Rules, 2013, a review petition has been filed by the Union of India on May 13, 2021.”In its May 5 judgment, the five-judge bench had interpreted the 102nd constitutional amendment, whereby provisions were inserted to give constitutional status to the National Commission for Backward Classes (Article 338B) and for empowering the President to notify the list of socially and educationally backward classes of state or Union territory (Article 342A).While justices Ashok Bhushan and SA Nazeer maintained that the amendment act was confined to the list to be issued for central government jobs, justices L Nageswara Rao, Hemant Gupta and S Ravindra Bhat held that the scheme of the amendments has taken away the power of the state to identify backward classes.The majority dismissed the Centre’s understanding of the amendments even as attorney general (A-G) KK Venugopal told the court that the 102nd amendment did not deprive state legislatures to enact law determining the SEBCs and conferring benefits on them.According to the top law officer, Articles 15(4) and 16(4) of the Constitution were untouched by the insertion of Article 342 and that the states will continue to exercise their power to identify SEBCs and give reservation even after the amendments.Several states, including Maharashtra, Punjab, Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu and Karnataka, also asserted their right under Articles 15(4) and 16(4) to make special provisions for SEBCs and give them benefits of quota.Both the Centre and states urged the court to lend credence to the parliamentary select committee report of 2017 and a statement of Union minister Thawarchand Gehlot on the floor of Parliament in August 2017 that the amendments did not affect the rights of the state governments to notify backward classes for reservation.But the majority judgment rejected this plea. “I am convinced that there is no reason to depart from the text which is in clear terms and rely upon the legislative history to construe Article 342 A contrary to the language...”Stating that the states could only make suggestions with the President having the exclusive authority to notify the list of SEBCs, justice Bhat added that once the list was notified, states could exercise their power under Article 15(4) and 16(4) to decide on extent of reservations, the kind of benefits, the quantum of scholarships, etc.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-asks-sc-to-review-order-on-state-s-role-in-defining-obcs-101620939385872.html
14-05-2021||India||15 more die at Goa hospital after drop in oxygen levels||Fifteen patients at state-run Goa Medical College and Hospital died allegedly of oxygen shortage early on Thursday despite high court directives to shore up supplies, barely two days after 26 people succumbed to low oxygen flow at the state’s premier hospital.Oxygen levels dropped between 2am and 6am on Thursday morning and 15 people lost their lives, hospital authorities told the Bombay high court at Goa, a day after the judges asked the government to do whatever it takes to ensure no deaths occur due to oxygen shortages for “at least one night”.“Around 15 people lost their lives last night between 2am and 6am at GMC the hours during which the oxygen levels have been dropping for every night for the last five days or so,” the hospital told the court via Advocate General Devidas Pangam.On Tuesday, 26 patients being treated for Covid 19 died between 2am and 6am with Goa health minister Vishwajit Rane saying the hospital got only a third of the 1,200 oxygen cylinders required and pushing for a probe by the high court.Oxygen shortages were reported in multiple wards of the GMC that are set aside for treating Covid patients on Wednesday night with the situation being a repeat of the previous four days when oxygen also ran out.“Despite raising SOSes, police and health dept officials reaching GMC in the wee hours of the night after the alarm of oxygen fluctuations in the central pipeline was raised, 15 people died last night. Again,” tweeted Shruti Chaturvedi, one of the petitioners.Medical college dean Dr Shivanand Bandekar said not all the deaths could be attributed to dropping oxygen pressure. The dean had earlier admitted to shortages and said that shortages could also claim patient’s lives in the long term.“Reduced oxygen saturation lasting for a significant duration causes tissue hypoxia and irreversible tissue damage. This is worse in the presence of comorbidities and old age. The death following such hypoxemia and organ hypoxia may be immediate, or most of the time after some period of time,” he said.Critical patients will be shifted out of wards witnessing low oxygen pressure and moved to a newly commissioned block where the supply is steady, he added.The health department told the court that oxygen levels dropped because of “logistical issues involved in maneuvering the tractor that carries the trolleys of oxygen and in connecting the cylinders to the manifold”.“During this process there was some interruption, which resulted in fall of pressure in the supply lines of oxygen to the patients. Basically on account of these factors some casualties may have taken place,” the advocate general told the court.The oxygen shortage at the premier hospital signals a fresh crisis for the coastal state where every second person tested for Covid is found positive this week. The state posted 2,491 fresh cases and 63 deaths on Thursday.GMC, which that is handling more patients than its bed capacity, delivers oxygen in two ways -- 700 regular beds are supplied through a central pipeline, and 250 additional beds set up during the pandemic are tended to by loose cylinders that need to be replaced and refilled. Bandekar told the court on Wednesday the hospital was facing a shortage of 6.5 metric tonne (MT) of oxygen per day, and that supply was not being augmented.On Wednesday, the high court warned the hospital authorities and state government, saying the right to life was a fundamental right guaranteed by Article 21 of the Constitution, which placed a duty on the State to ensure that life was not extinguished on account of its inability to supply oxygen. . “This duty can neither be avoided by pleading helplessness nor by putting forth logistical difficulties in sourcing and supplying oxygen,” the court said.For five straight days, oxygen pressure has dropped at the hospital during the same early morning hour, which the court now begun to refer to as ‘dark hours.’On Thursday, relatives of patients raised an alarm as soon as oxygen levels started falling, and the police and health department staff were called in to try and rectify the issue. But it was several hours before the supply was stablised, leaving those admitted facing potential organ damage that could have lasting effects even if they recover.Relatives complained that the pressure was running low for several days and patients were left to fend for themselves. “My sister Laura Fernandes is admitted in GMC hospital, Goa with severe pneumonia. She has been admitted on May 7, She is fighting for her life, while her two young kids are waiting for their mother to come home. The first few nights at the hospital were frightening as the oxygen ran low at night and patients were dying during this time,” Christine Fernandes said.“We got a cylinder from then on May 11, but no doctors were willing to help fix it. My brother in law went home on May 12, got his tools and fixed the cylinder by himself,” she added.A police complaint was filed against Rane, accusing him of culpable homicide not amounting to murder for failing to ensure adequate supply of oxygen to the state’s premier institute. “Goa’s oxygen shortage is man-made and the brain child of Vishwajit Rane and the supplier,” the complaint filed by Bento Lorena, also a member of the Bharatiya Janata Party, said. Rane also belongs to BJP, which rules the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/15-more-die-at-goa-hospital-after-drop-in-oxygen-levels-101620934072024.html
14-05-2021||India||CSI annual retreat: Two more Kerala priests die of Covid||Thiruvananthapuram: Two more Christian priests, who had tested positive for Covid-19 after attending the Church of South India (CSI) annual retreat in Munnar (Idukki district) from April 13-17, died on Wednesday while condition of five others were critical, church insiders told HT on Thursday. Father C Binokumar (39) and Father Y Devaprasad (59) died in CSI Medical College Hospital in Karakonam and five others are on ventilator support, a church insider said. With the two deaths, the toll from those attending the annual retreat jumped to four. Police registered a case against 400-odd priests, including CSI South Kerala Diocese Bishop Father Dharmaraj Rasalam, on May 5 for allegedly flouting Covid-19 protocols to organise a religious retreat in hill station Munnar.The case was registered after the Devikulam Sub-Collector submitted a report that permission was not sought for the large gathering and norms were flouted, which triggered a super-spread. The incident surfaced after two priests died of Covid-19 in May first week and more than 100 participants reportedly tested positive. Some of the reformist groups in the church alleged that a section of priests was forced to attend the retreat after church authorities threatened them. There were many attempts to hush up the case and most of the infected were shifted to a medical college run by the church along the Kerala-Tamil Nadu border discreetly, they alleged. The case was registered under Section 269 of the Indian Penal Code and sections of the Kerala Epidemic Diseases Control Act after a senior revenue official inquired the incident and found that more than 450 people, majority of them priests, attended the meet while flouting pandemic norms. Chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan had termed the incident “unfortunate.” The incident came to light at a time when the state is battling the surging second wave of the pandemic. Kerala reported 39,955 cases on Thursday, taking the active caseload to 438, 913. A total of 97 people succumbed to the infection on Thursday, taking the toll in the state to 6,150, according to health department data. Church insiders said all restrictions were flouted and when some young priests questioned the timing of the retreat, they were threatened with disciplinary action by authorities. However, the church maintained that all precautions were taken and only 28 priests and not 100 had tested positive. The CSI retreat is the latest religious event to hit the headlines for recklessness during the pandemic. Last year, at the beginning of the first wave, a congregation of the Tablighi Jamaat in New Delhi caused a spike in cases. Similarly, last month’s congregation at the Kumbh Mela also contributed to spike in cases in many north Indian states.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/csi-annual-retreat-two-more-kerala-priests-die-of-covid-101620934012477.html

According to Peddapuram sub-inspector of police A Balaji, the incident happened in front of Ruchi Soya Factory on the outskirts of Peddapuram town on Kakinada-Samalkot state highway. He said the family of nine were going in a sports utility vehicle from Peddavalasa village of Tallarevu block to Rajahmundry to attend a house warming ceremony. “As the car was crossing the industrial area on the outskirts of Peddapuram town, a speeding container truck coming from the opposite direction rammed into the SUV. Four persons including a five-month-old baby, a woman and two men died on the spot,” Balaji said. The deceased have been identified as, Vanamadi Eshwar Rao (36), Vanamadi Annapurna (33), Aradadi Swamy (55) and a four-month-old baby (name not known). Five others, including the person driving the car, were injured in the mishap.Though a partial lockdown is in place in Andhra Pradesh till May 18, however, there is no restrictions on travel between 6am till 12 noon. According to the SI, the accident took place at around 4.30 am, but the family had not taken any curfew pass. “They might have thought they could reach the destination before they were noticed by the police,” he said. The locals, who immediately informed the police, rescued the injured who were trapped inside the vehicle. “Three of them were taken to Peddapuram area hospital and two others were taken to Kakinada government hospital,” the SI said.

14-05-2021||India||MLC elections in Andhra pradesh and Telangana postponed due to pandemic||Hyderabad The Election Commission of India on Thursday announced indefinite postponement of biennial elections to the state legislative councils of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana, scheduled to be held this month, due to the ongoing second wave of Covid-19 pandemic. According to an official release from the ECI, the term of three members of Andhra Pradesh state legislative council and that of six members of Telangana state legislative council would expire on May 31 and June 3 respectively. The elections to these MLC seats will be held under the MLA’s quota. As such, they will be elected by the members of respective state legislative assemblies. As per the provisions of Section 16 of the Representation of the People Act, 1951, the elections to these MLC seats have to be held before the expiry of the term of sitting members. The EC said it had reviewed the matter and decided that due to outbreak of the second wave of Covid-19, it would not be appropriate to hold biennial election to the Legislative Councils of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana respectively till the pandemic situation significantly improves. “The Commission will take a decision in the matter at appropriate time after taking inputs from the states concerned and assessing the pandemic situation from mandated authorities like National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) and State Disaster Management Authority (SDMA),” the EC official note said. In Andhra Pradesh, three MLCs who would be completing their term on May 31 are legislative council chairman Mohd Ahmed Sharif (Telugu Desam Party), Devasani Chinan Govind Reddy (YSR Congress) and Somu Veerraju (Bharatiya Janata Party). In Telangana, the outgoing members of the legislative council are legislative council chairman Gutha Sukhender Reddy, deputy chairman Neti Vidyasagar, Kadiyam Srihari, Akula Lalitha and Bodakunti Venkateshwarlu (all Telangana Rashtra Samithi). Since both the YSR Congress and the Telangana Rashtra Samithi have more than the required number of MLAs in the Andhra and Telangana assemblies respectively, the new members can get elected without any contest.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mlc-elections-in-andhra-pradesh-and-telangana-postponed-due-to-pandemic-101620933771951.html
14-05-2021||India||Centre’s vaccine allocation to TN should not be diverted: HC||Chennai The Madras high court on Thursday said that the Centre’s allocation to Tamil Nadu on vaccines should not be diverted because of the state’s decision a day back to call for a global tender. During the hearing on the suo motu case registered to monitor preparedness of Covid-19 second wave in Tamil Nadu and Puducherry, a division bench comprising Chief Justice Sanjib Banerjee and Justice Senthilkumar Ramamoorthy observed that a global tender may be a long drawn process. “As and when the global tender matures and supplies are received, the state’s allocation by the Centre may be appropriately reworked,” the court said. The court reiterated its suggestions from a day back that vaccine centres be relocated from hospitals to minimise the spread of the virus. The court recorded that the Centre has increased oxygen supply to the state to 510 MT per day but the supply of 40 MT from Palakkad in Kerala to southern and western districts in Tamil Nadu may have been halted from Thursday. Additional Solicitor General (ASG) R Sankaranarayanan informed the court that additional oxygen supply would come from Orissa by Thursday night to make up for the loss. “Overall there doesn’t appear to be a great dearth of oxygen in the state at the moment,” the court said. “By and large things appear to be under control and nothing untoward has thankfully been reported on account of lack of oxygen or the like.”But during the hearing, an advocate Naveen Kumar Murthi alleged that at least nine patients have died waiting in ambulances at Rajiv Gandhi Government General Hospital (RGGGH) in Chennai. Advocate General R Shunmughasundaram appearing for the state explained that the government hospital doesn’t deny admissions and everyone is being monitored and that the state would address the situation. Measures are being adopted to increase the beds across the state, he added. The bench suggested that stretchers can be placed in corridors as a temporary measure if beds are unavailable. It pointed out that if ambulances are used to treat patients, other patients may not be able to avail ambulance facilities. “This is a war-like situation,” the court said.On the issue of vaccines to be made available for people with disabilities, the court hoped to get a better picture of the prospects of getting more vaccines before it can issue directions for prioritisation. The court also asked for immediate steps to be taken to accelerate vaccination by increasing awareness, particularly in non urban areas to prevent a large number of cases in the future. As there is a scramble for the drug Remdesivir in Chennai where people are waiting in serpentine queues and some are waiting overnight, the AG submitted that counters from Kilpauk Medical College will be shifted to the city’s Nehru indoor stadium. At least 20,000 vials will be sold in a day, the AG added. The next hearing has been adjourned to Monday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centres-vaccine-allocation-to-tn-should-not-be-diverted-hc-101620933711980.html
14-05-2021||India||Vijayan writes to PM seeking O2 urgently||Thiruvananthapuram: With the Covid-19 situation deteriorating in the state, chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan on Thursday wrote another letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi seeking additional 300 metric tonne of medical oxygen on an urgent basis. This is the third letter Vijayan has written to the PM in 10 days. “We have a capacity to generate 212 MT daily but experts said oxygen demand will rise to 426 MT in view of rising cases. Besides this, a low pressure is also forming fast in Arabian Sea and it is likely to take cyclonic proportions. So we have to get prepared,” he said. Red alert was sounded in five districts in view of a cyclonic threat.The state on Thursday reported another high recording 39,955 cases with a test positivity rate (TPR) of 28.61%. Two districts Ernakulam (32%) and Malappuram (38%) have reported TPR above 30% while in some of the local bodies in these districts, TPR is above 50%, health ministry data shows.As active caseload mounted, the government has given directions to all district administrations to build makeshift hospital to meet the influx of patients. They have been asked to take the help of state and central public sector units in their districts. Many schools, colleges, hostels and stadiums have been turned into temporary hospital to meet the surge.In one of the worst –affected districts in Ernakulam, the country’s largest temporary Covid-19 hospital is coming up in Ambalavayal in Kochi having 1,500 beds and direct oxygen supply from nearby Bharat Petroleum Corporation of Limited (BPCL) plant. Ernakulam district collector S Suhas said the first phase of the hospital with 500 beds has been opened to patients and it will be fully functional by next week.“We deliberately chose the place for the makeshift hospital because of the proximity with the BPCL plant. We will have direct oxygen supply from the plant and it will save enough time in transportation and logistics,” said the collector. In several parts of the country delay in supply of oxygen cylinders and technical glitches resulted in many deaths. “We are fighting hard to contain the surge. But this new hospital, largest with 1,500 oxygen beds, will be a game changer. We can contain fatality rate considerably in the district,” he said. The BPCL has the capacity to deliver 2 MT medical oxygen daily and it can be raised after gauging the need. The district administration has also appointed 400 nurses and other medical workers for the new hospital.“The high TPR is a concern but we are doing our best to bring down numbers. Cases are increasing due to presence of strong mutants and we are trying to improve the recovery rate to control the influx,” a senior health official said, adding that only serious patients who need oxygen will be admitted in the new hospital in Ambalavayal. A commercial hub Kochi has a sizeable population of workers from other states, especially from the north east.A close look at the health ministry data shows in last two weeks there has been a steady rise in cases and fatality rate. On Thursday, 1,39, 656 people were tested out of which 39,955 tested Covid positive. The state also reported 97 deaths taking total fatality to 6,150. The active caseload also jumped to 4,38,913. Among 14 districts, TPR in 10 districts is above 20%. The state is currently undergoing a lockdown till May 16 and it is likely to be extended.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/vijayan-writes-to-pm-seeking-o2-urgently-101620933651909.html
14-05-2021||India||Dr Shetty to head K’taka task force to tackle Covid-19||Bengaluru: The Karnataka government on Thursday announced the name of cardiac surgeon Dr Devi Shetty as the head of the task force set up to help prepare the state for the potential third wave of Covid-19. The announcement was made by chief minister BS Yediyurappa, who added that Gagan Deep Kang, Professor of Microbiology in Christian Medical College will be appointed as an adviser on the state’s vaccination strategy. Talking about the vaccine strategy the CM’s office on Thursday said that Karnataka is preparing to procure 50 million doses for the age group of 18-44 years. “The state has placed a purchase order for 30 million doses of vaccines, 20 million doses of Covishield and 10 million doses of Covaxin. We are floating global tenders for an additional 20 million,” read a statement from the CM’s office. It further added that 1.48 million beneficiaries have completed 6 weeks after taking the Covishield vaccine and are eligible for the second dose and 5,10,000 beneficiaries have completed 4 weeks after taking the first dose of Covaxin and are eligible for 2nd dose. Thus, a total of 1.97 million persons are eligible for 2nd dose as of today. “It is necessary to complete the second dose as early as possible to give full protection to the people who have taken 1st dose. Hence, we have decided to utilize the entire stock available with us for the 2nd dose of the eligible beneficiaries,” read the statement. In this context, the government also added that the CoWin application also was found to have certain limitations on where one chooses to be vaccinated leading to chaos across centres. “To better manage the vaccination process, we are coming up with a technology solution soon; post which we will re-launch the vaccination programme for the 18-44 age group,” said the CM’s office. The statement added that the government is tackling the increased Oxygen requirement through a 3-pronged strategy of increasing Supply of Liquid Medical Oxygen (LMO), massive scaling of localized generation capacity through oxygen generators, large scale procurement of concentrators and cylinders. “Government of India has increased the allocation of oxygen from 965 MT to 1,015 MT. We are lifting the entire allocation given to us from within the state and making efforts to bring as much as possible from the other States. In addition, we have received 40 MT of oxygen from Bahrain and another 100 MT from Kuwait. We have brought 120 MT of oxygen from Jamshedpur by train,” the statement added. Meanwhile, the SSLC examinations slated to start from June 21 stands postponed announced primary and secondary education minister S Suresh Kumar. The increasing Covid cases in the state coupled with the concerns of parent-students and many school associations has resulted in this decision. A suitable call will be taken after the second wave of Covid -19 dies down, the minister said in a statement. He also emphasised that the revised dates will be announced much ahead of schedule. The minister appealed that the students must not get disheartened and continue with their studious preparations.State’s death toll due to Covid-19 touched 20,712 with 344 new fatalities on Thursday, while 35,297 fresh cases took the infection count to 20,88,488, the health department said. The state has 5,93,078 active cases. Bengaluru Urban district reported 15,191 new cases and 161 fatalities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/dr-shetty-to-head-k-taka-task-force-to-tackle-covid19-101620933472471.html
14-05-2021||India||Karnataka HC pulls up govt over shortage of Covid jabs||Bengaluru: The Karnataka high court on Thursday raised concerns over the shortage of Covid-19 vaccines in the state and delay in administering the second dose of vaccine. The bench comprising Chief Justice Abhay Oka and Justice Aravind Kumar said that the state has only 1.1 million vaccines, while there was a need to provide the second dose to 3.1 million people. “How are you going to bridge the gap?” the bench asked Additional Solicitor General of India (ASG) Aishwarya Bhati. It went on to question the government on the consequences of missing the second dose. If someone takes a second dose of Covaxin after 4 weeks and Covishield, after 8 weeks, what will happen? Is it not the right of a person under Article 21 to get the second dose in a timely manner? the bench asked. In response, ASG said the stipulated period is the ideal period. Over the ideal period, the vaccine can be taken “A core group is studying and in two days they will give us a report,” Bhati said. In response, the bench said: “These are all excuses giving to us. You tell us how you will bridge the gap. Is it not necessary that maximum people should get immunity?” The ASG told the bench that states have been advised to prioritise vaccination for those above 45 years of age receiving the second dose and that 70% of vaccines allotted by the Union government must be dedicated for this purpose. “You must come clean before the members of the public... Come with the truth... Some people are going to vaccination centres and coming back. You need to set a priority on who will get vaccines now,” the bench said. “Your ministers and others should tell the truth to people... Tell the truth to the public, don’t make any inconsistent statements to the public. Put up the data of available vaccines on some website,” it further added. The Karnataka government on Wednesday had temporarily suspended the vaccination drive for the 18-44 age group. In another order, the bench asked all testing laboratories in the state to issue Covid test results within 24 hours of collecting swab samples. The direction was issued after a court staff member died on Wednesday. The staffer was unaware he had Covid; the results of his tests conducted on May 10 didn’t arrive until his death. “We direct the state to initiate action against those concerned and submit a report,” said the Bench.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/karnataka-hc-pulls-up-govt-over-shortage-of-covid-jabs-101620933412024.html
14-05-2021||India||B’luru crematoriums feel the heat as Covid deaths rise||Bengaluru: As Bengaluru continues to report more than 250 deaths every day for the past week, crematoriums in the city are feeling the heat. At one such crematorium in Chamarapet, putting “houseful” board outside its gates last week was a sign of the troubles ahead. Bengaluru has seven designated electric crematoriums for Covid-19 fatalities, six electric crematoriums for both Covid and non-Covid deaths, and three open-air crematoriums. However, as of Thursday, three electric crematoriums were non-functional after their furnaces broke down. The gravity of the situation could be gauged from the fact that the Bengaluru city administration has now converted an unused quarry in Geddanahalli into an open crematorium. A senior Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) official, who did not wish to be named, said the sustained high number of cases is putting severe pressure on the crematoriums. “Now, we are reporting around 250 Covid deaths per day (over the last week) and one day we reported even more than 300 deaths. Before this, when the city was reporting around 100 deaths per day, the pressure on the furnaces was high. Now they have started to break down due to high number of deaths. If there is no drastic reduction in numbers, it would lead to more breakdowns,” said the official. He added that Sumanahalli electric crematorium, which is one of the largest facilities in the city for the last rites of Covid-19 victims, was shut for maintenance after the nonstop burning of bodies resulted in equipment damage. After repairs, the crematorium was reopened on Tuesday. By then, three more crematoriums -- JJR Nagar, Banashankari and Wilson Garden – went for repair. As per BBMP estimates, they would be reopened only by May 20. “The average number of cremations that can be done at the crematoriums was around 10. In the last week of April, we were cremating 20-25 bodies per day. Now, it has gone up to 30 or more per day. When any machine is pushed beyond its limits, it will break down,” said Vinod P, a supervisor at Summanhalli crematorium. Meanwhile, the Karnataka government is looking at creating more open cremation grounds to address the issue. So far, four open crematoriums have been opened in TR Mills, Tavarekere, Guddanahalli and Anekal. A long-unused burial ground in Tavarekere has also been designated for Covid-19 burials, while a granite quarry in Geddanahalli was recently converted into a cremation ground. The new cremation facility at Geddanahalli, about 25 km from the city centre, has been receiving between 30 and 40 bodies from Bengaluru every day, officials said. According to officials, work at Tavarekere and Geddanahalli crematoriums was briefly halted on Monday and Wednesday due to rains. Following the disruption, hearse vans were diverted to other crematoriums. A temporary roof has now been erected at Tavarekere. Meanwhile, the BBMP is finding it difficult to open new places for cremations because of the lack of human resources. An official in the BBMP told Hindustan Times that those employed at the newly created open cremation grounds have no prior experience in the job. They perform the duties with the help of some volunteers, he added. Rajesh, a crematorium worker, said they are already getting 30-35 bodies per day at TR Mills. “Our work starts around 7 am and it goes on till late night, there is no one to take over from us. We can’t even take a break,” he said. Karnataka’s revenue minister R Ashoka said on Wednesday that a dedicated helpline would be set up to address issues related to the last rites of Covid-19 victims. There have been several complaints about delays at crematoriums and hassles faced by distraught families and volunteers assisting them. Bengaluru has been recording high number of casualties due to Covid-19 in the past few weeks. On Saturday, Bengaluru reported 285 Covi-19 fatalities, which increased to 374, the highest daily toll in 15 months of the pandemic, on Monday. On Wednesday, 275 deaths were reported in Bengaluru.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bluru-crematoriums-feel-the-heat-as-covid-deaths-rise-101620933292620.html
14-05-2021||India||BJP issues ‘fact sheet’ to refute Oppn charges||New Delhi : The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Thursday issued a “fact sheet” to counter the Oppositions’s allegations about the government’s handling of the Covid-19 crisis, including a sluggish vaccination policy and other systemic health care deficiencies. The fact sheet, shared on social media platforms, was a step-by-step attempt to refute some of the charges.On the allegation that the Modi government did not see the second wave of cases coming, for example, the document said that the PM, in a meeting with chief ministers on March 17, alerted states about a second wave coming, and asked them to take quick steps before it gets too late. It similarly attempt to counter narratives on differential pricing of vaccines for states and the Centre, deaths being under-reported, inaccurate government data, money being spent on the Central Vista project amid the pandemic, and that it would take 2-3 years to vaccinate the entire population at the current rate.“The Central Vista is a project that costs ₹20,000 crore over several years. In contrast, the vaccination budget in just 2021–22 is Rs35,000 crore and the health budget of the country in just the same period is over ₹2 lakh crore,” the fact sheet said.It also pointed to comparisons between how well New Zealand handled the crisis, by pointing out that it has less people than Bengaluru, and that India’s population is more than that of Europe and North Korea combined.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-issues-fact-sheet-to-refute-oppn-charges-101620932391885.html
14-05-2021||India||Even virus has right to live: Ex-CM Rawat||Amid rise in the number of Covid-19 cases and deaths in the state and country, Uttarakhand’s former chief minister Trivendra Singh Rawat has drawn flak from Opposition and experts for his remark, “Covid-19 virus has a right to live.”“If we talk philosophically, then Covid-19 virus is also a living organism which wants to live and has a right to live just like humans. However, we consider ourselves more intelligent than any other living organism. We are now after it and want to escape, the virus is changing its form constantly,” he said while giving interview to a local news channel here.“Hence, we now have to keep distance from it. It is also moving and we are also moving, but we have to move fast than it so that it gets left behind,” he further said.The video clip of the interview was widely shared on social media after which Opposition parties Congress and Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) attacked him for an “irresponsible and foolish” statement when “lakhs have died due to the virus.”Congress state vice-president Suryakant Dhasmana said, “What Rawat, who was state’s CM, said, is nothing but foolish and nonsense. He has no vision because of which he was replaced abruptly by his party. “The virus is a living organism, so was Ravana, Kansa and Mahishasura. But they all were killed by different gods because they were destroying the world just like this virus who has killed lakhs of humans on this planet and needs to be killed. Rawat is just uttering sheer nonsense.”Trivendra Singh Rawat was replaced by the party leadership in March this year. The Lok Sabha MP from Garhwal and former state BJP chief, Tirath SIngh Rawat succeeded Trivendra Singh Rawat, as the new state CM. AAP state spokesperson Amarjeet Singh Rana while condemning Rawat said, “It is ridiculous that he was once the CM of this state. This shows his and BJP leaders’ wisdom. They are making Uttarakhand a laughing stock.”The BJP meanwhile, accused Congress and AAP of indulging in blame game than working for humanity in the pandemic.Party media in-charge Manveer Singh Chauhan said, “Congress is just playing a dirty blame-game and sees everything in negative even in this pandemic. While the AAP is doing this just for cheap publicity as it has no political presence in the state. Both of them should rather indulge in serving the humanity.”On Rawat calling the virus a living organism, Uttarakhand state secretary of Indian Medical Association (IMA) Dr Ajay Khanna said, “Covid-19 virus is a living organism. But it’s killing people.”Another IMA office bearer, on condition of anonymity however, condemned Rawat on saying that Covid has a right to live.“It is really unfortunate for this country that when dead bodies are increasing every day in this country, a leader like Rawat who has been the CM of Uttarakhand is saying that Covid-19 virus is a living organism and has a right to live. It is just shameful and insult to all those who lost their lives to this lethal virus,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/even-virus-has-right-to-live-ex-cm-rawat-101620932331889.html
14-05-2021||India||Action being taken on GOM communication report, says Govt||The government is working on recommendations made by the working Group of Ministers on communication (GOM) formed last year to improve the centre’s media outreach strategy, the ministry of Information and Broadcasting said in response to a Right to Information (RTI) application filed by Hindustan Times.“Action taken on the GOM report is still continuing,” the RTI response said, adding that “it maybe premature to disclose the details as it would serve no public interest.”Hindustan Times, which reviewed the GOM report, on December 8 reported that the Union government was working on a strategy to overhaul its media and public outreach, with a group of ministers (GoM) comprising nine Union ministers recommending a focus on 10 key areas as well as detailing ways in which criticism could be addressed and positive messaging can be spread wider.“The final deliberations of the GOM will have to be cleared by the Cabinet,” a senior government official said on condition of anonymity.The recommendations also focused on social media discourse, saying there is a need to constantly track 50 “negative influencers”, and to engage with 50 “positive influencers” to put the “government’s view point in the right perspective.”The RTI filed by HT seeking details on the action taken by the GOM was disposed by the First Appellate Authority citing section 8 1 (I) of the RTI Act, 2005. The section refers to cabinet papers including records of deliberations of the Council of Ministers, Secretaries and other officers: “ Provided that the decisions of Council of Ministers, the reasons thereof, and the material on the basis of which the decisions were taken shall be made public after the decision has been taken, and the matter is complete, or over: Provided further that those matters which come under the exemptions specified in this section shall not be disclosed,” it states.The GoM comprises Cabinet ministers Ravi Shankar Prasad, Smriti Irani, Prakash Javadekar, S Jaishankar, Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi, and ministers of state Kiren Rijiju, Hardeep Singh Puri, Anurag Thakur and Babul Supriyo.The group made its first presentation to the Prime Minister, who guided the GoM with his insights and gave vital inputs, the December report noted.“After detailed deliberations, it was decided to identify 10 big narratives of the Government. These narratives are reflective of the good work / initiatives taken by the Government for the welfare of the people. It was agreed to identify the strategies that can be adopted to take these messages to the people and to suggest the specific action points by which it can be done,” the GOM report said.The 10 areas identified were: India at 75; plans to make the country a $5 trillion economy; initiatives under Aatmanirbhar Bharat; the overall Sabka Saath, Sabha Vikar, Sabha Vishwas philosophy of the government; Digital India; the Swach Bharat, Swasth Bharat campaign; welfare schemes for women; Skill India; the focus on sustainable development; and the projection of the country’s soft power.The report attracted criticism from the opposition. CPM chief Sitaram Yechury earlier this year said: “So much focus on managing headlines, spin and PR, all this in the middle of a global pandemic, record and growing unemployment and economic collapse.”The report also included recomendations made by the members of the GOM . Anurag Thakur suggested that “right-wing parties of other countries need to be roped in so that some common ground could be found”.Aviation minister Hardeep Puri said “we are in confrontation situation with political interest and commercially-backed interests” and emphasised the “strong need to deal with the international media and shape the global narrative”.Union minister for minority affairs Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi Proposed to identify a “strategy to neutralise people who are writing against the government without facts and set false narratives/ spread fake news.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-working-on-gom-plan-to-improve-media-outreach-to-tackle-criticism-101620932213147.html
14-05-2021||India||Bihar extends lockdown till May 25, test positivity rate dips to 8.9%||The Bihar government on Thursday extended the lockdown for another 10 days, from May 16 till May 25, after reviewing the positive impact that the lockdown had on the state between May 5 and May 15. An announcement to this effect was made by chief minister Nitish Kumar through social media platform Twitter. “Reviewed the ongoing lockdown in Bihar with ministerial colleagues and officials. We can see that the lockdown is having a positive impact. Therefore, we have decided to extend the lockdown in the state for 10 days, from May 16-25, 2021,” a rough translation of Kumar’s tweet, posted in Hindi, read. On May 4, the Crisis Management Group of the Bihar government had decided to impose a lockdown in the state, from May 5-15, amid a rise in daily Covid-19 cases. “The lockdown is showing desired results. After taking the opinion of the district magistrates, it was decided by the Crisis Management Group to extend the lockdown for 10 more days till May 25,” said chief secretary Tripurari Sharan. According to a Bihar health department bulletin on May 13, the state recorded 7,752 positive cases on Wednesday, the reports of which came on Thursday. “During this period, the state government has modified its earlier order by advancing the timings for opening different shops. Now the shops selling milk, vegetables, non-vegetarian items and other essential commodities will open from 6 am till 10 am in urban areas and from 8 am till 12 noon in rural areas,” said additional chief secretary (home) Chaitanya Prasad. Earlier, these shops were opening from 7 am till 11 am. The government has also revised the number of guests for marriages from 50 to 20 only. “All other restrictions enforced earlier will remain in place,” said Prasad. The 11-day lockdown has brought some relief for the Bihar government which was facing all-round flak following shortage of beds in hospitals, irregular oxygen supply, shortage of medicines, exorbitant prices being charged by ambulances, etc. “The positivity rate which stood at 15.7% on May 2 has come down to 8.9% on May 12,” said additional chief secretary (health) Pratyaya Amrit. Similarly, there has been a steady fall in the number of positive cases – from 14,436 on May 4 to 7,752 on May 12 while the recovery rate has also improved from 78.38% on May 5 to 83.43% on May 12. According to the health department sources, in the last one week, the number of new infections has grown by an average of 2.1% every day.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bihar-extends-lockdown-till-may-25-test-positivity-rate-dips-to-89-101620932212641.html

While finalising its recommendations, the Committee will also take inputs from State Nodal Officers of different divisions like Police, Expenditure, Health authorities as well as from some DEOs, SPs & ROs identified by CEOs, Polling officials, BLOs about the issues and challenges faced at the grass root levels,” the commission said in a press release.HT learns that one reform that the commission contemplated was with reference to tackling “sensationalisation” of health issues that can become a sympathy factor in the polls, but it remained in the draft stage.The core committee set up by on Thursday will look into the “shortcomings /gaps in ECI regulatory regime”, if any, at the level of the chief electoral officer or district officials. It will explore the possibility of strengthening the legal framework to ensure compliance of guidelines. The committee will submit its report within a month.The committee will also identify “shortcomings in existing framework in providing protection to electoral machinery from possibility of reprisal after elections”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ec-forms-core-panel-to-identify-shortcomings-after-state-polls-101620932151878.html
14-05-2021||India||NRC coordinator moves SC for list re-verification||Assam National Register of Citizens (NRC) coordinator Hitesh Dev Sarma has approached the Supreme Court seeking a “comprehensive and time-bound” re-verification of the draft citizenship list released two years ago, citing major irregularities in the controversial process that excluded 1.9 million people.In his application, Sarma claimed several thousand ineligible people were included in the draft NRC while other genuine applicants were left out. The plea came days after Assam chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma said his government will push for partial re-verification of the citizens list.“Several serious, fundamental and substantial errors have crept into the whole process of updating the NRC in Assam. This has vitiated the entire exercise and the present draft and the supplementary list for inclusion & exclusion of NRC that has been published is not free from errors,” stated Sarma’s plea.The Supreme Court is yet to fix a date of hearing for this plea.The NRC was first conducted in 1951 and the process of updating it began after decades of agitation in 2015, monitored by the apex court. Citizens were required to show that they or their ancestors were present in Assam before March 24, 1971, the day war broke out in neighbouring Bangladesh and sent droves of refugees into Assam. The cut-off date was related to the Assam Accord of 1985 that marked the end of a six-year-long violent movement against illegal immigrants. The draft NRC published in July 2018 excluded roughly four million people and the final list in August 2019 left out around 1.9 million people.Almost immediately, controversy broke out as rights activists alleged many poor and marginalised people were discriminated against due to lack of citizenship papers, spelling mistakes or difficulty in understanding the complex process. The ruling Bharatiya Janata Party also rejected the list, saying it excluded genuine citizens.In his plea, Sarma said office and field verification of applications could not detect manipulated or manufactured secondary documents, and were also unable to detect if the names were entered fraudulently in the electoral roll. He said the preparation of a correct and error-free NRC was integral to national security and the process was being closely monitored by the top court itself, therefore it was necessary to apprise the court of anomalies that occurred during the NRC updation process and seek remedial action.The application sought re-verification under the supervision of a monitoring committee, preferably represented by district judge, district magistrate and superintendent of police.Sarma said out of the 393,975 people who didn’t contest their exclusion in the July 2018 draft NRC, about 50,695 were later found to be eligible for inclusion. “This figure may increase if detail re-verification is done. For a flawless and complete NRC, names of these persons have to be included in the final NRC, failing which the final NRC will lose its acceptability,” the plea added.Previous applications in the top court for re-verification of NRC haven’t been successful.In July 2019, the top court rejected the Centre and the Assam government’s prayer for a sample re-verification. The Centre had asked the apex court to allow verification of 20% random samples of citizens. But the court referred to the then state coordinator’s report to say that a re-verification of 27% had already been done.On Monday, the CM said that the state government would seek 20% re-verification of the list in districts bordering Bangladesh and 10% re-verification in other districts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nrc-coordinator-moves-sc-for-list-reverification-101620931971861.html
14-05-2021||India||Kalra denied pre-arrest bail in O2 devices case, moves HC||A Delhi court on Thursday refused to grant protection from arrest to businessman Navneet Kalra, who has been charged with hoarding oxygen concentrators and selling them at inflated prices, saying his custodial interrogation was required to unearth the entire alleged conspiracy, and that, if released, he may jump bail or tamper with evidence.Later in the day, Kalra approached the Delhi high court challenging the trial court decision. A single judge bench of justice Subramonium Prasad heard senior advocate Abhishek Manu Singhvi appearing for Kalra and posted the matter for further hearing on Friday.The order came a day after four other co-accused obtained regular bail from the court of the chief metropolitan magistrate who said that the offence being established by the police was unclear.While Kalra has allegedly been on the run since the recovery of 524 oxygen concentrators from three of his restaurants – Khan Chacha, Town Hall and Nege & Ju – and from the office of Matrix Cellular last week, the police arrested five people, including the manager of Nege & Ju restaurant, Hitesh, and four senior officials of Matrix Cellular – Gourav Khanna, the chief executive officer (CEO), Gaurav, who is the business head, Sathish Sethi, the manager, and Vikrant, a sales executive in the company. Khanna was the last person to be arrested from Gurugram on Friday.A city court granted bail to Khanna, Gaurav and Vikrant and Sethi on Wednesday.Kalra, who operates optical stores and restaurants, approached the trial court claiming that he was doing business with a company Matrix Cellular (International) Services Limited in supplying oxygen concentrators to the needy affected by Covid-19 pandemic. He questioned the charge of cheating (IPC Section 420) invoked against him when there was no complaint made against him by any purchaser.Kalra also challenged charges under the Essential Commodities Act and the Epidemic Act for selling oxygen concentrators above its maximum retail price (MRP), saying till the time the police registered the case on May 5 against him and four others, there was no cap or ceiling price fixed for the concentrators by the Union or state governments. It was only on May 7, 2021 that the Drugs and Control Department of the Delhi government issued an order restricting sale of medical devices over and above the MRP, Kalra said in his anticipatory bail plea.Additional sessions judge Sandeep Garg rejected Kalra’s plea and said, “The accused persons have hatched a deep-rooted conspiracy to gain wrongfully, using the painfully pathetic situation caused due to the pandemic and compelled the needy persons to part with their hard-earned money much in excess of the acceptable international market rates of oxygen concentrators.”The judge noted that the concentrators were kept at three restaurants where Kalra held substantial stake, and each device was allegedly being sold at a price of about ₹70,000.The remarks made by the ASJ Garg rejecting Kalra’s pre-arrest bail stand in contrast to the bail order passed on Wednesday by chief metropolitan magistrate Arun Kumar Garg while releasing on bail the other four co-accused.The CMM noted in his order that “not even a prima facie case under IPC Section 420” was made out against the accused. The prosecution alleged Kalra to be the prime accused along with Matrix Cellular for cheating public at large by claiming that the products were of German technology and they provided 90% oxygen flow for use by two persons. However, the devices were Chinese products that could deliver an efficiency of 32%, the prosecution said.While the CMM held this to be a case of “breach of contract” and not cheating, ASJ Garg found substance in the same and said, “The allegations levelled against the applicant/accused are serious i.e. he made fraudulent representation to the effect that he was selling premium portable oxygen concentrators, manufactured with German collaboration, which were sufficient to meet requirement of two persons.”Even with regard to the charges under the Essential Commodities Act, Kalra was accused of selling the oxygen concentrators at “exorbitant” prices without informing the authorities about the MRPs pasted over the boxes containing the oxygen concentrators.On the other hand, the CMM order of Wednesday punched holes into the police probe. Referring to the provisions contained in the FIR - Section 3 and 7 of the Essential Commodities (EC) Act, the CMM said that the said provisions were “invoked in the FIR without the investigating officer (IO) being sure about existence of any such notification (capping price of oxygen concentrators).”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kalra-denied-pre-arrest-bail-moves-high-court-101620931912460.html
14-05-2021||India||Delhi short of Covid-19 jab stocks for ages 45+, says state govt||Coronavirus vaccine doses for those older than the age of 44, supplied by the Union government, are running low and could run out over the next 2-3 days, Delhi government officials said on Thursday, a day after they raised concerns of limited supply for the under-45 age group.Delhi has 290,690 doses of vaccines left for the 45 and above age group —146,690 of Covaxin, which will likely last three days, and 144,000 of Covishield, which will likely last two days.“Until recently, we had a shortage of vaccines for those aged between 18-44. But now, we are also facing a shortage for the 45+ category. I request the central government to urgently provide us with adequate doses, because now there’s scarcity of stocks for both age groups,” said Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) legislator Atishi during the government’s live-streamed vaccine bulletin on Thursday evening.She said replenishing vaccine stocks for the 45+ category is crucial because many of them have their second dose scheduled in the next few days. “In Delhi, we have a number of people in the priority age group (45 and above) who have already taken their first dose. It is important that the Centre immediately sends us doses because if these beneficiaries are not given their second dose in time, then the first dose given to them will be wasted,” said Atishi.Neither Serum Institute of India (SII), which manufactures Covishield, nor Bharat Biotech, which makes Covaxin, responded to requests for comment.The Centre on Thursday recommended doubling the gap between Covishield doses from 6-8 weeks to 12-16. The suggested interval for Covaxin remains 4-6 weeks.The Union government, in an affidavit to the Supreme Court on Sunday, said it will deliver 496,930 doses to Delhi in the first fortnight of May as part of its campaign for the 45-and-above age group.For the younger age group, only Covishield doses are available in the Capital, government data showed, and these stocks are likely to last for eight days. For the second straight day, Delhi on Thursday continued its immunisation programme with no stocks of Covaxin.Delhi health minister Satyendar Jain said there has been no communication from the two manufacturers on when more stocks will arrive.“Around 100 vaccination sites that were giving Covaxin jabs to the 18-44 population are now temporarily shut. Yesterday [on Wednesday], we announced that Bharat Biotech has expressed its inability to give us additional doses of Covaxin. After that, we are still to find out when fresh doses will come. We will inform people as soon as we get the doses, whether from the Centre or the manufacturers,” said Jain.Union health ministry spokespersons did not respond to requests for comment.According to data, Delhi has so far received around 817,690 vaccine doses – 150,000 Covaxin and 667,690 Covishield – for the 18-44 age group. Of these, as on Thursday evening, 390,410 doses were in stock —380,020 of Covishield and 10,390 of Covaxin.VACCINATION CENTRES FOR 45+ ALSO TO BE SHIFTED TO SCHOOLSWith nearly 100 vaccination centres being removed from the Co-WIN portal due to shortage of Covaxin, the pressure appears to have spilled over to the other centres. Taking cognisance of complaints of crowding, Delhi deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia on Thursday reviewed the administration’s vaccination management system and directed walk-in vaccinations be restarted for those aged 45 and above.“I have directed officials to ensure walk-in vaccinations for those aged above 45, as there’s a large section that finds online registrations difficult. Also, many were finding it difficult to book slots, so this step will help,” he said.Walk-in vaccination for the 45+ age group in Delhi was halted for 3-4 weeks, a senior government official said.Sisodia also said that vaccination centres for this bracket will also be shifted to Delhi government schools. On Wednesday, the state health department issued an order asking all district magistrates (DMs) to shift the vaccination drive for 45+category to schools and create an additional 186 vaccination centres, with about 10 vaccination sites at each.According to Thursday’s bulletin, Delhi vaccinated 74,654 people in the past 24 hours. Atishi said the number was lower than other days because on Wednesday government dispensaries and hospitals do not give Covid-19 vaccines as they immunise children with other routine vaccines.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhi-short-of-jab-stocks-for-ages-45-says-state-govt-101620931911844.html

14-05-2021||India||43 countries assure aid to help battle the pandemic in India||More foreign aid to help India combat the raging second wave of the Covid-19 is in the pipeline, with 43 countries have committed to help the country , government officials said.New Delhi has already received 87 consignments from 28 countries including the US, UK, Singapore, Netherlands, UAE, Bahrain and Qatar in the last 15 days since April 27. Government officials said that 64 of these have come through the government-to-government channel while the remaining 23 have arrived from private agencies or individuals.The government has set up three dedicated channels for Covid19-related aid: for countries; private donors; and those who want to directly send relief to the states. While the external affairs ministry is involved in facilitating the arrival of the shipments, the health ministry and Niti Aayog are distributing these aid materials to recipient states. The government has explained previously that the allocation is primarily to the states that have a high case load or regional medical hubs.Government documents available with HT show that India has received at least 9,000 oxygen concentrators and 6,000 ventilators from abroad and that a majority of these has already been delivered to the recipients.The US and Canada have sent the highest doses of remdesivir, while the US, along with Ireland have sent highest number of oxygen concentrators—demand for medical oxygen has soared in many Indian cities. These oxygen concentrators have been distributed to 11 AIIMSs across India, nine states and union territories and other institutions such as DRDO and the Army Base hospital in Delhi.India also received 19 oxygen generating plants from countries such as the UK, Israel, the US, Germany, Italy and Ireland. These plants have (or are being) been installed at both public institutions such as ESIC hospitals in Faridabad and Okhla, and also private hospitals including Apollo hospital and BL Kapur hospital in Delhi. States such as Rajasthan, UP and Assam too, have received these plants.While the highest number of ventilators were received from UAE and Netherlands, India also got four high-flow oxygen concentrators and liquid medical oxygen from Kuwait aboard INS Kolkata.Niti Aayog CEO Amitabh Kant said, “Our transparent system allows the donors to track the end-to-end movement of the goods with full information. All items which have been received until May 9 have been delivered to the recipients by May 10”.“Between May 9 and May 12, we have received further items from South Korea, UAE, Egypt, UK, Kuwait, Israel, US and Netherlands. All of this too, were immediately dispatched. They are either in transit or has been delivered,” added Kant.India also received almost 1.1 million Rapid Detection Kits, over 3 lakh Remdesivir vials and over 2.5 Lakh doses of Favipiravir from foreign partners. In addition, items such as nasal canula tubes, oxygen containers, PPE kits, masks, gloves and pulse oximeters have also been received.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/43-countries-assure-aid-to-help-battle-the-pandemic-in-india-101620931311811.html
14-05-2021||India||6 firms attend UP meet on import of vaccines||Six vaccine manufacturers attended a pre-bid meeting convened by Uttar Pradesh on Wednesday to discuss procurement of 40 million Covid-19 jabs, a top state official said on Thursday, adding that the process of floating a global tender was likely to begin in 15 days.Navneet Sehgal, additional chief secretary (information) in the UP government, said the meeting was attended by Dr Reddy’s Laboratories, Zydus Cadila, Pfizer, Serum Institute of India (SII), Bharat Biotech, and an unnamed Korean company.Dr Reddy's is marketing the Sputnik V vaccine in India , Zydus Cadila is developing a Covid-19 vaccine, Pfizer has a popular nRNA vaccine currently used across the world, SII manufacturers Covishield -- the name under which which the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine is marketed in India -- that is the mainstay of the country’s inoculation programme, and Bharat Biotech makes Covaxin, the other vaccine used in India’s drive.India has so far administered 179 million doses of Covishield and Covaxin. It has granted approval to Sputnik V and has indicated that it will fast-track approval for the Pfizer shot. Imported doses of Sputnik will start being available in India next week, and local production is expected to start in July. Zydus Cadila’s vaccine candidate is under development.“We expect to float the global tender in about 15 days. We are also making contact with Moderna and Johnson & Johnson,” Sehgal said, alluding to the two other companies whose vaccines have been approved in different countries.HT reported on Wednesday that Tamil Nadu was the 11th state to opt for global tenders to get vaccines, even as officials in states said it wasn’t clear by when they would receive doses. While states have freedom to float global tenders for acquiring Covid-19 vaccines from any drug manufacturer, they cannot inoculate their citizens with vaccines that have not been approved by the Union government. Several states have asked the Union government to set up a central procurement of vaccine to have the weight of sovereign behind them in negotiating better terms with global vaccine produces.To be sure, the Centre has said that vaccines approved elsewhere will be approved in India under certain conditions.After the Centre on April 19 decided to launch the “liberalised and accelerated” third phase of the national immunisation programme to cover the 18-44 age group from May 1, several states such as Uttar Pradesh, Odisha, Delhi, Karnataka, Telangana, Bihar and Maharashtra initiated the procurement process of vaccines. The April 19 decision allowed vaccine manufacturers in India to supply 50% of monthly output to states (allocated on the basis of the size of the eligible population in the state) and private hospitals after keeping 50% of doses for the Centre.In its tender norms, the UP government is likely to specify that the temperature for the storage of the vaccine should be 2-8 degrees Celsius, said additional chief secretary (health and family welfare) Amit Mohan Prasad.“The bidders have been told that the state government requires six million to eight million doses of vaccine to be supplied every month. The supply has to be initiated within seven days of the release of the purchase order and completed within 30 days. The bidder should have their own coldchain transporting system or should have proper contract with a transporting agent having the facilities to transport the vaccines under cold chain norms from the manufacturing unit to the government warehouses in Varanasi, Meerut, Lucknow, Agra, Gorakhpur, Kanpur, Jhansi, Bareilly and Faizabad (Ayodhya),” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/6-firms-attend-up-meet-on-import-of-vaccines-101620931251794.html
14-05-2021||India||Now, Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh halt inoculation for 18+ citing vaccine shortage||Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh on Thursday announced that they were suspending vaccinatons of people in the 18-44 age group, due to non-availability of Covid-19 vaccines, following the example of Karnataka and Maharashtra.With Serum Institute of India and Bharat Biotech, the two Indian companies providing vaccines to the government, not able to meet the growing demand for vaccines, as many as 12 states have decided to float global tenders to buy vaccines.“We are suspending vaccination till we get vaccines from Serum Institute,” said a Rajasthan government official, adding that the state expects to resume vaccination from Saturday if the vaccines arrive.The state has around 200,000 vaccines meant for those over 45 years of age. The official added that these would likely be used up on Thursday and that the state would wait for more vaccines from the Centre. Rajasthan has so far vaccinated 14.6 million people (3.3 million have received both shots and 11.6 million one shot). This includes 5,63,122 people in the 18-44 years age group who have received one dose of the vaccine.The state has ordered 30.75 million vaccines from the Serum Institute of India, of which 650,000 have been delivered. The state has also ordered around 300,000 vaccines of Covaxin from Bharat Botech. Rajasthan has decided to float a global tender to procure 10 million vaccines.The Union government provides states with free vaccines for those over the age of 45 and frontline workers. States have to make their own arrangements for vaccines for the 18-45 years age group, though the Centre works with vaccine manufacturers to decide how many vaccines each state is eligible for.A Chhattisgarh government official said vaccination in the 18-44 age group for Above Poverty Line (APL) people was stopped in Raipur due to unavailability of vaccines. “Vaccination is going on for other categories such as poor and frontline workers across the state,” said state immunisation officer, Dr Amar Singh Thakur. Health minister TS Singhdeo expressed confidence of getting vaccines soon to continue vaccination drive. West Bengal which started vaccination for the 18 - 44 segment on Tuesday in select districts may have to suspend the inoculation if vaccines don’t arrive in the next two days, officials said.Some states such as Goa, Himachal and Bihar are yet to start vaccination drive for 18-44 age group. Himachal Pradesh plans to start vaccinating people in this segment from May 17 with chief minister Jai Ram Thakur saying that the state has received first consignment of 1.07 lakh doses from the Serum Institute of India (SII) on Wednesday. Tripura on Thursday started vaccinations for people in the 18-44 age group.Both Telangana and Andhra Pradesh have not started vaccnating people in this segment -- something that was supposed to begin from May 1. While Andhra Pradesh has stopped administering first doses to people over the age of 45 -- it wants to prioritise second doses -- Telangana has been giving both first and second doses to those above the age of 45 years. Both the governments have clarified that they will start vaccinations for the 18-44 years age group only after the completion of second dose of vaccination for those over the age of 45 years.Madhya Pradesh immunization officer Santosh Shukla said, “Madhya Pradesh has about 3 lakh vaccines for the 18-44 years age group and within three days, we will receive 9 lakhs more. We started the vaccination of 18 + four days late because we wanted to have enough stock .”The Uttar Pradesh government, which has opened vaccinations for the 18-44 age group in 18 of the state’s 75 districts, said it would start vaccinations in more districts once tit receives five lakh vaccine doses by Friday. “We have enough vaccine doses to run the drive,” said state Health and Family Welfare minister, Jai Pratap Singh.Punjab, which is left with only 60,000 jabs for the 18-44 age group, is not contemplating a suspension of the drive, said Health Minister Balbir Sidhu. The state has ordered 3 million doses of Covieshield from Serum Institute of India (SII) and is expecting 2.5 lakh doses between May 15 and 25. Odisha and Assam do not plan to suspend vaccination for the 18-44 age group, as both states have enough stocks.The Maharashtra government on Wednesday decided to temporarily suspend the vaccination drive for the 18-44 years category and divert the vaccines that it purchased for that age group to provide second doses for those above 45, state health minister Rajesh Tope said.(With inputs from state bureaus)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/now-raj-and-chhattisgarh-halt-inoculation-for-18-citing-vaccine-shortage-101620931191761.html
14-05-2021||India||Over 2 billion vaccines to be available by Dec: Centre||India will likely have access to at least two billion doses of coronavirus vaccines, a top government official said on Thursday, listing out several vaccines in development and projected enhancements in manufacturing capacity by the end of 2021.The data presented by Niti Aayog member VK Paul, however, included eight vaccines of which only three have been approved in the country, and cited production enhancements that are beyond current estimates. Experts also said that for these doses to be available, the government will need to place purchase orders.“The emerging scene in terms of vaccine supplies shows that we are largely dependent on two vaccines, even though Sputnik V vaccine has also been added to the basket. According to the production plan that we asked some of the companies to draw for us for a period between August and December this year, we get a provisional figure of 216 crore doses,” said Paul, while speaking at the government’s weekly briefing on Covid-19.Paul presented a table showing production for August-December period, with the companies ostensibly giving out their figures as: Covishield (Serum Institute) – 750 million; Covaxin (Bharat Biotech) – 550 million; Biological E’s subunit vaccine – 300 million; Zydus Cadila’s DNA vaccine – 50 million; Serum Institute’s Covavax – 200 million; Bharat Biotech’s nasal vaccine – 100 millionl Gennova’s mRNA vaccine – 60 million and Sputnik V’s 15 million.Among these, only Covishield, Covaxin and Sputnik V have been approved and Covavax’s international brand – developed by Novavax – has reached the efficacy analysis stage in phase III trials.The projected production appeared to be significantly higher than what some of the companies have announced till now – for instance, the figures released by Paul suggests an average production of 150 million doses a month of Covishield, while the company has said it will take up production capacity to 100 million a month by July.SII and Bharat Biotech did not respond to requests for a comment by HT.Experts said it was too early to say these many doses will be available unless procurement orders were made.“While we should have a reasonable expectation that the ongoing trials would be successful, we should not pre-judge them till they are completed and data are available for scrutiny both by the regulatory agency and the wider scientific community. Hope does not automatically translate to proof at this stage,” said Dr K Srinath Reddy, president, Public Health Foundation of India.Dr Giridhara R Babu, head, epidemiology, Indian Institute of Public Health also said, “This is fantastic news if the orders are already placed for two billion doses. It is safe to count only those vaccines which are approved for use by regulatory authorities after phase 3 is successfully completed.”According to the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), Zydus Cadila’s, ZyCov-D, is currently undergoing phase III human trials, Biological E’s vaccine is undergoing phase I/II human clinical trials, Bharat Biotech’s nasal vaccine is undergoing phase I human trials, SII’s Covovax is at phase II/III human trials stages, and Gennova’s mRNA based vaccine is also undergoing phase I/II human trials.Paul urged people to remain optimistic. “You may say optimistic; yes, it is optimistic. Is there a risk? There may be; it’s quite possible because the trials are still underway but we have to remain prepared. These are all promising vaccines. It is all responsible data coming straight from the companies,” said Paul.According to government data, so far, 356 million vaccine doses have been received by the Centre —66 million (56 million of Covishield and 10 million of Covaxin) under the PM Cares fund, 10 million under Gavi-Covax facility, 120 million purchased for phase II of the vaccination drive and 160 million under phase III. phase .In addition to these, private hospitals and state governments have purchased 160 million more, taking the total volume of doses sourced or in the pipeline till July to 516 million.Serum Institute’s CEO Adar Poonawalla said in recent media interviews that he was looking at ramping up capacity up to 100 million by July.The Department of Biotechnology in April announced that, with its help, Bharat Biotech was working towards ramping up production capacity by May-June, 2021 to over 100% of their current capacity of 10 million doses a month, with a target of reaching 100 million by September 2021.About 150,000 doses of Sputnik V have already been imported and more doses are expected in coming weeks.“India has a great opportunity to turn around the vaccine story if these companies are invited to manufacture by collaborating with Indian companies under make in India. We have a tremendous potential to meet the needs of the whole world, especially in providing affordable vaccine to poor countries,” said Dr Babu.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/over-2bn-vaccines-to-be-available-by-dec-centre-101620931132370.html
14-05-2021||India||Covid-19: What you need to know today||A report released on Wednesday on what went wrong with the world’s (and the World Health Organization’s) response to the coronavirus disease doesn’t have any surprising revelations. The report, prepared by the Independent Panel for Pandemic Preparedness and Response (IPPPR) that was set up after various WHO members demanded it, lists some suggestions on preparing for the next pandemic, including the creation of a Global Health Threats Council (its members will be heads of state, and also from civil society and the private sector), and an International Pandemic Financing Facility which will be funded by rich countries to the tune of $5-10 billion a year, and which will help countries prepare for or manage pandemics, that, while not entirely new (again), do seem like good moves. The best time to prepare for the next pandemic is soon after seeing the current one off.Click here for complete Covid-19 coverageThe report terms February 2020 the lost month – if WHO had acted then, or if countries had, the trajectory of the pandemic is likely to have been very different from one that has, over the 17 months since January 1, 2020, caused 161 million infections and 3.34 million deaths around the world. The actual numbers of the infected and the dead are likely to be much higher. On January 14, 2020, WHO claimed, on the basis of investigations carried out by Chinese health authorities, that there was “no clear human-to-human transmission”. A week later, it changed its position, and said there was possibility of “sustained” human-to-human transmission. It delayed declaring a public health emergency till January 31, and terming the outbreak a pandemic till March 11. It wasn’t until June that the multilateral health agency would issue a proper advisory on masks (which it did not recommend till then). And while it did accept the possibility that the virus could be airborne last year, it wasn’t until earlier this year that it changed its guidelines to include this. Most worryingly, though this period, WHO has made no headway in figuring out the origin of the virus which first appeared in Wuhan, China.The debate over whether the virus was made in a lab, or evolved in nature, is ongoing, and more research is needed before a definite answer can be provided. In early May, science writer Nicholas Wade summarised the research so far, laying out the cases for and against either scenario. Wade’s article, published in Medium, leans towards the lab argument, but it isn’t a conspiracy theory. Instead, he presents a cogent scientific argument built around three strands. One, provenance, or how, if the virus was naturally found in the famous horseshoe bats of Yunnan, it travelled all the way to Wuhan, at least 1,500km away; evolution, or how the Sars-CoV-2 virus, which causes the coronavirus disease, came fully evolved to optimally target humans, unlike the Sars-CoV virus, responsible for South Asia Respiratory Syndrome, that evolved over time to become efficient at targetting humans; and finally, the unique furin cleavage site that the virus possesses, not found in other betacoronaviruses, and activated by an enzyme, furin, commonly found in human cells.The furin cleavage site has figured in this column previously because it is truly unique. The spike protein of Sars-CoV2 has three parts – S1, S2, and a cleavage site at the boundary. Furin cleaves the two, and the S1 site then attaches to the ACE receptor (also found commonly on the surface of human cells), a binding that facilitates the entry of the viral protein into the human cell. You can read Wade’s piece (I’d recommend it) at nicholaswade.medium.comPS: There are reports that the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) could meet on Friday to discuss the use of convalescent plasma therapy, something it (rightly) recommended against last year. Yet, its use has continued, and it has been heartbreaking to see people scramble for something that isn’t going to help them. A high level of antibody (AB) titer is required for the therapy to be effective in the case of Covid-19, and this isn’t found in the case of most plasma. While at it, ICMR should also issue strict guidelines on the right context for the use of remdesivir, and steroids.PPS: The National Expert Group on Vaccine Administration for Covid-19 (NEGVAC), on Thursday, accepted a recommendation that the gap between two doses of Covishield be increased to 12-16 weeks, from the current 6-8 weeks. This is a long-overdue move because there’s enough research to show that a gap of 12 weeks or more between doses has the most optimal impact on the vaccine’s efficacy, increasing it to 82.4% (protection against serious illness). The change will allow India to vaccinate more people. The first target is 375 million people who have received at least one dose of the vaccine. The sooner India reaches that number, the lower the chances of a strong third wave of the pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid19-what-you-need-to-know-today-101620930582759.html
14-05-2021||India||Bengal’s villages hit harder by Covid-19 this time compared to cities||West Bengal’s Bolpur block in Birbum district reported 15 Covid-19 cases in March. In April, the cases shot up to 617. The block, where 90% of people live in rural areas, earlier reported 160 and 170 infections in October and November when the disease reached its peak in the state. The exponential rise in Covid-19 cases in Bolpur coincided with the West Bengal assembly elections in March and April. An official added the scenario is almost the same in other rural areas.Birbhum reported an 11-fold increase in the daily count of Covid-19 cases compared to last year’s peak on Wednesday with 928 infections. On October 22, when West Bengal witnessed the peak of the first wave with 4,157 new cases, Nadia, another district in south Bengal, reported under 200 cases. On May 12, the district registered 1,171 cases, a rise of six times over last year’s peak. Just like Birbhum, Nadia has over 72% rural population.Urban areas like Kolkata and its adjoining district of North 24 Parganas have been reporting the maximum cases. Kolkata reported 3,989 cases and North 24 Parganas 4,091 on Wednesday. The rise is still less than five times that of the last year’s peak.Also Read | Bengal facing twin challenges of Covid-19, post-poll violence: Guv DhankharExperts have blamed the elections as the primary reason behind the exponential rise in Covid-19 cases in rural Bengal. The increase is more than that in urban areas.“Every political leader boasted of huge gatherings in their rallies not knowing what harm they were doing. Covid-19 spread rapidly even in the rural areas as huge political rallies were held in the villages, sans any safety protocols. This came at a time testing, tracing and treating had gone down,” said Abhijit Chowdhury, a health expert, who was a part of the advisory panel set up by chief minister Mamata Banerjee last year.The first phase of the eight-phase elections was held on March 27. The poll process continued for over a month.Active cases in Paschim Bardhman, East Midnapore and Hooghly have shot up four to six times over last year’s peak on October 22. Compared to this, active cases in Kolkata and North 24 Parganas, two urban districts, have shot up by around 3.5 times during the same period.Experts said that while during the first wave, the Centre imposed a country-wide lockdown and quarantine centres were set up when migrant labourers returned to their homes, this time the movement was unrestricted.“During the first wave, the lockdown was imposed. When migrant labourers, more than a million of them, started entering Bengal in buses and trains, they were first quarantined. But this time there were no restrictions. People moved from urban areas to rural areas freely resulting in the spread,” said Sukumar Mukherjee, another expert, who was part of the panel set up by the state during the first wave.On May 7, when West Bengal registered over 19,000, Union health minister Harsh Vardhan said that some districts in the state were registering a 40% positivity rate. Officials said the positivity rate of the state was 29% on May 12, stressing the need for more testing and restrictions.“While we were testing around 45,000 per day in October-November last year when Covid-19 cases were raging, at present we are testing around 69,000. Cases have shot up almost five times now since last year’s peak. But have we been able to increase our testing proportionately?” asked Manas Gumta, general secretary of a doctors’ association.Also Read | Maha extends lockdown till June 1; negative RT-PCR mandatory for entering stateEven as Balram Bhargava, the head of the Indian Council of Medical Research, has said restrictions should remain in place in all districts, where the rate of infection is above 10% of those tested, Banerjee has ruled out a total lockdown across the state.Several restrictions have been imposed in the state. They include cancellation of local trains and restriction on market timings. RT-PCR tests have also been mandatory for entering the state while political rallies have been banned.A health department official said efforts are also being taken to ramp up health infrastructure in the rural areas. “All rural hospitals and primary health centres in the villages have been asked to set up isolation beds, oxygen facilities and ambulances,” said the official, requesting anonymity.Officials said around 105 hospitals up to the sub-division level have been equipped with piped oxygen. By May 15, piped oxygen will reach another 41 hospitals, which would also add 3,000 beds.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bengals-villages-hit-harder-by-covid19-101620910730937.html
14-05-2021||India||Work allocation under NREGS rises amid Covid-19 surge||The Centre allocated more work under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS) in April and May than in the corresponding period last year, signalling a greater job demand amid the surge in Covid-19 cases that has prompted lockdowns across the country, and pushed at least some migrant workers in the cities to return home, although the exodus is still a fraction of what was seen duuring the 68-day hard lockdown last year.The rural development ministry, which administers the world’s biggest job guarantee scheme, budgeted for 335.7 million person-days of work in April under MGNREGS. As India’s Covid cases rose, the budget for May jumped to 799.4 million person-days of work, a rise of around 140%.MGNREGS, which guarantees at least 100 days of manual work annually for at least one member of every rural household, generated 325.2 million person-days of work in April. As many as 335.9 million person-days of work have already been generated in the current month, showing a steep rise in job demand.Demand for work under the scheme surged following the lockdown that was imposed to check the pandemic last year. The curbs in 2020 triggered an exodus of workers from the cities to their homes in the hinterland. It is believed that the job guarantee scheme and the performance of the agricultural sector (which bucked the trend) helped insulate the rural economy to some extent from the fallout of the pandemic.In the middle of the lockdown last year in April, 175.7 million person-days of work was budgeted under the scheme. The budget saw a steep increase to 676.3 million person-days the following month. For the first time in MGNREGS’s history, more work was done in every month of FY20-21, barring April, than the budgeted quantum as workers left jobless by the lockdown returned to their homes last year. The year saw the highest ever spending under the scheme-- ₹1.11 lakh crores.Most Indian states and Union territories have imposed lockdowns, prompting workers to return home, where they are likely to fall back upon MGNREGS.This year’s Union budget, presented at a time when the country was seeing fewer than 10,000 cases of Covid-19 a day allocated ₹73,000 crore to MGNREGS. More demand for work under the scheme, widely seen as the last resort of employment in a calamity, will likely entail more allocations through additional funds or diversion of money from other schemes of the rural development ministry, a government official said.The spread of the disease in rural areas -- not seen for several months during the first wave of the pandemic last year -- has added to the concerns of MGNREGS managers. A second official of the ministry said that apart from beneficiaries, many grassroots-level officials, who play a critical role in maintaining records and ensuring smooth payments, may be affected.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-cases-rise-govt-allocates-for-more-work-under-mgnregs-101620879049138.html
