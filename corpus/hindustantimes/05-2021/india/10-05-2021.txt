10-05-2021||India||Madras HC tells Centre to augment oxygen supply to Tamil Nadu amid rising demand||The Madras High Court on Monday said that it was necessary to take urgent measures to augment oxygen supply to Tamil Nadu and think of a plan B.“It is necessary that immediate urgent measures be taken, both to augment the supply of oxygen in the state, vaccines and drugs to both the state and the Union territory (Puducherry),” the court stated.The bench of Chief Justice Sanjib Banerjee and Justice Senthilkumar Ramamoorthy made the observations in the suo motu plea taken up by the court to monitor Covid-19 second wave preparedness in Tamil Nadu and Puducherry.The court observed that until a national task force is formed as ordered by the Supreme Court on May 6, it is the Union government’s responsibility to ensure a continuous supply of oxygen and drugs to states and union territories. The court also asked Additional Solicitor General, R Sankaranarayanan, to take up the issue with the Centre.During the hearing, newly appointed state advocate general R Shunmughasundaram submitted that Tamil Nadu’s demand about a week ago was for 475 MT of oxygen daily. On May 8, the Centre allocated a daily quota of 419 MT, this includes 40 MT supply from Palakkad in Kerala till May 12.But the state’s assessment is that the oxygen demand will rise to 800 MT “within the next few days”, the court noted. The court also added that it has been reported in the media that the locals have stopped vehicles carrying oxygen from Palakkad towards Coimbatore and the neighbouring areas in view of the perceived shortage of oxygen supply in Kerala.“The state and the Centre should find ways of effective supply to the south-western region of the state since supply from Sriperumbudur or elsewhere in north or central Tamil Nadu may be logistically difficult to reach the south-western part of the state and, at any rate, less efficient than ensuring supply from neighbouring Palakkad which is about 40 kilometres away,” the court said.It was also submitted to the court that the Sterlite facility in Thoothukudi district, which was allowed to be re-opened by the Supreme Court for the sole purpose of producing oxygen, may begin production this week with an anticipated 40 MT per day as initial supply.With present allocation and rising demand, the court said that it was necessary to think of a plan B and explore options such as oxygen generators being set up by the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) at short notice.As experts warn of a third wave, the court said, “it is necessary to be over-prepared and not require the resources being put to use rather than being unprepared and rue for not having garnered additional resources. The object of the exercise is to prepare for the worst and hope that the worst does not hit us.”The bench however observed that the lockdown in Tamil Nadu from May 10-24 will taper cases. It also noted that as the new government is being formed in the state, most key officials have been transferred except health secretary J Radhakrishnan to ensure continuing measures to fight the pandemic.The court said that though the state has augmented bed availability, “Both Tamil Nadu and Puducherry seem to be crying out for the requisite supply of drugs and vaccines.” Due to lack of doses, the state hasn’t rolled out vaccination for the 18-45 age group. “Learned ASG has assured to take up the case of both the state and the union territory with the Centre, at least till such time that the National Task Force set up by the Supreme Court order gets down to the nitty-gritty of the allocation and the like,” the court said in its orders.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/madras-hc-tells-centre-to-augment-oxygen-supply-to-tamil-nadu-amid-rising-demand-101620666139461.html

The four regions, namely the Pondicherry region, Karaikal, Yanam and Mahe region are at different locations, geographically separated from each other.Puducherry has various rivers and tributaries. There are five rivers in Puducherry district, seven in Karaikal district, two in Mahé district and one in Yanam district drain into the sea, but none originates within the territory, the ministry said.Puducherry has 84 irrigation tanks and more than 500 ponds which are the lifeline for groundwater recharging systems, drinking water and agriculture.Puducherry has been consistently working towards de-silting of ponds and rejuvenation of its local water bodies, which is crucial for drinking water supply schemes, it added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/puducherry-achieves-100-tap-water-connection-in-rural-areas-under-jjm-101620662973437.html

Marik, founding member of the FLCCC and Chief, Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine at Eastern Virginia Medical School in the US."We are calling on regional public health authorities and medical professionals around the world to demand that ivermectin be included in their standard of care right away so we can end this pandemic once and for all," Marik added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/regular-ivermectin-use-may-cut-risk-of-contracting-covid-19-study-101620664096285.html
10-05-2021||India||Edappadi Palaniswami is AIADMK’s leader in Tamil Nadu assembly||After a power tussle between former Tamil Nadu chief minister Edappadi Palaniswami and senior AIADMK leader O Panneerselvam on Monday, the former was chosen as the AIADMK’s legislative party leader in effect making him the Leader of Opposition in Tamil Nadu.After losing the assembly elections, this is the next best post for an outgoing chief minister and Palaniswami has now sealed his position in the AIADMK for now and future. The party needed to finalise its decision today as the newly elected lawmakers are to take oath on Tuesday.This was the second meeting as the party wasn’t able to arrive at a consensus when it previously met on Friday. After a three-hour meeting on Monday, at the party office in Chennai, there was no press briefing but AIADMK announced on Twitter that they have chosen Palaniswami as the opposition leader. It was followed by a statement signed by both Edappadi Palaniswami and Panneerselvam.The duo has been managing affairs of the party and government since J Jayalalithaa’s death in office in December 2016. The dual leadership arrangement is where Palaniswami was chief minister and joint coordinator of the AIADMK while Pannerselvam was his deputy chief minister and coordinator of the party. However, simmering tension between the duo has come up now and then over important decisions over the position.Inside the meeting, senior leader KP Munusamy announced Edappadi Palaniswami as the opposition leader to the newly-elected MLAs. “It is a unanimous decision of the new MLAs, senior leaders without any dissent,” said one of AIADMK’s founding members C Ponnaiyan.But the scenes outside the party office were different, as there was heavy police deployment and it had swelled up with opposing cadre who supported the two leaders. This crowd was there despite Tamil Nadu going into full lockdown from Monday up to May 24. The party had informed the police of their meeting that was decided last week.In the previous meeting, the newly-elected MLAs were seated on the first floor of the party office while seniors, along with Palaniswami and Panneerselvam discussed matters on the ground floor. When asked if there was no dissent why the previous meeting was inconclusive, Ponnaiyan said, “There was no actual problem, it was created by the media. Besides choosing the opposition leader, we had to discuss our electoral debacle. Our performance in the north and south regions isn’t appreciable.”The poll performance had given Palaniswami the upper hand as he and former top ministers hail from the western region where the party performed its best with more number of MLAs being elected. Pannerselvam hails from the south. In what was seen as Pannerselvam’s show of strength, he had attended chief minister MK Stalin’s swearing-in last Friday before the meeting and they ate a table together along with Governor Banwarilal Purohit, former chief secretary Rajeev Ranjan and other senior DMK leaders.A new MLA from the south’s Usilampatti constituency, P Ayyapan said that they agreed to the leadership’s decision. “I’m from his (Panneerselvam) region. He hadn’t come to us for our support in this matter. He didn’t say he wants the post,” said Ayyapan. “It’s the cadre outside who are shouting slogans and leaving.”However, issues had been brewing over who would become the leader of opposition. A former AIADMK minister who didn’t wish to be quoted said, “It is only natural and expected that both leaders had their own support base who put forth their points. We have resolved this now.”This is the second time that Pannerselvam has given up an important post despite putting up a fight initially. In October 2020, after more than a week of MLAs shuttling between the two leaders, Pannerselvam broke the suspense and announced the party’s decision to field Palaniswami as the chief ministerial candidate.The party has deftly ousted VK Sasikala and her nephew TTV Dhinakaran in 2017. While they wanted to reclaim the AIADMK, Sasikala announced that she was keeping away ahead of the elections and Dhinakaran’s Amma Makkal Munnetra Kazhagam (AMMK) didn’t win any seat but played spoiler for AIADMK in 21 seats. For now, the party says that there will be no deflection.Meanwhile, Rajya Sabha MPs Munusamy and R Vaithilingam have resigned since they have won as MLAs from Vepanahalli and Orathanadu constituencies in the recently concluded elections. During the campaign, AIADMK’s RS MP Mohamed John died of a cardiac arrest and with that three upper house seats from Tamil Nadu are vacant.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/aiadmk-chooses-edappadi-palaniswami-as-leader-of-opposition-in-tamil-nadu-assembly-101620662719178.html

The decision has been taken in the wake of alleged violence against party leaders and workers in the state, officials said.In X-category security cover, three to five armed personnel accompany the protecteee round the clock depending on the threat perception.The Union home ministry approved the security cover after taking into cognisance a report prepared by central security agencies and the inputs of a high-level team of officers that was sent to the state by the ministry in the wake of post-poll violence against the workers of the BJP, news agency PTI reported.Several BJP leaders were already put under VIP security protection during campaigning for the assembly elections. After the fresh order, all 77 MLAs of the BJP have now been brought under central security cover.Suvendu Adhikari, who has been chosen as the leader of opposition in West Bengal Assembly, is already under Z-category protection by CRPF while four more BJP leaders have Y-category security cover.The BJP has emerged as the main opposition party in the state, winning 77 seats in the 294-member house in the recently concluded polls where the Trinamool Congress (TMC) led by chief minister Mamata Banerjee formed the government.Violence has been reported in several parts of West Bengal after the results of the assembly elections were declared on May 2. The BJP alleged that nine of its party workers were killed in the post-poll violence. However, the TMC has denied the allegations.On May 7, a four-member team deputed by the Union home ministry visited the Diamond Harbour area of West Bengal's South 24 Parganas district to assess the ground situation.Meanwhile, the West Bengal government on Monday told a Calcutta high court bench that there has been no post-poll political violence in the state since May 9 and assured that all steps will be taken to ensure peace in future.The five-judge bench was hearing a Public Interest Litigation (PIL) filed by a lawyer and directed that all steps be taken in this regard by May 17 and posted the matter for hearing on May 18.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/61-bjp-mlas-in-bengal-get-x-category-security-cisf-cover-post-poll-violence-101620662287568.html

So the state should be allowed to procure all 150 metric tonne produced at Kanjikode plant (in Palakkad),” Pinarayi Vijayan said in his letter to PM Modi.Kerala’s main oxygen producing unit run by a private company, Inox Air Products, was also catering to demand for oxygen in two neighbouring states, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu. Pinarayi Vijayan said Kerala has been sending 40 metric tonnes of oxygen to Tamil Nadu daily in line with the directions of the central committee on oxygen pool.Vijayan said this would have to stop in view of the surge in Covid cases in Kerala.In the last 24 hours, according to the state government, Kerala has reported 27,487 fresh Covid cases, leading the active caseload to rise to 4,19,726. This is the third highest, next only to Maharashtra and Karnataka. Kerala’s 14 districts have reported a test positivity rate (TPR) of 26.5%.Pinarayi Vijayan, who had been reluctant to restrict movement in the state, reluctantly ordered a week-long lockdown till May 16 due to the spike in Covid cases.The chief minister told reporters that Kerala’s active Covid cases are estimated to cross 600,000 by next week and estimated that the state would need 450 MT to meet the demand from patients in the state.Kerala has been an oxygen surplus state and helped other states meet the growing demand for oxygen. It needed just about 80 MT but produced about 219 MT in big and small units. But this was before a virulent strain of the Covid started spreading in the state. Pinarayi Vijayan said the increase in cases had already led its buffer stock to dip to 86 MT.Instead, Vijayan asked PM Modi to send more cryogenic tankers to transport oxygen to hospitals and Covid centres in the state. The chief minister last week had asked PM Modi to help the state with imported oxygen concentrators and ventilators.At the same time, Pinarayi Vijayan said the state government has also started a vigorous exercise to check oxygen wastage. As part of this exercise, technical teams will visit all generating and filling stations.“There is no let up in the situation. In 72 panchayats, the TPR is above 50% and in 300, it is above 30%. Cases are surging in Kannur, Ernakulam and Thiruvananthapuram districts. We have to strengthen lockdown to keep fatality down,” Vijayan said.Kerala has, however, managed to control the number of deaths. Despite a high load of active cases, the state has the lowest case fatality rates due to Covid-19 in the country: 0.4% against the national average of 1.4%. Experts have mostly attributed the lower fatality rate to the state’s health infrastructure.Pinarayi Vijayan said his government will strengthen it further and hire more doctors, nurses and paramedical staff and ask retired health workers to return to work. The jail department has released 560 prisoners on parole in line with the Supreme Court’s orders to control its spread in jails.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/wont-be-able-to-send-oxygen-to-others-kerala-s-pinarayi-vijayan-tells-pm-modi-101620661819244.html

10-05-2021||India||Deadly 'black fungus' found in India's Covid-19 patients||The Indian government has told doctors to look out for signs of mucormycosis or "black fungus" in Covid-19 patients as hospitals report a rise in cases of the rare but potentially fatal infection.The state-run Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) said at the weekend that doctors treating Covid-19 patients, diabetics and those with compromised immune systems should watch for early symptoms including sinus pain or nasal blockage on one side of the face, one-sided headache, swelling or numbness, toothache and loosening of teeth.The disease, which can lead to blackening or discolouration over the nose, blurred or double vision, chest pain, breathing difficulties and coughing blood, is strongly linked to diabetes. And diabetes can in turn be exacerbated by steroids such as dexamethasone, used to treat severe Covid-19."There have been cases reported in several other countries - including the UK, U.S., France, Austria, Brazil and Mexico, but the volume is much bigger in India," said David Denning, a professor at Britain's Manchester University and an expert at the Global Action Fund for Fungal Infections (GAFFI) charity."And one of the reasons is lots and lots of diabetes, and lots of poorly controlled diabetes."India has not published national data on mucormycosis but has said there is no major outbreak. Media reports have pointed to cases in Maharashtra and its capital Mumbai, and Gujarat.Aparna Mukherjee, a scientist at ICMR, said: "It's not something to panic about, but you have to be aware of when to seek consultation."But it is a complication that India's overwhelmed hospitals, desperately short of beds as well as the oxygen needed for severely ill Covid-19 patients, could do without.Arunaloke Chakrabarti, head of the Center of Advanced Research in Medical Mycology in the Indian city of Chandigarh and an adviser to GAFFI, said that even before Covid-19, mucormycosis was more common in India than in most countries, "partly because of the millions who have diabetes".He said serious cases might require specific antifungal therapy and several operations.P Suresh, head of opthalmology at Fortis Hospital in Mulund, Mumbai, said his hospital had treated at least 10 such patients in the past two weeks, roughly twice as many as in the entire year before the pandemic.All had been infected with Covid-19 and most were diabetic or had received immunosuppressant drugs. Some had died, and some had lost their eyesight, he said. Other doctors spoke of a similar surge in cases."Previously if I saw one patient a year, I now see about one a week," said Nishant Kumar, a consultant ophthalmologist at Hinduja hospital in Mumbai, noting the potential for contamination of oxygen pipes and humidifiers in hospitals.Denning called it a "triple whammy". "You've got a high rate of mucormycosis, you've got a lot of steroids - maybe too much - being used, and then you've got diabetes which is not being well controlled or managed."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/deadly-black-fungus-found-in-india-s-covid-19-patients-101620658023360.html

Now, amid the second wave of Covid-19 pandemic raging across the country, the party has decided to defer the polls once again.“In view of the nationwide emergent conditions prevailing on account of unprecedented Corona pandemic, the CWC was unanimous that all our energies should be channelized towards saving every life and helping every Covid affected person.

When we met on January 22nd, we had decided that the process for electing a Congress President would be completed by end-June. The election authority chairperson, Madhusudan Mistri ji, has prepared a schedule.”The Mistri panel had proposed that the elections would be held in the last week of June. But leaders, including Rajasthan chief minister Ashok Gehlot, argued that this is time to hold party polls.In the meet, Congress also decided to form state-level committees to analyse the results of assembly elections in Assam, West Bengal and Kerala.

We are in the business of transport. We have to move freight and people. Around 1,000 cases are reported daily. We have our hospitals. We have augmented the number of beds, we have built oxygen plants in rail hospitals. We take care of our staff…,” he said at a press conference on Monday.“As of now, we have 4,000 beds currently occupied by staff and their families. Our effort is to see that they recover quickly. As of yesterday, 1952 rail employees have died due to Covid-19 since March last year,” he added.With a workforce of nearly 1.3 million, the Indian railways is one of the largest employers in the world.Last week, railways’ union - the All India Railwaymenś Federation - wrote to railway minister Piyush Goyal demanding compensation at par with frontline workers for railwaymen who lost their lives while working amid the Covid-19 crisis.In the letter, they said that these personnel deserved ₹50 lakh as compensation, the same as that announced for frontline workers, and not ₹25 lakh which is paid to them.In the letter, Shiva Gopal Mishra, general secretary of the All India Railwaymenś Federation, said that while more than one lakh have been infected by the virus, 65,000 have recovered and joined their duties while 1,500 have lost their lives due to the coronavirus disease.Sharma said that the Railways was concerned about the safety of all railwaymen and took all necessary steps to minimise their exposure.Speaking on the Oxygen Express, Sharma said that the Railways has delivered nearly 4700 tonnes of liquid medical oxygen (LMO) in more than 295 tankers to various states across the country since April 19.On Sunday, Oxygen Express delivered a record 831 tonnes of LMO, a record for one single day. So far, 75 Oxygen Express´ have already completed their journey.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/over-1900-personnel-succumbed-to-covid-19-since-last-year-railway-board-chairman-101620657438788.html
10-05-2021||India||Convene special Parliament session on Covid, Congress to President Kovind||Congress MP Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury on Monday asked President Ram Nath Kovind to convene a special session of Parliament to discuss the Covid pandemic and come up with steps to ease the suffering of people.The senior Baharampur Lok Sabha member’s letter to President Kovind comes at a time the second wave of coronavirus disease continues to rage across the country. On Sunday, the country had reported over 366,000 fresh cases, pushing the number of active Covid cases to 3.7 million and severely straining the health sector.The infection, according to official records, has led to over 2,46,116 deaths but most experts agree that a large number of deaths have gone unreported.“In this critical situation I would urge your kind conscience to convene a special (Covid crisis) session of Parliament because India consists of a number of constituencies and each member of Parliament representing his/her constituency from the respective state has some say about the condition of people therein and in order to find a way to ease the lives of suffering people,” Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury, who heads the Congress party in the Lok Sabha said.“Corona pandemic in the country is in a grave situation and you must be well informed about the exact scenario. In this critical situation I would urge your kind conscience to convene a special (Covid crisis) session of Parliament,” the lawmaker said in his letter to President Kovind.Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury added that the session was needed as “India consists of a number of constituencies and each Member of Parliament represents his/her constituency from respective State has some say about the condition of people therein and in order to find a way to ease lives of suffering people”.Many opposition leaders have also demanded that parliament should hold a special sitting and that this should be held virtually.To be sure, the power to convene a session of Parliament rests with the government. The decision to convene the session has to be taken by the Cabinet Committee on Parliamentary Affairs headed by defence minister Rajnath Singh. The presidential notification follows the cabinet committee’s decisions.India does not have a fixed parliamentary calendar. By convention, Parliament meets for three sessions in a year- the Budget Session, the Monsoon Session and the Winter Session. A special session is when the Parliament meets outside the normal legislative sessions. Special sessions can be convened to complete an unfinished task or to address special topics, or emergencies such as war or natural disaster.In April, Shiv Sena’s Rajya Sabha Sanjay Raut had also demanded a two-day session on Covid-19, underlining that the second wave of coronavirus cases had led to “an unprecedented and almost a war-like situation”.“Utmost confusion and tension everywhere. No beds, no oxygen and no vaccination as well. It’s nothing but total chaos. A special session of parliament for at least two days should be called to discuss the situation.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/convene-special-parliament-session-on-covid-congress-to-president-kovind-101620655398878.html

These equipment were airlifted from Israel and reached India on Sunday night.So far, the government of Israel has sent a total of 60 tonnes of medical supplies, three oxygen generators, 1710 oxygen concentrators and 420 ventilators to India.“The State of Israel is happy to stand solidly side by side with India as a true friend and a strategic partner in this hour of need. In the last few days, we have successfully airlifted three different consignments of life-saving medical supplies to India. This includes 60 tonnes of advanced medical equipment and several oxygen concentrators. More consignments carrying further medical aid will arrive for the people of India in coming days. The friendship between both countries is strong and collaboration during the Covid-19 crisis will only make it stronger,” said Dr Ron Malka, ambassador of Israel to India.The medical aid arrived in three different consignments on May 4, May 7 and May 9 via Indian Air Force (IAF) aircrafts and a commercial flight.The Israeli ministry of foreign affairs along with the National Security Council, health ministry, finance ministry, and control centre, together with full coordination with the Indian government through the Indian embassy in Israel made the delivery of the medical aid possible.In the first outbreak of Covid-19 in Israel, India had helped Israel, and within this framework approved the air delivery of masks, gloves, and raw materials for medications to Israel, and also helped arrange the repatriation of its citizens.Israel responded by reciprocating the significant gesture.The IAF has deployed 42 transport aircraft for Covid-19 relief tasks, including 12 heavy lift and 30 medium-lift aircraft."IAF has deployed 42 transport aircraft for Covid relief tasks including 12 heavy lift and 30 medium lift aircraft.

You won't be able to access your chat list, but you can still answer incoming phone and video calls. If you have notifications enabled, you can tap on them to read or respond to a message or call back a missed phone or video call,” it said.The messaging platform said after a few weeks of limited functionality, users, who still won't accept the terms, “won't be able to receive incoming calls or notifications and WhatsApp will stop sending messages and calls to your phone”.WhatsApp said it won't delete the users' accounts if they haven't accepted the update but highlighted that its existing policy related to inactive users will apply.WhatsApp accounts are generally deleted after 120 days of inactivity, wherein inactivity refers to users not connecting to the messaging platform.While the company did not respond to specific queries around these reminders, how long they will run and other modalities, a WhatsApp spokesperson said: “We'll continue to provide reminders to those users within WhatsApp in the weeks to come”.“We've spent the last several months providing more information about our update to users around the world. In that time, the majority of people who have received it have accepted the update and WhatsApp continues to grow."However, for those that have not yet had a chance to do so, their accounts will not be deleted or lose functionality on May 15,” the spokesperson said.WhatsApp had faced severe backlash over user concerns that data was being shared with parent company, Facebook.The company has not clarified the reason behind the decision for easing the May 15 deadline for acceptance of the privacy policy update, nor divulged the number of users who have agreed to the terms so far.In January this year, WhatsApp had informed users about the changes in its terms of service and public policy through an in-app notification. Users were initially given time till February 8 to agree to the new terms in order to continue using the platform.According to WhatsApp, the key updates include more information about its service and how it processes user data; how businesses can use Facebook hosted services to store and manage their WhatsApp chats; and how WhatsApp partners with Facebook to offer integrations across the company products.WhatsApp has insisted that the acceptance of the privacy policy update does not expand its ability to share user data with Facebook.However, user backlash over WhatsApp's alleged sharing of user information with Facebook had forced the messaging platform to postpone the February deadline to May 15.India is the biggest market for WhatsApp, and the platform -- as per government data -- has 53 crore users in the country.India remains a critical market for Internet companies like Facebook with its large population base and burgeoning Internet adoption.The country is the world's second-largest telecom market and the biggest consumer of data.Following the criticism faced by WhatsApp earlier this year, the popularity of rivals like Telegram and Signal surged as users thronged to these platforms.WhatsApp, in the past, has said it is open to answering any questions from the government on privacy and that it will continue to explain to users that their messages are end-to-end encrypted.It had also sought to assuage user concerns through blog posts and tweets by its Global Head Will Cathcart and even full-page ads in leading dailies in India.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/users-not-accepting-privacy-terms-to-face-limited-functionality-whatsapp-101620652496951.html

As this will be user generated content and not provided by authorised sources, it may be required to verify the accuracy and freshness of the information before utilizing it," it said.As India reels under the impact of the second wave, hospitals in several states are reeling under a shortage of medical oxygen and beds.Social media timelines are filled with SOS calls with people looking for oxygen cylinders, hospital beds, plasma donors, and ventilators.Google said its teams are focused on three priority areas - ensuring people can access the latest and most authoritative information; amplifying vital safety and vaccination messages; and providing financial backing for affected communities, health authorities and other organisations.Searches on the COVID-19 vaccine displays key information around side effects, effectiveness, and registration details, while treatment-related queries surface guidance from ministry resources. On YouTube it is surfacing authoritative information in a set of playlists, about vaccines, preventing the spread of COVID-19, and facts from experts on COVID-19 care.In addition to showing 2,500 testing centers on Search and Maps, Google is now sharing the locations of over 23,000 vaccination centres nationwide, in English and eight Indian languages, it said."And we're continuing to work closely with the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare to make more vaccination center information available to users throughout India...we're using our channels to help extend the reach of health information campaigns," it added.The company said it has been running an internal donation campaign to raise funds for non-profit organisations, including GiveIndia, Charities Aid Foundation India, GOONJ, and United Way of Mumbai.This campaign has raised over USD 4.6 million ( ₹33 crore) to date, and continues to generate much-needed support for relief efforts.Google has also rolled out a COVID Aid campaign on Google Pay, wherein people can donate to non-profit organisations like GiveIndia, Charities Aid Foundation, Goonj, Save the Children, Seeds, UNICEF India (National NGOs) and United Way towards COVID relief work.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/google-testing-new-feature-in-maps-to-enable-sharing-info-on-beds-medical-o2-101620650863919.html
10-05-2021||India||Congress puts off party president election in view of Covid-19 situation||The Congress Working Committee unanimously decided on Monday to defer the crucial election to the post of party president until the Covid-19 situation in the country improves, sources said.After a section of leaders had last year pressed for an organisational overhaul, the Congress had decided to hold elections for the new party president by June-end and its central election authority chaired by Madhusudan Mistry proposed June 23 for the exercise.The CWC, the apex decision-making body of the Congress which met in the backdrop of the recent drubbing in four assembly polls, considered the schedule for electing the AICC president prepared by the party's election authority.However, top Congress leaders at the meeting were of the view that holding the election right now would not be proper as the coronavirus situation in the country was very grim, the sources said.Rajasthan Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot proposed that there should be no election to the post of Congress president in view of the Covid-19 situation and senior party leader Ghulam Nabi Azad seconded him.Azad, a prominent member of the group of 23 leaders who had demanded organisational elections, said at the meeting that no one in the party was seeking an election right now and it should be postponed, the sources said."In view of the nationwide emergent conditions prevailing on account of unprecedented Corona pandemic, the CWC was unanimous that all our energies should be channelised towards saving every life and helping every Covid-19 affected person."CWC, therefore, unanimously resolved to defer the elections temporarily in the midst of these challenging times," said a resolution passed at the meeting.Mistry had earlier proposed that the election be held on June 23 and counting on June 24. He proposed that the notification for the election be issued on June 1 and nominations be accepted between June 2 and 7.Asked till when the election has been deferred, Congress chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala said it has been put off temporarily till the next two-three months by when the situation is expected to improve.Sonia Gandhi took over as the interim Congress president in August 2019 after Rahul Gandhi resigned in the wake of the party's Lok Sabha debacle in May 2019.There have been demands from a section of the Congress leaders for having a full-time and active party president and an organisational overhaul.A letter to Sonia Gandhi by a group of 23 leaders including Ghulam Nabi Azad, Anand Sharma, Bhupinder Hooda, Prithviraj Chavan, Kapil Sibal, Manish Tewari and Mukul Wasnik, raising these issues had triggered a storm in the party in August last year.The CWC had in its meeting on January 22 decided that the process for electing a Congress president would be completed by June-end and had asked Mistry to prepare a schedule.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/congress-puts-off-party-president-election-in-view-of-covid-19-situation-101620651169397.html
10-05-2021||India||Tackling Covid-19: Centre spotlights efforts to boost oxygen availability||The Centre said on Monday that it has taken a number of initiatives to enhance availability of oxygen, its distribution and storage infrastructure. In a release, the government said that the steps included augmenting the entire oxygen supply chain."Oxygen availability has been enhanced by increase in production capacity and production, setting up of pressure swing adsorption (PSA) plants, import of liquid medical oxygen (LMO) from overseas, and procurement of oxygen concentrators," the government said.It added that a digital tracking system has been setup of for real time monitoring.Talking about increasing the production, the government said that oxygen production has increased from 5700 MT per day in August last year to 9,446 MT per day in May this year."Commensurate with the increase in production and demand, LMO sale in the country has also increased from about 1,300 MT/day in March’ 21 to 8,920 MT/day on 6th May," the government said. It added that the sale of LMO grew more than five-fold - from 1559 MT per day on March 31, 2021 to over 8,000 MT per day by May 3, 2021.Talking about capacity enhancement plans, the government said that supply of oxygen for non-essential industrial purposes has been prohibited from April 22, resulting in about 1,000 MT of additional oxygen availability. "Additional capacity expansion of 630 MT/day is also planned by steel sector."Thousands of PSA plants are also being set up under PM-Cares through the Union health ministry, the government added.Apart from this, ministry of external affairs is actively assisting in securing sources of oxygen from abroad, the Centre said, adding that procurement of one lakh oxygen concentrators has been sanctioned under PM-Cares fund.The government's response came after the Congress Working Committee (CWC) passed a resolution on Monday, slamming the handling of Covid-19 pandemic by the Centre. It said that the government has put the burden of vaccination on the states.Many states have pointed to issues in oxygen supply, urging the Centre to increase their quota of oxygen to save lives of Covid-19 patients. The Centre said that it used the formula of Union health ministry to estimate oxygen requirement for each state in line with active cases there, and maximum efforts were made to align oxygen allocation to the estimated demand for each state."Oxygen allocation to states/UTs is dynamic in nature, based on requirement as per health ministry norms, and consultation with states/UTs, manufacturers and other stakeholders. There is a mismatch between producing and consuming states, and equity among states to be maintained," said the Centre. The government said that one-third of the production is concentrated in East India, while nearly 60% of demand for oxygen is in North and South India, resulting in transportation challenges.The Supreme Court had recently appointed a 12-member task force to look into the issue of oxygen supply. The task force held its first meeting on Sunday where it hailed the efforts put in by the Centre and suggested ways to augment the supply of the oxygen.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/as-covid-19-cases-surge-centre-spotlights-efforts-to-boost-oxygen-availability-101620650876891.html

It also said that former prime minister Manmohan Singh had suggested ways to increase vaccine supplies and coverage in a letter to PM Modi last month, but was given a reply by Union health minister Harsh Vardhan in most undignified manner.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/congress-adhir-ranjan-writes-to-president-kovind-seeks-parliament-session-over-covid-19-crisis-101620643585363.html

And Dolo is charged ₹30-40 each. We won’t allow this loot,” said the court.The court took up the issue suo motu after a 28-year-old man posted a video on social media narrating his bitter experience at a private hospital in Aluva in Kochi. Many such complaints of heavy billing were reported from various parts of the state. Also Read | Cong to form state-level panels to analyse assembly poll resultsThe state government informed the court that a case has been registered against the hospital and a fee structure was fixed for various services in private hospitals. “As per the new order, price of the general ward for a day would be ₹2,645, includes registration, bed, diagnosis, oxygen, nursing and doctor fees and other services,” the government counsel informed the court. But expenses of costly medicines such as Remdesivir will be charged separately. He also informed the court that a penalty of ten times the rate will be imposed in case of overcharging. The counsel appearing for private hospitals opposed the capping and said they were also working under trying conditions.“Because of the pandemic, you are having 100% occupancy. Normally it will be 50-60%. Learn to average our costs,” the court said. It also lauded the government initiative to bring a fee structure to check exploitation in hospitals.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-caps-private-hospital-treatment-fees-after-hc-rap-101620650298598.html

While the ruling Trinamool Congress returned to power for the third time with a thumping victory by winning 213 out of the 292 seats, party chief Banerjee lost to her protégé-turned adversary Adhikari by less than 2,000 votes at Nandigram in east Midnapore district. “We have inducted 20 new ministers in the Cabinet. There are nine women ministers (including Banerjee), seven ministers representing minority community and four each from SC and ST communities,” Banerjee said. There are 24 ministers of Cabinet rank, 10 ministers of state with independent charge, and nine other ministers of state.She retained some of the most important portfolios such as home and hills affairs, health and family welfare, land and land reforms, personnel and administrative reforms and information and cultural affairs. . Among the new ministers is former finance minister Amit Mitra. Even though he didn’t contest the elections because of his poor health, he was sworn in as finance minister. Among the new faces are former IPS officer Humayun Kabir and ex-cricketer Manoj Tiwari. Though the TMC had fielded several Tollywood actors and nearly all of them won, none were inducted in the Cabinet.

Jyotipriyo Mullick, who was the food and supplies minister, was made the forest and renewable sources minister. It was during Mullick’s tenure that the TMC had to face allegations of ration scam. Firhad Hakim was given transport and housing, while minister of state for health Chandrima Bhattacharya was given the additional charge of urban development. Bratya Basu retained the ministries of school and higher education. Leader of the Opposition Suvendu Adhikari said, “As the main Opposition party in the assembly, our first priority would be to ensure that there is no violence and to establish democracy. We would attend the sessions and raise our voice against injustice and torture.” The chief minister, however, said, “Nothing has happened in Bengal. Bengal is peaceful. There was one only genocide which took place at Sitalkuchi (where central forces had shot dead four persons).” Soon after, Banerjee held the first Cabinet meeting where she hinted that her government would rather not impose any lockdown despite the rise in Covid-19 cases. “We have imposed multiple restrictions. Without imposing a total lockdown, I urge people to behave as if there is a lockdown. If you impose total lockdown, people won’t be able to earn a living. There are many poor people who depend on daily wages,” she said. With Eid scheduled later this week, members of the Calcutta Khilafat Committee have decided not to hold prayers on Red Road, where over 200,000 people easily gather every year. The state has also put on a cap of 50 people on religious and cultural gatherings.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mamata-banerjee-retains-six-portfolios-inducts-20-new-ministers-in-her-cabinet-101620649878797.html

10-05-2021||India||'PM must atone for his mistakes': CWC passes resolution on Covid-19||The Congress Working Committee (CWC) on Monday held a meeting where it discussed the prevailing Covid-19 situation in the country, apart from discussing the party's performance in the recently concluded assembly elections. In the resolution passed after the meeting, the CWC called the second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic "a grave calamity and direct consequence of the Modi government’s indifference, insensitivity and incompetence"."It is the direct result of the central government’s willful disregard of scientific advice, its premature declaration of victory over the pandemic (that turned out to be just the first wave), and its unwillingness and inability to plan in advance in spite of warnings sounded not only by public health experts but also by the standing committee of Parliament concerned," the CWC further said in the resolution.Attacking the Centre over insufficient vaccine supply, the CWC resolution said the Modi government denies the hard facts. It also said that former prime minister Manmohan Singh had suggested ways to increase vaccine supplies and coverage in a letter to PM Modi last month, but was given a reply by Union health minister Harsh Vardhan in most undignified manner."The CWC noted with concern that the data on Covid deaths is horribly wrong and afflicted by massive non-reporting of deaths. The solution lies in facing the challenge and stopping the casualties from Covid-19 and not in concealing the truth by burying the data on deaths and infections," the CWC resolution said.It also slammed the Central Vista project, calling it "personal vanity project of the Prime Minister" which is leading to criminal waste of money. "This is the height of callousness and insensitivity as also an insult to the people of the country," the CWC said."The Congress Working Committee is of the firm belief that this a time for showing an unwavering sense of national unity, purpose and resolve. In order that it may become a reality, the Prime Minister must atone for his mistakes and commit to serving the people instead of carrying on with personal agenda, oblivious to the suffering all around," it further said.Earlier, addressing the CWC, Congress president Sonia Gandhi alleged that the Centre has abdicated its responsibility and left Covid-19 vaccination to states."Modi government has abdicated its responsibility and left vaccination to states. It would have been financially more equitable for the Centre to provide free vaccine to all," she said.India recorded 3,66,161 new coronavirus cases in the last 24 hours, as per the Union health ministry update on Monday morning. With this, the cumulative count of the cases has gone up to 2,26,62,575.As many as 3,754 people succumbed to the disease in the country in the last 24 hours, taking the cumulative death toll to 2,46,116. As per the government data, a present there are 37,45,237 active cases of Covid-19 in the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-must-atone-for-his-mistakes-cwc-passes-resolution-on-covid19-101620645864191.html

Metro service will be stopped as an additional measure.“The stricter the lockdown, the faster we will be able to control the virus," Kejriwal said.Stating that even though Covid-19 cases and positivity rate have come down in the last few days, Kejriwal said any leniency at this stage would squander the gains achieved so far in the current wave of the pandemic.In a revamped and stricter lockdown, marriages in Delhi will be held at home or in courts with not more than 20 people, according to an order issued by the Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA).India's daily Covid-19 infections and deaths held close to record daily highs on Monday, amid calls for locking down the world's second-most populous country.The 366,161 new infections and 3,754 deaths reported by the health ministry were off a little from recent peaks, taking India's tally to 22.66 million with 246,116 deaths.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhi-records-12-651-fresh-covid-19-cases-319-deaths-positivity-rate-rate-dips-101620645269928.html

The drive is part of a multi-pronged strategy to fight the second wave of the disease, believed to be more lethal and infectious than the first one last year.“We need a huge thrust on information dissemination regarding Covid and counter[ing] the misinformation. On the instructions of Lt Governor, Manoj Sinha, we have also started a phone-in programme where specialist doctors will provide information to the general public. A mass social media campaign has also been launched to educate [the] public about the Dos and Don’ts in the Pandemic,” said Dr Shafqat Khan, the officer on special duty (OSD) in the Health and Medical Education Department. He said the government’s target audience were mild cases under treatment in home isolation.“This is turning into a success story,” Dr Khad added referring to the perceived success of the program.“The efforts are to amplify the [correct] message as there is a lot of misinformation spreading within the community about the disease,” said Dr Salim Khan, the head of department (HoD) of Social and Preventive Medicine at the Government Medical College (GMC) Srinagar. He is also the nodal officer for Covid-19 at the hospital.Till Sunday evening, Jammu and Kashmir’s Covid infection toll had reached 216,932 including 2,726 deaths.

10-05-2021||India||CWC meeting: Congress to form state-level panels to analyse poll results in Assam, Bengal and Kerala||The Congress has decided to form state-level committees to analyse the results of assembly elections in Assam, West Bengal and Kerala. The decision was taken at the Congress Working Committee (CWC) meeting.At the meeting, the party leaders noted that in Assam, the difference of vote share between Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and Congress alliance was very narrow. The BJP was able to retain power in Assam by defeating Congress-led 'Mahajot'; Himanta Biswa Sarma took oth as 15th chief minister of the state on Monday.The CWC meeting was convened to analyse the election results and review the party's performance in the recently-concluded assembly polls. All the Congress leaders present at the CWC meeting maintained that the need of the hour is to maintain unity.Addressing the CWC, Congress president Sonia Gandhi said the party has to take note of its serious setbacks in assembly polls, and face the reality to draw the right lessons and put its house in order.The Congress fared poorly in the assembly elections, drawing a blank in West Bengal and failing to win back power in Kerala and Assam, besides losing Puducherry. The party only came to power with the help of its ally - MK Stalin-led Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) - in Tamil Nadu."These will yield uncomfortable lessons, but if we do not face up to the reality, if we do not look the facts in the face, we will not draw the right lessons," she noted.The Congress chief asked the party general secretaries and in-charges of states where it lost to spell out clearly and frankly the reasons for the party's defeat.The Congress lost the Arunachal Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh, Odisha and Haryana elections in 2019 and the Delhi and Bihar polls last year.It only won in Jharkhand along with its ally Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM).Monday's deliberations were meant to help the Congress prepare for the next round of assembly elections in Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, Uttarakhand, Goa and Manipur.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/congress-forms-state-level-committees-to-analyse-assam-bengal-kerala-debacle-101620643427397.html
10-05-2021||India||Himanta promises pro-active govt; says Covid-19 control in Assam top priority||Assam’s new chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma on Monday assured people of the state a pro-active government that will work for them round the clock. “You will see a pro-active government which will be there for you at 12am, at 5am and also at 2pm. We will try and resolve all pending issues and seek blessings of the people of Assam,” Sarma told journalists during his first press conference after taking oath earlier in the day. He said the first Cabinet meeting will take place on Tuesday and on agenda would be the prevailing Covid-19 situation in the state. “Daily cases in Assam have crossed 5,000. The situation in Assam will affect other N-E states as well,” he said. The chief minister assured that all the promises made by the BJP and its allies in their election manifesto will be fulfilled. “We saw peace and development in the past five years. I appeal to the remaining outlawed armed outfits in Assam to join the peace talks. I would make a special request to leader of United Liberation Front of Asom-Independent (ULFA-I) Paresh Baruah to shun violence and join talks for permanent peace in the state.” Also Read | Himanta Biswa Sarma takes oath as Assam’s 15th CM; 13 ministers also sworn inSarma said that as promised by the BJP in its poll manifesto, the state government would seek re-verification of the National Register of Citizens (NRC). The document that lists Indian citizens in Assam was released in 2019 with exclusion of names of 1.9 million applicants. BJP has termed it as faulty saying while many genuine citizens got left out, those with dubious credentials managed to get enlisted. “Our view on NRC is very clear. We want 20% re-verification of the list in districts bordering Bangladesh and 10% re-verification in other districts. If after that, the NRC is found to be correct, the state government would accept it and take the process forward. But if the NRC is found faulty after re-verification, we would want the Supreme Court to view this issue critically,” Sarma said. On the issue of granting scheduled tribe (ST) status to Ahoms, Koch-Rajbongshis, Moran, Motok, Sutias and tea-tribe, Sarma said that the state government would try and resolve the issue through talks and without affecting the rights of tribes already under the ST ambit. Reacting to concerns about Assam’s financial situation, Sarma, who held the finance portfolio in the previous government, said the state has nearly ₹7,000 cr in its treasury and stressed there is no cause of concern as the state’s fiscal health is among the best in the country. Sarma assured that his government would enact laws on “love jihad” and “land jihad”. Love jihad is a term used by some Hindu groups to describe relationships between Muslim men and Hindu women. They accuse Muslim men of seducing Hindu women and luring them into marriage with an intention to convert them to Islam. Likewise, “land jihad” is used for land belonging to indigenous people being encroached upon by outsiders.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/himanta-promises-pro-active-govt-says-covid-19-control-in-assam-top-priority-101620642018668.html

Law and order being a state subject all state governments must ensure special teams at state, district and taluka levels to mercilessly clamp down on any illegal hoarding or black marketing and send a clear message that trading in human miseries shall not be tolerated under any circumstances,” the Centre has said in its affidavit.It said that enforcement actions have been taken in 157 cases across the country, which include lodging of FIRs and arresting those involved in such activities.A bench headed by Justice D Y Chandrachud, which is hearing a suo motu case for ensuring distribution of essential supplies and services during the pandemic, had on April 30 flagged the issue of black marketing of drugs.In its affidavit filed in the top court, the Centre has said that sale and distribution of drugs are regulated under the Drugs and Cosmetics Act, 1940 and the Drugs Rules, 1945 by the state licensing authorities (SLAs) appointed by the state governments.“DCGI has taken a number of measures to check any hoarding and black marketing of drugs. DCGI had instructed all state drugs controllers (SDCs) on April 10, 2021 to conduct special investigation drive to prevent hoarding/black marketing on Remdesivir in the country and action taken is being followed up by the CDSCO (Central Drugs Standards Control Organisation) regularly,” it said.“On April 24, 21, DCGI had communicated to all the SDCs that there should be zero tolerance to any kind of hoarding/black marketing of drugs and again asked to instruct their enforcement staff to keep strict vigil at the sensitive places and to take stringent action against black marketing/ hoarding of drugs,” it said.It said CDSCO has also collected information from the SDCs regarding details of the enforcement actions taken in this regard.“The enforcement actions have been taken in 157 cases in various places across the country, which include actions like filing cases/ lodging FIRs, arresting people involved in such activities, etc,” the affidavit said.The apex court, in its April 30 order, had said that black marketing of critical Covid-19 drugs and oxygen was a condemnable attempt to exploit peoples' misery.It had directed the Centre to consider constituting a special team to identify and prosecute such offenders.The apex court had also noted that several critical drugs such as Remdesivir and Tocilizumab, were being sold at significantly inflated prices or in fake form."This is a condemnable attempt to exploit peoples' misery and profit from their helplessness," the apex court had said."In order to clamp down on this practice, the Central Government can consider constituting a special team to identify and prosecute those who: (a) sell medical grade oxygen/Covid-19 medicines at exorbitant prices; and (b) sell fake substances and recover the concerning substances," it had said.The Centre had earlier told the top court that hoarding or black marketing is a serious menace and heinous offence apart from being an unpardonable act of trading in human miseries.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/states-must-ensure-special-teams-to-mercilessly-clamp-down-on-black-marketing-of-drugs-centre-tells-sc-101620640234212.html

Earlier this month, the administration extended services of existing medical staff at some government facilities till the end of the year to mitigate the manpower crisis.“Hire interns and final year medical students to increase the manpower in the health sector,” Sinha told the principals of government medical colleges and the chief medical officers in the union territory last week.On Sunday, the government called upon the health institutions across the UT to utilise the services of final year MBBS students for services like telephonic consultations and monitoring of mild Covid-19 cases after due orientation under the supervision of faculty members.Mission director National Health Mission, Choudhary Mohammad Yasin, wrote to the principals of government medical colleges of Jammu and Srinagar besides Sher-I-Kashmir Medical College and Hospital Bemina, asking them to pay a monthly stipend of ₹5,000 to all such final year MBBS students, under Covid-19 Emergency Response Package (ECRP) 2021-22.“The stipend will be [paid] to those who work for at least 100 days for Covid care in accordance with the notification issued by Union Ministry for Health and Family Welfare,” he said. The Central government has announced several incentives including preference in government jobs for medical students who opt for Covid duty for at least 100 days.As many as 5,190 fresh infections and 54 Covid-19 deaths were reported in Jammu and Kashmir on Sunday, taking the overall death toll to 2,726 and the total cases to over 216,000. 444 people have died this month alone in the UT.President of J&K’s employees’ joint action committee (EJAC), Rafique Rather hailed the step as the one that “will prove helpful to a great extent in containing Covid-19”.A doctor said that doctors who had left government service were also ready to help if given an opportunity. “Many such doctors have volunteered to join back at this time of crisis. It will be better than only taking retired doctors back in service,” he said on condition of anonymity.On May 03, the Jammu and Kashmir administration had announced the decision to extend the tenure of retiring doctors till the end of the year and also provide monetary incentives to all the healthcare workers directly dealing with Coronavirus patients.The incentive, to be paid for a period of three months initially, will be ₹10,000 per month for resident doctors, PGs and medical officers; ₹7,000 per month for nursing and paramedical staff, and ₹5,000 per month for drivers, sweepers and attendants.LG Sinha also granted extension up to 31st December, 2021 to faculty members, consultants, doctors working in SKIMs at Soura and Bemina and government medical colleges and health departments who were going to retire between May, 2021 and November, 2021.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jammu-and-kashmir-to-hire-retired-doctors-deploy-mbbs-students-for-covid-care-101620640398494.html

"I urge ULFA(I) commander-in-chief Paresh Baruah to abjure violence and come to the discussion table. Both the parties will have to come forward for peace talks," said the Assam chief minister.I urge ULFA – Independent commander-in-chief, Paresh Baruah to come forward for peace talks. Both the parties will have to come forward for peace talks: Assam CM Himanta Biswa Sarma pic.twitter.com/bysNTgPsQhFormed in 1979 with the aim of creating a sovereign Assam, the United Liberation Front of Asom (ULFA) is the biggest militant outfit in Assam, seeking to establish an independent state for its indigenous people with armed conflict. Although banned by the Indian government in 1990 citing terrorist threat, the organisation had clearly marked its 'military' and 'political' wings, with Paresh Baruah heading the former as 'commander-in-chief'. A faction led by former ULFA chairman Arabinda Rajkhowa joined the peace process in 2011, but Baruah who renamed his faction as ULFA (Independent) has rebuffed all offers of talks to date.Also Read: ULFA-I chief Paresh Baruah says talks possible only on sovereigntyLast month, the banned outfit abducted three employees of the Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) from its Lakwa oil rig in the Sivasagar district along the Assam-Nagaland border. Following this, security forces ramped up their counter-insurgency operations, killing a top ULFA(I) commander and arresting one of his aides, thwarting the outfit's plan to carry out more such "high-profile kidnappings". Two of the abducted employees have been rescued since, while the search is on for the third.Also Read: Assam Police gun down ULFA-I commander, nab his aidePolice have arrested over a dozen persons in connection with the Sivasagar incident, including an Assam Police constable who was among the five persons who abducted the ONGC employees.

Although Baruah had said, in a telephonic interview to a local Assamese news channel in Guwahati last year, that the ULFA(I) would only join talks with the Centre if sovereignty is the main agenda, it remains to be seen how Assam chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma's new appeal is responded to, considering the banned outfit's stated 'one-point agenda'.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/assam-cm-urges-ulfa-i-chief-paresh-baruah-to-abjure-violence-join-peace-talks-101620637043064.html

They have been served notice under Section 160 of the CrPC and asked to appear at the CID headquarters on Tuesday.Last week, the investigating officer of the Mathabhanga police station was questioned by the sleuths of the West Bengal CID which is probing the deaths of five persons in firing by the CISF personnel during fourth phase of assembly election.A special investigating team (SIT) under DIG CID Kalyan Mukhopadhyay has been formed to carry out the investigation in the case.The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), meanwhile, called it politically motivated. "The CID's action is politically motivated. They have no right to summon CISF personnel," BJP general secretary, Kailash Vijayvargiya said. Party leader Suvendu Adhikari, who defeated Mamata Banerjee in Nandigram, said the CID is doing it on the directions of Mamata Banerjee.A day after taking oath as chief minister for the third consecutive term, Mamata Banerjee said on May 6 that her government will provide jobs of home guard to one family member each of all five persons killed in Sitalkuchi.The five people were killed at Sitalkuchi in two separate incidents on April 10. In the first incident, an 18-year-old first-time voter was shot dead by miscreants, while in the other central forces shot dead four people allegedly in self-defence.The incident had drawn protests and criticism from the ruling Trinamool Congress (TMC). The TMC held demonstrations across the state to protest the firing incident. Several TMC activists wore black badges and demanded the resignation of Union home minister Amit Shah.The Election Commission, however, had said that that the security forces had to open fire in self-defence. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) had referred to the firing incident multiple times to issue veiled threats against the TMC during the poll campaign.The Superintendent of Police of Cooch Behar Debasish Dhar was suspended after the incident.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/west-bengal-cid-probing-sitalkuchi-violence-serves-notice-to-6-cisf-officials-101620639235613.html

So, the vaccination drive for those in 18-45 will be prioritised".He had said the state government would initiate steps to ensure the availability of enough vaccines and take the matter up with the Centre.Kerala high court had also sought information from the Centre last week on the time frame in which the state government would get its share of vaccines.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/35-lakh-doses-of-covishield-vaccine-reach-kochi-from-pune-101620638383408.html
10-05-2021||India||NCP calls for 'one nation, one policy' to tackle Covid-19||The ruling NCP and Congress in Maharashtra on Monday hit out at the Centre over its handling of the Covid-19 situation in the country and called for "one nation, one policy" to fight the pandemic.State Minority Affairs Minister and NCP leader Nawab Malik also demanded that the Narendra Modi government convene an all-party meeting to chalk out the policy."The coronavirus cannot be eradicated only through advertisements at a time when there is a need to work out 'one nation, one policy' considering the current Covid-19 situation in the country," a statement said quoting Malik.He claimed the situation in Uttar Pradesh and Bihar was such that the last rites of Covid-19 victims were being performed in rivers instead of crematoriums."The Covid-19 pandemic cannot be tackled until there is one policy for the country. The Modi government should call an all-party meeting to decide the policy," he said.There is no doubt in anyone's mind that "the Centre is not able to handle the Covid-19 situation," he claimed.Malik also referred to the constitution of a 12-member National Task Force of top medical experts by the Supreme Court to formulate a methodology for oxygen allocation to states and Union Territories and to facilitate a public health response to the pandemic."The Centre is not carrying out works which it is supposed to. So, these are being carried out by court orders. This means the (central) government is falling short of discharging its duty," the NCP leader alleged.Maharashtra Revenue Minister and senior Congress leader Balasaheb Thorat targeted the Centre over its vaccination programme, saying it has unfortunately been proved that the Modi government "does not have" any proper policy and planning to inoculate people."The Centre earlier talked about successfully tackling the first wave (of COVID-19)...(but) the way elections were held, the way Kumbh Mela was organised...the entire country is suffering consequences of the same," Thorat told reporters here."The central government, its leadership, Prime Minister Narendra Modi ji are completely responsible for it, he claimed.The SC had to intervene and form the task force, Thorat noted, and asked what exactly was the Centre doing."It is being seen that it (the Centre) is not serious about anything," he claimed.Thorat also claimed that adequate number of vaccine doses were not being made available to states to inoculate people in the age group of 18 to 44 years.He charged the Centre with not giving permission to foreign players willing to provide vaccines to India.Thorat also demanded that the Centre allow states to develop their own apps for people to register for vaccination.The Shiv Sena, which shares power in Maharashtra with the NCP and Congress, also hit out at the Centre, saying the SC took the step of forming the task force considering the Covid-19 situation, but "those ruling the country are engaged in politics".They were busy in appointing chief minister of Assam (after the recently held Assembly polls) and "in conspiring" to not let the Trinamool Congress-led government in West Bengal do its work, an editorial in the Sena mouthpiece 'Saamana' alleged without naming the BJP or its leaders."At such a time, what should the people, who are about to die, do? Who is their saviour?" it asked.The Supreme Court's heart melted and it formed the national task force of 12 experts, the editorial noted."This committee should now pump life into the collapsed health care system," it said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ncp-calls-for-one-nation-one-policy-to-tackle-covid19-101620637397589.html

The state unit of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) claimed that the wedding was that of Markam's nephew where all Covid-19 protocols were violated.BJP's state vice president Lata Usendi even claimed that Markam was also present at the wedding. The screenshots from the video, posted on Twitter by news agency ANI, show a large number of people roaming around freely at the ceremony.The Congress MLA, however, rubbished all the allegations. "Lata Usendi has alleged that I got my nephew married off like that. She can look at my lineage. Everyone is connected to everyone in villages, it's not right to call everyone my nephew. If Covid norms are violated, the administration can take action," ANI quoted Markam as saying.Chhattisgarh is among the states which account for 82.89 per cent of India's total active cases, according to Union health ministry. The state's Covid-19 count rose to 8,51,476 on Sunday with the addition of 9,120 cases, while the death toll went up by 189 to 10,570, according to an official quoted by news agency PTI.The number of active cases in the state stands at 1,26,547, the official said.The worst-hit Raipur and Durg districts, which were recording high numbers of cases earlier, saw 392 and 294 cases on Sunday respectively.Raigarh recorded 687 new cases, Balodabazar 635 and Janjgir-Champa 600, among other districts.The state government has announced weekend lockdown while earlier allowing district collectors to extend local lockdowns till May 15.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-protocol-broken-by-chhattisgarh-congress-chief-claims-bjp-mohan-markam-denies-charges-101620637152396.html

As healthcare is very poor in the area, we refer the mild and the serious cases to government medical college at Nagpur,” says Rajesh Thakare, a social worker from Ramtek village.Private and government hospitals in rural Nagpur have a combined capacity of 2,100 Covid beds at a time when over 2,000 new cases and 25 deaths are being reported daily in the area as per official health bulletins, overwhelming the rural infrastructure.Dr Ratan Roy, a well-known physician from Kamptee blames lack of awareness among the rural population as the major problem.“If a patient tests positive, they start fighting and allege that the reports are false and we are forcefully trying to send patients to Covid care centres and home quarantine,” says Dr Roy.Their ignorance is also behind the refusal to adhere to Covid-19 appropriate behaviour and submit to timely testing apart from the inability to identify symptoms of the disease, which makes timely treatment difficult.Divisional commissioner Dr Sanjiv Kumar points out that unlike the behaviour seen during the complete lockdown in the first wave of the disease, people are now congregating in violation of the restrictions and behaving as if the Coronavirus is no longer a threat. “In rural Nagpur, people can be easily spotted in crowded areas without masks or face coverings,” he said.Kumar however says the situation has improved with the scarcity of hospital beds and oxygen witnessed till last week easing out a bit. “...Now the situation has improved, and we are trying hard to accommodate almost all patients with medicines and oxygen,” he said.The chief executive officer (CEO) of Nagpur Zilla Parishad, Yogesh Kumbhejkar claimed the district body had tried to ramp up the health infrastructure and recruited nurses on contract basis. The administration was also trying to give a leg-up to the vaccination drive. Besides, ASHA workers were asked to monitor Covid patients under home isolation.Officials believe the second wave of the disease built up slowly this year with 1,793 positive cases and 51 deaths registered in the district in January at 7.66% monthly positivity rate and 2.84% case fatality rate (CFR). The monthly positivity rate and the CFR further dropped to 1.16 and 5.07% respectively in February, leading to lowering of the guard.In March, positive cases suddenly jumped to 19,077 with 241 deaths at 1.26% CFR and 16.49% test positivity rate (TPR), indicating a high rate of infection among those tested. The floodgates well and truly opened up in April with 50,447 positive cases and 549 deaths at 24.89% TPR and 1.29% CFR.Nagpur district collector Ravindra Thakre says increased testing, social gatherings such as weddings, gram panchayat elections and non compliance to containment measures such social distancing and wearing of masks were among the chief reasons for the unprecedented Covid spike seen in Nagpur.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid19-second-wave-overwhelms-nagpur-spills-over-to-rural-areas-101620637038551.html

Speaking to reporters after the ceremony in Kolkata, Dhankhar said, "Retributive violence, acts of arson, loot now have graduated to intimidation and extortion. This is worrisome," news agency ANI reported."We are in a deep crisis in the state," Dhankhar also said while referring to the alleged violence in which at least 16 people from various political parties were reportedly killed since May 2. The death toll was announced by Banerjee on May 6.The governor who has been an old rival and a vocal critic of Banerjee, also announced that he would visit the violence-affected areas and he has informed the state government about the same. "As part of my constitutional duty, I've decided to visit affected parts of the state and asked the government to make arrangements." "Unfortunately, their response hasn't been very responsive," Dhankhar added.Dhankhar then said that he will go ahead with the visit and make arrangements by himself in the coming days.Further criticising Banerjee, Dhankhar said that people are being made to pay with their lives for exercising their franchise in the recently concluded assembly elections. "If your vote becomes a cause of your death or property destruction, if it leads to arson, then that signals the end of democracy," he said.Taking a swipe at Banerjee's earlier statement in which she claimed that West Bengal is peaceful and there is no violence, Dhankhar said, "I expect the state government to engage in soul searching, address grim ground reality and book the culprits who have chosen to tarnish our democratic fabric."Clashes were reported from several places in Bengal following the declaration of assembly election results on May 2. In the recently concluded assembly elections, Trinamool Congress secured a thumping majority by securing 213 of the 292 assembly seats.However, Banerjee herself lost from Nandigram, a hotbed of Bengal politics. She was defeated by TMC's former leader and now in Bharatiya Janata Party, Suvendu Adhikari.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/soulsearching-needed-says-governor-after-mamata-claims-bengal-is-peaceful-101620635637213.html

Highlighting the fact that Congress failed to dislodge the incumbent governments in Kerala and Assam, and drew a complete blank in West Bengal, Gandhi said that she will set up a small group to "candidly understand" the underlying causes behind the party's dismal performance. "These will yield uncomfortable lessons, but if we do not look the facts in the face, we will not draw the right lessons," she said in a CWC meeting.The crucial meeting of the Congress Working Committee (CWC) was convened to deliberate and introspect on the party's performance in the latest elections. The Congress fared poorly, drawing a blank in West Bengal and failing to win back power in Kerala and Assam, besides losing Puducherry. The party only came to power with the help of its ally -- the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) -- in Tamil Nadu. "To say that we are deeply disappointed is to make an understatement," Sonia Gandhi noted while addressing the crucial meeting of the top Congress body.The Congress chief also raised the matter of electing a new party president. "When we met on January 22, we had decided that the process for electing a Congress president would be completed by end-June. The election authority chairperson, Mr. Madhusudan Mistri, has prepared a schedule. Mr. Venugopal will read it out to you after our discussion on Covid-19 and the election results," she said.The chief ministers of the grand old party were invited to speak first on the Covid-19 situation. Following their address, general secretaries for the aforementioned states -- Jitender Singh for Assam, Tariq Anwar for Kerala, Dinesh Gundurao (in-charge of Tamil Nadu and Puducherry), and Jitin Prasada for West Bengal - were then invited to make their presentations."I expect them to brief us very frankly on our performance in their respective states. We want them to tell us why we performed well below expectation. These results tell us clearly that we need to put our house in order," noted Sonia Gandhi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sonia-gandhi-says-congress-must-draw-uncomfortable-lessons-from-assembly-poll-results-101620633351313.html

The world's largest Covid-19 care centre admitted patients referred by 11 hospitals in Delhi, including All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Safdarjung, Medanta and Max Hospital.The facility is 1,700 feet long, 700 feet wide and has 200 enclosures with 50 beds each. Today, the facility has grown into a 500-bed centre with oxygen support for patients suffering from Covid-19.During the first wave of the pandemic, between June and February 2021, the SPCCC admitted 12,057 patients and treated them under its care. By the time the centre was shut, in late February, when cases started dipping, as many as 11,657 people were cured of the virus and discharged, while 338 patients were referred to other hospitals.While the Delhi government provides administrative support, the ITBP is operating the centre with volunteers from the religious sect of Radha Soami Beas, who help them in its day-to-day functioning.Their volunteers have been working round-the-clock and tirelessly to provide free meals to not just the patients but also the doctors, paramedics, healthcare workers, ITBP personnel at the facility and the frontline workers.“On a daily basis 250 volunteers are preparing four meals a day – from Karra early in the morning, to breakfast, lunch, the evening tea and dinner – for every soul inside the Covid care centre,” said an office-bearer of the Radha Soami Satsang Beas in Chhatarpur on Monday.Between March and August 2020, the organisation had sent 135,000 food packets for Covid-19 patients and their caregivers, he informed, adding that the Satsang runs on charity and donations by individuals.ITBP once again proactively formulated its Covid-19 management strategies and under the guidance of ITBP director general SS Deswal took additional steps to contain the situation and help the healthcare system fight with the second wave of the deadly infection in the country.The Chhawla camp started functioning as a major covid care arrangement for ITBP in the national capital region on April 14. It initially began with 50 beds, some with oxygen support. The serving and retired ITBP personnel, their family members and persons from other CAPFs, CPOs and other sister organisations are being treated at the facility.Till Sunday, this centre had admitted 147 patients out of which 75 were discharged after treatment while at least 59 patients are under treatment at the moment.When the second wave of the coronavirus struck the country, the ITBP pressed into action and reopened the Chhatarpur centre on April 22 this year with 500 oxygenated beds. Till Monday, the Chhatarpur centre admitted 1,037 patients and discharged 504 of them.This centre is proving to be a great relief to the Delhi Covid19 patient care management which is providing uninterrupted oxygen to the patients and treating them with all possible medical aid.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/from-himvir-to-corona-warrriors-itbp-shows-the-way-101620631815984.html

10-05-2021||India||Stayed indoors for over a year, still caught Covid-19: Taslima Nasreen mentions her 'misfortune'||Taslima Nasreen, the Bangladeshi-Swedish writer of acclaim beyond borders, said on Sunday that she contracted the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) despite remaining indoors for over a year. Sharing details of her "mishap", the activist said that during her time at home, her only companion was an indoor cat and she did not let anyone enter her home. Yet, much to her surprise, Nasrin managed to contract Covid-19. "Wish I knew how I caught it," the writer said, lamenting her fate.i haven't stepped out of my home for more than a year. Didn't allow anyone to enter my home. i was alone with a cat. And then i caught covid-19. Wish i knew how i caught it. ☹️The author, who has fought several shades of religious fundamentalism and oppression during her lifetime, said that she was vexed by this new viral threat. In a detailed Facebook post in Bengali, the writer narrated, "Misfortune had always found its way with me. I have been at home alone, with only a cat as my companion, since March last year. Never went out, never let anyone enter my home either. Did all the cooking and cleaning myself as well. Did it come of any use? Not at all. The virus still found me." She added, "Yes, I only went out for one hour, that too over two months ago, to take the first shot of the Covid-19 vaccine, which perhaps saved my life this time."আমি চিরকালই বড় দুর্ভাগা। এই যে গত বছরের মার্চ মাস থেকে একা আছি ঘরে, একখানা ইন্ডোর ক্যাট সঙ্গী, কোথাও এক পা বেরোলাম না,..."Misfortune had always found its way with me. If I start listing everything that has happened with me, all those things which weren't supposed to, then the list would be so long no one would find an end to it! For now, let Covid-19 be the only tragedy," the writer said."However", Taslima Nasreen continued, "To call it a tragedy is probably not accurate, because I'm on my way to recovery. Instead, I'm thinking about the thousands of people who couldn't recover! The people who passed away for lack of life-saving oxygen! Let all our sadness and tragedy be reserved for them."Although originally hailing from Bangladesh, Taslima Nasreen currently resides in Delhi after facing religious extremism in her native country. But the writer continues to express concerns about the aggravating Covid-19 pandemic situation in Bangladesh. On Saturday, she tweeted photos of Bangladeshis thronging the streets despite the ongoing Covid-19 related advisories in places and asked how can shopping for Eid and going home for family get-togethers be more important than saving lives from the deadly virus."Bangladesh. Shopping for eid and going home for family get together are more important than saving lives from deadly virus. pic.twitter.com/bUhauaEkrAHowever, despite the adverse situation, Nasreen noted that at least there's no "stigma" any longer over contracting Covid-19. "Earlier, people used to hide the fact that they had contracted Covid, because there was a certain stigma attached to it like for AIDS, perhaps. Society would ostracise them. Since scores of people have been down with Covid-19 this past year, that stigma no longer exists!" she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/stayed-indoors-for-over-a-year-still-caught-covid-19-taslima-nasreen-cat-coronavirus-mentions-misfortune-101620623458296.html

10-05-2021||India||Covid-19 cases dip from peak, calls for shutdown rise||Calls grew for India to impose a nationwide lockdown as new coronavirus cases and deaths held close to record highs on Monday, increasing pressure on the government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi.The 366,161 new infections and 3,754 deaths reported by the health ministry were off a little from recent peaks, taking India's tally to 22.66 million with 246,116 deaths. As many hospitals grapple with an acute shortage of oxygen and beds while morgues and crematoriums overflow, experts have said India's actual figures could be far higher than reported.Sunday's 1.47 million tests for Covid-19 were this month's lowest yet, data from the state-run Indian Council of Medical Research showed. The figure compared with a daily average of 1.7 million for the first eight days of May.The number of positive results from the tests was not immediately clear, however.Many states have imposed strict lockdowns over the last month while others have placed curbs on movement and shut cinemas, restaurants, pubs and shopping malls.But pressure is mounting on Modi to announce a nationwide lockdown as he did during the first wave of infections last year.He is battling criticism for allowing huge gatherings at a religious festival and holding large election rallies during the past two months even as cases surged."A failure of governance of epic and historic proportions," Vipin Narang, a political science professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in the United States, said on Twitter.Sonia Gandhi, the chief of the main opposition Congress party, blamed the government for abdicating its responsibility by leaving vaccinations to states, Reuters partner ANI said on Twitter.Delhi's health minister said the city was running out of vaccines, with just three to four days of supplies remaining of AstraZeneca's vaccine, made by the Serum Institute of India and branded Covishield, the NDTV news channel reported.By Sunday, the world's largest vaccine-producing nation had fully vaccinated just over 34.3 million, or only 2.5%, of its population of about 1.35 billion, government data shows. SHUT DOWN NEEDEDOn Sunday, top White House coronavirus adviser Dr. Anthony Fauci said he had advised Indian authorities they needed to shut down."You’ve got to shut down," Fauci said on ABC's "This Week" television show. "I believe several of the Indian states have already done that, but you need to break the chain of transmission. And one of the ways to do that is to shut down."The Indian Medical Association (IMA) has also called for a "complete, well-planned, pre-announced" lockdown.New Delhi, the capital, entered a fourth week of lockdown, with tougher curbs such as the shutdown of the suburban rail network, while residents scrambled for scarce hospital beds and oxygen supplies."This is not the time to be lenient," Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal said on Sunday."This phase is so tough, this wave is so dangerous, so many people are dying...the priority at this hour is to save lives," he said in a televised address.Late on Sunday, the northern state of Uttarakhand said it would impose curfew from Tuesday until May 18, just days after mass religious gatherings held in the state became virus super spreading events.Shops selling essential food items will stay open for some hours in the morning, while malls, gyms, theatres, bars and liquor shops are among the enterprises that will be shut, the government said.Measures announced by India's central bank last week for relief to lenders and borrowers during the new devastating wave of infections will only delay the stress for financial institutions, Fitch Ratings said.Fitch said disruptions could persist longer and spread further than its baseline case scenario, especially in case of more regional lockdowns or one nationwide, adding that a drop in April-May activity would delay recovery.Organisers of the popular and lucrative Indian Premier League (IPL) cricket tournament conceded the remaining games would have to be played overseas after having suspended the contest over the virus this month.Global support, in the form of oxygen cylinders and concentrators, ventilators and other medical gear, has poured in.On Monday, U.S. company Eli Lilly and Co said it signed licensing deals with Indian drugmakers, such as Cipla Ltd, Lupin and Sun Pharma to make and sell its arthritis drug baricitinib for the treatment of Covid-19 patients.India's drug regulator has approved the drug for restricted emergency use in combination with remdesivir for hospitalised adult sufferers requiring oxygen.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid19-cases-dip-from-peak-calls-for-shutdown-rise-101620630466239.html
10-05-2021||India||Outpouring of support from US for India, Covid-19 help touches USD half a billion||Less than a fortnight after President Joe Biden in his conversation with Prime Minister Narendra Modi pledged his country’s steadfast support for the people of India, America has responded with an unprecedented financial assistance worth nearly USD half a billion.Biden spoke at length with Modi last month and conveyed solidarity with India in its fight against the viral disease. He assured the prime minister that the US and India will work closely together in the fight against Covid-19."Just as India sent assistance to the United States as our hospitals were strained early in the pandemic, we are determined to help India in its time of need," Biden had said in a tweet.Reflecting an overwhelming support for a "natural ally", the entire country not only the administration, but also the corporate sector which created a global task force, as well as Americans and Indian-Americans have opened their coffers for India.This half a billion dollars includes USD 100 million pledged by the Biden administration, USD 70 million by pharma major Pfizer and 450,000 Remdesivir doses, the governmental purchase price of each of which in the US is USD 390.Thousands of oxygen concentrators and plane loads of life saving drugs and health care equipment are flying off the United States for India almost every day.Several companies like Boeing and Mastercard have announced financial assistance worth USD 10 million each, Google has pledged USD 18 million, which the Global Task Force that comprises CEOs of top American companies have already pledged USD 30 million worth of life saving equipment.Describing it as a “Berlin Life Moment”, Mukesh Aghi of US India Strategic and Partnership Forum (USISPF), told PTI he expects the assistance to touch almost USD 1 billion by the end of the month. “It is emotional for the diaspora, almost everyone has someone who has been touched by COVID-19,” he said.Nisha Desai Biswal, president of US India Business Council (USIBC) said, “The outpouring of support from the United States over the past two weeks was a spontaneous mass mobilisation of support for the Indian people from across the America government, business community and diaspora community and the American people.”“It is unprecedented, and it reflects both the deep bonds between our two countries and the gratitude that Americans feel for the role India played in supporting the United States when we were experiencing our COVID surge last year,” she said.However, given the “speed and severity” that have overwhelmed the capacity of hospitals and local authorities, more assistance will be needed and for a sustained period of timescale of the pandemic, Biswal said.People of the country and the Diaspora too have come out in large numbers. Indian-American Vinod Khosla has committed USD 10 million, top corporate leader John T Chambers has promised USD 1 million.For the first time in its history, Sewa International has raised USD 15 million; American Association of Physicians of Indian Origin (AAPI) (USD 3.6 million), Indiaspora (USD 2.5) million and Jai Shetty has raised USD 4 million.“There has been overwhelming support and offers of assistance from the US Government, private sector, diaspora and the American public at large. In fact, in my interactions in recent days, the US interlocutors across the board ask me, ‘tell us what more we can do for India’”, India’s ambassador to the US Taranjit Singh Sandhu told PTI.“They recall with fondness the help India gave. These are reflective of strong partnership and close people to people ties between our both nations. We deeply appreciate these gestures. We will continue to engage with the US in our collective fight against the pandemic,” he said.Among other major financial contributions announced include Procter and Gamble (USD 6.7 million); Merck (USD 5 million), Walmart (USD 2 million), Salesforce (USD 2.4 million), and Caterpillar (USD 3.4 million). Companies like Deloittee have announced to 12,000 oxygen concentrators to India.While Microsoft is partnering with the US government in providing aid and oxygen, FedEx and UPS have taken up the mantle of taking care of the transportation of life saving health care equipment like oxygen cylinders, ventilators and oxygen concentrators to India.On Sunday, Indian-Americans from Tamil Nadu including eminent philanthropist M R Rangaswami, held a “Help Tamil Nadu Breathe” to raise USD 1.5 million in few hours.“This is an incredible outpouring of generosity, which people have come to expect from America. When the world has a crisis, beyond politics, beyond dispute America steps up,” Rangaswami said.“It is comforting to see US cargo jets with much needed medical supplies landing at the Delhi airport regularly,” said Karun Rishi, president of the USA-India Chambers of Commerce.Noting that the stakes are very high for the entire world, he said India’s success or failure to come out of this once in a century crisis will have a direct impact throughout the world.Echoing Biswal, Rishi said that more needs to be done.“The scale of assistance to India needs to increase and speeded up. To make some reasonable impact to tide over this crisis, India may need between USD 25-USD 50 billion in assistance in the form of vaccines, technology transfer, increasing vaccines and therapeutics manufacturing capacity, medical equipment and public health measures,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/outpouring-of-support-from-us-for-india-covid-help-touches-usd-half-a-billion-101620627988812.html

There is no one else in the family to perform the last rites and cremation, the court noted, highlighting that Natasha's brother Aakash is in isolation himself."In view of the circumstances elaborated here, and in the interest of justice, we are of the view that the release of the applicant is imperative in this hour of grief and personal loss and in the facts and circumstances of the case," the Delhi high court bench noted.The Delhi police did not resist the bail plea. However, Natasha has been directed to furnish a personal bond in the sum of ₹50,000 to the satisfaction of the jail superintendent and her phone number to the SHO special cell of the Delhi Police and the Rohtak Police, under whose jurisdiction the last rites of Mahavir Narwal are to be performed.Moreover, Natasha Narwal was also asked not to "tweet anything" and to maintain radio silence for the duration of her interim relief.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/natasha-narwal-jailed-activist-granted-interim-bail-after-father-dies-of-covid-101620628079392.html

Gagandeep Singh Bedi’s transfer is among the first bureaucratic reshuffle after the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) formed the new government. Bedi took charge on Sunday and will now be spearheading the Covid-19 control in Chennai which has the highest caseload in the state. When asked about his immediate focus, he said it would be to break the Covid chain in the city. “Our immediate and broad focus is to reduce the positivity rate,” he said. “We want to ensure good coordination between the local body and health department so that we make more oxygen beds available for people. Of course, we will follow other developments, but our first focus is tackling Covid.”Also Read | TN government urges industries to produce medical oxygen under CSR schemeBedi has been associated with disaster management. He is known for his work as collector of Cuddalore district that was ravaged after the Tsunami in 2004. He was also Cuddalore district monitoring officer for Covid-19. In the transfer order, Chief Secretary Irai Anbu said Bedi’s post will be equivalent in status and responsibilities to the cadre post of principal secretary-cum-commissioner.Prakash’s new posting is yet to be announced. He took over as civic chief in February 2019. Prakash and his team of young deputy commissioners from the health and revenue department are known for their work during the pandemic. They increased testing, introduced volunteers to help those in quarantine and put in place a system that has been brought back to address the second wave. Besides, Covid-19, under Prakash’s tenure, solid waste management was decentralised, and a new private operator was given the contract. The pedestrian plaza, which had been in the pipeline for several years, was completed last year. Since urban local body elections haven’t been conducted in the state since 2017, there is no elected council so Bedi also becomes de-facto special officer for the corporation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/focus-on-reducing-covid-positivity-rate-chennai-s-new-corporation-chief-101620623417521.html

They've got to get their resources, not only from within, but also from without."Calling for global cooperation, Fauci said, other countries also "need to chip in to be able to get either supply to the Indians to make their own vaccines or to get vaccines donated."Alos Read | ‘No doubt’ US has undercounted its Covid-19 deaths: Anthony FauciIndia is struggling with an unprecedented second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic with more than 400,000 cases being registered daily in the past few days. With hospitals swamped with patients, the healthcare system has also reached a breaking point. People are struggling to secure things like oximeters, key medicines as the sudden surge has led to an acute shortage of medical necessities.On Saturday, World Health Organization's chief scientist Soumya Swaminathan warned that a Covid-19 variant spreading in India is more contagious and maybe dodging vaccine protections, contributing to the country's explosive outbreakUS' top epidemiologist, 88-year-old Fauci is one of the leading global voices on coronavirus pandemic. He is currently serving as the director of the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.Speaking further on India's Covid-19 situation, Fauci said big companies should scale up manufacturing of Covid-19 vaccines in a way that India gets "literally hundreds of millions of doses."Speaking on ways that India can tackle the raging second wave of Covid-19 in which the daily number of covid-19 cases has soared as high as 400,000, Fauci said India should build makeshift hospitals like what China did a year ago. "You've got to get that. You can't have people out in the street not having a hospital bed," said the chief medical adviser to US President Joe Biden in an interview with ABC News.Calling India's situation "tragic" and said, "the oxygen situation is something that was really critical. I mean, to have people not have oxygen is really tragic."Further speaking, Fauci underlined the need for a countrywide lockdown to curb the spread of Covid-19. On May 1 as well, Fauci called for a complete lockdown as an immediate step to break the chain of transmission in the country."You've got to shut down. I believe several of the Indian states have already done that, but you need to break the chain of transmission. And one of the ways to do that is to shut down," said Fauci on Sunday.As of Sunday morning, that country has a caseload of 22,662,575 and the death toll stood at 246,116.

Aside from Remdesivir and tocilizumab, the company also offers antiviral drug favipiravir, used to treat patients with moderate to mild Covid-19.Last week, Cipla said it would be the local distribution partner for a Covid-19 antibody drug cocktail developed by Roche and Regeneron, after the therapy got emergency use approval from India's drug regulator.India has posted more than 400,000 daily coronavirus cases for the past four days, and its total infections have reached nearly 22.30 million, the second highest number of cases in the world after the United States.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cipla-to-make-sell-eli-lilly-s-baricitinib-for-covid-19-treatment-101620620896263.html

However, by December, India was the second largest manufacturer of PPE kits across the world, with 450,000 units being produced daily by over 1,100 manufacturers. “There are over a crore [10 million] units of PPEs being produced per month, these include all qualities, from spun bound to non-woven to fully certified suits,” said an industry expert on the condition of anonymity. As for N-95 masks, the country has gone from producing 2 million units per month to nearly 25-30 million units per month. There are currently 241 manufacturers of N95 masks in the country, and exports have been allowed. The only export ban to still be place in on melt blown fabric, an essential part of the N95 masks. “The manufacturers of melt blown fabric in India have increased from four to nearly 80,” said the above-mentioned industry expert.

10-05-2021||India||Greenpiece: The need to focus on indoor air||Irrespective of economic background, it is high time people start thinking about indoor air quality, because we spend so much time indoors now. We focus on outdoor air, but forget how toxic indoor air is-even in a fancy home. Why breathe in all that pollution?In most homes, people burn agarbattis or camphor. Both these intensify pollution with health impact. We think they purify the air -- a cultural construct. Today, science is telling us to stop it.Many people have taken to rugs all over their home. It’s a great dust vault. And dust is nothing but collection of chemical particles, many very toxic. We breathe those too.Sometimes, we use electric mosquito repellents-the particles stay on. Wood polish, some PVC materials and many other products might harm us silently. When we spend more time at home, we are increasing our exposure, and that of our children. Many use solid fuels, the source of some of the deadliest air pollution. Most of this impacts women and infants, reducing their live span.With working from home being the new normal, more people will have to spend time inside. If we want to protect ourselves, we must clean up the air inside. Some of this we can do ourselves.But we also need standards and government oversight around indoor products. We need an aggressive campaign for an urbanized Ujjwala model of clean fuel for the poor. But first of all, we must agree that indoor air pollution is also a big problem.(The writer is the founder and director of the Chintan Environmental Research and Action Group)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/greenpiece-the-need-to-focus-on-indoor-air-101620605506241.html

The development comes as the case tally in India surged to 22,662,092, with 366,528 new cases being reported on Sunday.Addressing a meeting to review the Covid-19 situation in the state, Rajasthan chief minister Ashok Gehlot stressed on the need to accelerate the pace of the vaccination drive to arrest the spread of the virus and reduce the fatality rate. “The state will consider importing Covid-19 vaccine to ensure that the residents of Rajasthan are vaccinated at the earliest,” he said at the meeting held on Saturday.Rajasthan recorded 17,921 Covid-19 cases and 159 deaths on Sunday that pushed the infection tally to 756,707 and toll to 5,665, according to the HT dashboard.Over 13.9 million people, including around 275,000 between 18 and 44 years, have received the first and second dose of the vaccines in Rajasthan so far. The state, which has a population of around 7.50 crore, requires additional 6.50 crore vaccines (for the first dose).Also read | 1.8mn in 18-44 yrs age group have received first jab, says govt dataThe Maharashtra government, too, has started talks with foreign vaccine manufacturers to boost the speed of the inoculation drive in the 18-44 category. However, clearances from the Centre continue to remain a hurdle for the government to procure stock from outside the country, said officials.On Sunday, state health minister Rajesh Tope said:. “Currently our vaccination drive is going on at a slow pace because vaccines are not being made available. Chief minister has clearly said that Maharashtra has the potential to purchase 120 million doses in one go, but availability is the main issue. The Centre must intervene in this matter and make vaccine doses available for Maharashtra. The vaccination of 18-44 category is crucial as the age group steps out of their homes. If the government gives permission, we can procure Sputnik or other foreign vaccines for the citizens of our state. There are several approvals needed from Centre,” Tope said.Tope earlier revealed that the state government is currently in talks with the Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF), Russia’s sovereign wealth fund that helped finance vaccine Sputnik V, to purchase doses. “We are trying to get the stock available with them,” Tope said on May 7.Maharashtra recorded 572 Covid-19 fatalities and 48,401 fresh cases on Sunday that pushed the death toll to 75,849 and the infection tally to 5,101,737, according to the HT dashboard.

The former is developed by Oxford University-AstraZeneca and is being manufactured in India by Serum Institute of India, while the latter is an indigenous shot, developed by Hyderabad-based Bharat Biotech International Limited in collaboration with the Indian Council of Medical Research.

10-05-2021||India||Government suspends key nationwide surveys amid raging Covid-19 2nd wave||The Union government has suspended work on four key surveys on migrants, domestic workers, and jobs created by the transport sector and professionals because of the deadly second wave of the pandemic, possibly delaying a national employment policy based on these surveys.With lockdowns and curfews being imposed across the country, surveyors on the field will find it difficult to visit families, offices and worksites, two government officials said, adding that the management of the pandemic has become a top priority now, and the surveys will restart once the situation improves.The nationwide surveys, designed and executed by the labour bureau in consultation with an expert committee, may also be reworked as the explosive surge in infections this year has changed the ground realities since the surveys were conceived.The delay may, however, have an adverse impact on the proposed national employment policy that the government was mulling. The four labour codes already passed by Parliament, and the national jobs and social economic survey results were expected to be the base of such a policy.“We have put the four surveys on hold as the surging covid-19 makes it almost impossible to do the household surveys,” said DPS Negi, director-general of labour bureau.“We are talking to our expert committee on how to incorporate the new realities in these surveys. It’s a difficult situation, and sending our field workers to houses and offices will have a huge implication on their health and well-being. Second, no one will entertain surveyors at their homes during a second wave,” said Negi, who is also the chief labour commissioner (central).Also read | India Inc’s wait to vaccinate staff gets longerAccording to the Union labour ministry, the migrants’ survey will be the first such study of “the socioeconomic and working conditions of migrant workers” and shall “also assess the impact of Covid-19 on migrant workers”.The survey of domestic workers expects to capture the socio-economic condition, the job preference and impact of the pandemic on their economic status.While the transport sector survey was supposed to capture the jobs created by the industry, including by taxi aggregators, the one on professionals was supposed to capture the employment generation and potential of tens of thousands of professionals, including advocates, doctors and chartered accountants.The surveys were supposed to be released by November. On March 31, labour minister Santosh Gangwar said the surveys will “generate highly useful data for effective policymaking in the field of labour and employment”.The study of the labour market, including gig workers, will help the government formulate a comprehensive employment policy for both formal and informal segments and design social security and welfare measures. Besides, there has been a growing demand for a national policy on employment to formalize the large informal sector, implement social security for unorganised workers, and formulate welfare schemes for low-income households.Negi said the labour bureau is hopeful of restarting the process in a couple of months once the situation improves, allowing them to resume fieldwork. The surveys are crucial as they could provide a holistic picture of the employment market and the socioeconomic condition of migrants and other informal workers, who have drawn global attention following the massive reverse migration and job losses they faced after the national lockdown of 2020.The first wave of the Covid-19 pandemic pushed an estimated 230 million Indians to poverty, according to a survey by Azim Premji University. The survey suggested authorities focus on rural jobs and direct cash transfer to the poor. The second wave has, however, further strained the labour market.

10-05-2021||India||Covid-19: What you need to know today||I’ve mostly worked from office since March 2020, apart from a few weeks last April (and, of course, apart from Wednesdays when I work on the best weekend section across newspapers in India, HT Wknd, and prefer to do so from home). I kept the AC off in my room in the office; wore two masks; used a sanitiser as often as I could (I used to do this even before the pandemic, especially after shaking hands, even if the person with whom I’d shaken hands was still in the room); avoided crowded conference rooms (even in January and February when everyone else seemed to think they were fine); and showered the minute I returned home. I must have taken an RT-PCR test more than a few times — once to travel, another time to meet with and interview the finance minister, and the rest of the times to make sure I was not infected after contact with someone who went on to test Covid-positive. I was careful. I knew the science.But I also knew that the probability was always against me.On the night of April 17, a Saturday, I was working in the study when I realised I’d left something I needed in the bedroom upstairs — and I found that I just couldn’t walk up the stairs.The next morning, I woke up with fever, and isolated immediately. But I could smell, my throat was fine, and I wasn’t experiencing any difficulty breathing.Monday was worse, but I managed to get tested — a technician came home and took a sample. It was a bad time to fall ill. Maybe it was because my fever was rising, but I remember that as the day when things started going south in Delhi and some other parts of India. Through the day, I received calls from people seeking help. We (it was mostly my colleagues) managed to help some; for others, we could do nothing. The calls continued through the night as my fever continued to rise (despite double strength Tylenol). When I last checked it just before dropping off, it was close to 103 degrees.On Tuesday, when I woke up, I realised I’d lost my sense of smell. By then, I’d acquired a cough (a wet one, strangely enough, but this is not entirely unknown among Covid patients). The results, which came in a few hours later, confirmed that I was indeed Covid-positive. A colleague put me in touch with a doctor for a virtual consultation. He recommended a blood test (to check base levels, so that a subsequent test could highlight so-called inflammatory markers that would guide the course of treatment). I had anticipated this and already booked a test with a lab (they assured me a phlebotomist would come by later that evening to draw a sample).The doctor also sent me a prescription on WhatsApp; the company doctor reviewed the prescription and said he’d feel more comfortable if I took a dose of steroids in addition. The medicines were not available in my neighbourhood, but another colleague found them for me (in Faridabad). Eventually, I chose to have favipiravir (a drug found effective in China in early 2020, but which subsequent tests found largely ineffective; I decided to take it because it is an antiviral that is believed to act against a wide variety of RNA viruses, and the one that causes Covid-19 is an RNA virus), the antibiotics (I did have a very bad throat, the kind for which my GP loves prescribing antibiotics, although I know this isn’t good practice), the fever medication, and the vitamins (which couldn’t hurt). I skipped the ivermectin (I know this doesn’t work at all) and the steroids.By Wednesday, my fever was below 100 and my throat felt a little better. Calls from people seeking help — the utter sense of despair from hearing grown men cry on the phone, amplified by one’s own inability to help — continued through the day; Delhi was short of tests, medicines, oxygen, hospital beds, and ventilators. People wanted help with remdesivir and plasma. Both were being prescribed indiscriminately by doctors. The first works only in early stages of infection , and on people who need supplemental oxygen (not mechanical ventilation). The second doesn’t work, usually — it is next to impossible to find plasma with the required concentration of antibodies. Oxygen, of course, helped, but there wasn’t enough of it to be had in Delhi. The few people I’d helped find hospital beds, for themselves and theirs, sent back messages: some were better, others had passed on to the great beyond.I was lucky. The fact that I had taken a first dose of the vaccine, I believe, helped me (I cannot take the second dose for at least two months now). I continued to write this column through my brief illness, but I did little else. By Friday, the fever had broken. By Monday, I was back at work (although I was still in isolation in my study).My blood oxygen level never went below 98 the entire time. The two blood tests I took, a week apart (Day 1 and Day 8), came back with normal and almost identical readings.Three weeks on, I am almost back to normal, although I am still very tired, and have persistent body ache and joint pain. But I plan to resume running sometime this week.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid19what-you-need-to-know-today-101620594650261.html

10-05-2021||India||Himanta Biswa Sarma’s political acumen, oratory played key role in BJP’s Assam win||Ever since he joined the Tarun Gogoi-led Congress government in 2001 as a minister of state after his first electoral victory, Himanta Biswa Sarma had always been seen by many as someone who would reach the chief minister’s chair in due course. On Sunday, that expectation came true as Sarma pipped incumbent Sarbananda Sonowal to be unanimously selected as the legislature party leader of BJP, which secured 60 seats in the recently concluded assembly polls to return to power in Assam for a second consecutive term. As a seasoned politician, Sarma never made his ambitions for the top post public. But ever since he quit the Congress cabinet of Gogoi in 2015 after differences with the CM promoting his son Gaurav, the perception was strong that he joined the BJP in order to fulfil his political goals. Sonowal led the BJP to an electoral victory, but the high command had to give the CM’s chair to Sarma as he was the one who galvanized mass support for the party and also had the support of two-third of the new BJP legislators. The 52-year-old has been a key figure in Assam politics for two decades now. But Sarma, who joined the BJP six years ago, has had a meteoric rise in the saffron party and his influence is not restricted to Assam but seen across the region. Sarma’s political acumen and oratory played a key role in BJP winning 60 of the total 126 seats in 2016 and forming the party’s first government in Assam with alliance partners Asom Gana Parishad and Bodoland Peoples’ Front. Despite being new to the party, Sarma was given four crucial departments-health, education, finance and public works-in the Sonowal cabinet. As convener of North East Democratic Alliance (NEDA), a BJP-led front of anti-Congress parties in northeast, Sarma shares a close rapport with senior politicians in all seven states of the region. His role was crucial in BJP forming governments in Arunachal Pradesh, Manipur and Tripura and becoming part of the ruling coalition in Nagaland and Meghalaya. Sarma hasn’t had a clean slate and there were accusations about his involvement in the Louis Berger scam and the Sharada Group ponzi scheme. But he has been able to override them and play a key role in the BJP, a party that once targeted him on the accusations. Over the past five years, Sarma has made a mark beyond the region and become a known face across the country---a rarity for politicians from the northeast. He is consulted by the BJP leadership for any issue concerning Assam and the region and most often than not his suggestions are accepted. Due to his position in the Assam cabinet and in NEDA, Sarma’s stature grew to such extent that he was sometimes mistaken by some from outside the region as the CM instead of Sonowal. An astute politician, Sarma had never tried to compete with Sonowal for the top post and there is a cordial relationship between the two, at least in public. In 2019 ahead of the general elections, Sarma had indicated his intentions to leave state politics and shift base to New Delhi where he could play a bigger role. But the BJP leadership decided against it. However, in a rare gesture, then BJP president Amit Shah issued a statement that the party needed Sarma’s services in the poll campaign in northeast and could not afford to have him restricted to just one seat. Sarma has been representing the Jalukbari seat continuously since 2001 and this time too that party gave him ticket from the seat. With the BJP high command not projecting a CM face for this election, rumours were abound that Sarma could be given that role. Sarma has been the brain behind most of the social welfare schemes on the Sonowal government like ₹830 per month to 2.2 million households, cash incentives and grants to various sections of society. But his role as health minister in the past year, when he supervised setting up of large Covid care centres, boosting infrastructure at hospitals and personally visiting quarantine centres to keep tab on care being provided to those infected have earned him headlines as well as admiration even from his critics. For this election, Sarma specifically targeted the Congress and its alliance partner All India United Democratic Front (AIUDF), the two main opposition parties in Assam which formed a grand alliance along with former BJP ally Bodoland Peoples Front. Terming AIUDF as an important factor in this election, Sarma has accused its chief, perfume baron and Lok Sabha MP Badruddin Ajmal, as being the enemy of Assam and Assamese culture. He has openly stated that BJP doesn’t need votes of ‘Miyas’ (Bengali speaking Muslims from erstwhile East Pakistan). Besides politics and governance, Sarma is interested in sports and is an author. He has penned four books till date, the latest released in February ahead of the assembly polls. He is the president of Badminton Association of India (BAI). Sarma’s wife Riniki Bhuyan Sarma is the chairperson and managing director of Pride East Entertainment that owns several TV channels, a daily newspaper and magazine. The couple has a son and daughter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/himanta-biswa-sarma-s-political-acumen-oratory-played-key-role-in-bjp-s-assam-win-101620590415383.html

The governor will administer him the oath of office on Monday, people aware of the developments said.The decision to pick Sarma as the Assam CM was taken at the first legislature party meeting of the 60 newly elected MLAs of the BJP held at the state assembly after days of backroom lobbying in Guwahati and official meetings in Delhi following the announcement of assembly poll results on May 2.Sarma’s name as the BJP’s legislature party leader was announced by Union agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar who, along with the party’s national general secretary Arun Singh, was the central observer for the meeting.“I asked other MLAs if they had any other names in mind. No other name was suggested. Since the name of Sarma, a senior minister in our state government was the only one that was proposed, he is unanimously chosen as the legislature party leader,” Tomar said after the meeting.Sarma’s name for the post was proposed by Sonowal and seconded by BJP state president Ranjeet Kumar Dass. It was also supported by newly elected MLA from Halflong, Nandita Golosa.Also read | Assam's new cabinet to take oath at noon tomorrow, says Himanta Biswa SarmaOn Saturday, the two main claimants to the top post, Sonowal and senior minister Sarma, were summoned by the party leadership to Delhi, where they held several rounds of meetings with BJP national president JP Nadda and others. Both leaders returned to Guwahati late on Saturday night in the same flight.BJP office bearers in the know of the developments said the leadership decided in Sarma’s favour after the discussions in the Capital. Sonowal, who was part of the first Narendra Modi government at the Centre, is likely to be accommodated in the Union Cabinet again at a later date, they said on condition of anonymity.“With fragrance of Assam in my heart and love of my wonderful people in my veins, I offer my deepest gratitude to you all. I would have not been what I am had it not been for your pious faith in me. On this day, I vow to work with and for each one of you with greater passion,” Sarma tweeted after the formal announcement on Sunday.At the BJP legislature party meeting, Sarma praised Sonowal for proposing his name for the CM post and thanked him for giving him several important responsibilities that allowed him to work for the people of Assam.“I am confident Sarma will lead the state efficiently. I am also sure that with his long political expertise, in the coming days, he will be able to make Assam one of the leading states in India,” Sonowal said at the meeting.Both Sarma and Sonowal later went together to the Raj Bhawan where the former formally staked his claim to form the next government. The oath-taking ceremony will be held at noon on Monday in which few ministers from allies Asom Gana Parishad and United Peoples’ Party Liberal are also expected to be sworn in, people aware of the developments said.“Many congratulations to Himanta Biswa Sarma on being elected as the next chief minister of Assam. Our only vision must be to work in tandem to make Assam one of the most developed states in India,” Assam Congress president Ripun Bora tweeted.Earlier on Sunday morning, Sonowal went to the Raj Bhawan, where he submitted his resignation to the governor before proceeding with Sarma in the same vehicle to take part in the meeting of the newly elected legislators.Sunday’s development marks a major landmark in Sarma’s sharp rise within the BJP, a party which he joined in 2015 after parting ways with then Congress chief minister Tarun Gogoi, in whose cabinet he was a minister for three consecutive terms since 2001.Watch | BJP ends suspense, announces Assam CM name; Himanta Sarma gets top jobSarma played a crucial role in the BJP forming its first government in Assam in 2016 and was allotted four important ministries -- finance, health, education and public works department (PWD) -- in the Sonowal cabinet.As convener of NEDA, the conglomeration of anti-Congress regional parties in the Northeast, Sarma was also responsible for the BJP forming governments in Arunachal Pradesh, Manipur and Tripura, and becoming part of the ruling coalition in Nagaland and Meghalaya in the past few years.Despite criticism from some, Sarma earned mass support with the way he handled the Covid-19 crisis, visiting patients in hospitals, overseeing setting up of Covid care centres and ensuring proper care for those infected.He carried forward that goodwill during the assembly election campaign, addressing rallies in all parts of the state and conducting road shows where thousands turned up to watch him.Sarma also exercised influence in the selection of candidates and actively campaigned for most, ensuring another return to power for the BJP. People aware of the matter said he enjoys the support of at least 40 of the new MLAs, a big reason that tilted the balance in his favour for the CM’s post.“Sarma is the most aggressive voice of Hindutva in Assam politics. He helped in polarisation of votes in this election by targeting Badruddin Ajmal’s party All India United Democratic Front (AIUDF) and Congress for their poll tie-up. Sarma was also the one who conceptualised and implemented competitive populist schemes that helped the BJP reach out to all sections of voters,” said Akhil Ranjan Dutta, professor of political science, Gauhati University.“Sarma’s elevation to the CM’s post shows the BJP leadership is keeping an eye on the 2024 Lok Sabha polls. As convener of NEDA, he would play a crucial role in the BJP’s fortunes in Assam and all other states in the Northeast,” he added.The delay in the announcement of the CM’s name and formation of the next government despite a clear mandate at a time when the state is witnessing a rapid rise in new Covid-19 cases and deaths had led to criticism of the BJP by opposition parties.The Assam assembly has a total of 126 seats. While the BJP got 60 seat this time, same as its figure in 2016, its allies Asom Gana Parishad and United People’s Party Liberal (UPPL) won 9 and 6 seats, respectively, taking the alliance’s total to 75 seats.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/himanta-biswa-sarma-to-take-over-as-next-assam-chief-minister-101620589026467.html
10-05-2021||India||As jabs arrive, Karnataka set to vaccinate 18+ from today||The Karnataka government on Sunday said that it would open up vaccination for people between the age groups of 18-44 from Monday in public hospitals and medical college hospitals after it received fresh stocks. “Starting Monday, Covid-19 vaccination will be provided for citizens aged between 18 and 44 years at K C General Hospital, Jayanagar General Hospital, Sir C V Raman General Hospital, Government Medical Colleges, ESI Hospitals and NIMHANS in Bengaluru,” K Sudhakar, Karnataka’s minister for health, family welfare and medical education said in a statement. The number of vaccination centres would be increased as and when more vaccines are available, the minister added. All such centres providing vaccination for the 18-44 age group would have an exclusive session site earmarked for them, he said,adding the shots would be given only to those who have registered and scheduled an appointment on the Co-Win portal.The announcement comes at a time when vaccine shortages continue to haunt the southern state and its capital, Bengaluru, that remain firmly under the grip of the Covid-19 pandemic.“In the order placed by Karnataka Govt to procure 20 million doses of Covishield, we received 3.5 lakh (three and a half thousand doses) on Saturday night taking the total delivery to 6.5 lakh (six and half thousand doses). So far, GoI has supplied 1,10,49,470 doses including 99,58,190 doses of Covishield & 10,91,280 doses of Covaxin,” Sudhakar said in a post on Twitter.Karnataka has seen a shortage of vaccines in recent days that has impacted its vaccination drive, which is its biggest strategy to contain the Covid surge in the state.Though Karnataka had opened vaccination to persons between 18-44 on May 1, it was more symbolic than operational due to the shortage of vaccines in the state.According to government estimates, there are around 30.26 million persons in the state between 18-44 and to vaccinate all of them with both doses, it would require 60.52 million doses.“In order to fulfill this requirement (the) state government has already placed orders for 20 million doses of Covishield and 10 million doses of Covaxin. Serum Institute which manufactures Covishield has already supplied six and half thousand doses of vaccine. More consignments will be delivered by May second or third week,” Sudhakar said on Sunday. Vaccine shortages have been reported across India’s IT capital and other districts of the state with “no vaccine” boards dangling outside major hospitals in Bengaluru.Karnataka has so far vaccinated 10,521,773 persons. However, only 20,46,015 out of this have received both doses, according to government data, which makes it less than 5% of the state’s population of around 60.5 million.The daily vaccination numbers have also shown a sharp decline with the shortages as only 32,590 were vaccinated on on Sunday till 3.30pm, according to the daily bulletin of the state health department, which is just over 10% of the state’s own target to inoculate around 300,000 persons per day.Bengaluru recorded 20,897 new infections in the 24 hours on Sunday that takes its active case count to 350,370. Meanwhile, the other districts of Karnataka continue to see a surge and the state recorded 47,930 new infections that takes the active caseload to 5,64,485, one of the highest in the country. Bengaluru accounted for 280 out of the 490 fatalities, according to the daily bulletin of the health department.Private hospitals, barring Manipal and Apollo, have run out of stock ever since the Yediyurappa-led government asked them to procure vaccines on their own from May 1 and even took back stocks, according to multiple persons aware of the developments. The state has so far inoculated only 10,627 persons between 18-44 years of age.The shortage of vaccines has also added to the challenges of the BS Yediyurappa-led state government that is accused of neglecting warnings by a government appointed- technical advisory committee (TAC) in November about the imminent second wave of infections and required preparedness to tackle the same.With the health infrastructure collapsing in Bengaluru and other parts of the state and country, government’s are banking on vaccination to reduce the chance of hospitalisation and severity for those infected by Covid-19.“#LargestVaccineDrive . GoI has so far provided 17.56 Crore(175 million)+ #COVID19Vaccine doses to States & UTs for free. 72 Lakh (7.2 million) + doses are still available in stock with them. 46 Lakh(4.6 million)+ doses to be sent to States/UTs in the next 3 days,” Dr Harsh Vardhan, union minister for health & family welfare, science & tech, earth sciences, said in a post on Twitter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/as-jabs-arrive-karnataka-set-to-vaccinate-18-from-today-101620587654653.html
10-05-2021||India||Online campaign in B’luru takes on ‘hate politics’||A select group of individuals in Bengaluru on Sunday launched a social media campaign to smother out any politics or fueling of hate during the pandemic and instead focus on providing aid and relief. The campaign #NammooraEllaruNammavaru (everyone in our city is our people), which has seen a significant amount of response online, is being used even by legislators with hashtags like #HatespeechbeDa (no hate speech), which was posted on Twitter on Sunday by Sowmya Reddy, the Congress legislator from Jayanagar assembly constituency. The campaign kicks off days after Bengaluru South member of parliament, Tejasvi Surya and at least three other legislators from the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)--Satish Reddy, Ravi Subramanya and Uday Garudachar--barged into the war room in the south zone and made communally provocative comments against Muslims working there. Though Surya claimed to have entered the war room to expose a huge “bribe for bed scam”, the entire episode was alleged to have a communal twist as the BJP MP named 16 Muslims working in the facility. Subramanya, also Tejaswi’s uncle, questioned if the war room was a “madarasa”. “We are working together without looking at caste creed, oxygen, bed booking, cremation, food. Politicians are trying to fuel hate. We do not want hate, we want oxygen. We do not want dirty politics, we want hospital beds,” Vinay Sreenivasa, advocate and activist said on Sunday. A twitter handle called @BlrForLove was also created as a platform to get the government to focus more on finding solutions for the raging pandemic than deflecting away from it. Bengaluru is showing signs of plateauing as it registered 20897 new infections in the 24 hours on Sunday that takes its active case count to 350,370. Meanwhile, the other districts of Karnataka continue to see a surge and the state recorded 47,930 new infections that takes the active caseload to 564,485, one of the highest in the country. Bengaluru accounted for 280 out of the 490 fatalities, according to the daily bulletin of the health department on Sunday. Social media has played an active role in the ongoing Covid-19 second wave as it has become the most used platform to highlight the plight of patients, seek help or make public any apathy on the administration’s part. With most of Bengaluru’s hospital beds full, relatives of coronavirus (Covid-19) infected persons have used social media platforms to seek help in securing beds, oxygen, medicines and even ambulances to ferry the dead. For those seeking oxygen, there is also a twitter handle, @oxygenblr where verified information about oxygen supplies in Bengaluru is posted on a regular basis.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/online-campaign-in-b-luru-takes-on-hate-politics-101620587595742.html

Sources say, he enjoys support of at least 40 of the new MLAs, a big reason which tilted the balance in his favour for the CM’s post. “Sarma is the most aggressive voice of Hindutva in Assam politics. He helped in polarization of votes in this election by targeting Badruddin Ajmal’s party All India United Democratic Front (AIUDF) and Congress for their poll tie-up. Sarma was also the one who conceptualized and implemented competitive populist schemes that helped BJP reach out to all sections of voters,” said Akhil Ranjan Dutta, professor of political science in Gauhati University. “Sarma’s elevation to the CM’s post shows the BJP leadership is keeping an eye on the 2024 Lok Sabha poll. As convenor of NEDA, he would play a crucial role in BJP’s fortunes in Assam and all other states in northeast,” he added. The delay in announcement of a CM’s name and formation of the next government despite a clear mandate at a time when the state is witnessing a rapid rise in new Covid19 cases and deaths had led to criticism of BJP by opposition parties and experts. Assam assembly has a total of 126 seats. While BJP got 60 this time, same as its figure in 2016, its allies Asom Gana Parishad and United People’s Party Liberal (UPPL) won 9 and 6 seats respectively taking the alliance’s total to 75 seats.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/a-week-after-poll-results-assam-gets-a-new-cm-sarma-pips-sonowal-to-top-post-101620587595270.html

We will have to get official confirmation of the same on Monday morning,” Shivu Nayak, the manager of Crystal Info system and services, the agency that hires the workforce for the south zone war room said.One senior official from the BBMP said that those who were under suspension were “neither government employees nor BBMP employees” and hence there was no question of hiring or reinstating them.The 16 persons were kept on hold after the allegations were levelled by the BJP leaders in full view of the war room personnel and the video of which went viral online.Subramanya, the BJP legislator from Basavanagudi in Bengaluru, was heard questioning if the war room was a “madarasa” for hiring these Muslim personnel. The incident garnered severe criticism for the communally provocative statements made by the BJP leaders.Post the incident, Surya had revisited the war room and apologised for the distress caused to the workers and even said that he would file a police complaint against those who leaked their personal numbers online, according to at least two persons aware of the developments.Surya has denied any reference to an apology. After the allegations were levelled, the police took over the case and these personnel were subjected to intense questioning even though law enforcement authorities denied that the 16 were asked to be at the station.Reddy, who accompanied Surya, has been accused of running the scam after his close aides were questioned in the case.“We have received a call that we will receive a letter stating that we can rejoin work,” said one of the 16 persons who was named in the list. He requested anonymity.Nayak said that the company runs several projects in other zones like East and Rajarajeshwarinagar as well in other organisations and the 16 persons can be placed in any one of these sites.Meanwhile, the police have continued to crackdown on people who continue to sell hospital beds in the black market as Bengaluru’s health infrastructure crumbles due to the higher number of infections.“Investigation in bed scam case had revealed irregular bed booking in 3 hospitals..enquiry of hospital staff, arogyamitra is being done..further is investigation on,” Sandeep Patil, Joint Commissioner (Crime) said on Sunday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/16-muslim-covid-warriors-likely-to-be-reinstated-101620587474714.html
10-05-2021||India||Single-use plastic resurfaces in B’luru amid pandemic||Bengaluru For well over a year now, Single Use Plastic (SUP) has made a resurgence of sorts in Bengaluru and other urban centres in India on account of the Covid- 19 pandemic, making it harder to reverse the dependence on the extremely polluting products, officials said.Though the total generation of waste in Bengaluru, one of India’s largest cities, has come down by as much as 30-40%, the proportion of SUP has seen an increase in the last one year as individual safety, hygiene, health and paranoia over fear of contracting Covid-19 has forced people to depend on products like plastic cups, cutlery, carry bags, packaged drinking water and other items that are extremely hazardous to the environment.The reduction of total waste is on account of closure of marriage halls, small hotels and other businesses that produce a large amount of bulk waste.“Since most of the factories like make irrigation pipes, cement and asphalting works are not operational, SUP is now ending up back in landfills,” said one official of the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP), requesting anonymity.The official cited above said that though the quantity of waste generated has come down to around 3000 MT per day from around 5000 MT, the proportion of SUP remains the same, if not more.He said that solid or dry waste accounts for 80% of the total waste generated in India’s IT capital, of which over 5% or around 120-150 MT is SUP. In broader terms, anything below 50 microns is considered single use, according to the All India Plastic Manufacturers Association (AIPMA), which said that the definition is dependent on the end consumer.Waste segregation remains just a slogan in Bengaluru as the sight of small neighbourhoods throwing garbage in one corner of the street is still a common sight. This, despite, innovative ideas like painting pictures of deities, cleanliness messages and even installing CCTV cameras.Most city corporations are already in a bind over the rising amount of bio-hazardous waste mixed up with regular home-generated waste such as masks, face shields and other protective gear used for safeguard against Covid-19. City corporations are already in a fix over face masks, shields, protective gear and other hazardous waste finding their way into regular piles of garbage, which enhances the risk of the infection spreading, especially for pourakarmikas or civic workers, whose demands for better safety gear remains unfulfilled.With poor recycling facilities and the Covid-19 induced lockdown that has stalled several sectors from functioning, the piling waste threatens to add to the spiralling health crisis.At least one landfill, Mavallipura, in Bengaluru has now been turned into a mass-crematorium as Covid-19 tightens its grip on India’s IT capital. The BBMP also banned SUP around five years ago and this was the highlight of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s 2019 Independence Day speech. With more e-commerce activities, plastic that comes home often ends up being discarded, officials and others said. The pressure on civic authorities has gone up many folds during the pandemic and garbage collection has not been a priority, especially in Bengaluru, which was well renowned for its waste management--or mismanagement.“If you see 2019-20 and 2020-21 figures, SUP consumption has gone up by 14-16%,” Anil Reddy, the Vice President (South) of the AIPMA told Hindustan Times.He said that a considerable amount of this SUP is used for medical purposes like making PPE kits, masks and food packets for relief efforts, medicines and industrial packaging.He, however, said that industrial packaging has come down due to slowdown and lockdown.“Almost all industries were running on maximum 40-60% capacity. Whereas SUP, which is used for medical purposes and others, have operated with 100% capacity,” he said.Manufacturers said that India’s per capita consumption of plastic is around 10.4 kgs per annum as against 18 kgs in Singapore, 22 kgs in China and 34 kgs in the USA.They said that raising awareness was more important than banning SUP.Several large retailers in the country also use SUP to sell packaged goods.Plastic manufacturers say that khullad paper bags are being portrayed as the solution, but these may be more hazardous to the environment as it is made from topsoil and wood pulp.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/singleuse-plastic-resurfaces-in-b-luru-amid-pandemic-101620587414617.html

10-05-2021||India||Rohtak: 4 linked to farm group booked for rape||Six people were booked on Sunday in connection with the rape of a 25-year-old woman from West Bengal, who later died of Covid-19 at a private hospital in Jhajjar’s Bahadurgarh, the police said.According to a complaint lodged by the victim’s father at Bahadurgarh police station, the accused worked with ‘Kisan social army’, the IT cell of farmers’ group protesting against the three central farm laws passed in September last year.“I was pressurised that if I wanted to take my daughter’s body, I would have to give a statement that she died of Covid,” the deceased’s father said in his FIR.The police have identified the accused as Anil Malik, Anup Singh, Ankush Sangwan, Jagdish Barad and two women Kavita Arya and Yogita Suhag.“The victim came to Tikri from West Bengal on April 11 to join the protest. On April 25, she was admitted to a private hospital in Bahadurgarh after her condition worsened. The doctors found infection in her lungs and she later tested positive (for Covid-19). She breathed her last in the hospital on April 30. The charges are serious against the four farm leaders and two women volunteers, who are quite active in the farm agitation,” said the SHO Vijay Kumar.The accused, meanwhile, alleged that the victim died of Covid 10 days ago and the police are trying to frame them in a fake case.“ The police are trying to defame us and we are ready to face the probe. The government is making every attempt to defame us,” one of the four accused men said.Suhag, who is among the six persons booked in the case, tweeted, “I was the whistleblower and not an accused in the sexual assault that happened at Tikri. I had raised the issue, that is why you are hearing it. Otherwise, the issue would also have been suppressed like many others.”In a press statement, the Samyukt Kisan morcha (SKM) extended their support to the victim and said asserted that they will not tolerate assault against any woman taking part in the farm agitation.“ We removed the tents and banners of the Kisan Social army four days ago when the incident came to light. This social media handle was never part of our farm agitation and we have announced their boycott. We had earlier told the woman’s family that we are standing by them in this fight,” the statement read.A special investigation team (SIT), being headed by a deputy superintendent Pawan Sharma, will further probe the entire incident, the SHO added.“ We will launch a thorough probe and investigate the case.”The police have registered a case under sections 365 (kidnapping ), 342 (Punishment for wrongful confinement), 354 (Any man who assaults or uses criminal force to any woman or abets such act with the intention of disrobing or compelling her to be naked, shall be punished with) , 376-D (gang-rape), 506(criminal intimidation), 120-B (cheating) of the Indian Penal Code.Several farmers have been protesting against the farm laws at border points of Delhi, including Tikri and Singhu, since November last year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rohtak-4-linked-to-farm-group-booked-for-rape-101620587054580.html

Industries Minister Thangam Thennarasu said the government has requested JSW, Chennai Petroleum Corporation Ltd (CPCL), Tamil Nadu Newsprint and Papers Ltd (TNPL) and other entities to expedite measures towards producing medical oxygen in view of an increase in demand. Tamil Nadu on Sunday recorded an all time high of 28,897 new Covid-19 cases, pushing the caseload to 13,80,259 while 236 deaths in the last 24 hours took the toll to 15,648. Thennarasu said the state government proposed to set up a facility to accommodate 300 beds equipped with oxygen support, with the help of CPCL. "We have also asked companies like Hyundai Motor India, NLC India Ltd to take steps to produce medical oxygen," he added. To a query, he said the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) was planning to set up four oxygen plants in Tamil Nadu while NLC India was mulling establishing three. Earlier, Chief Minister M K Stalin interacted with industry leaders at a meeting and explained about the measures taken by his government to control the virus spread. He sought their cooperation for the two-week full lockdown, an official release said.

10-05-2021||India||Renowned sculptor and Rajya Sabha MP Raghunath Mohapatra succumbs to Covid-19||Renowned sculptor and Rajya Sabha MP from Odisha Raghunath Mohapatra who was planning to build a replica of the Sun Temple at Konark, on Sunday succumbed to Covid-19 at AIIMS Bhubaneswar where he was being treated for the last two weeks. Mohapatra, 78, had turned critical and was in the ICU after having tested positive for coronavirus.“Mohapatra’s condition deteriorated this afternoon and he passed away at 3.49 PM,” said AIIMS Bhubaneswar medical superintendent Sachidanand Mohanty. Mohapatra’s two sons, Prashant and Jasobant are also in a critical condition and undergoing treatment at AIIMS after testing positive for Covid-19. Prime Minister Narendra Modi earlier this week had spoken to Jasobant to inquire about their health.Leader of opposition and senior BJP leader Pradipta Naik too is in the ICU at AIIMS Bhubaneswar after testing positive for Covid-19.Condoling the death of Mohapatra, Prime Minister Narendra Modi tweeted: “Saddened by the demise of MP Shri Raghunath Mohapatra Ji. He made pioneering contributions to the world of art, architecture and culture. He will be remembered for his contributions towards popularising traditional crafts. My thoughts are with his family and admirers. Om Shanti.”Nominated to the Rajya Sabha in July 2018 for his contribution to the world of arts, Mohapatra is considered a master of stone carving who had deep knowledge of the traditional style of sculpting of Odisha temple architecture. Mohapatra’s ancestors were said to be involved in the building of the Sun Temple at Konark, a world heritage structure and the Jagannath Temple in Puri.Hailing from a family of illustrious sculptors, Mohapatra started sculpting at an early age. He studied till about class 3, but had become an authority in sculpting at a young age. At the age of 22, he won a national award.In 1974 he came into prominence by creating a six-foot-tall grey sandstone statue of the Sun God, which is now displayed in the Central Hall of Parliament. His other works include a wooden image of Buddha at the Buddha Temple, Paris, two white Dholpuri stone lamps in the Prime Minister’s office, the decorative central circle and pillars in Park Street, Kolkata and a 15-feet-high Mukteswar gate in red sandstone at Surajkund, Haryana. He also worked for the preservation of the Jagannath Temple in Puri.His other works include two 15-feet-tall Buddha statutes in white sandstone at the historic Dhauligiri Santi Stupa near Bhubaneswar, a gigantic lotus of 30 feet x 30 feet in a single black granite stone at former PM Rajiv Gandhi’s samadhi at Vir Bhumi, and three 20-feet-high statues of Buddha in white sandstone at the Buddhist Monastery, Ladakh.In Bhubaneswar, the 15-feet-high Konark horse installed at the Master Canteen square and 12 ft tall Konark Horse at Barabati Stadium, Cuttack are famous landmarks of the twin cities. He was the main sculptor of Emami Jagannath Temple (Balasore) and Maa Taratarini Temple (Ganjam). He also sculpted the Viswarupa Bishnu Statue at Narayana Heart Hospital, Bangalore.Among his most ambitious venture was a “second Sun Temple” called Aditya Narayan Mandir on the outskirts of Bhubaneswar to give people a glimpse of the true glory of the original Sun Temple. He believed that the second Sun temple, once completed would allow future generations to know more about the original Sun Temple built in the 13th century.The current Sun temple at Konark is actually Jagamohan or frontal portion. Historians believe that the main temple has been destroyed due to vagaries of nature.In 1980, he sculpted a 14-feet-high Konark wheel in red sandstone at the India International Trade Fair which is now displayed at the Ashoka Hotel, New Delhi. He had set up a school in Bhubaneswar where he has trained more than 2,000 students.He was awarded the Padma Shri in 1976, Padma Bhushan in 2001, and Padma Vibhushan in 2013.Since 1963, he has served as a senior instructor and superintendent of the Handicraft Training and Designing Center of the Government of Odisha. In 2000, he was nominated as a member of the Indian Council for Cultural Relations by the Ministry of External Affairs, Government of India. Currently, he was a member of the Lalit Kala Academy and President of the Bhubaneswar branch of the All India Viswakarma Mahasangha.Mohapatra unsuccessfully contested the Rajya Sabha polls in February 2014 as a BJD-backed independent candidate. Though BJP had extended support to his candidature, he could not make it. The seat was won by Ranjib Biswal of Congress.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/renowned-sculptor-and-rajya-sabha-mp-raghunath-mohapatra-succumbs-to-covid19-101620586515402.html
10-05-2021||India||Himanta Biswa Sarma: From BJP’s key strategist in northeast to Assam CM||Ever since he joined the Tarun Gogoi-led Congress government in 2001 as a minister after his first electoral victory, Himanta Biswa Sarma was always seen by many as someone who would reach the chief minister’s chair in due course.On Sunday, that expectation came true as Sarma pipped incumbent Sarbananda Sonowal to be unanimously selected as the legislature party leader of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which secured 60 seats in the recently concluded assembly polls to return to power in Assam for a second consecutive term.As a seasoned politician, Sarma never made his ambitions for the top post public. But ever since he quit the Congress cabinet of Gogoi in 2015 after differences with the CM over purportedly promoting his son Gaurav, the perception was strong that he joined the BJP in order to fulfil his political goals.Sonowal led the BJP to an electoral victory, but the BJP high command had to give the CM’s chair to Sarma as he was the one who galvanised mass support for the party and also had the support of two-third of the new BJP legislators, people in the party with knowledge of the matter said.The 52-year-old has been a key figure in Assam’s politics for two decades now. But Sarma, who joined the BJP six years ago, has had a meteoric rise in the saffron party and his influence is not restricted to Assam but seen across the region.Also read | Himanta Biswa Sarma to take over as next Assam chief ministerSarma’s political acumen and oratorical skills played a key role in the BJP winning 60 of the total 126 seats in 2016 and forming the party’s first government in Assam with alliance partners Asom Gana Parishad and Bodoland Peoples’ Front. Despite being new to the party, Sarma was given four crucial departments -- health, education, finance and public works -- in the Sonowal cabinet.As convener of the North East Democratic Alliance (NEDA), a BJP-led front of anti-Congress parties in the North-east, Sarma shares a close rapport with senior politicians in all seven states of the region. His role was crucial in the BJP forming governments in Arunachal Pradesh, Manipur and Tripura and becoming part of the ruling coalition in Nagaland and Meghalaya.Sarma hasn’t had a clean slate and there were accusations about his involvement in the Louis Berger scam and the Saradha Group fraud scheme. But he has been able to override them and play a key role in the BJP, a party that once targeted him on these accusations.Over the past five years, Sarma has made a mark beyond the region and become a known face across the country -- a traditional rarity for politicians from the North-east. He is consulted by the BJP leadership for any issue concerning Assam and the region and more often than not, his suggestions are accepted.Due to his position in the Assam cabinet and in NEDA, Sarma’s stature grew to such extent that he was sometimes mistaken by some from outside the region as the CM instead of Sonowal. An astute politician, Sarma never tried to compete with Sonowal for the top post and there is a cordial relationship between the two, at least in public.In 2019, ahead of the general elections, Sarma had indicated his intentions to leave state politics and shift base to New Delhi, where he could play a bigger role. But the BJP leadership decided against it. However, in a rare gesture, then BJP president Amit Shah issued a statement that the party needed Sarma’s services in the poll campaign in the North-east and could not afford to have him restricted to just one seat.Sarma has been representing the Jalukbari seat continuously since 2001 and this time, too, the party gave him the ticket from the seat. With the BJP high command not projecting a CM face for this election, rumours were abound that Sarma could be given that role.Sarma has been the brain behind most of the social welfare schemes of the Sonowal government such as ₹830 per month to 2.2 million households and cash incentives and grants to various sections of society. But his role as health minister in the past year, when he supervised setting up of large Covid care centres, boosting infrastructure at hospitals and personally visiting quarantine centres to keep tabs on care being provided to those infected have earned him headlines as well as admiration even from his critics.For this election, Sarma specifically targeted the Congress and its alliance partner All India United Democratic Front (AIUDF), the two main opposition parties in Assam which formed a grand alliance along with former BJP ally Bodoland Peoples Front.Terming the AIUDF as an important factor in this election, Sarma accused its chief, perfume baron and Lok Sabha MP Badruddin Ajmal, as being the enemy of Assam and Assamese culture. He has openly stated that the BJP doesn’t need votes of ‘miyas’ (Bengali-speaking Muslims from erstwhile East Pakistan).Besides politics and governance, Sarma is interested in sports and is an author. He has penned four books till date, the latest released in February ahead of the assembly polls. He is also the president of the Badminton Association of India (BAI).Sarma’s wife Riniki Bhuyan Sarma is the chairperson and managing director of Pride East Entertainment that owns several TV channels, a daily newspaper and a magazine. The couple has a son and daughter.“Sarma’s elevation to the CM’s post was coming for some time and he was working towards it by delivering the goods for the party time and again. He already had a stronghold in the BJP and over time, managed to become a brand himself that cuts across party and community lines,” Kaustubh Deka, professor of political science in Dibrugarh University, said.“After the poll debacle in West Bengal, the BJP leadership realized the importance of having strong regional leaders and also listen to local voices. That’s the reason why instead of imposing a leader, it decided to go with ground realities and even override the so-called opposition by RSS to Sarma’s elevation to the top post,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/himanta-biswa-sarma-from-bjp-s-key-strategist-in-northeast-to-assam-cm-101620586214553.html
10-05-2021||India||NIA begins probe against top Maoist commander||The National Investigation Agency (NIA) has launched a probe against Madvi Hidma, commander of Battalion-I of Maoist’s People’s Liberation Guerilla Army (PLGA), in connection with the seizure of a cache of explosive materials, including 900 detonators, used for planting Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs) to target security forces, people familiar with the development said.Hidma is the mastermind behind last month’s U-shaped ambush on security forces in Chhattisgarh’s Bijapur district in which 22 security personnel were killed.The officials cited above said that Hidma, who also goes by names Hidmal and Iduma, was booked in a matter related to the arrest of two ‘Maoist couriers’ – Muthu Nagaraju and Kommaraju Kanakaiah – by a routine patrolling team of Telangana Police and Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) on February 18. The duo was carrying 400 electrical detonators, 500 non-electrical detonators, 400 gelatin sticks and 549 metres of fuse wire in bags and was heading towards a forest in Chhattisgarh when they were caught.Also read | NIA takes over case involving recovery of uranium worth ₹21 crore“During interrogation, they disclosed that they are sympathisers of CPI (Maoists) and were instructed by Hidma to collect the explosives,” an officer said, preferring anonymity. According to details accessed by HT, Hidma has been named as an accused in the NIA FIR, registered last week under the explosives act among others.Officials said the whopping cache of explosives was recovered around the time when Maoists begin their Tactical Counter Offensive Campaign (TCOC), from February to May every year. As part of TCOC, Maoist cadres are mobilised across the country, and then they carry out attacks on security forces and government establishments in order to kill them and loot their weapons. The targets also include patrolling parties, destroying railway tracks, police stations and schools among others.Hidma, a strategist in guerilla warfare, has been the face behind Maoists’ TCOC every year for the past 15-16 years. He has planned and executed some of the deadliest ambushes on security forces, including the 2017 Burkapal attack in which 24 CRPF personnel were killed, 2013 Jheerum Ghati ambush in which 27 people, including Congress leaders, were killed and 2010 Dantewada ambush in which 76 lost their lives.There is already a reward of close to ₹40 lakh on him by different police departments and central agencies.Former Director General of CRPF, K Durga Prasad, said: “Hidma is basically the muscle-power of Jantana Sarkar of Maoists. He rose in the ranks of Maoists because of his military skills. Since he is a tribal, he has a good network of informants in the villages and people inside trust him more because the local administration is not visible. Honestly, the administration’s lack of planning and understanding of the terrain and needs of villagers is the reason why Hidma is more successful than us in the jungles of Chhattisgarh.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nia-begins-probe-against-top-maoist-commander-101620586094520.html

As supplies (vaccine) get better, more slots will open up,” a central government official said on condition of anonymity.About 180 million Covid-19 vaccine doses have been administered in the country so far. “Ten states account for 66.78% of the cumulative doses given so far in the country,” Union health ministry said in a statement.Also read | PM Modi takes stock of Covid-19 crisis, strategy in 4 statesThere has been a massive surge in the number of new Covid-19 cases over the past few weeks, and the global community has come to the aid of the Indian government as the country’s health care delivery system is stretched thin.As per recent government data, nearly 500,000 Covid-19 positive cases currently are in intensive care units (ICUs), with over 170,000 people on ventilator support at various hospitals across the country, with many more seriously ill patients in need of hospital beds.Many countries began sending essential medical supplies to help India strengthen its clinical management capacity for effective management of hospitalised Covid-19 patients.Since April 27, when shipments started arriving, 6,738 oxygen concentrators; 3,856 oxygen cylinders; 16 oxygen generation plants; 4,668 ventilators or Bi PAP machines; and about 300,000 remdesivir vials have either been delivered or dispatched cumulatively.On Saturday, the government received oxygen concentrators (2,404), antiviral drug remdesivir (25,000 vials), ventilators (218) and testing kits (692,208) from Canada, Thailand, The Netherlands, Austria, Czech Republic, Israel, US, Japan, Malaysia, Gilead, Salesforce and the Indian community in Thailand.“A dedicated Coordination Cell has been created in the Union Health Ministry to coordinate the receipt and allocation of foreign COVID relief material as grants, aid and donations. This Cell started functioning from 26th April 2021. A Standard Operating Procedure has been framed and implemented by the Health Ministry since 2nd May, 2021,” said the health ministry statement.Most of the material is being sent to tertiary care hospitals in states, as these hospitals see maximum Covid-19 caseload, and mostly severely ill patients.“I thank all for sending foreign aid in the form of essential medical equipment -- ventilators, oxygen cylinders, and oxygen concentrators, to fight the huge surge of Covid-19 cases,” said Dr Randeep Guleria, director, All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), Delhi.AIIMS is also one of the two hospitals in Delhi to have installed DRDO’s oxygen generation plant that is designed for a flow rate of 1,000 liters per minute. The system caters to 190 patients at a flow rate of 5 litres per minute. The other hospital where the plant has been installed is New Delhi’s Dr Ram Manohar Lohia Hospital.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/18mn-in-18-44-yrs-age-group-have-received-first-jab-says-govt-data-101620585375105.html
10-05-2021||India||Heatwave conditions won’t set in till May 18: IMD||An unusually high number of western disturbances (WD) in March, April and now in May has subdued the searing heat normally felt in April and May, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) has said, adding that similar conditions are likely to persist till around May 18.“There was no heatwave in May till now. We are not expecting heatwave conditions to set in till May 18. On May 10, 11 and 12, rain and thunderstorms are likely over northwest India under the influence of an intense western disturbance. It has rained almost continuously in many parts of the country in April. There were cloudy skies and strong winds over north India also, which didn’t allow the maximum temperatures to rise. In central and peninsular India, there is wind discontinuity which is bringing intermittent thunderstorm activity and cool winds,” RK Jenamani, senior scientist, national weather forecasting centre, said.There were seven western disturbances which moved across western Himalayan region in March against the normal of four WDs. Of these, three were very active, bringing rainfall, snowfall and thunderstorm to the region. April saw nine WDs move across western Himalayan region against the normal of four to five WDs. Four of them were active and moved as cyclonic circulations, bringing rain and thunderstorms to the hills and plains. There were two WDs in May and another expected to impact the region from Tuesday.In March, severe heatwave was recorded over west Rajasthan and heatwave conditions over east Rajasthan, Odisha, Gangetic West Bengal, coastal Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu. In April, however, the heatwave was occasional and for shorter periods over smaller pockets. This is mainly because of wet spells over the western Himalayan region and adjoining plains of northwest India and central India on many days due to the movement of WDs. No heatwave was recorded in May, according to the weather body.Jenamani added that with the likely arrival of monsoon over Kerala on June 1, further heatwave conditions are unlikely over Peninsular India. “Over north India, May-end and beginning of June can be very hot. But we can’t tell now. It depends on what weather systems develop.”The average maximum, minimum and mean temperature in April was 34.52 degree C, 22.33 degree C and 28.42 degree C, respectively, against the normal of 33.94 degree C, 22.15 degree C and 28.04 degree C based on the average for 1981-2010 period.In March, the maximum, minimum and mean temperature was 32.65 degree C, 19.95 degree C and 26.30 degree C, respectively, against the normal of 31.24 degree C, 18.87 degree C and 25.06 degree C.A fresh western disturbance is likely to affect western Himalayan region and plains of northwest India from May 11 onwards. Under the influence of this WD and its interaction with easterly winds and moisture feed from Arabian Sea, fairly widespread rainfall or thundershowers are very likely over western Himalayan region and isolated rainfall/thunderstorms is likely over plains of northwest India on May 11 and 12 with maximum intensity on May 12 and 13. Isolated heavy rainfall is also likely over Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand on May 12 and 13.Under the influence of strengthening of lower level south-westerly winds and its confluence with lower-level westerlies, fairly widespread rainfall/thunderstorm activity is also likely over northeastern states and West Bengal; and scattered rain/thundershower over remaining parts of east India during the next four to five days.Due to a north-south trough (area of low pressure)/wind discontinuity from southwest Madhya Pradesh to Karnataka coast, light/moderate rain/thunder is very likely over Kerala, Mahe, Lakshadweep and Karnataka and isolated rain over rest of south Peninsular India during the next four to five days. No heatwave conditions are likely over any part of the country during this period.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/heatwave-conditions-won-t-set-in-till-may-18imd-101620585374495.html

It gave 6.5 crore doses to them. Around 1 lakh people have died of Covid during the second wave in India. If not exported, these vaccines could have saved the lives of these people," the Deputy Chief Minister said.He said that other countries also follow international treaties, but they did not export vaccines and prioritised their own people."Some people in Central government would say that we are bound by international treaties. US, France and European countries also follow these treaties but none of them prioritized other countries. Only we gave vaccines to others when our own people were dying," Sisodia said."Was it (export of vaccines to other countries) done just to improve the image of Central government and earn accolades from some other countries? I request the Central government to vaccinate everyone in the country before exporting vaccines," he added.Earlier today, he also tweeted about the matter and said the Delhi government has approved a budget of 600 crores to buy vaccines but there is a shortage of vaccines with manufacturers."It is a good thing to worry about the world, but the countries of America, Canada, Europe, are starting to arrange vaccines for their people first from around the world. Only France exported 1 lakh vaccines last month. Our central government has donated 6.6 crore since March," he tweeted."The Delhi government has approved a budget of 600 crores to buy vaccines for the people of Delhi. Many more states are also prepared in this way. But the vaccine is not available. Because from March till now, the central government has showered favour on 93 countries including Arab countries and exported 6.6 crore vaccines," Sisodia said in another tweet.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid19-delhi-s-deputy-cm-manish-sisodia-urges-centre-to-vaccinate-indians-first-before-exporting-vaccines-101620584569029.html

Punjab has been battling a surge in Covid cases and recorded 8,436 cases and 191 deaths on Sunday, taking its total tally to 442,125 and 10,506.Amarinder asked Modi to raise the state’s total quota of oxygen to 300 metric tonne (MT) amid an increase in hospitalisation, officials said.An official statement said the chief minister informed Modi that “the state has a high mortality count, and hospitalisation in Level 2 and 3 facilities (both government and private) has seen a sharp surge over the past three weeks, pushing up the oxygen demand”.The CM informed Modi that from 197 MT on April 22, the demand for oxygen had risen to 295.5 MT in the state on May 8 with the shortage of O2 tankers making the situation worse, the statement said.The chief minister hoped that the Centre would take immediate steps to supplement oxygen supplies and ensure vaccine doses were sent on priority to help the Punjab government effectively manage the situation, an official statement said. The state is set to start the vaccination of those in the 18-44 year age group from Monday.Also read | Regulate supply of Covid-19 vaccine shots: Delhi CM Kejriwal writes to health minister Harsh VardhanSpeaking on condition of anonymity, an official said that Punjab health secretary Hussan Lal, in a letter to the additional secretary in the Union health ministry noted that while the state has taken several steps to ensure judicious use of oxygen by hospitals, in line with the advisory of government of India, the growing demand for the life-saving gas necessitated an increase in allocation.The Prime Minister has been holding a series of talks with the CM and lieutenant governors across the country to assess the ground situation and take stock of the states’ demands.Karnataka chief minister BS Yediyurappa apprised Modi of the Covid situation in the state during their conversation, officials said. “They spoke about Covid-19 situation in the state and took stock of the situation,” said one of the two officials at chief minister’s office.Karnataka, which remains firmly in the grip of Covid, recorded 47,930 new cases on Sunday.On May 5, while hearing a public interest litigation, the Karnataka high court noted that the projected requirement of oxygen in the state was 1,471 MT per day as on April 30, 2021, whereas the Centre had agreed to enhance it from 862 MT to only 962 MT per day. The high court then directed the Karnataka government to submit a representation to the Union government while ordering that till this representation was considered, the Centre will supply 1200 MT of oxygen per day to the state. The Centre challenged this order in the Supreme Court but the top court turned down its plea on May 7.Uttarakhand chief minister Tirath Singh Rawat, who received criticism from health experts after the state held mahakumbh amid the pandemic, said he updated the PM about the Covid situation the state. Uttarakhand recorded 5,890 fresh infections and 180 deaths on Sunday. “Prime Minister Narendra Modi called up for an update on Covid cases in Uttarakhand. I apprised him with the present situation,” Rawat said in a tweet.Till late on Sunday, the office of Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar did not issue a statement about the matters discussed between the PM and Kumar during the telephonic conversation over the pandemic.“ The PM had talked with the CM on the Covid situation in the state. There were discussions on it ,”said a senior bureaucrat, wishing anonymity.Principal secretary to the chief minister, Deepak Kumar, did not comment about the meeting, or what issues were discussed.However, in a series of tweets later on Sunday, the CM exhorted people to come together to fight against the Covid-19 pandemic by adopting appropriate behaviour and extending support to the government.

10-05-2021||India||Quarry work illegal, high-level probe ordered in Kadapa blast||The Andhra Pradesh government on Sunday formed a multi-department panel to conduct a high-level probe into the Kadappa quarry explosion, where 10 labourers were killed, after preliminary probe by revenue authorities suggested that the leaseholder of the quarry had no permission to use explosives for mining activities in the area.Kadapa district collector C Hari Kiran made the observation in his report to the state government submitted on Sunday. Based on his report, the state government ordered the probe by a multi-departmental panel comprising officials of five different departments, including mine, geology, industries and revenue and sought another report in five days.“The committee headed by the district joint collector has been asked to submit a report to the government within five days. Stringent action would be taken against the leaseholders of the limestone quarry as per the law, as prima facie it was proved that he had not followed any safety precautions in using the explosives,” state minister of mines and geology Peddireddy Ramachandra Reddy told reporters in Vijayawada.The minister also announced an ex gratia of ₹10 lakh each to the kin of the deceased who were killed during the blast while unloading detonators from a vehicle at a limestone quarry.The incident happened at Tirumalakonda hillocks on the outskirts of Mamillapalli village of Kalasapadu block at around 10 am on Saturday.Also read | 10 killed in explosion at limestone quarry in Andhra“We shall also make the mine operator pay additional compensation to the victims’ families as per the Labour Act. Operators of other mines have also been alerted to ensure all safety measures are taken to prevent such blasts in the future,” Reddy said.In his report to principal secretary (mines and geology) Gopala Krishna Dwivedi, Kiran said the explosion took place at the limestone mine extending over 30.696 hectares in Survey Nos. 1 and 133. The original leaseholder of the mine is C Kasturi Bai, wife of C Ramachandraiah, legislative council member of YSR Congress party, but the general power of attorney was given to one C Nageshwar Reddy of Chechaiahgaripalli village for a period of 10 years.“Reddy was doing quarry operations illegally during this pandemic situation, knowing that the department officials were appointed as nodal officers for Covid-19 duties and there were holidays for the weekend. He illegally brought the explosive material to the quarry in a car and the explosion took place at the time of unloading due to negligence and lack of proper precautions in handling the material,” the collector said.While Reddy continues to hold the permission for mining till November 2021, he did not have the permission to use and transport detonators for mining activity from the competent authority.“During raids conducted by the mines and geology department for three days in October 2019, it was found that Reddy had been conducting underground mining operations without appointment of statutory employees. He also excavated excess quantities of barytes (a variety of limestone) beyond the annual approved quantity,” the collector said.Kiran also pointed out that Reddy was conducting quarry operations and excavated thousands of tonnes of minerals without environmental clearance and forest approval. The quarry operations were also not in accordance with the approved scheme of mining.The collector pointed out that in August 2020, the assistant director of mines and geology department of Kadapa had recommended suspension of quarry operations as Reddy had violated all norms. Accordingly, the director of the department had issued show cause notice to the lease holder asking why no action should be initiated against him.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/quarry-work-illegal-high-level-probe-ordered-in-kadapa-blast-101620584594951.html

The NIA has re-registered the case and started the investigation, the spokesperson added.Thane resident Jigar Jayesh Pandya, 27, and Abu Tahir Afzal Hussain Choudhary, 31, a Mankhurd local, are in police custody till May 12 for the alleged possession of the highly radioactive substance.Also read | NIA begins probe against top Maoist commanderEarlier, an NIA team had visited the ATS office, and after verifying facts, took over the case. “Now the documents related to the case will be handed over to them for further inquiry. As per the procedure, NIA will approach the court to take custody of both the accused as they are in ATS custody till May 12,” said an ATS officer.The incident came to light after police inspector Santosh Bhalekar of the Nagpada unit got information about a person planning to sell pieces of uranium illegally. Bhalekar and his team then laid a trap and nabbed Pandya. During interrogation, Pandya revealed that he had got the uranium from Choudhary. Bhalekar then arrested Choudhary on May 5 after questioning several scrap dealers in Mumbai.Meanwhile, ATS had sent the recovered substance to Bhabha Atomic Research Centre (BARC), Trombay, for chemical analysis. The BARC report confirmed that the seized substance was natural uranium and dangerous to human life.“We have been interrogating the accused to find out where they had procured the uranium from. It appears that there are several others involved in the case.

The five-judge bench also refused to refer the 1992 Indra Sawhney judgment, setting a 50% cap on reservation to a larger bench for reconsideration.Virendra Pawar, one of the convenors from Maratha Kranti Morcha (MKM) said, “It [formation of the committee] was expected when the legal battle for reservation was going on in the apex court. We had suggested names such as Dr Sadanand More (scholar), BG Kolse Patil (retired high court justice) and PB Sawant (retired Supreme court judge) to the government requesting them to use their expertise by appointing them as advisers but our suggestions were overlooked.”“If the state government is really serious about granting reservation to the Maratha community they should consider incorporating us in the OBC quota,” he added.Also read | Maharashtra to set up panel to study SC order on Maratha reservationSanjiv Bhor Patil, president, Shiv Prahar Sangathana said the state is just passing the time. “We have lost our reservation quota so now whatever is required to get it back, should be done at the earliest. We would have hit the streets by now but not doing so because of the pandemic. We want the government not to waste the time anymore.”However, a few Maratha leaders termed the constitution of the expert committee as a “positive development”. Mansing Pawar, one of the convenors of the MKM said, “It [the move] is definitely a positive development as only two authorities in the country — the Supreme Court and President — can provide us reservation. Individual petitioners are also preparing grounds to go for a review but the petition by the state government will make a difference. Thus, I would say it is a much needed step.”The state government on Saturday decided to constitute a committee under two retired high court (HC) judges to review the recent apex court verdict and suggest the next course of action. The committee, comprising five-six other members including laws officers, is expected to submit its report in two weeks to the state government.Marathas were given 12% and 13% quota in education and government jobs, respectively, under the Socially and Educationally Backward Classes (SEBC) Act, 2018.The state government on Saturday also said that they are tapping the option of requesting the central government to intervene, as the judgment stated that the right to accord the reservation is with the Centre after the 102nd Constitutional amendment.“Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray will write to the President and prime minister, requesting them to take steps required for the reservation. The Centre has time and again clarified that the powers of the states have not been nullified even after the amendment, though the SC order has stated otherwise,” Ashok Chavan, Public Works Department (PWD) minister said on Saturday.Many of the organisations are also planning to hold statewide virtual agitations by starting social media campaigns against leaders from the political parties in the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-verdict-on-quota-maratha-leaders-voice-discontent-over-panel-101620584534451.html
10-05-2021||India||Ashwani Kumar urges PM to raise supply of oxygen, vaccine to Punjab||Former Union minister for law and justice Ashwani Kumar has called upon Prime Minister Narendra Modi for assistance to Punjab in the fight against Covid-19, urging that the availability of oxygen and vaccine doses in the state be ramped up urgently.The Prime Minister on Sunday spoke to the chief ministers of Punjab and three other states on the Covid-19 situation, according to people aware of the matter, a development that comes amid a steep surge in cases in the region.“Considering the particular vulnerabilities of Punjab, an aggressive vaccination drive and adequate supply of oxygen for the seriously ill patients is a compelling need of the state,” Kumar wrote in a letter to PM Modi.“As regards the availability of oxygen, the present demand of the state is 280 MT per day as against the availability of about 150 MT. This demand could increase substantially in the days ahead considering the obvious possibilities, for which it is necessary to keep a reasonable buffer,” he added in the letter dated May 8.“The doses required for vaccination of persons between the age group of 18 to 44 is 2.6 crore for which orders have been placed by the state government. Out of this, 30 lakh doses are required by May 21 but the supplies may not match this demand unless ensured by the central government. Similarly, for vaccination of those at 45 and above, 1.6crore doses are required for double dose vaccination against which only 40.50 lakh doses have been received by the state government through govt. of India,” Kumar wrote.Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh on Saturday reiterated that violation of the weekend lockdown in Punjab will not be allowed given the Covid-19 situation. Kumar praised the Punjab CM’s leadership, saying that he took “timely initiatives to contain the pandemic in the state”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/former-minister-ashwani-kumar-urges-pm-to-raise-supply-of-oxygen-vaccine-to-punjab-101620584414461.html
10-05-2021||India||Saudi Arabia backs India-Pakistan dialogue||New Delhi Saudi Arabia has welcomed the decision by India and Pakistan to observe a ceasefire along the Line of Control (LoC) and backed a dialogue between the South Asian rivals to address all outstanding issues, including the Kashmir dispute.The kingdom’s position was articulated in a joint statement issued by Pakistan and Saudi Arabia late on Saturday after a meeting between Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and visiting Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan. It came against the backdrop of speculation about the role being played by Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) to foster dialogue between New Delhi and Islamabad.Khan was on an official visit to Saudi Arabia from May 7 to 9. Pakistan Army chief Gen Qamar Bajwa too visited Saudi Arabia last week. Both Bajwa and Khan held meetings with the Saudi crown prince and the talks were seen as part of Pakistan’s efforts to normalise strained relations with Saudi Arabia.The joint statement said the Saudi crown prince “welcomed the recent understanding reached between the military authorities of Pakistan and India regarding ceasefire at the Line of Control (LoC), which is based on a 2003 understanding between Pakistan and India”.It added that Saudi Arabia and Pakistan “emphasised the importance of dialogue between Pakistan and India to resolve the outstanding issues between the two countries, especially Jammu and Kashmir dispute, to ensure peace and stability in the region”.However, a separate readout issued by the Saudi side on the meeting between Khan and the crown prince made no mention of India or the Kashmir issue.There was no immediate response from Indian officials to the joint statement.There has been speculation about the role played by Saudi Arabia and the UAE to reduce tensions between India and Pakistan since the 2019 Pulwama suicide bombing, which triggered a tense military standoff.The UAE envoy to the US, Yousef Al Otaiba, confirmed last month that his country played a role in bringing together India and Pakistan for talks aimed at calming tensions over the Kashmir issue and getting bilateral ties “back to a healthy level”. It is understood that senior Indian and Pakistani security officials have met in London and Dubai for secret talks in recent months.The surprise decision by the Indian and Pakistani armies to recommit themselves to the 2003 ceasefire on the LoC from February 25 is seen as the outcome of these contacts.During the Pakistani prime minister’s visit to Saudi Arabia, the two sides reviewed all aspects of bilateral cooperation and discussed regional and international issues. They agreed to intensify contacts and cooperation between government officials and the private sector, and the crown prince assured Khan of Saudi Arabia’s continued support for his vision to transform Pakistan into a modern welfare state.Both sides also expressed satisfaction at cooperation in military and security ties, and agreed to augment collaboration to achieve mutually agreed goals, the joint statement said.The two sides said an “inclusive, broad-based and comprehensive political settlement” is the only way forward in Afghanistan. They also signed several agreements on establishing a Saudi-Pakistan Supreme Coordination Council, combating illicit trafficking in narcotics and drugs and financing projects in energy, hydropower, infrastructure and transport and communication.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/saudi-arabia-backs-india-pak-dialogue-101620584294432.html
