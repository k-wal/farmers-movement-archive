22-05-2021||Delhi||Covid-19: Delhi records 3.58% positivity rate, lowest cases since March 31||With 2,269 new cases of Covid-19, Delhi reported the lowest daily incidence of the viral infection in 52 days on Saturday, and the positivity rate – the proportion of samples that return positive – dropped to 3.58%, a figure, experts said, showed the fourth wave was gradually coming under control in the national capital.The Capital has been under a lockdown for a month; the “last resort” step was taken after a massive surge in infections overwhelmed the health care infrastructure and resulted in shortages of essential supplies such as medical oxygen and life-saving drugs.In April, Delhi reported its worst surge of Covid-19, with the number of cases recorded in a single day shooting up to over 28,000 and the positivity rate to 36%, meaning more than one in three people tested were found to have the infection. It has now reduced to around one in 33 tested people having the infection.Dr Jacob John, former head of the department of virology at Christian Medical College-Vellore, said the government should now focus on vaccinating a significant proportion of the population to prevent a third wave.With reports of a shortage of vaccines for those between the ages of 18 and 44 years, the number of jabs given in Delhi almost halved on Saturday. About 50,000 jabs were administered, according to the official health bulletin; the daily jabs crossed 100,000 a day after the vaccination was opened up for the younger population in the Capital.“Some curbs have to remain – malls, gyms, cinemas, weddings any place where people gather. With a large number of people exposed to the infection, there might not be a surge for the next few months... this time needs to be utilised to vaccinate a significant proportion of the people,” said Dr Amit Singh, associate professor, Centre for Infectious Disease Research, Indian Institute of Science, Bengaluru.He added: “In the absence of vaccines, the government also needs to see whether it is prepared with beds and oxygen needed in case there is a surge again.”On Saturday, Delhi reported 182 deaths due to the viral infection, dipping below the 200 mark for the first time in 34 days. However, with fewer cases and a high number of deaths still being reported, the seven day rolling average case fatality ratio (CFR) – proportion of deaths among those who test positive – has shot up to 6.15%. The cumulative CFR – based on the total number of cases and deaths reported so far – is at 1.63%, higher than the national average of 1.1%.As per the latest health bulletin, the new fatalities pushed the death toll due to Covid-19 in the national capital to 23,013. The number of daily cases in the city was 2,260, Delhi health minister Satyendar Jain said on Twitter, adding: “These are lowest numbers after 31 March. Still need to take all precautions and follow Covid appropriate behaviour.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/covid19-delhi-records-3-58-positivity-rate-lowest-cases-since-march-31-101621707533292.html
22-05-2021||Delhi||‘Should be clearly visible’: Delhi medicine sellers asked to display Covid drug info||The Delhi Disaster Management Authority on Saturday asked all authorised dealers, retailers and sellers of essential drugs needed for treatment of coronavirus disease (Covid-19) in Delhi to display information with relation to its stocks and its maximum retail price in clearly visible areas inside their shops or premises for the viewing of the general public. The order also said that this information will have to be updated four times a day.Delhi’s Lieutenant Governor Anil Baijal has instructed that the drugs needed for the treatment of Covid-19 should be made available to the general public. He also highlighted that hoarding, overcharging or black-marketing of these essential drugs should be stopped. He said that the new measure will ensure that such practices are minimised, news agency ANI reported. The DDMA rule states that the information should be updated at 10am, 2pm, 6pm and 9pm daily.The Lieutenant Governor also instructed that similar measures should be taken with regard to equipment like pulse oximeters, oxygen cylinders and oxygen concentrators.The Delhi high court previously ordered the Centre and the Delhi government to check black-marketing of essential medicines and medical oxygen as the city raced against time to provide for its Covid-19 patients, many of whom died due to the lack of medical oxygen as well as life-saving drugs. “We are still not understanding the gravity of the situation and that is why we are not coming together. Which is why we are seeing instances of hoarding and black marketing. Our moral fabric has been dismembered to a great extent,” Delhi high court said on May 6.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-medicine-sellers-asked-to-display-covid-19-related-drug-info-prominently-101621682868025.html

So far 5,017,579 beneficiaries have received the jab in the national capital.Earlier in the day, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi over the vaccine situation in Delhi saying that vaccination centres have been closed due to non-availability of stocks. “We've to close the vaccination centres from today as vaccines for 18+ category is exhausted. Delhi needs 80 lakh vaccines every month so that everyone here can be vaccinated within 3 months,” news agency ANI cited from Kejriwal’s letter.“Delhi received only 16 lakh vaccines in May and we have been told that we will receive only 8 lakh vaccines in June. If this is the pace then it will take 30 months to vaccinate just the adults,” the letter further read.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-records-2-260-new-covid-19-cases-active-caseload-falls-further-to-31308-101621678272000.html
22-05-2021||Delhi||Delhi court dismisses police plea seeking 5-day custody of Navneet Kalra||A Delhi court on Saturday dismissed police’s plea seeking five-day police custody of businessman Navneet Kalra in connection with the case of alleged hoarding of oxygen concentrators at a restaurant in south Delhi.Advocate Vineet Malhotra appearing for Kalra opposed the plea of Delhi Police seeking further police custody and said Kalra was fully cooperating in the investigation.On Thursday the court observed that police remand of the accused was not warranted in the case pertaining to the alleged hoarding of oxygen concentrators.The Enforcement Directorate (ED) on Friday conducted raids at 13 premises linked to Kalra and another businessman Gagan Duggal.The ED team seized 150 foreign brand liquor bottles from Kalra’s residence, officials told Hindustan Times.The ED’s probe, according to two officials, has revealed that both Kalra and Duggal had imported more than 7,000 oxygen concentrators from China in the past one month and sold them at exorbitant rates.The ED registered a case earlier this week to investigate the money trail of sale and purchase of oxygen concentrators and beneficiaries of hoarded concentrators.Earlier on May 7, the Delhi Police had busted an oxygen concentrator black-marketing racket during a raid and seized 105 such concentrators from two upscale restaurants in Delhi's Khan Market area. The two restaurants, namely Khan Chacha and Town Hall, are owned by Kalra.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-court-dismisses-police-plea-seeking-5-day-custody-of-navneet-kalra-101621673052294.html
22-05-2021||Delhi||'Vaccination for 18-44 age group to be halted in Delhi from today,' says Kejriwal; asks govt to ramp up production||Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Saturday urged the Centre to increase the quota of Covid-19 vaccine for the national capital as it faces a huge crunch of the shots. Reiterating his appeal, he requested the Centre to import Covid-19 vaccines at a national level instead of leaving it to the states to raise global tenders. The chief minister made four appeals to the Centre to boost vaccine availability in the country as he flagged vaccine crunch in Delhi.The chief minister cited the temporary halt in the vaccination of people in the age group of 18-44 years to flag the shortage of shots in Delhi. He said that the vaccine stocks for the category is over due to which their centres have been shut.Also read: India’s Covid-19 active caseload at over 2.9 million; 8 states contribute 69%Kejriwal further said that Delhi requires 80 lakh vaccine doses per month. “However, we only received 16 lakh vaccine doses for May." He also said that the quota of vaccines for the national capital has further been reduced, and referred to a letter from the Centre that only 8 lakh vaccine doses will be supplied for June."We have administered 50 lakh vaccine doses so far and to vaccinate all the adults in Delhi, around 2.5 crore additional doses are required," Kejriwal said, adding that if this pace continues then it might take more than 30 months to inoculate the adults against the virus.Emphasising the need for vaccines, he said that immunisation is the major tool required to fight against the second and upcoming third wave of the fatal virus.To ramp up the production of and availability of vaccines in the country, Delhi chief minister first recommended Bharat Biotech, the manufacturer of India's homegrown vaccine Covaxin, to share its formula with other companies.He also suggested the government ask the vaccine-producing companies to step up their production on war footing in the next 24 hours.The chief minister urged the government to grant approval to all international vaccines within the next 24 hours without any delay. He also suggested the Centre to grant approval to international vaccine manufacturers to produce vaccines in the country.Also read: Sonia Gandhi writes to Modi over shortage of mucormycosis drugFurther, he reiterated his concern and urged the government to import vaccines at a national level and not let states compete for vaccines in the international market. Kejriwal said states competing with each other for vaccines can harm the global image of the country.He also said that the government will also be able to talk with the international governments and can directly bulk order vaccines through the companies which will aid the inoculation process in India.India has so far administered more than 19.33 crore vaccine doses through over 2.7 million sessions across the country, according to the health ministry.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/cm-kejriwal-appeals-centre-to-increase-covid-19-vaccine-quota-for-delhi-101621669569134.html
22-05-2021||Delhi||Delhi hits 5 million jabs but few doses left for 18+||The national capital has all but run out of coronavirus vaccines for adults below the age of 45, the Delhi government said on Friday, announcing that centres catering to this age group will be shut from Saturday with no new stocks expected for the rest of the month. Private hospitals administering vaccines to people in this age group will, however, continue to function.The announcement came on a day the Capital hit an important landmark, administering over 5 million vaccine doses – including first and second shots – since the exercise began on January 16. According to the Delhi government, at least 800,000 of these were given to people in 18-44 age group, for whom the drive began on May 1.“Delhi has crossed total 50 lakh (5 million) vaccination doses benchmark today (including first and second dose). But it’s unfortunate that we have to close our centres for 18+ age group because of non-availability of vaccine,” said deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia.Also Read| Delhi: As vaccine stock runs low, Sisodia calls for transparency in allocationOverall, about 26% of the population has received at least one dose -- the latest electoral rolls put Delhi adult population at about 15 million -- although the recipients are likely to include people from the neighbouring NCR towns of Noida, Ghaziabad, and Gurugram. Of the 5 million jabs, only 1.13 million, or 23%, are second shots.“From tomorrow, we will have to stop the vaccination for the 18-44 age group. This is a matter of regret and concern, since we have seen that the second wave has also significantly impacted people of younger ages. There have been cases as well as deaths in this age group,” said Aam Aadmi party leader Atishi, while sharing the government’s daily vaccination bulletin on Friday.“This is an age group that also wants to be vaccinated and is coming forward by registering in large numbers. Hence, we appeal to the Union government to make more doses available; otherwise we will have to halt vaccinations for this group entirely from Monday onwards,” she added.States have to buy their stock of vaccines for this age group directly from manufacturers on the basis of a Union government approved formula.According to government’s records, some centres for 18-44 group had a couple of hours’ worth of doses left for Saturday and no stocks are expected for the rest of this month.To be sure, the Capital has doses for people aged 45 and above, and private hospitals are carrying out vaccinations for the under-45 age group from stocks directly procured from the manufacturers.Also Read| Problem is supply, not distribution: Jain on antifungal for mucormycosisThe Union health ministry did not respond to requests for a comment on Delhi’s vaccine supplies. Centre has previously said that it will allot states doses -- even those that they procure directly -- using a formula based on their population and demographics in order to ensure no states are disadvantaged.For the month of May, India has a cumulative supply of 73 million doses, Union government officials said earlier this month. Half of the monthly production goes to the Union government that sends vials to states to vaccine people above the age of 44 for free.The remaining half is split between the state governments and private hospitals. Only the doses acquired by the state government are offered for free to the under-45 group – at private hospitals, these can cost between ₹900-1,250 depending on the facility and the vaccine.According to an affidavit filed by the Union government to the Supreme Court on May 9, the Centre has allocated 360,530 doses for Delhi government to acquire from the vaccine makers for administration to people below 45. This is separate from the doses acquired by private hospitals directly from the vaccine makers.On Friday, the Delhi government said that vaccination has been suspended in 235 of the 368 centres meant for the 18-44 age group. This includes 140 centres where Covaxin was being administered and had to be shut last week when the vaccine ran out.The remaining centres are likely to run out of doses within a few hours when they open on Saturday, Atishi said. “Collectively, these 133 centres have Covishield stocks which will not last for more than a few hours on Saturday. And we will be forced to suspend them too,” Atishi said.Also Read| Covid-19 in Delhi: Positivity rate drops to 4.76%, lowest in 45 daysShe added that for the 45-and-above age group, only second doses of Covaxin were being given. “We technically have Covaxin doses that would last for less than a day (for the 45 and above age group). So, we are managing things by vaccinating only people arriving at the centres for second doses. For this beneficiary group, we have eight days’ Covishield stock left. I urge the central government to intervene in this regard and ensure that we do not have to suspend vaccine centres for any group,” she said.At least three states -- Maharashtra, Chhattisgarh and Rajasthan -- too halted vaccinations for the 18-44 age group earlier in the month after a surge in demand meant the limited doses were quickly used up. Karnataka too suspended the drive for this age group but said on Friday it will resume it from the weekend. Tamil Nadu, which was short on doses for this category, began inoculating this category only on Friday.Experts said accelerating the vaccination drive is crucial in order to stave off another wave of cases. “In several states across the country, including Delhi, the case trajectory and positivity rates are going down at this point. This is the time to boost the vaccination drive. This period of decline in cases is an opportunity to increase vaccine coverage and protect large share of the population against potential waves in the coming days,” said Dr Lalit Kant, former head of the epidemiology and communicable diseases division at the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR).“A state like Delhi has seen the terrible consequences of a recent Covid-19 wave. We can’t let that happen again. Governments should take all possible steps to ensure increased production of vaccines, more supply and enable opening of more vaccine centres across the country to widen the drive and increase vaccine coverage at this point,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-hits-5-million-jabs-but-few-doses-left-for-18-101621645362923.html
22-05-2021||Delhi||IGST on personal O2 concentrators unconstitutional, says Delhi high court||The Delhi high court on Friday said the imposition of 12% Integrated Goods and Service Tax (IGST) on oxygen concentrators for personal use or those received as gifts is “unconstitutional”.A bench of justices Rajiv Shakdher and Talwant Singh said this is a George Floyd moment for the citizens of the country in a different setting where several of them were gasping for breath due to the shortage of medical oxygen.“The refrain is I can’t breathe, albeit, in a somewhat different context and setting; although in circumstances, some would say, vastly more horrifying and ghastlier. Chased and driven by the merciless novel coronavirus, the citizenry has been driven to desperation and despair,” the bench said.Quashing the May 1 notification by the Union finance ministry imposing 12% IGST on concentrators imported for personal use, irrespective of whether they are a gift or otherwise, the court said that the “virus has brought out the best and worst in people”.Also Read| ‘Those importing O2 devices can afford 12% IGST’: Centre tells Delhi HC“….We have messiahs. We have charlatans. We have hoarders. We have seen a kind and caring hand being struck out by strangers when they could have remained cocooned in the safety of their houses. Bravehearts, there are many; doctors, nurses, and personnel manning public institutions….,” the court noted in its 33-page order.The judgment came on a plea filed by advocate Siddharth Bambha for an 85-year-old Covid-19 patient who challenged 12% IGST being levied on oxygen concentrators after his nephew sent him the equipment as a gift from the US.To check the misuse of the oxygen concentrators being put to commercial purpose, the court said individuals importing concentrators for personal use or as gift, will have to furnish a letter of undertaking to the officer designated by the Centre that the device was not for commercial use.“Till such time an officer is designated by the State, it would be in order, if the importer were to address the undertaking to the joint secretary, customs and/or his/her nominee and handover the same to the officer detailed at the customs barrier,” the court said.Pursuant to the filing of the petition, the finance ministry issued a notification on May 3 exempting IGST on oxygen concentrators coming as donation or gifts for the state government or if procured through a canalizing agency. However, individuals were not included in the list for exemption.Also Read| QR-code system to regulate distribution of O2 devices in DelhiSenior advocate Sudhir Nandrajog along with advocate Bambha for the petitioners argued that such distinction was violative of the Constitution.The court agreed and said that such distinction is “arbitrary”, “unreasonable” and in violation of Article 14 of the Constitution.The Centre, in its affidavit, argued that any person importing concentrator for personal use or has sources for receiving such supplies in gifts will be in a better position to afford the nominal 12% IGST as compared to others who source it through commercial channels.The Centre said imposition of tax or deciding rates does not come under judicial review. It said that if the argument of the petitioner is accepted, then it will lead to absurd consequences and interpretations, wherein citizens will be seeking exemption from property tax, since housing is an essential facet of the right to life under Article 21 of the Constitution.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/igst-on-personal-o2-concentrators-unconstitutional-says-delhi-high-court-101621634409549.html

22-05-2021||Delhi||Families homeless after rain floods over 25 hutments||Several tenements on the floodplains of the Yamuna near east Delhi’s Mayur Vihar have been inundated in incessant rain over the past two days, rendering over 25 families homeless. Locals alleged that mounds of soil and concrete waste, dumped on the floodplains this February, exacerbated the flooding.Environment activists had raised the alarm about the dumping of soil in the area in February itself. Activists had alleged that the central public works department (CPWD), undertaking the construction of the new Parliament building using private developers, had been allowing the dumping of construction waste — including debris and soil from the site on the floodplains — in violation of an order of the National Green Tribunal (NGT).CPWD officials had, however, denied the allegations back in February. When Hindustan Times reached out to CPWD on Friday, officials refused to respond.“Nearly 25 houses got flooded over the past two days. The situation has been aggravated by the mounds of mud and waste dumped there. A lake of sorts has formed amid the mounds and the hutments are right in the middle of the lake,” said Dev Pal, a local resident and field researcher for citizens’ group, Housing and Land Rights Network, which had filed a petition against the dumping in the area in February. While dumping has been put on hold since February, their fears of flooding have come true, said residents.“We had feared that houses will be inundated in the event of heavy rain. Our fears have come true,” said Pal, who added that people living in the area were worried about their houses getting buried under the sand mounds and were seeking rehabilitation. “Nearly 70 families are affected by all this and nearly 25 of them have been rendered homeless by the flooding. If no steps are taken, the crisis will be much worse during the coming monsoon,” said Pal.The 25 families are now living on the road till the flood water recedes. “Water has accumulated in our homes and about 60-70 people are affected. There has been no respite from the rain since Tuesday. We are struggling to get in and out of our homes,” said Meena, who goes by her first name, and has been living in the area for the past 26 years.She said residents like her only want to be rehabilitated to a safe and secure place by the authorities. “During the day, we move to the main road with charpoys and live there. The nights are more difficult. The soil mounds and water have mixed and there is slush all around us,” said Meena.Delhi Development Authority did not comment on the flooding issue nor on the residents’ demand for rehabilitation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/families-homeless-after-rain-floods-over-25-hutments-101621634584973.html
22-05-2021||Delhi||Over 800k migrants left Delhi after lockdown announced: Govt||At least 800,000 migrant workers travelled from Delhi to their home states in the first four weeks of lockdown in the Capital, nearly half of them in the first week, a report by the Delhi government said, highlighting that buses and other arrangements were made for labourers to avoid a repeat of last year’s crisis.Between April 19, when the lockdown was imposed to arrest a crushing fourth wave of infections, and May 14, 807,032 passengers took buses from three interstate bus terminals (ISBTs) in Delhi to go to other states. These buses were arranged by the governments of Delhi, Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand specially for migrant workers in addition to the daily buses plying from the terminals.“The timely coordination with transport authorities of neighbouring states especially Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand by the Delhi government has helped about eight lakh migrant workers reach their destination without any difficulty. There was no complaint of overcharging as the interstate buses were owned and operated by the respective state governments,” read the report by the state transport department.On April 19, a weekend curfew in Delhi was turned into a full lockdown for six days. At the time, the city was clocking roughly an average of 20,000 cases a day, nearly every third person tested returned a positive result , and hospitals were overrun with patients, and fast running out of oxygen and key drugs. Since then, the lockdown has been extended four times even as daily infections and positivity rates have plunged.Also Read| Covid-19 cases down, Delhi begins preparations for third waveWhile announcing the lockdown, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal appealed to migrant workers to not leave the city and assured them that the government will take care of them. Soon after, migrants started gathering at the three ISBTs at Kashmere Gate, Sarai Kale Khan and Anand Vihar.But unlike last year -- when a nationwide lockdown on March 25 prompted tens of thousands of panicked workers to throng ISBTs and wait for 12-16 hours for a bus, or walk hundreds of kilometres back home -- Delhi government officials had negotiated bus arrangements beforehand with other state governments, especially Uttar Pradesh.“The situation was better handled this time and there was visibly less crowding at ISBTs, especially in Anand Vihar, because of better coordination with Delhi Police, proper ground management by the concerned district magistrates and timely coordination with neighbouring states. We also are still offering free meals to anyone who walks up to our hunger relief centres. The UPSRTC [UP state road transport corporation] also played a very proactive role this time and deployed a huge number of buses as soon as the lockdown in Delhi was announced. So, things were planned in advance this time,” said state transport minister Kailash Gahlot.To be sure, there are no current estimates to indicate how many migrants have returned to the Capital because the lockdown is still in effect.Nearly half of the total - 379,604 passengers - left during the first week of the lockdown. In the following weeks, the number of passengers gradually declined to 212,448 (second week), 122,490 (third week) and 92,490 (fourth week), said the report. It also stated that within the city, Delhi Transport Corportation (DTC) and cluster buses facilitated 827,905 passengers to be dropped at the ISBTs and railway stations. To be sure, the Delhi Disaster Management Authority allowed movement of people travelling through ISBT, airports and railway stations during the ongoing lockdown.Also Read| Covid-19: Delhi makes new tracing push with revised targetsAt least 21,879 trips were made by buses, of which 8,074 were carried out in the first week. Additional government data showed a majority of the passengers travelled to Uttar Pradesh, which operated 17,762 additional buses from Anand Vihar and Kaushambi ISBTs. These two bus terminals are located along the Delhi-UP border; Anand Vihar falls under the Delhi government’s jurisdiction and Kaushambi is with the UP administration. The Anand Vihar and Kaushambi terminals alone handled the 689,642 passengers during the four weeks.Uttarakhand also deployed additional 2,000-3,000 buses. Haryana, Punjab and Bihar administrations did not deploy any additional buses.Gahlot said last year, rumours of special UP government buses forced thousands of migrants to gather overnight at Anand Vihar, but transport properly began only after 12 hours, by when the crowd had swelled to almost a kilometre.Dheeraj Sahu, UP transport commissioner and managing director of UPSRTC, said on the first day of the lockdown in Delhi this year, the state transport unit arranged for at least 5,000 additional trips from Anand Vihar and Kaushambi. He said the UPSRTC pulled three-fourth of its buses from western UP and diverted them to Anand Vihar for migrant workers.“We arranged everything in a very short notice. As soon as the Delhi government informed us about the lockdown, we called a high-level meeting at Lucknow, and it was decided that UPSRTC should put all its might in transporting people from Anand Vihar and Kaushambi so that we do not see a repeat of what happened last year. It was decided that UPSRTC will deploy additional buses for migrant workers apart from the usual 1,000 buses operated per day from these points. Almost three-fourth of all our buses operating in the western UP region were pressed to service at Anand Vihar and Kaushambi,” Sahu said.The Delhi government report said that this time, the crowd was also lower because trains were operational, unlike the last lockdown when railway stations were shut. “Yet, buses are the first choice of migrant workers because it is slightly cheaper and it is more accessible to their home villages than a railway station,” said a senior transport official. Last year, trains for migrant workers were started only after a month of lockdown on May 1.HT tried to find similar passenger data from last year, but the transport department said such a record was not available because in 2020, all forms of transport were prohibited during the nationwide lockdown.The state also arranged 500 cluster buses to ferry workers from Delhi to far-flung places in neighbouring states.The buses didn’t have any restriction on who could board them but officials said the high number of outward trips in the first week coupled with the lockdown -- which discouraged non-emergency travel -- meant that an overwhelming majority of those travelling were migrants.“The report states the number of passengers who boarded interstate buses from Delhi including the additional buses deployed by various states. The weekly break-up of the same shows that the demand for such transport services was highest during the first week, indicating it is mostly migrant workers and their families who were using these buses to reach their villages,” a second transport department official said.Debolina Kundu, professor at the national institute of urban affairs, said, the governments should not only prepare healthcare facilities for the potential third wave, but also provide adequate facilities for the migrant workers to avert a mass exodus."Experts have already warned of a third wave, so to avoid similar migrant issues from cropping up the governments need to ensure three basic things before imposing a lockdown again - a place to live, a social security from the government in the form of financial assistance and free rations irrespective of identity proof. Most of the migrant workers in Delhi have no option but to leave because they are tenants and live on rent. Affordable rental housing complexes, announced by the central government should be created expeditiously to ensure they have a place to live on such occasions. They must be given some free ration and employment guarantee. But, these measures should come a little ahead of the announcement of the lockdown, so that the workers have some confidence in the system and do not leave the city," said Kundu.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/over-800k-migrants-left-delhi-after-lockdown-announced-govt-101621636995573.html
22-05-2021||Delhi||SN Shrivastava formally given charge as commissioner of Delhi Police||The ministry of home affairs (MHA) on Friday appointed SN Shrivastava as Delhi’s police commissioner, a position he has been holding since February 28 last year, in what appeared to be an administrative formality.“With the approval of Competent Authority, SN Shrivastava, IPS (UT cadre: 1985 batch), presently holding the additional charge of Commissioner of Police, Delhi is hereby appointed to the post of Commissioner of Police, Delhi with effect from the date of assumption of the charge of the post and until further orders,” the MHA order said.Shrivastava was brought to Delhi Police, his parent police department, last year from the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) after communal riots in the Capital broke out amid protests at several places against the Citizenship Amendment Act, 2019. The controversial act, brought by the Centre, offers to give Indian citizenship to minorities from Bangladesh, Pakistan and Afghanistan.Shrivastava had earlier headed key units of Delhi Police, including the special cell and traffic.In the last 14 months under his command, Delhi Police has filed multiple charge sheets in the Delhi riots case, and he has handled the police force through the difficult Covid-19 pandemic, when the role of the force has expanded beyond its primary role of crime-fighting.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/sn-shrivastava-formally-given-charge-as-commissioner-of-delhi-police-101621628920662.html

As the world celebrates International Day for Biodiversity on Saturday, it’s relevant to put the spotlight on how seven biodiversity parks in the city not only maintain green cover, but also make an important contribution in increasing the counts of birds and animals.Delhi is home to the Yamuna Biodiversity Park, Aravalli Biodiversity Park, Neela Hauz Biodiversity Park, Tilpath Valley Biodiversity Park, Northern Ridge (Kamla Nehru Ridge), Tughlaqabad Biodiversity Park, and Kalindi Biodiversity Park.Data from each of these parks show that, since their inception, the count of species within them has spiked.Faiyaz A Khudsar, scientist-in-charge at the Yamuna Biodiversity Park, which came up in 2002, said, “The Delhi Development Authority’s biodiversity parks have assumed global importance as models for replication. They not only help conserve the vanishing natural heritage from urban centres but also serve many more functions, such as serving as vegetation filters for non-point source air pollutants, imparting resilience to climate change, enhancing water availability to the city and providing cultural, conservational and educational services.”Data showed that in the Yamuna Biodiversity Park, which is spread across 184 hectares, the count of terrestrial plants increased from 90 in 2002 to 915 in 2020. The count of mammals in the park went up from just four to 22, butterflies increased from 11 to 82; number of fishes increased from nil to 18, and the number of aquatic plants went up from two to 101 last year. The bird species count increased from 37 in 2002 to 203 in 2020.In 2016, the park also saw the arrival of a leopard.The ecology at the 280-hectare Aravalli Biodiversity Park is no different. When the park was established in 2005, it had 150 species of terrestrial plants, which increased to 950 in 2020, and the count of mammals went up from five to 19 in the same period.Data also showed that the number of butterflies went up from 13 in 2005 to 113 last year, and the number of birds increased from 42 to 209.CR Babu, who heads the biodiversity parks project of Centre for Environmental Management of Degraded Ecosystems (CEMDE) at Delhi University, said that these parks are nature reserves, which harbour natural heritage and have functions such as carbon sequestration — a process in which carbon dioxide is removed from the atmosphere and stored in the plant body and soil, recharging groundwater and controlling the micro climate of an area, among others.“Over the next few years, we will undertake more studies to find out how these parks are functioning. This will help us get important information, such as the amount of carbon they are able to sequester and whether they are able to recharge groundwater levels and control local temperature,” Babu said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/more-birds-and-animals-make-delhi-s-7-nature-parks-their-homes-101621628814019.html
22-05-2021||Delhi||Delhiwale: Kailash Colony’s actor-cum-poet||While Delhi passes through one of its most tragic times in living history, it has citizens distilling their experiences into art.Isolated within home in Kailash Colony, actor Siddharth Sethi, 20, is away from fellow actors and rehearsals, away from the audience and the stage. “Theatre was my escape into a reality other than mine,” he says on a WhatsApp video chat. With the city in lockdown, he is flailing about in only one reality.This reality too is rich, comprising of his “dada,” parents, and younger sister, Suhani, who is holding his mobile for this photo shoot. There are online classes to stay busy—Mr Sethi is a literature student in Delhi University’s Hansraj College. Plus, he recently acted in two plays performed on zoom; the virtual audience were encouraging college mates and folks from DU’s “theatre circuit.” He also penned a poem in the ongoing isolation “as a let out to reassure myself that this too shall pass.” Mr Sethi chose an uncommon word for the title. We won’t give away its meaning. Go and flip through your heirloom dictionary or read the poem.KadotaThis fire burns my bellyThe cries mar my sleepThese silences give me shiversThe spirits wound me deepAway from the chains of my beingMy freedoms lure me strong,Rotting in my sickness, desolateI struggle every breath,I struggle to belong,But not any more.My skies crave my warmthMy seas swallow my desiresThese thorns on my skin, thrive on my memoriesMy pains suck my soul, they loathe my fallacious attire.My fears conspire against meWith the evils that reside in my eyesMy sanity give me shiversMy truths worship my liesBut not any more.My boundaries set my lengthsMy eternity fiddles with my hopeMy touch, longs for a ventMy sighs, my desires grope.Barren deserts mock my stories,With glee, they imitate my tears,The storms sing me lullabyThe tot within though,Restless it appears.But not any more.My chest enthrones my past;With pride, with power, with careMy touch comforts my soulOn my body, my scars lay bare.I’m struggling, for the good I believeFor I’m struggling for myself,against myselfTo be who I am, and not who I am.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhiwale-kailash-colony-s-actorcumpoet-101621627859242.html
22-05-2021||Delhi||Over 100 air ambulances operated from IGIA in April||The General Aviation terminal at the Delhi’s Indira Gandhi International airport has handled about 100 air ambulance movements in April alone. The flights were operated between Delhi and airports across the country and to several international locations like Germany, Dubai, Zurich, Kathmandu, Dhaka, etc, said airport officials aware of the matter.According to Delhi International Airport Ltd (DIAL), which runs the airport, currently, there are 12 aircraft owned by different charter jet operators which are permitted to operate as air ambulances from IGI airport. These aircraft have completed at least 100 movements in April alone, ferrying Covid patients to different states and even abroad, said DIAL officials.“Most of these air ambulances function from the newly constructed dedicated General Aviation (GA) apron. While the pilots and the crew travel from the GA Terminal, the patients’ movement takes place through dedicated airside gates to avoid any chances of contamination inside airport terminals. On board, Covid patients are kept in German-made isolation pods, a protective cover with oxygen arrangement,” said an official.Under the current circumstances, patients are to be accompanied only by a doctor, a paramedical officer and a nurse. These are certified doctors trained to handle critical care while flying, the operator added.DIAL also said it ensures timely sanitisation of the ambulance aircraft and dedicated passage for patients to board the ambulance.“Regular fumigation and use of particular garbage bins for used PPE kits are also ensured. Our staff follow all the precautionary protocols to comply with Covid-19 safety measures while handling emergency activities at the Delhi airport,” an official said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/over-100-air-ambulances-operated-from-igia-in-april-101621629183448.html
22-05-2021||Delhi||Deep Sidhu among 16 named in first charge sheet over Red Fort violence||Punjabi actor-turned-activist Deep Sidhu is among the 16 people who have been named in the charge sheet filed by Delhi Police’s crime branch in a Delhi court in connection with the case of alleged violence and vandalism at the Red Fort during the farmers’ tractor rally on Republic Day, senior police officers aware of the development said on Friday.The charge sheet running into 3,224 pages was submitted before a duty metropolitan magistrate in Tis Hazari Court on April 17 (Monday), the officers quoted above said. The chief metropolitan magistrate will hear the matter now on May 28.All the 16 people named in the charge sheet were arrested. While Sidhu and 12 others have been released on bail, three accused, identified as 23-year-old Dutch national of Indian origin, Maninderjit Singh alias Moni, Khempreet Singh and Jabrajang Singh, are still in judicial custody.Also Read| Deep Sidhu, accused in Jan 26 violence, granted bail by Delhi court in 2nd caseA senior police officer associated with the probe said even as the investigation into the case is still in progress and many suspects are yet to be arrested, the charge sheet was filed to meet the deadline of 90 days from the date of the first arrest.“A charge sheet has to be filed within 90 days of the first arrest in any case. The three arrested men would have got advantage in getting bail had the police failed to file the charge sheet in time. We will file supplementary charge sheets as and when required, and depending upon the progress in the investigation,” the officer said.According to the officer, names of many farm leaders have been mentioned in the contents of the charge sheet but “nobody has been listed in the accused column because as of now as their role is still being probed”.Two separate cases were registered in connection with the violence at the Red Fort. While one case involving serious charges such as rioting, attempt to murder, and criminal conspiracy was registered on the police’s complaint, the second case was registered on the basis of a complaint filed by the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI), which is the custodian of the Mughal-era fort. Sidhu was arrested in both the cases.The police are yet to file a charge sheet in the second case.Also Read| Farm unions write to PM Modi, seek resumption of dialogueAt least seven key suspects, including gangster-turned-activist Lakha Sidhana, are still absconding in the main Red Fort case (registered on the police’s complaint). Police have announced a ₹1 lakh reward each for information on Sidhana, Jugraj Singh, Gurajant Singh, and Gurjot Singh. Three more absconding suspects – Buta Singh, Jajbir Singh, and Sukhdev Singh – carry a ₹50,000 reward each on their arrest.Farmers who have been protesting against three farm laws since November last year took out a tractor rally on January 26. The rally turned violent when a group of protesters deviated from the pre-decided route and entered the Capital. After a face-off with police at ITO, the protesters moved towards Red Fort, vandalised property and clashed with policemen.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/deep-sidhu-among-16-named-in-first-charge-sheet-over-red-fort-violence-101621626702349.html
22-05-2021||Delhi||Covid-19 in Delhi: Positivity rate drops to 4.76%, lowest in 45 days||The Covid-19 test positivity rate in the national capital on Friday dropped below 5% for the first time in 45 days, as the number of new infections continued to wind down in a clear sign that Delhi may be heading out of the punishing surge of infections that battered the city’s health care infrastructure, and left thousands dead in a matter of weeks.The positivity rate — proportion of samples tested that return positive for Covid-19 – in Delhi fell to 4.76%, down from 5.5% the previous day. Before this, the lowest positivity rate in the city was 4.64% on April 4.At its peak of the April-May surge, the positivity rate hit an all-time high of 36.24% on April 22.The test positivity rate is a crucial metric to judge the spread of an infection in an area. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends a number below 5% for a two-week period for an infection to be considered under control.In the past seven days, 7.58% of all samples have tested positive in the Capital, down sharply from 17.93% in the previous week ending May 14.New cases too kept up their steady drop in the city, with 3,009 fresh infections logged, showed the Delhi government’s health bulletin on Friday. Delhi recorded 3,231 new infections on Thursday, and 3,846 cases the day before that.The seven-day average of cases, known as the case trajectory, dropped below the 5,000 mark on Friday for the first time in 43 days. A week ago on May 14, Delhi added an average of 12,588 cases every day.However, the daily death toll increased in Delhi on Friday, with 252 more people dying of the infection, the health bulletin showed, compared to 233 deaths the previous day. However, the seven-day average of deaths has dropped continuously for the past five days, from 312 on May 17 to 275 on Friday.To be sure, any drop in case trajectory generally takes 14 days to reflect on daily deaths as studies have shown that the median time between someone testing positive for Covid-19 and dying from it is around 13.8 days.Also Read| IGST on personal O2 concentrators unconstitutional, says Delhi high court“It is a good sign, but it is one day. We have to wait for at least the rolling weekly average to come below 5%; it would be better if it is 2%. And, even then, we shouldn’t think about easing all restrictions immediately,” said Dr Lalit Kant, former head of the department of epidemiology at the Indian Council of Medical Research. “A huge proportion of the population must have been exposed to the infection during the current wave; they will likely have some immunity for the next four to six months. We should use this time to prepare for the next surge.”The drop in new infections has led to a sharp fall in the active case count, which fell to 35,683 on Friday, down from 71,794 a week ago.Also Read| Over 800k migrants left Delhi after lockdown announced: GovtThis drop in active cases means that hospitalisations for the infection are also on the decline in the city. There were 11,388 people with the infection admitted to various city hospitals as on Thursday night. This means that almost 17,000 of the 28,490 beds earmarked for the treatment of Covid-19 were vacant as on Friday evening, putting the occupancy at 40.4%.As for intensive care unit (ICU) beds, 1,825 beds were vacant as on Friday evening according to the government’s Delhi Corona app, pegging the occupancy rate at 73.3%. At the peak of the current surge, Delhi had run out of ICU beds entirely.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/covid19-in-delhi-positivity-rate-drops-to-4-76-lowest-in-45-days-101621626744122.html
22-05-2021||Delhi||Hoarding case: ED raids on Kalra and Duggal’s premises in South Delhi||The Enforcement Directorate (ED) on Friday raided the premises of businessmen Navneet Kalra and Gagan Duggal in connection with its money laundering probe into alleged hoarding and black marketing of oxygen concentrators, people familiar with the development said.Among the places raided included their residences at Mandi Road in South Delhi’s Mehrauli and Kalra’s restaurants – Khan Chacha, Town Hall, and Nega & Ju – as well as Dayal Opticals in the upscale Khan Market, officials said. A team separately searched Kalra’s bank lockers.Officials told HT that the ED team recovered 150 foreign brand liquor bottles from Kalra’s residence.The agency said UK-based businessman Gagan Duggal, managing director of Matrix Cellular International Services Limited (Matrix), was working with Kalra in importing the concentrators to India and selling at inflated prices.ED’s probe, according to two officials cited above, has revealed that both Kalra and Duggal imported more than 7,000 oxygen concentrators from China in the past one month and sold at exorbitant prices by claiming that the concentrators are made with German technology.“The forensic examination of the concentrators has revealed that they were low quality equipment. Kalra and Duggal bought these in China and same were routed to India via Hong Kong,” said the first officer, who asked not to be named.ED’s probe has revealed that the import price per unit of oxygen concentrator for Kalra and Duggal was ₹15,000 but they were charging R69,999 per unit from buyers. “They took advantage of a raging pandemic and made huge profit by cheating the public,” said another ED officer, who also asked to remain anonymous.The agency registered a case earlier this week to investigate the money trail of sale and purchase of oxygen concentrators and beneficiaries of hoarded concentrators. The federal anti-money laundering probe agency has powers to attach properties if established that money made by the accused is proceeds of crime.Kalra was arrested from a farmhouse in Gurugram on Sunday evening. He is currently in judicial custody.The Delhi Police recovered 524 oxygen concentrators from three restaurants – Khan Chacha, Town Hall and Nege & Ju – owned by Kalra and from the office of Matrix Cellular between May 5 and May 7. Before Kalra, five people, including the manager of Nege & Ju restaurant, chief executive officer (CEO) and three senior officers of Matrix Cellular, were arrested after the recovery of the concentrators. However, all five were later released on bail with the court observing that it was unable to understand the offence they had committed as the government did not regulate the prices of the devices .In a statement after the arrest of CEO Gourav Khanna and other officials, Matrix said, “All materials procured by Matrix have been by way of import or purchase in India, after paying all relevant duties and taxes. Matrix has thereafter facilitated sale of such equipment / materials via it’s app or direct orders placed on the company, all of which have used formal banking channels based on tax invoices with an unimpeachable audit trail.”Samudra Sarangi, lead counsel for Matrix, said the company has filed documents before the high court to prove the allegations made by the police are misplaced. “Matrix has filed documents before the Delhi high court which prove the allegations of exorbitant pricing and deficient quality of oxygen concentrators are misplaced and incorrect. Matrix unequivocally denies any wrongdoing in the matter. The matter is currently before the courts and Matrix has faith that the legal process will vindicate it.”Kalra’s counsel, senior advocate Vikas Pahwa didn’t comment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/hoarding-case-ed-raids-on-kalra-and-duggal-s-premises-in-south-delhi-101621626782237.html
22-05-2021||Delhi||Road safety expert Prof Dinesh Mohan dies of Covid at 75||Dinesh Mohan, honorary professor of the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Delhi, and leading road safety and transportation expert, the man behind the now scrapped bus rapid transit (BRT) system in Delhi, succumbed to Covid-19 on Friday. He was 75.Mohan was undergoing treatment for Covid-19 at Delhi’s St Stephen’s Hospital when he died on Friday morning following a cardiac arrest.Colleagues, friends, and students remembered Mohan as a “great humanist”, and a fervent supporter of human rights, besides being a noted name in academia. An alumnus of IIT-Bombay and University of Michigan, Mohan was also known for his work in areas of advancing motorcycle helmet design.Professor Mohan started his career with the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety in Washington DC, USA. Since 1976, he was with IIT-Delhi’s Centre of Biomedical Engineering, where he did pioneering work through the establishment of the Transportation Research and Injury Prevention Program (TRIPP) at the institute.In a message on Friday, IIT-Delhi director V Ramgopal Rao said, “He was a great humanist and fervent supporter of individual rights. The Delhi Declaration on People’s Right to Safety is one such example, besides many others...It is a huge loss for all faculty, students, and staff at TRIPP and all those known to him at IIT-Delhi and the traffic safety community in India and the world. We pray to the almighty to give his family strength to overcome this huge loss.”Geetam Tiwari, professor of civil engineering and transportation planning, IIT-Delhi, said Mohan always rooted for more sustainable modes of public transport. “He designed Delhi’s BRT. The whole idea was there, but the press treated it very poorly, without understanding much. So, it was scrapped by the government,” she said.The BRT project was implemented by the chief minister Sheila Dikshit-led Congress government in 2008. However, it was not well-received, and scrapped in 2016.Delhi transport commissioner Ashish Kundra said Mohan was a doyen of sustainable urban transport. “A great thinker and a progressive mind, he always infused new ideas and energy for urban transport solutions in Delhi. I had sought time from him separately for guidance. But, that wasn’t meant to be,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/road-safety-expert-prof-dinesh-mohan-dies-of-covid-at-75-101621625454929.html
22-05-2021||Delhi||Another rain spell keeps Delhi’s AQI, mercury low||The Capital woke up to a surprise spell of rain on Friday caused by a fresh western disturbance, weather officials said, a day after incessant showers broke the all-time 24-hour rainfall record for May.Kuldeep Srivastava, head of the India Meteorological Department’s regional weather forecasting centre, said that till 8.30am on Friday, the Safdarjung weather station, considered the official marker for the city, received 2.6mm rainfall. The Palam observatory received 5.8mm rainfall, the Lodi Road station received 3.2mm, and Aya Nagar got 10.6mm.Weather officials said several parts of Delhi saw rain between 5am and 10am. However, Srivastava said that while Wednesday and Thursday’s showers were under the impact of cyclonic storm Tauktae, Friday’s rain was caused by a fresh western disturbance that passed over the Capital.“The residual clouds of Tauktae cyclonic storm have passed. What we saw on Friday was the impact of a fresh western disturbance. There could be some light rain in the early morning hours in Delhi and the National Capital Region (NCR) over the weekend. But temperatures will rise now,” said Srivastava.The rain and the gusty winds on Friday kept Delhi’s air quality in the “satisfactory” category for the third consecutive day. Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) recordings showed that the city’s overall air quality index (AQI) was 85. On Thursday, Delhi recorded an AQI of 58, also “satisfactory”.On Friday, IMD recordings showed that the maximum temperature at the Safdarjung observatory was 33.1 degrees Celsius, seven degrees below normal.The minimum temperature was 19.4°C, also seven degrees below normal.Met officials, however, said the temperature is expected to touch 39°C by May 29.Delhi, between Wednesday and Thursday, recorded the highest rainfall to ever be recorded in 24 hours in the month of May. On Wednesday-Thursday, Safdarjung weather station recorded 119.3 mm rainfall, induced by Cyclone Tauktae’s after-effects.Monsoon likely to keep May 31 date with KeralaThe monsoon advanced into some parts of southwest and most parts of southeast Bay of Bengal, and South Andaman Sea and Nicobar Islands on Friday, a day ahead of its normal onset date of May 22, said IMD.“Monsoon is likely to make an onset over Kerala around May 31, one to two days here or there,” Sunitha Devi, in charge of cyclones at IMD, said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/another-rain-spell-keeps-delhi-s-aqi-mercury-low-101621625589564.html
22-05-2021||Delhi||Problem is supply, not distribution: Delhi health minister Jain on antifungal for mucormycosis||State health minister Satyendar Jain on Friday said that the Capital was beset in its fight against the rising black fungus threat by a shortage of the antifungal medicine Amphotericin B, and added that there were no hiccups in its distribution.“There is a shortage of the medicine across the country; the Centre has taken control of it and it is being allocated as per quota to states. Delhi has been allocated around 2,000 doses,” said Jain in a press briefing.“Delhi had 197 people with the infection admitted to various hospitals till Wednesday night. Every patient needs several injections each day; if Delhi’s requirement is, say, 4,000 injections, and we are given 1,000 injections, there will be a problem. It is similar to the oxygen situation; when Delhi needed 600 MT of oxygen we were given 300 MT and people said there was a distribution problem.”The Delhi government has set up a four-member committee that looks at hospitals’ demand for the drug after patient information is submitted and gives a go-ahead for the Directorate General of Health Services to dispatch it. As per submissions in the Delhi high court, every patient needs 42 vials of the injection per week.Black fungus has been found mostly among people with uncontrolled diabetes, whose immunity is compromised, or among people who are given excessive steroids or immunity-modulating drugs such as tocilizumab. According to doctors, if left untreated, it could kill up to 80% of those infected. If not detected early, it affects the orbit of the eye and the mouth, resulting in people losing their vision or jaw during debridement — the process of removing dead tissue from an infection or wound.The country has seen a sharp rise in the number of mucormycosis cases as a complication in patients with Covid-19, forcing people and state governments to scramble for Amphotericin B, the only drug that can treat the fungal infection. In the Capital alone, about 200 patients are admitted in hospitals with the infection. Usually, major hospitals in the city see no more than 10 cases of the infection in a year.To address shortage of the drug, the Centre on Thursday allowed five more firms to manufacture Amphotericin B, even as the Delhi high court asked it to get medicines from abroad.To prevent the infection, Jain said, “Please take steroids only on the advice of a doctor. Do not continue taking the medicine even after the doctor has stopped it. In some diabetics, the sugar level shoots up because of steroid use and they have to be prescribed insulin injection. But, they stop taking it once they are home. Please don’t do that. At the moment, controlling diabetes is more important, you will be able to get off the injection in a few days.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/problem-is-supply-not-distribution-jain-on-antifungal-for-mucormycosis-101621624650713.html
