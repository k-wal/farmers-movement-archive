29-05-2021||Delhi||Kejriwal kickstarts drive-through Covid vaccination centre at Chhatrasal Stadium||Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Saturday launched the drive-through Covid-19 vaccination centre of the government at the Chhatrasal Stadium, where people above the age of 45 can get themselves vaccinated for free.“The Delhi government has started a drive-in vaccination facility here at the Chhatrasal stadium. People can come here in their cars, motorcycles, some are even on foot, and can get vaccinated here. The vaccination is free at this centre. Right now, this has been initiated for those above the age of 45 years because there is no vaccine for those below it. As soon as adequate vaccines arrive, vaccination for those below the age of 45 (18-45 years) will also be started," Kejriwal said.He said that the people are satisfied with the arrangements. "I spoke to some of the people who got themselves vaccinated here and they are very happy with the entire arrangement and by the fact that they got the jab," he added.He said the Delhi government has floated a global tender for vaccines and is making all efforts from its side, but big vaccine manufacturing companies want to deal with the Centre directly.“We have filed a global tender for vaccines. We are making all the efforts from our side but till now all the governments which filed a global tender, the outcomes of that have not been very fruitful. So, we have also filed it in the hope that a company comes forward, but on a general note from what I have understood is that all the big vaccine manufacturing companies of the world want to deal directly with the central government and are communicating directly with them. So only time will tell as to how successful the different state governments will be but we have filed a global tender from our side," he added.He said that Delhi has recorded 900 Covid-19 cases in the last 24 hours and the Delhi government will unlock more activities in a phased manner as and when the cases decrease.“Yesterday we announced that two activities - construction activities and factories can be opened up because the poor such as migrant laborers have faced the most difficulty during the lockdown. Today, only 900 cases have emerged for the first time, I hope that as and when the cases keep on decreasing in the upcoming weeks, we will continue to unlock further. We want the economic activities to come back on track so that the economy can be revived," he added.He said he can understand the troubles of the traders and their anxiety. "I read in the newspapers that they are a bit upset. I want to tell them that it was with great difficulty that we were able to control the situation by imposing a lockdown. I can understand their difficulty but they should be patient and should not rush. We also want their markets and shops to open up and as and when the situation comes under control, we will open up everything," Kejriwal further said.On the treatment of black fungus, the Delhi chief minister said the government has demanded medicines for the same. "I have black fungus data till yesterday. There are two kinds – that of Delhi government and that of private hospitals and the Central government hospitals on the other hand. In the Delhi Government hospitals, there are about 4,500 cases of black fungus. The central government hospitals are dealing directly with the Centre. We have demanded the medicines accordingly and I understand that there is a countrywide paucity of medicines. The Central government is giving whatever it can. As I understand, more injections of this medicine will be procured and will be distributed to all the state governments," he added.On the question of politicising the vaccine procurement, Kejriwal said that this is not the time for petty politics since the Delhi government is demanding vaccines to vaccinate all the people of Delhi to protect them from the Covid-19 pandemic.“We just want vaccines, where is the politicization in this? The people need vaccines, they should tell where should we get the vaccines from. The Central government has to procure the vaccines, after doing so they should give them to us and we will administer them to everyone. This is not the time for petty politics. This is not the time to play a blame game. This is not the time for finger-pointing. This is not the time for debate and counter. The country is suffering from a pandemic. The experience of all of the world shows that vaccination is the sole solution for this. Therefore, they should buy vaccines for the entire country and distribute them to the state governments. We will administer them. Why they are debating over this is beyond my understanding," he added.Earlier on Wednesday, Kejriwal inaugurated the city’s first drive-through Covid-19 vaccination centre, set up by Akash Healthcare Super Speciality Hospital in Vegas Mall in Dwarka’s Sector 14 for people aged between 18 and 45, and said more such centres would be set up in the national capital.Earlier in the day, Kejriwal claimed that the national capital reported less than 1,000 daily cases of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) for the first time since the second wave of pandemic grappled the nation. “Over the last 24 hours, around 900 Covid-19 cases have been reported in Delhi,” news agency ANI quoted Kejriwal as saying.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/kejriwal-kickstarts-drive-through-covid-vaccination-centre-at-chhatrasal-stadium-101622278304279.html

Titled Show for Cause, this event, scheduled for May 30, will have performances by students of across DU and even some artistes from Delhi-NCR. The two hour event, which is set to start at 6pm, will have around a dozen young performers who are keen to do their bit to support Covid relief work. The entry fee to the event is ₹100, but people can donate in excess, as per their choice. Post donation, an online link to the fundraiser will be shared with those attending the show. “Youngsters from DU and a few other performers will present songs, poetry and dance at the event. The proceeds from this will go to distribution of ration kits to children and street vendors in North Campus who have lost their livelihoods, which we will personally undertake. Those attending can also donate to AeSha for Friendships Foundation, which is catering to the needs of single mothers and women waste pickers in north east Delhi, New Seemapuri and Bhati Mines,” says Paripoorna Baxi, a student of Kirori Mal College, who heads the Girl Up – It’s Time, the Delhi chapter of the UN Foundation initiative Girl Up, which is organising this e-meet.Kashish Soni, a student of Lady Shri Ram College, who is looking forward to performing her original compositions on her ukulele and guitar, says, “In these rather difficult Covid-19 circumstances, being able to use my music to support fundraisers and help people in need has brought me close to my music, and has allowed me to contribute my tiny bit, alongside other artists from so many different backgrounds. It is a humbling experience.” “As a professional classical dancer, I have always believed that art spreads happiness and peace, but more than anything, brings one out of their ignorance,” says Annaika Ahuja, another performer at the event, adding, “Being a dancer is synonymous to who I am, my true identity. And I’m pleased to be a part of this initiative by GirlUp, raising not just funds but spreading joy and the magic of art in such dark times. I am grateful that I can showcase a piece of our culture through my performance, and I hope India will recover and stand tall, once again!” Baxi adds: “The major brunt of the pandemic has been taken by the poor, who have lost their livelihoods and have no way of providing for themselves or their families.

29-05-2021||Delhi||Navneet Kalra committed white-collar crime: Delhi Police to court in oxygen concentrator black marketing case||Businessman Navneet Kalra, accused in a oxygen concentrator black marketing case, committed a white-collar crime and earned profits by selling medical devices at exorbitant prices to those on death beds, the Delhi Police told a court on Saturday.During a recent raid, 524 oxygen concentrators, which are crucial medical equipment used for Covid-19 patients, were recovered from Khan Chacha, Town Hall, and Nege & Ju restaurants owned by Kalra. The restaurateur is in judicial custody till June 3.Chief Metropolitan Magistrate Arun Kumar Garg heard the bail application filed by the businessman who was arrested on May 17 for allegedly hoarding oxygen concentrators and selling them at inflated prices."His intention was to cheat people and make profit. This is a white-collar crime. He sold oxygen concentrators to needy people lying on death beds," additional public prosecutor Atul Shrivastava, representing the Delhi Police, told the court and sought rejection of Kalra's bail plea.The remarks by the Delhi Police come a day after Kalra, through senior advocate Vikas Pahwa, told the court that he had no criminal intent to cheat people and cannot be kept in pre-trial detention.During the course of the proceedings on Saturday, the prosecutor showed Kalra's oxygen concentrator brochures to the court, and said they were not premium or from Germany as claimed by the accused."Its flow was also below 35 per cent, and he sold it for more than ₹70,000 as against the MRP of ₹27,999," he added.On Kalra's contentions that he was merely helping those in need, the prosecutor said, "He was not doing any charity. If he had sold them at the cost price, it would have been a charity but he took a margin."The police further relied on a report by the Sriram Institute for Industrial Research on the oxygen concentrators' efficacy and submissions of doctors from the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS).Shrivastava said the doctors opined that the oxygen concentrators were not suitable for treatment of Covid-19 patients due to their low efficacy."It is useless and as good as a box. Using them for even mild and moderate patients would cause harm. It will accelerate death," the additional public prosecutor said.He further apprised the court about the gravity of the offence and sought rejection of bail on the grounds that the businessman tampered with evidence, deleted material from the device and gave a bad name to the society.The police have claimed that the concentrators were imported from China and were being sold at an exorbitant price of ₹50,000 to 70,000 a piece against its cost of ₹16,000 to ₹22,000.On May 5, a case was registered against Kalra under sections 420 (cheating), 188 (disobedience to order promulgated by public servant), 120-B (criminal conspiracy) and 34 (common intention) of the Indian Penal Code, the Essential Commodities Act and the Epidemic Diseases Act.The Enforcement Directorate (ED) has also registered a money laundering case against him.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/navneet-kalra-committed-white-collar-crime-delhi-police-to-court-in-o2-concentrator-black-marketing-case-101622272964827.html
29-05-2021||Delhi||Capital adds 1,141 Covid cases, positivity rate stays below 2%||The Capital on Friday recorded 1,141 new infections of Covid-19 and 139 more deaths, with the positivity rate remaining low at 1.6%, as city’s numbers continued its downward trend.This is the third consecutive day when the cases have remained below the 1,500 mark. With this, the seven-day average of new cases in the Capital, a statistic that denotes a region’s Covid curve, dropped to 1,533 cases a day the lowest in nearly two months, or since March 30 – highlighting Delhi’s remarkable turnaround from the massive fourth wave of infections.At its peak a little over a month ago, the seven-day average of new cases soared to a peak of 25,294 a day.As per the Delhi government’s health bulletin on Friday, there were 1,141 fresh cases detected in the past 24 hours from the 71,853 samples tested in the city, taking the total number of confirmed infections to 1,423,690. A total of 139 new deaths pushed the death toll from the deadly virus in the city to 23,951.On Thursday, 1,072 cases and 117 deaths were recorded, while the positivity rate had dipped to 1.5%. On Friday, the positivity rate stood at 1.6%. The test positivity rate had soared to 36% in the last week of April, coming down to around 1.5% now.Positivity rate is a crucial metric as experts say it shows how widespread the virus is in the community, and when a dropping positivity rate is coupled with decreasing new cases, it indicates that the spread of the virus is reducing within the community. Tracking a region’s positivity rate serves as a good barometer for whether cases are going to increase or decrease in the coming days.The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that the positivity rate from a region that has a comprehensive testing programme be at or below 5% for at least two weeks before it can be considered that the outbreak is under control. In Delhi, this number has been below the threshold for eight days now.With a view on dropping cases, Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Friday said it was time to start the unlock process, but warned that if the coronavirus cases start rising again, “we will have to stop the unlock exercise”, and appealed to people not to step out unless it is absolutely necessary.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/capital-adds-1-141-covid-cases-positivity-rate-stays-below-2-101622249958570.html

The monoclonal antibodies attach with the spike protein of the Sars-CoV-2 virus that causes Covid-19 and prevent the entry of the virus into the human cell.The therapy is administered to those at high risk of developing severe disease before the disease progresses on from mild or moderate category with no need for oxygen support. “The treatment is administered so that those at a high risk of developing severe disease and of mortality do not progress to that stage,” said Dr Rajesh Chawala of Indraprastha Apollo hospital.The therapy should not be administered to those who have a history of allergies or those who are dependent on oxygen because of other lung diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/covid19-65-yr-old-is-first-to-get-antibody-cocktail-therapy-101622246709333.html
29-05-2021||Delhi||IIT-D study on oxygen submitted to Delhi HC||The Delhi high court on Friday asked the state government to implement the recommendations of a study by IIT-Delhi to streamline the oxygen supply chain in the capital. The study was commissioned by the Delhi government on the suggestions of the court on May 5, to prepare for a possible third wave of Covid-19. Delhi government standing counsel (civil) Satyakam submitted the report to the high court on Friday.The report, curated by IIT-Delhi’s Professor Sanjay Dhir, is based on information provided by the Delhi government on various aspects of the issue. It illustrates nine challenges that the Delhi government has to overcome in order to improve the oxygen infrastructure in the Capital -- oxygen storage capacity, supply of oxygen from outside Delhi, GNCTD IT portal for oxygen management & ICCC (Delhi) dashboard, compatibility of nozzles, re-fillers’ capacity evaluation, pressure swing adsorption (PSA) plants, planning to set up of manufacturing units for oxygen production, shortage of cryogenic oxygen tankers, and scenario-building to plan infrastructure requirements for Covid-19 third wave.Delhi government’s standing counsel Rahul Mehra said a 13-member task force is already working on preparations for the third wave. “On instructions, broadly, we are all on the same page. We will surely implement to the extent possible,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/iitd-study-on-oxygen-submitted-to-delhi-hc-101622244916669.html
29-05-2021||Delhi||Jabs shortage ‘artificial’, says AAP over supply running low||Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) spokespersons Raghav Chadha and Atishi on Friday accused the central government of creating an “artificial scarcity” of vaccines in India by favouring supplies to private sector facilities over state governments, including Delhi.Alleging that the state was choking state governments of vaccine supplies and diverting stocks to private facilities — which charge for doses, unlike public centres, forcing people to pay for vaccines.Delhi BJP spokesperson Praveen Shankar Kapoor called these allegations “unfounded.”“The Delhi government has run out of vaccines, forcing centres for the 18-45 age group to be suspended. These centres offered vaccines for free. But the private centres, which charge between ₹1,000 and ₹1,500 for a dose, have adequate stocks. How are they getting the supplies? It’s because the central government is favouring the private sector over the state governments when it comes to ensuring supply of vaccines. It also looks like doses meant for the state governments are being diverted to the private sector,” said AAP spokesperson and Rajendra Nagar MLA Raghav Chadha.Union health ministry spokespersons did not respond to requests for comment.India’s Covid-19 vaccination drive follows two tracks: the Centre offers free doses meant for those 45 and above; then there is the acquisition by state governments and private health care institutions to give doses for any group they choose to cater to.The Union government has made it mandatory for vaccine makers in India to keep 50% of their doses for the central supply, while the remaining will be evenly split between private procurers and state governments.The BJP hit back at the AAP’s allegations.“The Centre has not caused any scarcity of vaccines,” said BJP spokesperson Kapoor.“AAP leaders should know that creating scarcity and putting people at discomfort is the chief minister’s speciality,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/jabs-shortage-artificial-says-aap-over-supply-running-low-101622242927851.html
29-05-2021||Delhi||Delhiwale: A Miranda House poet||This Delhi University (DU) student hasn’t been to her college yet. “I belong to the cursed 2020 batch,” says Rangoli Sharma on phone, blaming the pandemic that has forced her campus life to be substituted by online classes. In fact, she is far from Delhi, at her home in Churu, Rajasthan.Also read: High daily testing allowed isolation of Covid patientsIn her early 20s, Ms Sharma is a post-grad student in Miranda House, a college for women. Having spent all her life in places other than Delhi, she was looking forward to the experience of being a DU student. Especially because she always viewed its women colleges as “cradles of feminism” where “women can choose to be more of themselves than they can be at any other place; they become kind, opinionated and confident, and I always wished to be one.” With the unpredictability of the ongoing pandemic, there is a possibility of Ms Sharma ending up as a Miranda House alumnus without any personal memories of its canteen and corridors.She wrote a poem last month, “after seeing requests for oxygens, injections, ventilators and life on social media.”This is not a love poemWorld is always sufferingand people are always dyingbut it is only in the times of warthat we are more scared and kinderfor ‘people’ can be usmore than ever this timeas children in 6th gradewe used to discuss world warsand guessed what the third one would be formany of us would say “water”little did we knowit could be on the air we breatheand dying in the arms of a loved onecould be a fearful act in itselfI can never understandhow does one attempt to write love poemsor one dreams of world peaceor one thinks of building houseswhen there is a war going ona war no one deserveda war everyone has to be a part ofso, this, is everything but a love poemfor all those who are a part of this warthis, is a poem of rage and helplessnessof suffering and tearsof shattered dreams and smilesof undone last rituals and unsaid goodbyesand no, it should not end on a note of hopefor it would have lost its similes and personificationtill the time it comes to an endso, this poem, doesn’t completely rhymeit rather chooses to be blurry and uncertainlike the times it has been written inlike the person it has been written bylike the world it has been written forand the only comfort it can offer youis in the fact that you are not alone.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhiwale-a-miranda-house-poet-101622242446360.html
29-05-2021||Delhi||High daily testing allowed isolation of Covid patients||With vaccines in short supply, testing and isolating people quickly is the best way to keep infections under control. Experts say more testing helps trace and isolate Covid patients, set up containment zones, and track the size and spread of an outbreak.Delhi is the runaway leader in testing among the country’s 20 most populous regions, shows an HT analysis, highlighting another important factor that helped the city get control over its deadliest Covid wave. The Capital tested 955,849 samples per million people till Wednesday, nearly four times the national average of 252,809. Jammu & Kashmir, in second, tested 633,133 per million.Click here for complete coverage of Covid-19Delhi has tested twice the proportion of its population compared to other states with good testing strategies, such as Kerala, Karnataka, and Telangana.In all, the city has conducted over 19 million tests till Friday.What turned out to be crucial was that even at the height of the fourth wave, when every third person was testing positive and labs were overwhelmed, the city administration did not let the number of daily tests drop below 60,000. Moreover, the city kept conducting a high number of the more accurate RT-PCR (reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction) test.At least 65% of the over 257,000 tests in April and 76% of the 193,000 in May were RT PCR, considered the gold standard in testing, even as nationally the proportion of the less accurate rapid antigen tests (RAT) increased as governments ramped up testing during the second wave of infection. At the peak of the infection, when the positivity rate was 36% and about 25,000 new cases were emerging every day, it also meant that the 25,000 people were being isolated from the rest of the population every day to break the chain of transmission.“Delhi has been a model state nationally in terms of testing since the first Covid wave. Against the national average of 1,500 tests per million population per day, Delhi has consistently been doing 4,000 tests for several months now, which is the highest nationally and among the highest globally.”Experts said this played a role in Delhi controlling the wave.“The rapid antigen tests are known to miss one out of every two positive cases. Once a person gets a negative report, albeit using an RAT, they are likely to go out in the society and infect others if they are asymptomatic carriers of the infection. Ideally, all tests should be conducted using RT-PCR but it is not possible to do so in such a populous country,” said Dr Harsh Mahajan, president of healthcare association NatHealth and founder of Mahajan Imaging that does RT-PCR tests in Delhi.“What is good though is that Delhi maintained the 70:30 ratio for RT-PCR tests. Had that not been the case, more people with the infection would have been out and about and infected others,” he added.RT-PCR and other molecular tests amplify the genetic material of the virus extracted from the swab sample to detect an infection. They are, therefore, more accurate than the rapid antigen tests that detect the presence of viral proteins without any amplification.When Delhi first imposed a weekend lockdown on April 17, the seven-day average of daily samples had touched a peak of 99,776 – the most recorded in the city. The number of samples tested crossed the 100,000-mark on five occasions in the first two weeks of April.However, the imposition of the lockdown brought down the number of tests, which Delhi health minister Satyendar Jain attributed to a stop in testing at transit points like railway stations and interstate bus terminals. Still, the city on average tested over 70,000 samples daily, including in the city’s rural areas.“During this wave, we have seen a high number of cases being reported from the rural areas of Delhi as well. This was not the case during the last wave. To ensure all cases get detected quickly, a high number of tests – nearly 10,000 to 12,000 a day – is being conducted in districts with rural pockets such as Southwest,” Jain said last week.Another challenge the city faced as cases rose in April was lab technicians getting infected, leading to long delays in sample collection and results, resulting a crucial lag period in which people could unknowingly infect others. The government, on April 22, reiterated its May 2020 order asking labs to release reports within 48 hours of collection to check the delay in infected patients getting isolated.Also read: GST Council forms GoM for tax slabs of Covid essentials“Testing has to be done aggressively even when the number of cases is low. And, this is not just from the government’s point of view, people should also be willing to come out and get tested. If that happens, then the government will know in which locations the number of cases are on the rise and localised lockdowns can be implemented to stop the spread of the infection to the rest of the city,” said Dr Amit Singh, associate professor, Centre for Infectious Disease Research, Indian Institute of Science, Bengaluru.In addition to tests, experts have suggested the government boost genomic sequencing in view of the looming threat of new variants. So far, Delhi has sequenced the third highest number of samples after Kerala and Maharashtra, both states with a much higher population. Of the 19,000 samples sequenced by Indian Sars-CoV-2 Genomic Consortia (INSACOG), 1,605 are from Delhi.With only 10 institutes across India sequencing genomes, the numbers, however, are low as compared to the recommended 5% of total positive samples. In April alone, Delhi reported 487,000 positive cases; 5% of this would have translated to over 24,000 samples sequenced.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/high-daily-testing-allowed-isolation-of-covid-patients-101622242065377.html

29-05-2021||Delhi||Sushil Kumar murder case: HC junks plea seeking restraint on ‘media trial’||The Delhi High Court on Friday declined to entertain a plea to restrain the alleged media trial of wrestler and Olympic medallist Sushil Kumar for his involvement in the death of a 23-year old man. The plea has also sought issuance of rules for reporting criminal cases.A bench of Chief Justice D N Patel and justice Jyoti Singh said a PIL cannot be filed for an individual, who is a “vigilant person”. It said the petition has been filed on behalf of a “vigilant person” (Kumar), claiming that media has defamed him by its reportage of the murder case in which he is an accused.“You cannot file a PIL for an individual. We see no reason to entertain litigation on behalf of a vigilant person,” the court said and disposed of the plea filed by a law student, Shrikant Prasad.Prasad had alleged that Kumar’s career and reputation have been damaged by the media’s reporting of the case registered against him in connection with the Chhatrasal Stadium brawl that led to the death of 23-year-old wrestler Sagar Dhankar.On May 23, a Delhi court sent Kumar to six-days’ police custody for interrogation in connection with the killing of a fellow wrestler, saying the allegations against him are serious in nature and that no one is above the law.Kumar and his associates allegedly assaulted Dhankar and two of his friends, Sonu and Amit Kumar, at the Chhatrasal stadium on the intervening night of May 4 and 5. Later, Sagar succumbed to the injuries. Kumar was arrested along with co-accused Ajay from outer Delhi’s Mundka on May 23. The two-time Olympic medallist was on the run for nearly three weeks.Delhi Police has lodged an FIR in the case under Sections 302 (murder), 308 (culpable homicide), 365 (kidnapping), 325 (causing grievous hurt), 323 (voluntarily causing hurt), 341 (wrongful restraint) and 506 (criminal intimidation) of the IPC.The FIR was also registered under sections 188 (disobedience to order by public servant), 269 (negligent act likely to spread infection of disease), 120B (criminal conspiracy) and 34 (common intention) of the IPC and various sections of the Arms Act.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/sushil-kumar-case-hc-rejects-plea-seeking-restraint-on-media-coverage-101622225965126.html
29-05-2021||Delhi||‘Everyone is living this hell’: Delhi high court on antifungal shortage||“We are living this hell. Everyone is living this hell. It’s a situation where we want to help but we are helpless,” the Delhi high court said on Friday while showing its helplessness in not being able to help anyone approaching the court for supply of Amphotericin-B, a medicine used for treatment of mucormycosis, commonly referred to as the black fungus infection.“This is a problem we all are facing. We are living this hell. All of us are living this hell where, despite our wanting to help everyone, we are not able to help,” a bench of justices Vipin Sanghi and Jasmeet Singh remarked while hearing a plea by a man who had moved to the court seeking adequate supply of Amphotericin-B.The bench, while asking the Centre to give the status of import of the medicine, said it cannot give preferential treatment to anyone while denying it to others.“The Union of India shall place a report giving the detailed current status of the said imports. It will be considered on Monday. It has to indicate how the figure of 2.3 lakh vials was arrived at, and whether there is a greater availability of the drug which could be imported,” the bench ordered after the Centre told the court that steps are being taken to procure 230,000 vials of Liposomal Amphotericin-B from six countries.The court asked the Centre to return on May 31 with a “definite statement” on the status of these 230,000 vials. It also said that the order should have reached the country from Australia, Russia, Germany, Argentina, Belgium and China, after a submission by the Centre’s counsel that the requisition was placed on May 24.“We are running against time. If you placed the order on May 24, today it should have been here… We are only expressing our anxiety because... every hour, it is assuming a new proportion,” the bench said, adding that “the effort here is to save lives and every hour matters”.Also read: Jabs shortage ‘artificial’, says AAP over supply running lowThe court was hearing two petitions seeking medicine vials for two patients admitted in Delhi hospitals. On Friday, advocate Rizwan, appearing for one of the petitioners, told the court his client’s eye had to be removed due to the shortage of the drug.The issue of shortage was first raised by lawyer-petitioner Rakesh Malhotra in a batch of petitions seeking better facilities on Covid-19 for the residents of the city.The Centre, during the proceedings, informed the court that there are 14,872 patients under treatment for black fungus in the country. It said that Delhi had 423 patients, even as the city government has put the figure above 600.“Out of the sources that have been presently identified abroad, the ministry of health and family welfare (MoHFW) on May 24 has called upon ministry of external affairs (MEA) to take steps to procure 230,000 vials of Liposomal Amphotericin-B from Australia, Russia, Germany, Argentina, Belgium and China.“MEA has also been called upon to procure 50,000 tablets of Isavuconazole. Steps in this regard are being taken by the MEA,” the Centre told the court.It said that the domestic production of Amphotericin-B has gone up from 62,000 vials per month in April to 140,000 vials in May. It is expected to reach 325,114 vials in June, the Centre said. It said the main impediment in granting more licences for manufacture of Amphotericin-B injection is the worldwide shortage of the raw materials.The Centre submitted that 400 vials were allocated to Delhi government on May 24, 300 vials on May 26, and 1,920 vials on May 27.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/living-hell-hc-remarks-on-shortage-of-black-fungus-medicine-101622225844631.html
