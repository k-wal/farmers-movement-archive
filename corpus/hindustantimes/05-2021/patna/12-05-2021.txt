Within 12 hours of his arrival in the jail, Pappu Yadav sat on hunger strike demanding clean drinking water and hygienic conditions in the jail’s toilet and washroom. He also tweeted on Wednesday morning that jail authorities were not providing him with proper medical treatment for an old wound in one of his legs.Last night Yadav pleaded before the Madhepura court to send him to medical college and sadar hospital on medical grounds. He also cited his petition pending before the Patna high court challenging the non-bailable warrant issued against him in the kidnapping case. However, the court decided to send him to judicial custody.While he was pleading his case before the court through video conference, several of his supporters staged a protest outside the court in defiance of the lockdown norms. Earlier in the day, hundreds of his supporters had blocked the national highway in Vaishali when the police was escorting him through the district on the way to Madhepura. And a few hours before that, Patna police had to lathicharge workers of his JAP party at Gandhi Maidan, where they were protesting his arrest. Yadav is the president of a local political outfit named Jan Adhikar Party (Loktantrik).Patna police had arrested Yadav on Tuesday morning for violation of Covid-19 containment protocols during the state-wide lockdown. Hours later, he was given bail at Pirbahore police station on the condition that he will make himself available whenever required during the investigation of the case.Patna police then handed over his custody to Madhepura police, which had declared him absconding in the 1989 abduction case. Udakishunganj sub divisional police officer (SDPO) Satish Kumar said the Madhepura court had cancelled Yadav’s bail-bond and issued non-bailable warrant against him in September 2020 and on March 22, a property attachment warrant was issued against him by the court.Yadav’s wife Ranjit Ranjan, a former Congress MP from Supaul, said she “feared” for her husband’s life and alleged a “big conspiracy” behind his arrest. She said she will hold the state’s national democratic government led by chief minister Nitish Kumar responsible if anything untoward happened to Yadav in custody.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/pappu-yadav-starts-hunger-strike-in-bihar-s-supaul-jail-seeking-hygienic-conditions-101620809671155.html
12-05-2021||Patna||Bihar hospitals in trouble over sexual assault on woman, drug mismanagement||A ward boy of a private hospital in Bihar’s Bhagalpur district was arrested late Tuesday night over allegations of sexually harassing a Covid-19 patient’s wife. The said hospital has also been found guilty of mismanagement in a probe by district authorities, said police.Bhagalpur senior superintendent of police (SSP) Nitasha Gudiya confirmed the arrest of hospital’s ward boy Jyoti Kumar after taking cognisance of a video narrating the woman’s ordeal, which went viral on social media. The woman had also alleged medical negligence by the Bhagalpur hospital. That’s not all, she had also accused a doctor of a private hospital in Patna of sexually abusing her when her husband was shifted to the state capital for treatment.The SSP said following her complaint, a joint team of Bhagalpur administration and the state drug department started a probe into the conduct of the Bhagalpur hospital. The three-member team comprising senior ADM (additional district magistrate) Triloki Nath Singh, drug inspector Dayanand Prasad and assistant drug inspector Pradip Kumar found many irregularities and seized internal records of treatment of the woman’s husband. During their probe, they also found that the hospital’s drug store was illegally selling medicines given as samples to physicians apart from expired drugs.A scrutiny of the woman’s husband’s treatment record also revealed that the hospital procured three vials of Remdesivir injection for his treatment but administered only two vials on April 18 and 20.They also found another case of a missing vial of Remdesivir injection, procured for treatment of one Mamata Devi, who was admitted to the hospital on April 28 and died on May 3.

12-05-2021||Patna||Bihar farmers crush their produce to protest against low tomato prices||A group of farmers in Bihar’s Muzaffarpur district destroyed their harvest of tomatoes and other green vegetables for the second consecutive day on Tuesday to register their protest against low prices, not covering even their costs. They claimed to have destroyed crops worth lakhs of rupees grown over an area of 50 ‘bighas’ of land. One ‘bigha’ is equal to around 35,000 square feet of land in the district.The farmers of Ganj Bazaar and its adjoining areas in the district claimed their tomato crops were not even fetching the wholesale rate of ₹1 per kilogram and some other green vegetables were selling for less than ₹2/kg. They claimed the cost of bringing tomatoes to the market alone is ₹4 to 5/kg.“I spent ₹15,000 per bigha to produce tomatoes and now I am not even getting ₹5000 for my produce per bigha. We have been forced to sell our produce for less than ₹1 per kg. Hence, we don’t have any other option left but to destroy our produce,” said Shambhu Prasad, a farmer, who claimed to have destroyed tomatoes worth ₹2 lakh.The drop in demand of tomatoes and vegetables in Muzaffarpur is primarily due to poor off take of stocks by traders from different states due to movement restrictions and lockdowns clamped to contain the Covid-19 pandemic. Rajendra Prasad, another farmer from the Minapur block said Ganj Bazar was one of the biggest vegetable-producers and marketing venues in north Bihar. “We used to send 20 to 25 trucks of tomatoes to other places every day from here. But the numbers have now been limited to two to three trucks a day.”He added that the estimated cost of growing tomatoes on 10 bigha land is around ₹2 lakh. Another farmer Sanjay Sah said he was also thinking of destroying his produce of tomatoes grown on around 10 bighas of land. “I had never imagined in my dreams that I would ever destroy my produce with my own hands,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/bihar-farmers-crush-their-produce-to-protest-against-low-tomato-prices-101620794490817.html
