The primary teacher’s union and the kin said they had no money to arrange proper treatment of the deceased, who had not received their salaries for the last four months.“Most of them were contractual teachers, who died due to the financial crisis. For the last four months, contractual teachers have not received their salaries,” said Amardeep Kumar, president of Bihar Panchayat Nagar Prarambhik Shikshak Sangh, East Champaran-- a union of district’s primary school teachers.10 teachers in East Champaran died due to Covid-19 in the month of April and 12 others succumbed in May, while the remaining two deaths were reported from West Champaran, confirmed Binod Kumar Vimal, district education officer, East Champaran.Family of Upendra Kumar, headmaster at Chakayi Tola primary school in Pakaridayal, said non-payment of salaries was a major factor behind his death.“We were unable to meet the medical expenses of private health services. There were no beds available in government hospitals,” said Neeraj Paswan, son of Upendra Kumar, who died on April 24.The district programme officer (establishment) of the education department in East Champaran, Praful Kumar Mishra said the department’s hands were tied in absence of funds due to which the teachers, both regular and contractual, were last paid 80% of their January salary. “We are waiting for the funds for the allocation of salary from February onwards,” said Mishra, adding that the salary gets paid out as soon as the funds arrive.Another official in the department said on condition of anonymity that most of the time, the fund allotment is not only late but also below the entitlement for full payment of salaries.Upendra Kumar’s son said the financial crunch made his father consult quacks after the symptoms of coronavirus first appeared. “For the first few days, my father had to depend upon unqualified rural healthcare consultants. When his condition did not improve, we took him to the government hospital but could not get him admitted there,” said Neeraj, a school van driver, who claims to be penniless.“Getting treated at a private hospital was out of question given the kind of financial problems our family suffers from,” he said when asked why his father was not taken to a private hospital for treatment.The civil surgeon of the district said he couldn’t respond to claims if Upendra Kumar was denied admission at a government hospital in the district. “We are admitting patients and providing them with treatment as and when [they are] brought to the hospital,” Akhileshwar Prasad Singh said.Ravi Shankar Thakur, a contractual teacher posted at a government school at Binwaliya in Areraj sub division of the district said they get a salary of about ₹28,000 or thereabouts. “It makes it difficult to make ends meet and the late payment of salary further aggravates the problem.”An office bearer of the district teachers’ association alleged that the state government had put these teachers at additional risk of contracting the virus.“Even though the state government has shut educational institutions till May 15, teachers were required to be present at the school on rotation basis, which increased the risk of infection,” said Jai Prakash Singh, vice president of the primary teachers’ association in the district.District officials are at a loss to explain the deaths of these 24 teachers. “The compilation of details is still underway,” said the district education officer (DEO) of East Champaran.The vice president of the primary teachers’ union has demanded a compensation of ₹50 lakh for the families of deceased teachers, besides a job for one of the dependents.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/bihar-teachers-in-2-districts-die-of-covid-19-amid-financial-crisis-101620728666426.html
11-05-2021||Patna||Pappu Yadav arrested for violation of Covid-19 lockdown rules in Bihar||Former parliamentarian from Bihar and Jan Adhikar Party chief Rajiv Ranjan alias Pappu Yadav was arrested on Tuesday morning from his Patna residence for alleged violation of Covid-19 lockdown norms. Bihar is under a 10-day lockdown till May 15.Chief of Buddha colony police station in Patna, Kaisar Alam, said Yadav was arrested Tuesday morning and driven in his own SUV to the police station for further investigation. A case was lodged against him for alleged violation of Covid-19 guidelines and the disaster management act, he added.Another police officer pointed out that Yadav has been travelling across Bihar during the lockdown apparently to assess the situation of Covid-19 treatment facilities without permission. “The police repeatedly asked him to follow the rules of the lockdown but he ignored it,” the officer added.Yadav suggested his arrest was politically motivated. “They’ll tell you why I have been arrested. I have helped [needy] families for [the last] 1.5 months despite recently [undergoing] an operation. The government and Nitish babu (a reference to chief minister Nitish Kumar) will know what this is. Arrest doesn’t take place for violation of lockdown,” he said while on the way to the police station.Yadav recently accused the Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP) MP from Saran, Rajiv Pratap Rudy of apathy, claiming the 24 ambulances funded by MPLAD (Members of Parliament Local Area Development) scheme lay abandoned in Saran instead of serving Covid-19 patients during the current crisis precipitated by the second wave of the disease. One Rudy supporter later filed a complaint against him for “trespassing” and “vandalizing” the ambulances.Marhaura district superintendent of police (DSP) Indrajit Baitha said Yadav was booked under sections 147 (rioting), 448 (house tress pass), 379 (theft/snatching), 384 (extortion), 427 (mischief causing damage), 506 (criminal intimidation) and 188 (disobedience to order promulgated by a public servant). “Barring Section 378 and 384 (non-bailable sections) all other sections were bailable,” said the DSP.Earlier on May 4, another case was lodged against Yadav in Gaya for violation of Covid-19 guidelines and the disaster management act after he barged into a district hospital with his supporters, demanding to inspect the facilities to treat Covid-19 patients there.“This [Yadav’s arrest] should be condemned but at the same time one is not above [the] law. [The arrest is] condemnable because as a public representative you have the right to reach out to people, extend an helping hand but not at the cost of the provisions of law. He should have definitely taken prior permission to move around,” said Gyanandera Yadav, assistant professor of Sociology at College of Commerce in Patna.Yadav’s activism had elicited praise from many belonging to poor families who credited him for intervening in time to get them admitted to hospitals during the present crisis.In the meanwhile, the Covid crisis in the state has shown signs of easing a bit with the test positivity rate (TPR), which was at 16.1% on April 30, declining to 10.3% on May 9. The TPR measures the percentage of positive cases among all those tested for the disease on a given day.Bihar reported 10,174 new Covid-19 infections on Monday, taking the total number of cases to 601,650. Patna topped with 1,745 new cases, followed by Katihar 706, Gopalganj 541, East Champaran 478, Samastipur 463, Begusarai 435 and Vaishali 417 among others.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/pappu-yadav-arrested-for-violation-of-covid-19-lockdown-rules-in-bihar-101620718045830.html
11-05-2021||Patna||Bihar Police arrests 9 persons for selling a oxygen cylinder for ₹1.10 lakh||Bihar Police’s economic offence unit (EoU) arrested nine persons for selling an oxygen cylinder for ₹1.10 lakh to an NRI, who needed it for his relatives under treatment for Covid-19 in home isolation in the city. The arrests were made on Monday.Main accused Harsh Raj Verma and three of his associates: Gauri Shankar, Ravi Kumar and Rahul Kumar, were the first to be arrested based on the complaint filed by the NRI, a USA resident, who is currently in Patna. He didn’t wish to reveal his name.The NRI approached additional director general (ADG) of EoU, Nayyar Husnain Khan, about five days ago with a complaint alleging Verma, a native of Motihari district who was currently staying in Patna’s Indrapuri locality, sold him one oxygen cylinder, 50 litres in capacity, for ₹1.10 lakh. The money was electronically transferred to Harsh Raj Verma’s Bank of Baroda account, said the police officer.50 litre oxygen cylinders, also referred to as Jumbo cylinders, normally cost ₹8,000 each but were currently being black marketed for ₹25,000-30,000 each by unscrupulous traders and middlemen looking to profit from its high demand for treatment of the continuously rising number of Covid-19 patients. In the past few days, the EoU has arrested several people for black marketing of oxygen cylinders, concentrators and life saving medicines from across the state.Verma was apprehended by an EoU team headed by two deputy superintendents of police (DSPs) Bhaskar Ranjan and Rajneesh Kumar from Rajiv Nagar police station area in the capital. His bank statement showed approximately ₹9 lakh were deposited in his account within the last six days.During interrogation, Verma revealed the name of his three associates, who were also arrested on Monday. The remaining five people were arrested later during multiple raids conducted by the unit. Police also seized two Jumbo oxygen cylinders, a Maruti Swift Dzire car, two motorcycles and an e-rickshaw from their possession.Earlier, an EoU team led by additional superintendent of police (SP) V Dayal and a team of Delhi police arrested two persons, Kishan Kumar Gupta and Firoj Khan, from Patna’s Danapur police station area for cheating a Covid patient in Delhi of ₹5 lakh with the false promise of delivering them oxygen cylinders.Their bank accounts were frozen by Delhi police and their passbooks, ATMs and mobile phones seized.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/bihar-police-arrests-9-persons-for-selling-a-oxygen-cylinder-for-rs-1-10-lakh-101620709344887.html
11-05-2021||Patna||Bihar govt rate fixed for computed tomography scan higher than AIIMS, CGHS||The Bihar government has dismissed criticism that the rate it fixed for high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) scan of thorax—being used to measure the infection in lungs of Covid patients—was on the higher side citing the unique circumstances presented by the pandemic outbreak.On Saturday, the government capped the scan at all private laboratories in the state at ₹2,500 for single-slice CT machine and ₹3,000 for multi-slice CT machine with the aim to prevent profiteering when it’s being used extensively to decide the line of treatment for Covid-19 patients.However, some questioned the rationale for the rate slab fixed by the government citing it cost less ( ₹1,200) at Patna’s All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) and was also higher than the rates ( ₹1700-- ₹2,000) approved by the Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS).While reimbursing treatment cost to any of its employees, the state government relies on rates fixed by AIIMS or the CGHS. However, this was not done while capping the rate for the HRCT test.“We do rely on CGHS and AIIMS rates while reimbursing the cost of treatment, even if undertaken in a private facility by our employees. However, this is a pandemic, where the situation is different,” said Dr Naveen Chandra Prasad, director-in-chief, disease control, health department, Bihar.The health department claims the higher rates also account for other expenses and were in line with the limit fixed by other states.“We had taken into account the rates of Punjab, Madhya Pradesh and Jharkhand that ranged between ₹2,000 and ₹3,000, while capping our rate for HRCT scan of thorax, depending on the quality of the machine. The rate includes the cost of PPE kit, sanitisation or GST, required if any,” Dr Prasad said.Though on the higher side compared to the rates at government hospitals, the capping has still managed to bring down the cost of the computed tomography scan, which was as high as ₹5,100 in some private laboratories in Patna before the order came into effect.In the meanwhile, the Covid crisis in the state has shown signs of easing a bit with the test positivity rate (TPR), which was at 16.1% on April 30, declining to 10.3% on May 9. The TPR measures the percentage of positive cases among all those tested for the disease on a given day.Bihar reported 10,174 new Covid-19 infections on Monday, taking the total number of cases to 601,650. Patna topped with 1,745 new cases, followed by Katihar 706, Gopalganj 541, East Champaran 478, Samastipur 463, Begusarai 435 and Vaishali 417 among others.In other measures to standardise the cost of treatment for Covid patients, the state government on May 5 fixed the rates for both AC and non-AC private ambulances in the state.Private ambulances now cannot charge more than ₹1,500 for a small non-AC vehicle up to 50km (including both sides), and ₹2,500 for bigger vehicles with AC for the same distance. Last year in August, the government also capped treatment rate for Covid-19 patients at private hospitals to a maximum of ₹18,000 per day for ICU patients with ventilator support for NABH (national accreditation board of hospitals) accredited hospitals and ₹15,000 for non-NABH accredited hospitals in Patna, while the rates were lesser for the remaining 37 districts of Bihar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/bihar-govt-rate-fixed-for-computed-tomography-scan-higher-than-aiims-cghs-101620704724371.html
11-05-2021||Patna||Horror sinking in, bodies found floating in Ganga||Amid the current wave of Covid-19 infections, over two dozen partially decomposed bodies, some bloated, were found floating in Ganga river near Chausa in Buxar district of Bihar on Monday, setting off panic among locals and prompting a probe by the district administration.“There are 30-35 bodies floating in Ganga in a spread of over 2 km,” said K K Upadhyay, subdivisional officer (Sadar), who has been asked by the district administration to probe the matter.Upadhyay, however, was quick to claim that these bodies could have floated downstream from neighbouring Uttar Pradesh.“Here at Chausa, there is curve in the river. These bodies seem to have floated downstream from other places and washed up near the bend. It is not clear how they died. The administration is making arrangements to dispose of the bodies,” he said.Ashok Kumar, block development officer at Chausa, which borders UP, said, “We were alerted by the local chowkidar that many bodies had been spotted floating from upstream. We have so far recovered 15 of these. None of the deceased happens to be a resident of the district,” he told PTI.“Many districts in UP are situated right across the river and the bodies may have been dumped in the river for reasons not known to us. We cannot confirm whether the deceased were indeed Covid-19 infected. The bodies have started decomposing. But we are taking all precautions while ensuring that these are disposed of in a decent manner,” he said.Addressing a press conference in the evening, Buxar’s district magistrate Aman Samir said the bodies found floating in Ganga near Chausa were three-four days old. “This makes it clear that the bodies are not from Buxar but have floated downstream from neighbouring UP. We have contacted officials from neighbouring districts. To prevent a repeat of this, it has been decided to start boat patrolling,” he said.However, social activist and lawyer Ashwani Verma countered the claims of the administration. “For the last 10 days, I have been approaching the local administration over bodies in the river. Because of the lockdown, people do not prefer to go to Buxar and instead dispose bodies in Ganga. You never know they could be infected with Covid-19,” he said.A large number of villages, situated on the banks of Ganga, use river water for drinking purposes as several villages have reported presence of arsenic in ground water in Buxar and adjoining Bhojpur district.A K Singh Kushwaha, a local, said there is hardly any facility at Chausa funeral ground. “People have to bring wood from a distance of 1 to 1.5 kms to the funeral site,” he said, adding that those manning the funeral ground ask for exorbitant sums for a wooden pyre.While enforcing the lockdown, the state government had announced free funeral (at government cost) for all Covid-related deaths and made urban and rural development departments as nodal agencies for this.Former MP and Jan Adhikar Party (JAP) leader Rajesh Ranjan alias Pappu Yadav, who has been exposing the malfunctioning of system by visiting different districts, called for a thorough probe into the manner. “This is government failure. Poor people are hesitant to take bodies to villages or consign them to flames. They simply dump bodies directly into the Ganga. The state has failed to rise to the occasion,” said Yadav.Meanwhile, Bihar on Saturday reported 11,259 new Covid cases, taking the number of active cases to 110,814.Buxar district on Saturday reported 62 new cases, which increased to 81 on Sunday. The district has so far reported 26 deaths and has a total of 1,216 active cases.The positivity rate in the state, for the first time, showed signs of a declining trend, from a high of 16.1% on April 30 to 10.3% on May 9.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/horror-sinking-in-bodies-found-floating-in-ganga-101620658938427.html
