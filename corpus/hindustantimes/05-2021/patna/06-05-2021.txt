The service began on Wednesday.Subhash Kumar, CEO of a green vegetable vendors’ association said the need for the tie-up was felt due to continued delays in distribution of vegetables booked online. He says the online booking facility started on April 30 and it received great response but no reliable method of quick delivery was proving to be the biggest hurdle in its continuation. “Many of old orders are still pending,” he said.The auto drivers’ association members have begun the deliveries at a time when the city is under total lockdown, making the service effective and valued.Rajkumar Jha, general secretary of the All-India Road Transport Workers Federation in Bihar, said this work has provided auto drivers a much needed source of earning. “As the city is under total lockdown, auto drivers have no passengers,” he said.The cooperative department has offered to open bank accounts in the cooperative bank for the drivers involved in the programme. It is planning a direct money transfer to these accounts, he added.Jha said the delivery facility could also be launched in other cities of the state if the experiment succeeds in Patna.Vijay Dhari, president of the federation said it has also proposed home delivery of other essentials like food grain, oil, milk and eggs.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/bihar-lockdown-auto-drivers-begin-home-delivery-of-fresh-vegetables-in-patna-101620295552091.html

The Centre has allocated Bihar a daily quota of 214 metric tonnes of medical oxygen, but it was able to lift only 167 metric tonnes because of logistic issues.Dr Sanjeev Kumar, nodal officer for Covid-19 at the hospital said the oxygen demand was never so high even during August last year, when Covid-19 cases had spiked during the first wave of the pandemic. “This clearly points to the increased requirement of oxygen among Covid-19 patients during the second wave,” he said.At the peak of the first wave, Bihar registered 4,071 cases on August 11 which is little more than 25% of the 15,853 cases registered on May 1 this year during the second wave of the pandemic.The AIIMS has so far admitted over 5,000 Covid patients since March 22 last year, when it reported the first case at its institute. 90 days later on July 10, it was declared a dedicated Covid-19 hospital. It had resumed full OPD and general services only on February 15 this year.Of the total 538,677 Covid-19 cases reported in Bihar so far, the state has 113,479 active cases as on Tuesday.
