12-05-2021||Ranchi||State allocates vaccines to districts for inoculating 18-44 age group||In the run up to roll out free mass vaccination drive to inoculate citizens aged between 18-44 years from May 14, the state government allocated doses of two vaccines, Covishield and Covaxi, in different shares to the districts.Among the 24 districts across the state, the ten districts of Bokaro, Deoghar, Dhanbad, East Singhbhum, Garhwa, Giridih, Hazaribagh, Palamu, Ranchi and West Singhbhum were the top gainers after being allocated 10,000 doses each.The distribution of vaccine was made on the basis of population of the 18-44 age group residing in a particular district. The state government has identified 1.57 crore people under this group for inoculation.The state capital Ranchi, which is the hardest hit by the pandemic, has the maximum 13.9 lakh population of people between 18-44 years of age. Dhanbad, Giridih and East Singhbhum also have more than 10 lakh people under this group.Apart from the above 10 districts, the rest of them were allocated a total of 5,000 doses--2,000 doses of Covaxin and 3,000 doses Covishield.The state received 2.34 lakh doses of Covishield and Covaxin against its purchase orders for carrying out the third phase. After making the above allotment to the districts, the state is now left with a total of 64,000 doses--56,000 doses of Covaxin and 8,000 doses of Covishield.Meanwhile, health mandarins were sceptical about a hassle-free third phase, citing the meagre stock of vaccine doses. If proper supply chain of the vaccine is not maintained, the third phase may come to a halt, they said.Chief minister Hemant Soren, however, expressed dissatisfaction over the initial response of citizens desiring to take the jab. He said, “Only 30,000 people from across the state have registered themselves on CO-WIN app or other approved platforms to take the shot. Majority of them are from Ranchi, East Singhbhum and some other big districts.”The CM appealed to people to come forward and take the vaccine. Pre-registration is mandatory for vaccination for the 18-44 age group, and there walk-ins are not allowed for this category as of now.Though the third phase of the inoculation drive, under which citizens in the age group of 18 to 44 years are eligible to take the jab, began across the country on May 1, the state could not start it due as the Centre banned the states from using its existing vaccine stock for inoculating this group.The central government asked the states to purchase the vaccine on their own directly from manufacturers for this phase. Following this, the state health department issued purchase orders (PO) to the two vaccine manufactures, demanding 25 lakh doses from each of them.Against the said orders, the state has so far received 1.34 lakh doses of Covaxin and 1 lakh doses of Covishield.Jharkhand till May 11 inoculated 2,762,184 beneficiaries, including health care workers (HCW), frontline workers (FLW) and citizens above the age of 45 with the first dose of Covid-19 vaccine. As many as 622,691 have also taken the second dose.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ranchi-news/state-allocates-vaccines-to-districts-for-inoculating-18-44-age-group-101620834163999.html

12-05-2021||Ranchi||Jharkhand elephant killed 9 people in five districts, faces threat to life||An elephant separated from its herd in Jharkhand’s Dhanbad forest division has allegedly killed nine people while moving across five districts since early April, said forest officials, before adding that most of the deaths were triggered by human misadventures such as chasing or pelting the animal with stones or while taking selfies with the elephant.The tusker is currently at Dumka district’s Kathikund forest where its life is in grave danger from fearful villagers, who attacked it on Tuesday with stones in an attempt to drive it away from the forest.Concerned over the situation, a wildlife lover Alok Sharma tagged a tweet to Jharkhand chief minister Hemant Soren, requesting him to save the elephant from the villagers. Soren then directed the Dumka deputy commissioner to ensure that the elephant was released into a safe forest area.Jharkhand’s principal chief conservator of forest (wildlife) Rajiv Ranjan said, the elephant was currently in a good habitat in Dumka. “There is sufficient food and water in the forest. We hope that the elephant would cause no more damage,” Ranjan said.The forest department said it had been tracking the jumbo since the beginning of its journey from Dhanbad.“The animal has been on its migratory route. Most of the casualties that took place on its journey were due to human error. People are gathering in large numbers on its way, chasing it, taking selfies and pelting stones, which made the animal aggressive,” said a forest official, who didn’t wish to be named.He said forest department officials have been continuously appealing to people not to disturb the tusker’s movement.As per a forest department report, the elephant first killed one Ajmerun Bibi, 25, on April 8 in Dhanbad district, followed by Furkan Ansari on April 13 in Jamtara district. On May 21, it killed one Mela Soren followed by Nachon Murmu on May 23 in Dumka district. Then, it moved to Pakur district where it killed Kalu Pahariya on April 24 and Baburam Malto on May 2. Thereafter, it moved to Sahibganj district where it killed three people- Kabil Seikh on May 3, Som Murmu and Ishmatur Rahman on May 6. The elephant was again spotted in Pakur district on May 8 but caused no deaths before moving back to Dumka district.Divisional forest officer (DFO), Dumka, Sourav Chandra said villagers have been requested through loudspeakers not to go near the elephant or harass it. “Old people, women and children have been asked to remain at home, while young people have been asked to be alert,” Chandra said. “We are also asking people not to pelt stones on the animal,” he added.He said the elephant was currently happy in Kathikund forest due to availability of adequate food and water inside the forest.In 2017, a rogue elephant from Bihar killed 15 people including four in Bihar and 11 in Jharkhand. After the forest department failed to capture it, an order was issued to eliminate it, which was carried out by hunter Nawab Shafath Ali Khan on August 8 that year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ranchi-news/jharkhand-elephant-killed-9-people-in-five-districts-faces-threat-to-life-101620816451839.html
