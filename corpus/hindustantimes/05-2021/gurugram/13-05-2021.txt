However, there is a large number of people suffering from high fever and other symptoms in the village who did not turn up. I hope the health department conducts testing in every household,” said Kumar.He said that eight to 10 recent deaths were of people suffering from Covid-19 symptoms.The situation is similar in Manesar village, which is witnessing one or two deaths daily for the past 15 days, locals said. “The population of Manesar is around 100,000 and people live in highly dense pockets. We have witnessed seven deaths in Aaalhu mohalla alone due to Covid-19 this month. Villagers are admitted to local hospitals and a large number of them have self-quarantined with little help from authorities. The Covid-19 safeguards and protocols are not being followed,” said Om Prakash Yadav, a former village head.He said that lack of enforcement is leading to more infections and causing deaths. “Today, we lost a young man of 43 years, who was healthy and in the prime of his life. His family is shattered,” he said on Thursday.According to the health department data, the test positivity rate (proportion of positives out of the samples tested) in rural areas was at 21.8% in April. Officials identified seven high-risk areas for mass surveillance and door-to-door screening.The health department said that it has registered around 17 deaths due to Covid-19 in the seven high-risk areas. “The large outreach planned in rural areas is aimed at preventing the spread of Covid-19 infections and ensuring better treatment so that patients do not succumb due to complications,” said Dr Virender Yadav, chief medical officer, Gurugram.Officials said that a large-scale exercise is being launched across the district for testing and screening people in villages, and serious cases will be referred to hospitals.Yadav said, “Around 50 large isolation centres will be set up in villages initially with healthcare facilities. One team for testing and another for isolation will be deployed in villages that will help the in medication and preventing the spread.”To ensure that locals don’t rely on chemists for treatment, Yadav said that healthcare professionals are being deployed to curb this practice. “We will ensure timely testing and treatment,” he said.Residents of villages said that infected persons prefer to wait for a week to approach the hospitals and only do so when their condition deteriorates. Free movement of infected persons is further spreading the infection, complained locals.In Sultanpur village, at least eight people died due to Covid-19 this month, most of whom relied on self-medication, said locals. “Our neighbour waited four to five days before getting tested and suddenly collapsed. He could not survive a single day in the hospital. His wife is also in a critical condition and is surviving on ventilator support,” said Pravesh Chauhan, a resident.Many infected persons or those with influenza-like illness are also not isolating and there is no one to keep a check, residents said.“It is difficult to ask people to refrain from sharing hukka or playing cards. Some step out for fresh air but this has caused more infections,” said Dilip Yadav, a resident of Kherki Daula, who recently shifted to a condominium across the toll plaza.Bhawar Singh, a resident of Hassanpur village, said that authorities should ensure that critical patients from rural areas are admitted to hospitals. “We have to make a lot of effort to get the patients admitted, even if their condition is bad,” said Singh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/lack-of-awareness-poor-enforcement-of-curbs-in-rural-areas-leading-to-more-deaths-allege-residents-101620927291536.html

Some 50 isolation centres will be set up initially, and will be increased if the situation demands, they said.Gurugram deputy commissioner (DC) Yash Garg said that the health department, and the district development and panchayat department will send teams for Covid-19 testing and screening over the next 10 days, to contain the local spread. These teams will also sanitise the villages.Panchayats will also get grants for setting up isolation centres based on the population, according to the district administration.“Villages with a population of over 10,000 will get ₹50,000, and less than 10,000 will get ₹10,000,” Garg added.He also appealed to the people to get themselves tested for if they have Covid-19 symptoms and isolate themselves immediately from other family members to stop the spread of the infection.“We will treat the patients, and also conduct awareness drives on Covid-19. With the district administration’s help, the enforcement of safeguards and Covid-19 protocols will also be ensured,” said Dr Virender Yadav, chief medical officer (CMO), adding that that Accredited Social Health Activist (ASHA) and Anganwadi workers — those from the panchayat department — will be part of local teams that will work in rural areas.According to the health department, its officials identified seven high-risk rural areas where 138 teams are testing and tracing Covid-19 for treatment.On Wednesday, Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar had directed the officials concerned to set up adequate healthcare facilities and isolation centres, and deploy healthcare teams across the rural areas in Haryana. He also ordered that the village isolation centres should have beds and beddings, triple layered masks, and hand sanitisers with bottle dispensers and steamers.Patients must get food either through the community or on a hire basis, Khattar had said, adding that the health department will provide essential medicines and medical equipment to the isolation centres in the villages, and the healthcare staff will supervise the patients and shift critical patients to the facilities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/164-isolation-centres-to-be-set-up-in-villages-intensive-testing-on-the-cards-101620927292248.html

Due to the lockdown, community lunches stopped and many factories have been shut since the lockdown was announced.”“They offered to work in exchange for food, but we told them that we had enough staff but that they were welcome to have meals,” he said.After more than 15 people approached them, the police started preparing more food and the message spread through word of mouth, following which the numbers started increasing daily. Two cooks were also hired to help with the preparations for lunch and dinner.KK Rao, the commissioner of police, said that in a survey on May 8, they located four sites where daily wagers were sleeping without having food. “A team was formed to feed the needy and ration was bought by the police station staff. They did not ask for any help or fund and for nearly 10 days, they were spending from their own pockets. Now, the ration is being sent from the police headquarters,” he said.At present, the department is supplying food to workers at the four locations, including Labour Chowk. The initiative is being announced through loudspeakers in areas where daily wagers are staying and social distancing and mask discipline is enforced, said officials.“I lost job my again this year and could not tell my family members as they need money. I am hopeful I will get another job soon and will start saving and sending money to my ailing mother in Bihar. Last year, I had returned to my village after the lockdown was announced and returned to Gurugram after eight months,” said Lankesh Kumar, who worked with an automobile company.Another labourer, Kanwar Singh of Bihar, said “There was no hope to get any meal and we had slept on an empty stomach for two nights before we got freshly cooked food. We sleep near the police station so that we do not have to travel to eat on time and they do not run short of food.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/cops-feed-600-daily-wagers-amid-lockdown-101620927231578.html

Several states have reported animals being infected with the coronavirus. We do not want to take risk, so we have halted the estimation process for now.”Over 25 forest officials have tested positive in Haryana, making it riskier to continue the census, said a senior forest department official.The wildlife census, which is conducted in collaboration with Wildlife Institute of India (WII), Dehradun, had started in the second week of April this year. The forest department, with the WII, was scheduled to set up camera traps for a survey of large mammals between May 1 and June 30.With the help of the survey, the forest department officials wanted to assess the abundance and distribution of the major mammalian carnivore population, and prey population inside the protected areas. The census also focuses on assessing abundance and distribution of nilgai and rhesus macaque in a human-dominating landscape outside these areas. As part of the census, 59 beats of Shivalik forest and 38 beats of Aravalli forests will be surveyed.The forest department, however, was able to conduct the monkey survey in urban areas from April 28-30 through the ‘Wildlife Census Haryana’ mobile application, wherein residents noted the presence of monkeys in their respective areas.The data recorded on the mobile application will be used to devise strategies to reduce man-monkey conflicts, rampant in cities like Faridabad and Gurugram, the senior forest official added.“Amid the rise in such cases, we had asked the residents not to venture out, and report the presence of monkeys in their areas — either through their balconies or terraces. We have received a good response for this survey, despite the high number of cases, with around 600 participants recording their sightings on the application, with over 6,000 monkeys being present across Haryana,” said Rajvanshi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/haryanas-1st-wildlife-census-postponed-amid-wildlife-safety-concerns-in-times-of-covid-101620927232195.html
