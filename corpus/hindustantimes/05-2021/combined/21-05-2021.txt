21-05-2021||Mumbai||CM Uddhav Thackeray visits cyclone-hit Ratnagiri, Sindhudurg||Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray on Friday visited Ratnagiri and Sindhudurg, the districts hit the most by Cyclone Tauktae early this week, and assured relief to those affected, once the assessment is completed. Although the CM did not spell out the details, the Maharashtra government is expected to announce a package early next week. Thackeray visited two affected villages in Vengurle and Malvan tehsils in Sindhudurg and held a meeting with the district administration. He also held a review meeting with Ratnagiri district administration and took stock of the damage caused by the cyclone and the Covid-19 situation. Thackeray said the spot assessment of the losses is expected to be completed in the next few days. “We have started giving compensation as per the National Disaster Relief Fund (NDRF) norms. We will ensure that nobody goes without relief. The additional relief will be determined after the assessment is completed. Although the coastal parts have sustained damages, it was less severe this time, compared to last year’s Cyclone Nisarga,” he said. Cyclone Tauktae, that hit the coastal districts on Sunday and Monday, claimed 19 lives and caused damage to structures and horticulture in the state. According to preliminary estimates, crops and horticulture on more than 12,000 hectares (ha) have been damaged. Hundreds of villages in Ratnagiri and Raigad are still without electricity and internet. “As per the assessment so far, crops and horticulture on more than 12,500 hectares have been damaged. As per the set norms of NDRF, the compensation for crop losses ranges between ₹6,800 and ₹18,000 per ha and ₹6,000- ₹95,000 for damage to houses. The state government had increased the relief amount as special case for the damages in last year’s Cyclone Nisarga. But it would not be possible to give that much this time. The total losses are expected to be around ₹60 crore,” said an official from Mantralaya. Coastal districts do not grow any seasonal crops, so there was not much damage to the crops. However, plantations of Alphonso mango and chickoo were damaged largely. Thackeray said the state will press for long-term measures that will help the coastal districts that face such cyclones. He said the state government has requested the Centre for assistance for cyclone-risk mitigation measures, including underground power supply infrastructure and anti-erosion measures. “I am sure Prime Minister Narendra Modi will help Maharashtra, similar to how he announced a package for Gujarat,” he said. Bharatiya Janata Party leaders slammed the CM for his short tour of the cyclone-affected districts. “I do not want to politicise the issue, but one should answer why the CM visited only two districts? His tour lasted for just three hours and travelled just a few kilometers. The ruling parties have questions about Modi’s Gujarat tour. They should first look at Thackeray’s tour,” said leader of opposition Devendra Fadnavis. Thackeray took a dig at Fadnavis, saying that he was not frustrated like the opposition leader. “I have not come here for a photo session. I want to give true relief to the affected people from coastal areas. I did not restrict myself to the aerial tour,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/cmuddhav-thackeray-visits-cyclone-hit-ratnagiri-sindhudurg-101621621730756.html
21-05-2021||Mumbai||Crime branch arrests history-sheeter on the run for 28 years||A 58-year-old history-sheeter, who had been absconding for over 28 years, was arrested by Mumbai police’s crime branch on Thursday evening. The accused, Suresh Ganpat Jamsandekar, had fled when a non-bailable warrant was issued against him in a murder and robbery case by the sessions court more than two decades ago.According to officers from unit 11 of crime branch, Jamsandekar was booked by Goregaon police for dacoity and murder under relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code and of the Arms Act after he had shot and killed a shopkeeper in Goregaon (West) during robbery in 1992.Officers said they received information that Jamsandekar had been hiding in Tembipada area in Bhandup (West), following which a team of five police officers kept watch on the locality with the help of informers and arrested Jamsandekar when he was spotted outside his house.The officers said that under “Operation All Out” which is carried out every month, the police are expected to get a status update on the criminals in their areas and search for absconding and wanted accused. “We had been keeping a tab on all the wanted and absconding accused of past cases and had given a description of those criminals to our informers,” said an officer from the crime branch.Vinayak Chavan, inspector from unit 11 crime branch, said Jamsandekar has been handed over to Goregaon police for further action.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/crime-branch-arrests-history-sheeter-on-the-run-for-28-years-101621621431260.html
21-05-2021||Mumbai||Forest department extends scheme linked to sustainable use of mangrove ecosystems||The state forest and revenue department this week extended its Mangrove Protection and Employment Generation Scheme for a period of five years, by way of a general notification issued on May 19. First cleared by the state cabinet in September 2017 at a cost of ₹15 crore and launched in the same year, the scheme aims to generate employment opportunities linked to sustainable use of mangrove ecosystems, whether on government or on private land.It is so far active in five of the seven coastal districts in the state including Palghar, Thane, Raigad, Ratnagiri and Sindhudurg. The scheme is funded through the mangrove foundation established by the state government and the district development fund. Though originally launched only for a three-year period, the scheme has now been extended to 2024-2025, which will be its second phase. In its first phase, the scheme enrolled an estimated 3,000 beneficiaries across 103 villages or wards where mangroves are present. This was done by instating an equal number of joint mangrove management committees which are responsible for identifying sustainable livelihoods — whether through aquaculture, eco-tourism or other means — for communities that live nearby and have been historically reliant on mangroves.“Under the scheme, if a person or group wants to conduct some sustainable business that also aids in conservation of mangroves and coastal areas, they are given subsidies by the state up to 90% of their capital cost. If a person, who owns private land with mangroves, wants to take on a similar business, the state may provide subsidies up to 75%,” said Virendra Tiwari, additional principal chief conservator of forests, mangrove cell.These businesses, according to the general resolution issued on May 19, largely include aquaculture projects, such as crab, shellfish, jitada and oyster farming, as well as rearing of ornamental fish. There are a total of 1,024 villages where this scheme can be made eligible, but so far around 103 steering committees have been formed. In the next phase of the scheme, the forest department is aiming to set up at least 40 additional committees every year.“Our goal is that within 10 years, at least 50% of all eligible villages should have a joint mangrove monitoring committee to provide guidance in business planning, budget management and implementation of sustainable businesses. The main objective is to link community livelihoods with mangrove conservation. The scheme will also deter violations,” said Tiwari.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/forest-department-extends-scheme-linked-to-sustainable-use-of-mangrove-ecosystems-101621621430681.html
21-05-2021||Mumbai||MVA parties attack Centre over ‘bias’||With little over six months left for the politically crucial elections to the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC), the tug-of-war between the ruling and opposition parties kicked off over the discriminate treatment given to Maharashtra as compared to Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s home state Gujarat. Issues ranging from PM Modi’s recent tour of Gujarat after Cyclone Tauktae to vaccine allocation to the state have once again triggered the comparison over the treatment to the two states; and it may intensify ahead of BMC elections.The ruling parties in Maharashtra have criticised PM Modi and his party for the step-motherly treatment to Maharashtra. All the three ruling parties — the Shiv Sena, Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) and Congress — slammed the PM for not visiting Maharashtra and other cyclone-hit states and choosing only Gujarat to take a review of damages this week. Modi on Tuesday did an aerial survey of parts of the Gujarat which was hit by Cyclone Tauktae on Monday and announced a relief package of ₹1,000 crore for the state. Congress’s state unit chief Nana Patole, NCP leader and state minister Nawab Malik, and Sena MP Sanjay Raut raised questions over PM’s bias. “Why did Modi not visit the cyclone-affected areas of Maharashtra? Is he the prime minister of Gujarat only,” Patole remarked. Sena mouthpiece Saamana on Friday said that Gujarat and Maharashtra are twins but when it comes to relief packages, the former is treated as a stepchild. An editorial in Saamana questioned as to why the PM has not conducted an aerial visit in Maharashtra, adding that Cyclone Tauktae has left a trail of destruction in Goa and Maharashtra. “Why should the Centre, which has given ₹1,000-crore relief package to Gujarat, discriminate against Maharashtra and Goa?… Gujarat is Maharashtra’s twin brother. The stepbrother treatment given to Maharashtra of late is not correct. Keeping in mind that Mumbai contributes ₹2.5 lakh crore annually to Delhi, there is no harm in expecting that the rulers of Delhi will provide relief of around ₹2,000 crore for the people who were displaced in Konkan,” it said.The Sena mouthpiece said that Leader of Opposition Devendra Fadnavis, who is on a tour of affected areas in Raigad, Ratnagiri and Sindhudurg, should tell the Centre to provide help to the state. “Fadnavis has demanded that the state government give an abundant package for affected areas. He should make this demand forcefully with the Centre. He is from Maharashtra, he must forget political lines and tell Modi saheb to give relief like the Centre gave to Gujarat,” the editorial said.Maharashtra BJP chief spokesperson Keshav Upadhye said, “First, it is the duty of the state to provide immediate relief. They have not announced any relief but are expecting the Centre to give. The Centre will definitely give relief packages to the states which have been affected by the cyclone.”On Friday, Congress raised questions over the “step-motherly” treatment to Maharashtra while allocating Covid vaccines. After a spat between the leaders from both the sides over short supply of vaccine and its wastage in Maharashtra last month, Congress’s general secretary and spokesperson Sachin Sawant alleged that the Centre supplied vaccines to Gujarat disproportionately. Sawant asked as to why the Modi-led Centre allotted 16.2 million vaccine doses to Gujarat, against just 20.15 million doses to Maharashtra when the latter’s population is double than Modi’s home state. “The distribution of vaccines should have been in the proportion of population, active cases, total Covid-19 cases and inoculation rate. Against 404,229 active cases of 4,978,337 infected people in Maharashtra, Gujarat has just 669,490 cases including 92,617 active cases. Similarly, Maharashtra has reported 84,371 deaths while Gujarat reported 9,340 deaths, as on May 19. In vaccination Maharashtra tops in the country, while its population (around 130 million) is double than Gujarat’s population. Despite this, Maharashtra has got much less vaccine doses from the Centre,” he said.Sawant also questioned Fadnavis and other BJP leaders to reply over the discrimination. “BJP leaders have been claiming Maharashtra received highest number of doses, because of which it could achieve the top positon in vaccination. They should speak about the special treatment given to Gujarat,” he said.MVA leaders have upped the ante against the BJP by attacking the Centre over the alleged discrimination in allocation of the Covid-related medical equipment and vaccines. State public health minister Rajesh Tope has been attacking the Centre over short supply of vaccines and oxygen to Maharashtra by the Centre. The leaders feel the political rhetoric and comparison between Maharashtra and Gujarat is expected to intensify as BMC elections near. “High stakes are involved for both Sena and BJP in the polls for one of the richest civic bodies in Asia. The attack and counter-attack will go on increasing between ruling and opposition parties. The card of Marathi pride is always played by the Sena during elections and it has the old backdrop of six decades, since the days of fight for unified Maharashtra. The incidents of favouritism to Gujarat at the cost of Maharashtra may play a crucial role in this political game plan,” said a NCP leader.The ruling parties have always been playing up incidents such as shifting International Financial Services Centre from Mumbai to Gujarat, shifting National Institute of Coastal Policing from Palghar to Dwarka in Gujarat five years ago. The Sena has staunchly opposed Modi’s dream project of Bullet train between Mumbai and Ahmedabad, saying it was meant to benefit Gujarat. Political analyst Hemant Desai said that though Gujarat has been given an upper hand by the PM, it would not emerge as Maharashtra versus Gujarat or Marathi versus Gujarati in the BMC elections. “The Sena, under Uddhav or Aaditya Thackeray, had never taken anti-Gujarati or anti-north Indian stand over all these years. It is true that Gujarat has got favoured treatment under Modi, be it shifting of IFSC, bullet train designed to give advantage to Gujarat, shifting of RBI offices to Gujarat and now the relief package to the state,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mvaparties-attack-centre-over-bias-101621621370707.html

Police said the 29-year-old complainant, while resisting the accused, had slit her wrist with a blade. The accused was arrested from INS Agnibahu after being on the run for over a week.The complainant and her husband reside in a shared Navy staff quarter with the accused. The quarter is allotted to the accused by the Navy administration.

21-05-2021||Mumbai||Governor should decide on nominee list, cannot sit on it: HC to state||The Bombay high court (HC) observed that the governor cannot sit on the list of 12 nominees submitted to him by the council of ministers in November 2020, and directed the state and other respondents to file their replies to a public interest litigation (PIL) which sought directions for a decision to be taken on the list as per the stipulations of the Constitution of India. On November 6, the council of ministers had submitted the list of 12 nominees to be nominated by the governor to the Maharashtra Legislative Council after the cabinet approved it. A division bench of justice SJ Kathawalla and justice SP Tavade while hearing the PIL filed by Ratan Luth, a social worker from Nashik through advocate Gaurav Srivastav, was informed that as per Article 171 (2) (2) and 171 (5) of the Constitution, the 12 members to be nominated by the governor included persons having special knowledge or practical experience in literature, science, art co-operative movement and social service. The plea submitted that as per the said articles of the Constitution, the governor has an obligation to decide on the recommendations of the council of ministers, but as he had not done so even after a passage of four months, there was a loss to the cabinet and the citizens of Maharashtra as they could not benefit from the expertise of the 12 members having expertise in various fields. Additional public prosecutor Geeta Shastri for the state informed the court that as the governor could not be expected to respond, the secretary to the governor should be added as a respondent. The court agreed and directed the petitioner to carry out amendment in the PIL. The court then refused to allow advocate Satish Talekar, who has filed two separate petitions opposing the list of 12 members suggested by the council of ministers, to make submissions and observed, “The governor has to approve or reject the list and cannot sit on it and let it lie in his drawer.” The bench then directed the state to file an affidavit in response to the PIL within two weeks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/governor-should-decide-on-nominee-list-cannot-sit-on-it-hc-to-state-101621621250681.html
21-05-2021||Mumbai||Cyberattack hits Air India: Data of 45 lakh fliers leaked||A cybersecurity attack on Air India’s passenger service system has compromised the data of lakhs of passengers, according to a message sent out by the national carrier on Friday. In a text message, the airline said the SITA PSS data processor of the passenger service system, which is responsible for storing and processing of personal information of the passengers, was subjected to a cybersecurity attack which led to a leak of personal data leak of around 4.5 million passengers in its system. The data leak reportedly took place on February 25.SITA confirms that it was the victim of a cyber-attack, leading to a data security incident involving certain passenger data that was stored on SITA Passenger Service System (US) Inc servers,” SITA said in a statement on March 4, according to media reports.Cybersecurity experts said they were yet to see specifically Air India data being sold on dark web forums, but added that since the hack did not include passwords, the data may instead be sold as a tranche of credit and debit card data. “The credit card data may show up as individual tranches of card information based on limits etc”, said Yash Kadakia, founder and CTO of Security Brigade.Experts have separately said that sensitive person information like contact and passport data could potentially lead to impersonation attacks and allow perpetrators to break into people’s bank accounts by using such data for verification.According to Air India, personal data registered between August 26, 2011, and February 3, 2021, including name, date of birth, contact information, passport information, ticket information, Star Alliance and Air India frequent flyer data as well as credit card details, were leaked due to the breach. The information did not include CVV/CVC numbers, the carrier clarified in a message posted on their website.The airline said the identity of the affected data subjects was only provided to them by their data processor on March 25 and April 5. “The present communication is an effort to apprise of accurate state of facts as on date and to supplement our general announcement of 19th March 2021 initially made via our website,’ the airline’s media statement uploaded on their website read.“However, in respect of this last type of data, CVV/CVC numbers are not held by our data processor,” the statement read.Air India said to ensure the safety of the data, investigations of the breach incident were immediately ordered, compromised servers were secured, and external specialists of data security incidents were engaged.The national carrier said that it notified credit card issuers and reset the passwords of Air India’s frequent flying programme. Air India said, “Our data processor has ensured that no abnormal activity was observed after securing the compromised servers. While we and our data processor continue to take remedial actions including but not limited to the above, we would also encourage passengers to change passwords wherever applicable to ensure the safety of their data. The protection of our customer’s personal data is of the highest importance to us and we deeply regret the inconvenience caused and appreciate continued support and trust of our passengers.”Air India spokesperson did not comment when asked about the update on the investigation findings. A senior airline official said, “We do not know the extent of misuse of the data. This is a serious matter and is being investigated.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/cyberattack-hits-air-india-data-of-45-lakh-fliers-leaked-101621620951332.html

The groom-to-be, a merchant navy employee, arrived during Ramzan for preparations of marriage after Eid but fell ill and tested positive for Covid-19. After fighting for his life at a hospital for a few days, the youth breathed his last on the fifth of Ramzan, shattering the dreams of Afreen.It is not just Afreen but hundreds of Muslim households in the district are now mourning loved ones instead of preparing for grand marriages, which are generally solemnised after Eid-ul-Fitr. Instead, ceremonies praying for the repose of the soul of the deceased are now being observed across the district. There are many households where marriages have been postponed due to the death of a near relative of the bride or the groom.A resident of C-Block in Kareli, Mohd Shadab, was to be married in the first week of June. However, following a death in his family, the marriage has been put on hold. Although marriages are still taking place according to guidelines issued by the government, families who have lost loved ones are finding it hard to move on and organise marriages of their sons and daughters.Corporator Fazal Khan of ward number 78 of Kareli said he knew many families who had cancelled marriages after losing a close relative. “Instead of marriage songs and festivities, ‘Chaliswa’ (post death ceremony among Muslims) and ‘terahi’ (post death ceremony in Hindus) are being observed at these households which is tragic. People have stood with each other in difficult times and have supported people who have lost their dear ones,” Fazal said.Rambali Mishra of Badokhar in Koraon area was happy after the marriage of his son and daughter was to take place in May. However, after the death of a relative due to Covid-19, both marriages have been postponed.A similar situation prevailed in the house of Chhotelal of Naini who had to cancel his daughter’s marriage which was to take place on April 30 but was put off as a close relative of the groom died in the pandemic.Sarita Khurana of Civil Lines has had to put off her son’s marriage after his mother-in-law-to-be fell ill and was admitted to the hospital.Pandit Balak Maharaj, who solemnises marriages, said that many marriages have been cancelled with the start of second wave of the pandemic. Now, the next ‘muhurt’ will be taken out for such marriages, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/pain-of-the-pandemic-instead-of-marriage-festivities-many-households-holding-post-death-ceremonies-101621620891288.html
21-05-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra records 29,644 new Covid-19 cases, 555 deaths||Even as the state government planned various methods to rein the fatality rate, the high number of deaths continue to remain a concern. The state on Friday recorded 29,644 new Covid-19 cases and 555 deaths. The total number of deaths till May 21 stood at 15,755, while the total number of deaths in April was 13,835.The death toll has now reached 86,618, with Mumbai leading with 14,464 deaths, followed by Pune with 11,015 deaths. The total number of Covid cases stand at 55,27,092.Currently, there are 367,121 active patients across the state, of which, Pune tops with 58,840 patients, followed by Mumbai with 28,579 active cases.Dr Subhash Salunke, advisor to the Maharashtra government on Covid-19 management said the major focus now is to reduce the number of deaths. “We are planning micro-management measures where we will decentralise our whole efforts to contain the virus as well as the death rates. We are making people aware that they need to test after they develop any symptoms. We are also ramping up the number of tests, and have asked the labs to fast-track the reports. We are also beefing up the hospital infrastructure, like increasing the number of beds along with ensuring adequate oxygen supply as well as medicines for the patients,” said Salunke.According to Dr Amin Kaba, who is associated with various city hospitals, several reasons contribute to the high fatality rate in the second phase. “The current mutant is more infective and virulent compared to the previous ones. In addition, we saw large youngsters dying as many believed they had stronger immunity and hence, they neglected the initial symptoms. In rural areas, the casual attitude of the people along with lack of proper hospital infrastructure added to the toll,” said Dr Kaba.He said that government needs to speed up the vaccination process if it wanted to control the deaths. “The lockdown should have ideally coincided with large scale vaccination but that was not the case. Vaccination impairs the severity of the virus,” Kaba added.The state government has imposed a severe lockdown in the rural parts of Solapur, which has been witnessing a surge in cases.Meanwhile, the Aurangabad police have raided a prominent cloth store that was conducting the business and detained the staff and consumers, for violating Covid-19 guidelines. In Nagpur, the police tightened its drive-by catching those roaming without valid reasons and conducted the Covid-19 test on violators.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-records-29-644-new-covid-19-cases-555-deaths-101621620771811.html
21-05-2021||Mumbai||Hold exams in the online mode: MBBS students urge Maharashtra govt||Less than three weeks before their exams are scheduled to take place in offline mode, second- and third-year medical, dental and para-medical students are demanding that the upcoming exams be held online. In a series of online petitions and letters addressed to the state government as well as officials at the Maharashtra University of Health Sciences (MUHS), students have highlighted that offline exams could prove dangerous for staff as well as students who will participate in the examination process.These demands come days after state medical education minister Amit Deshmukh announced that the long-pending winter examination session for undergraduate and postgraduate medical and dental courses will be held between June 10 and 30.“These exams have been postponed three times already because it was not feasible to hold an offline exam for 6,000-8,000 students at the time when the state is grappling with a pandemic. The situation hasn’t changed still, then how is the state planning to conduct physical exams in June?” asked a student, requesting anonymity. He added that time and again, students have highlighted the need for these exams to be conducted in the online mode, but the authorities have not paid heed.Second- and third-year MBBS exams, which usually take place in December-January, were postponed three times this year due to the rising Covid-19 cases recorded across the state. At first the exams were postponed to February from January, and then to April. However due to the second wave of Covid-19 gripping the nation, these exams were once again postponed to first week of June by the state government. “Many students are presently in their hometowns, away from the college campus, because all lectures were being held online this academic year. In order to appear for exams in the physical form, we will all have to travel to our college, share hostel rooms with at least three other students and share bathrooms as well. What guarantee does the state or university give us that we will not contract the virus,” asked another student.In a letter marked to MUHS officials, students highlighted how at present, at least 3,000 students across MUHS-affiliated institutes have tested positive for Covid-19, or have a close family member fighting for their lives. Conducting exams in the offline mode in such times could make the situation worse, students said.“All affiliated institutes have already started ensuring that safety measures are implemented during exams as well as at the hostels. Taking exams online will be difficult for several students and therefore exams will be conducted in offline mode,” said an official from MUHS. In a previous circular, the National Medical Commission (NMC) had clarified that in case students are unable to appear for their MBBS exams due to their health status or travel restrictions, those students be given the chance to appear for these papers at a later date by the examination authority.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/hold-exams-in-the-online-mode-mbbs-students-urge-maharashtra-govt-101621620710584.html
21-05-2021||Mumbai||Week before exam, Mumbai university releases sixth merit list for LLM course||Merely a week ahead of semester exams, the University of Mumbai (MU) released the sixth and final merit list of candidates admitted to the Masters of Law (LLM) course on Wednesday.The first semester exams for LLM students are scheduled to kick off on June 1 and newly admitted students will have only a week to prepare. “It is unfair of the university to expect students to prepare for exams in a week,” said a student on the condition of anonymity. On May 15, the university’s department of law issued a notice allowing candidates, who couldn’t make it to the five merit lists, to apply afresh to vacant seats for spot admissions. On the same notice, the department announced that the sixth merit list would be the last one. Rajeshwari Varhad, head of the department of law, did not respond to calls or messages. Meanwhile, the final merit list states that nine seats reserved for students from marginalised backgrounds would remain vacant for want of applicants. There are around 800 seats for LLM in six divisions—Constitutional and administrative law, business law, intellectual property and information technology law, human rights law, criminal law and criminal administration and environmental and legal order. The sixth merit list states that since there are no applications from Vanjari nomadic tribes (NT-D category) and as well as from other backward classes (OBC Category), one seat in the intellectual property law course will go vacant. Eight seats will go vacant in environmental law and order. Applicants claimed that until last year, all unclaimed seats were converted into general category seats in the final round of admissions. “This is an arbitrary rule brought in by the department this year that seats will go vacant if there are no applications from that category. As it is, the number of seats are precious few,” said an applicant, who had applied for environmental law and order after the fifth round. He didn’t make it to the sixth merit list despite scoring 70 marks in the entrance exam.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/week-before-exam-mumbai-university-releases-sixth-merit-list-for-llm-course-101621620650686.html
21-05-2021||Mumbai||Vax and wane: Mumbai sees sharp dip||The vaccination drive in Mumbai slowed down in May, with the average number of beneficiaries vaccinated per day dropping to 20,000 or lower, in comparison to 45,000 to 50,000 beneficiaries vaccinated per day in April. A total of 22,686 beneficiaries were vaccinated in Mumbai on Friday, of which 19,863 got their first dose, and 2,823 their second dose. On Thursday, a total of 19,361 beneficiaries were vaccinated, of which 16,769 got their first dose and 2,592 got their second dose. Over the past few weeks, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has introduced newer rules to streamline vaccination, avoid crowding at centres and achieve internal targets for certain age groups on priority, leading to confusion among beneficiaries. The BMC has pointed out that there are days during the drive when all vaccine slots are not filled up, and citizens are unwilling or unable to get their shots. Shortage of vaccine doses is another reason for reduced numbers. The BMC started vaccination of healthcare workers on January 16, of beneficiaries above age 60 years and those between 45 years and 59 years on March 1, and for beneficiaries in the age group of 18 years to 44 years on May 1, in line with the Centre’s directives. Until March, the BMC was vaccinating about 25,000 to 30,000 beneficiaries per day. However, by the end of March, the civic body set a target of 100,000 beneficiaries per day, and allowed walk-ins to accelerate vaccination in April. Subsequently, vaccination was stepped up to over 45,000 beneficiaries per day. However, in May, the BMC briefly stopped walk-in vaccination for all age groups to avoid crowding. Beneficiaries could opt for vaccination only by registering online and pre-booking a slot, posing a challenge to senior citizens. Saloni Sikdar, 26, a resident of Goregaon, said, “I booked slots on the Cowin application for my parents. Both of them have now received both their vaccine shots. But even for me, it was tedious to book a slot online. It is like a lottery, and you get virtually five seconds to manage your booking. It took a lot of research to understand the process. But one of my relatives, who is 50 years old, has been trying to register herself and her 70-year-old mother, but is unable to figure out the process. For those without younger family members at home, it is very challenging.” From Monday, the BMC will restart walk-in vaccinations for beneficiaries above the age of 60 years for the first and second dose, to increase the turnout and speed up the vaccination. Of the 1,100,000 beneficiaries in this age group, 300,000 have still not got their first dose. Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner in charge of the public health department, said, “Shortage of vaccine doses is one reason. The BMC also wants to prioritise vaccinating citizens above age 60 years, especially those who are due for their second dose. To avoid crowding at centres, some days, we limit the drive only to senior citizens. On some days, all our slots are not booked, indicating there is still some hesitation among citizens to get vaccinated. “ Anjum Shaikh, 28, a resident of Mumbai Central, who is a healthcare worker, said, “I booked slots for my parents, and my uncle and aunt. While my parents got the vaccine shots, my uncle and aunt were hesitant to get vaccinated and missed their appointment. They fall in the 45-60 age group. Now we are unable to book slots for them. There is also a lot of confusion about which days the drive is open for 45 years and above. We were trying to book slots again last week, but we found out the BMC had paused vaccination for this age group.” Vanita Kawale, 78, got her first dose of covaxin in March. When she was due for her second dose, Covaxin was not available at many centres, and Vanita had to run pillar to post to get her second dose in time. According to data from the state government, in the first week of May, a total of 190,074 beneficiaries were vaccinated in Mumbai, of which 122,654 received their second dose and 67,420 the first dose. In the second week of May, a total of 209,428 beneficiaries were vaccinated in Mumbai, of which 104,973 received their second dose and 104,455 received their first dose.

On the contrary, in the last week of April, 263,461 beneficiaries were vaccinated, of which 113,967 got their first dose and 149,494 their second dose. In the third week of April, 280,735 beneficiaries were vaccinated, in the second week, 309,578 beneficiaries were vaccinated, and in the first week of April, 340,461 beneficiaries were vaccinated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/vax-and-wane-mumbai-sees-sharp-dip-101621620590581.html
21-05-2021||Mumbai||Compared to April, Mumbai cases drop 76%, deaths up 61%||The number of Covid-19 cases recorded in the first 20 days of May has dropped by around 76% when compared with the first 20 days of April, which was considered to be the peak of the city’s second wave, according to the state health department data.

The total case tally in the city is 694,200 while the death toll is 14,464. The recovery rate in the city is 93% with 649,128 recoveries. The city’s fatality rate is 2.08% and there are 28,579 active cases in the city.The daily positivity rate in April, during the second wave in the city, has gone down from around 25 to 15% to around 4%, as of Friday. The daily positivity rate was 4.27% on Friday, as 1,415 samples were tested positive for Covid, of the 33,078 samples tested.According to the data, between May 1 and May 20, 40,417 cases were reported, compared to 170,640 in the same period during April. Further, 1,195 deaths were reported between May 1 and May 20 compared to 738 during the same period in April.In the same period, Mumbai reported 897,951 number of tests between April 1 and April 20 compared to 557,817 tests during the same period in May. The number of discharges decreased in the month of May compared to April, owing to a fall in the number of cases.

The state task force member Dr Shashank Joshi said though the overall fatality rate is not increasing, number of deaths on a week-on-week basis is on a rise.“We need to be vigilant, as despite in decline in the number of cases, we are seeing an increase in the number of deaths. This is very worrying. Two major reasons for this can be - late treatment or self-treatment, and the patients who have got infected last month during the peak, succumbing to the virus now after prolonged treatment on ventilator and ICU beds,” Dr Joshi said.Another expert, Dr Madhav Sathe, former microbiology professor at Nair Hospital said, “Nowadays we are also seeing many patients being referred to Mumbai for treatment. This could be one of the reasons increase in the number of deaths in the city. However, the concern remains on those getting self-treatment via searching on the internet and those going to the hospital late.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/compared-to-april-mumbai-cases-drop-76-deaths-up-61-101621620531744.html

Tikait had addressed his first mahapanchayat in Kandela.Jind immunisation officer Dr Navneet Singh said misinformation is tracking in rural areas and many villagers were initially hesitating to get the vaccine jab.“After a combined effort of the administration, farmers, media and the health department, vaccination drive was started at Khatkar toll plaza last month. The response is such that we have administered vaccine jabs to 470 persons above 45 years of age at Khatkar toll plaza,” Singh said.“Farmers are coming to get the jab at Khatkar toll plaza in good numbers. Similarly, we received a satisfactory response at Roopgarh village, where people had earlier asked us to leave the village and were not allowing to set up camp for vaccination. Now people are supporting health officials and appearing for vaccination,” Singh added.“Earlier, due to misinformation, people were thinking that they have strong immunity and are capable of fighting the virus without the jab. We carried out awareness campaigns to inform people the need and benefits of inoculation,” he added.Sandeep Kumar, sarpanch of Roopgarh village in Jind, said they have sanitised the village and collected ₹2.5 lakh from villagers in donations to purchase medicines and install isolation centre.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/covid-vaccination-drive-picks-pace-in-jind-villages-101621615433339.html

However, the villagers mistook them as staff of Covid-19 inoculation drive and held them hostage for hours,” Sudhir Prakash, Goilkera block development officer (BDO), said.This assumes significance in view of widespread confusion and reluctance over availing the Covid-19 vaccine among people in rural areas of the three districts of Kolhan division - West Singhbhum, East Singhbhum and Seraikela-Kharsawan.Following the incident, the ANM filed an application and forwarded the same to the district headquarters. “We will take action as per the guidelines by the DC. People should co-operate with medical staff on vaccination drive because it is for the benefit of us all. They should not misbehave with medical staff,” added Prakash. In her application, the ANM alleged that she and her husband were held hostage by the villagers for three to four hours. “They threatened us of dire consequences and warned against coming to the village for vaccination. We somehow convinced them and managed to return to Goilkera safely by late Thursday evening,” Sunita said.West Singhbhum DC Ananya Mittal and other senior district officials have been holding a series of meetings with traditional village heads, called Mankis and Mundas, for the past few days to raise awareness about the absolute necessity to get vaccinated against Covid-19 pandemic. Meanwhile, East Singhbhum DC Suraj Kumar issued order to all BDOs in the district to conduct awareness campaign and rope in people’s representatives, sevikas, sahayikas, self-help groups and sakhi mandals to convince villagers to come forward and get vaccinated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/health-staff-held-hostage-threatened-in-west-singhbhum-village-101621614469996.html

The couple reportedly fought frequently.On Thursday morning, Chandan and his wife had an altercation after which the woman stormed out and went to her parents’ house in rural Mokama, leaving the children with their father.On Friday morning, a relative visited Chandan’s house but saw the two children lying lifeless inside the house.

He has been booked for murder and bodies sent for autopsy to Barh Sadar Hospital, the SHO said.“Prima facie, the investigation suggests that Chandan doubted his wife’s fidelity and picked up a fight with her, which led to the gruesome incident, resulting in the death of their nine-year-old son and a five-year-old daughter,” Mishra said, adding that police had recovered a sharp-edged weapon from the spot which was used in crime.“Based on our investigation till now, Chandan committed the crime suspecting that they were his illegitimate children,” the SP said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/man-kills-two-minor-children-after-fight-with-wife-arrested-101621614410092.html

Defence counsel Sanjay Kumar argued that the prosecution had failed to prove the participation of the appellants in the crime with credible evidence. Altogether, 23 witnesses and five doctors who conducted autopsies on the deceased recorded their statement before the court. “On appreciation of evidence adduced during trial, court finds that there is a real and reasonable doubt as to the guilt of the appellants. Accordingly, the impugned judgment of conviction and order of sentences are, hereby, set aside,” the bench said. Earlier, on November 18, 2016, the Jehanabad district court had sentenced 10 persons to death and awarded life imprisonment to three others. The court had acquitted 23 others for lack of evidence. Those who were awarded the death penalty are Bacchesh Singh, Buddhan Yadav, Butai Yadav, Satendra Das, Lallan Pasi, Dwarika Paswan, Kariban Paswan, Godai Paswan, Uma Paswan and Gopal Paswan. On the evening of March 18, 1999, alleged MCC members forced 34 people to line up near a temple at Senari village and killed them by slitting their throats and shooting them.Chinta Devi, whose husband Awadh Kishore Sharma and son Madhukar alias Jhabbu were among those massacred, was the complainant in the case. She died in 2011. Sources in the home department said the Senari incident, one of the last in a series of caste-related massacres at the time, is believed to be in retaliation to the Lakshman-Bathe massacre in which 58 Dalits were killed in 1997.Sanjay Sharma and Rakesh Sharma, eyewitnesses of the incident, said the village could have been chosen as target because of its inaccessibility. The village has 300 around houses. Meanwhile, police have been deployed at Senari after the HC order. The massacre had drawn international attention. The bodies were lifted for last rites by kin only after the arrival of the then union ministers George Fernandes, Nitish Kumar and Yashwant Sinha.

The three-member committee had earlier raised issues related to oxygen shortage, manpower requirement, security etc. at the hospital. The bench wanted the state government’s response on that. “We are dealing with PMCH and ESIC hospitals separately. There still seems to be issues with ESIC hospital,” the court said. Additional solicitor general KN Singh said that the ESIC hospital was managed by the Army on one floor and ESIC on the other. “The Army authorities have communicated that all beds are not occupied. Same is the condition with the portion managed by the ESIC. Army authorities had earlier pointed out certain deficiencies, which the state acted upon,” he said. Death registration Former additional solicitor general SD Sanjay drew the attention of the bench on the issue of delay in issue of death certificates, which was causing problems to the kin of victims in availing insurance claims and other compensations. “Many of the victims were breadwinners for their families and without death certificate, they cannot do anything,” he said. The bench said that the issue was already under consideration and its order on Buxar death registration issue was a test case. “If the officials of the panchayati raj institutions don’t comply with the court’s order within a week and fail to update death registrations, we will stop their salary and even seize their powers,” it said. On Monday, the court had expressed its displeasure over apparent inconsistency in figures of death in Buxar, where 81 bodies were found floating in the Ganga river and later cremated, as provided in the affidavits filed by the Patna division commissioner and the chief secretary. The court had sought the figures of the entire district to be furnished since March 1. The court said this would apply to all the districts of the state. It also pointed out that in the digital era, the websites were also not updated to get the correct figures of death. Biowaste disposal With the availability of home testing kits likely from next week through the open market, the issue of biowaste disposal was again raised before the bench. The bench said it was time to seek information from the four private agencies, which have been assigned the job of collecting biowaste. The court had on Thursday observed that the matter of biowaste disposal in Patna town was an issue not confined to private and government hospitals only, but also labs and homes, where people were living in isolation, and sought details of the quantum of biowaste generation and the way they were being treated from the Patna Municipal Corporation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/hc-seeks-status-report-on-esic-hospital-says-buxar-a-test-case-101621614350718.html

All the new cases have been found among Covid patients undergoing treatment at government and private facilities,” said Dr Anjani Kumar, addtiional director, health services, Bihar. As per the break-up, 40 patients suffering from black fungus infection are admitted in private hospitals in Patna where as rest of 77 patients are admitted in AIIMS, Patna, PMCH, NMCH and Indira Gandhi Institute of Medical Sciences, Patna. “All the patients are Covid infected and have developed black fungus. They come from different districts in the state,” an official in the health department said. Though the infection rate of black fungus among Covid patients is still low i Bihar compared to states like Maharashtra, Delhi and a few others, the health department has made allotments of amphotericin-B, an antifungal drug used for treating black fungus cases, to all major hospitals to tackle the rising cases of the infection. “We are constantly monitoring the cases and ensuring supplies of drugs for treatment of black fungus. There is enough stocks of anti-fungal drug,” said Kumar. Dr Vinay Swaroop, ENT surgeon and former additional director, health, said black fungus itself is nothing new, but its prevalence among Covid patients was rising owing to low immunity and overuse of steroids. “It is advisable that persons affected with Covid and living in home quarantine should take preventive measures, like keeping their rooms well ventilated with lot of sunlight coming in and also rinse their mouth with salt water three times in a day. One should avoid wearing reused masks and take lukewarm water for drinking and bathing . Too much of inhaling steam is also not good as it weaken the nasal blankets. Even healthy persons should apply these methods to prevent fungus entering through mouth and nose,” he said. Meanwhile, sources said AIIMS-Patna and PMCH have set up separate wards for treatment of black fungus affected patients so that they could be kept under constant monitoring. So far, two deaths have been attributed to black fungus, including of one doctor. Bihar has diverted around 14,000 vials of Liposomal Amphotericin-B injection, a specific drug for the treatment of black fungus, available under the kala-azar elimination programme. Around 6,000 vials of injection from this stock were made available to different hospitals. The AIIMS had got 2,000 vials, while each of the nine state-run medical college hospitals had received 200-300 vials each, said Bihar health minister Mangal Pandey.

The administration also claimed that the number of tests for Covid has also increased in the second wave in the district.As per the comparison, Pune saw 8,818 deaths during the first wave between March 20 and November 20, and 6,488 deaths during the second wave between February 21 and May 20. The overall case fatality rate (CFR) in the first wave went up 2.4, while during the second wave it dropped to 1.5.While the number of deaths stayed low during the second wave, the data also showed that the number of maximum active cases during the second wave was much higher, more than double, of that of the first wave. While the first wave saw its peak on September 20 when the number of cases touched 57,298, on April 18 the cases crossed over 0.1 million. Dr Subhash Salunkhe, Covid-19 advisor to Maharashtra said, “We knew that the newer strain which could have possibly resulted in the second wave surge was not as deadly as the first wave strain. Although it does spread faster it leads to fewer complications. However, this does not mean that it is to be taken lightly, if the number of infections rises, in proportion the number of deaths among those most vulnerable might also go up.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/number-of-covid-deaths-in-pune-down-in-the-second-wave-admin-101621610809659.html
21-05-2021||Pune||Loss of biodiversity forces microbes to “hitchhike” on humans: researchers||A research paper published by the Indian Journal of Medical Research in April 2021 called Hitchhiking microbes: Declining biodiversity and emerging zoonoses sheds light on the role of declining biodiversity and emerging diseases on humans which has led to new diseases like Covid-19 being passed on to humans. This research was presented on the occasion of the international day for biological diversity on May 22 by Gurudas Nulkar, Madhura Bedarkar of Symbiosis International University (SIU) and Symbiosis Institute of Business Management (SIBM) along with Ketaki Ghate, Oikos for Ecological Services, Sakshi Nulkar, intern and wildlife researcher, ecological society, Pune. The research paper argues that microbes which were found in animals, have jumped on to other animals, because of habitat loss and food loss, this is why we now see microbes hitchhiking, for example, the way Covid has jumped from bats to human beings. “The connection between nature conservation and human wellbeing is well known, however, the role of declining biodiversity and emerging diseases is relatively less studied. The presence of a thriving biological diversity is known to have therapeutic effects on human health, but economic activities have contributed to a sharp decline in species, resulting in poor ecosystem health. Several studies have shown how microorganisms have switched from animals to humans, leading to novel diseases and we have presented studies on zoonotic diseases and biodiversity, with examples from India,” said Nulkar. According to Nulkar, the biodiversity in the city is undergoing a change which can be seen in bird species seen in the city. “We have more crows, mynas and squirrels seen in the city while in wilderness, you will come across flycatchers, thurshes and other birds which are now completely missing from the cityscape. This is because of urbanization, deforestation and infrastructure that have changed the biodiversity in the city,” he said. Earlier too, we witnessed diseases such as rabies, leptospirosis, plague, scrub typhus, Nipah virus, Kyasanur forest disease, Japanese encephalitis, and various types of influenza are causing small and consistent outbreaks in animal and human populations across India. “Rabies, another disease with a 100 per cent fatality rate, is not an emerging infectious disease, but has existed for a long time. As a rabies-endemic country, India is estimated to have 20,000 rabies deaths every year, among 20 million dog bite cases a year. Nearly 36 per cent of the world’s rabies deaths occur in India every year. This disease has the potential to spillback into healthy populations of wild canids, small mammals and bat species through dog bites, as free ranging dogs are increasingly found to have conflicts with wild animals,” said the research. It also highlights that increasing mining has led to a sharp decline in natural forests, which has forced out apex predators and increased human-animal conflicts. This has denuded millions of hectares of forests all over the world. “Three major infrastructure projects sanctioned in 2020 in Goa will go through the Mollem National Park, diverting over 250 hectares of forest land for commercial purposes. Of this, 170 hectares falls within protected areas. Mollem is host to a large biodiversity and several threatened species are found here. The proposed Hubballi-Ankola rail project in North Karnataka will divert 727 hectares of pristine forests and 2.2 lakh trees will be fallen. This is part of the ecologically fragile Western Ghats, home to rare and endangered flora and fauna,” said Nulkar. Viruses, bacteria and other types of microbes are capable of inflicting diseases in plants, animals and humans. In a healthy ecosystem, they are usually constrained geographically and seasonally by ecological relationships and the regulatory functions of ecosystem services. Researchers have established an association between biodiversity loss and human health. Biodiversity must be conserved even in urban environment, with patches of wilderness given importance, like for example leaving the Tekdis alone and not building any infrastructure that could imbalance the biodiversity. It is argued that conservation of biodiversity and ecosystems and changes in economic activities must be made to ward off new diseases, and this is why cooperation between ministries is critical to restrict the decline of biological diversity in a megadiverse country like India. The diversity of potential disease-causing organisms is also greater, only a fraction of which are currently known to science. The zoonotic disease outbreaks in India like Covid- 19, Nipah virus, Swine flu, KFD among others have pointed to a need for continuous surveillance for detecting zoonoses early and initiating timely and efficient management of these diseases. However, the field of studies concerning zoonotic diseases and their implications are largely isolated, institutionally, with studies undertaken by ecologists, public health experts, and agriculturists, all working in isolation and there is hardly any public awareness and engagement seen. In the recent national budget of 2021-2022, the government has made a provision for establishing the Institute of One Health, to manage endemic and emerging epidemic threats of zoonotic diseases, where it offers a holistic approach for combating the emerging global health concerns with transdisciplinary efforts, especially with respect to zoonotic diseases.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/loss-of-biodiversity-forces-microbes-to-hitchhike-on-humans-researchers-101621610569654.html

21-05-2021||Pune||Forest department to clear encroachments at Sinhagad fort||The forest department authorities have warned for a crackdown on illegal structures which have come up inside and along the historic Sinhagad fort. The structures erected by locals as stalls for food have been issued the third and final notice for removal failing which action will be taken. Forest officials said surprise action will be taken against violators. As many 300 establishments comprising of hotels, zunka bhakar kiosks, curd outlets and others are going to come under the hammer of the department which seems to be in no mood to relent. The kiosks are mostly owned by villagers from Avsarwadi, Sinhagad, Mardari, Kalyan peth, Koliwada, Atkarwadi, Golewadi (Donje), Kondanapur. The forest department claimed that Sinhagad forest was situated in reserve and protected forest area in survey no 321/323 and the notices to the encroachers have been given under reserve forest act 1927 and 1980. The first notice seeking removal of the encroachment was given on April 15, 2017, followed by second one on Oct 13, 2017, while the third and the last notice was slapped on May 5. Bhamburda range forest officer Deepak Pawar said, “We have given them notice thrice and they will have to remove all the encroachments failing which we will remove them by our staff. We have mentioned about the violations in the notice which has been served to all.” Meanwhile, on behalf of the vendors, Dattatreya Jorkar, former president of forest protection committee of Ghera Sinhgad-Sambrewadi village said, “The forest department will have to face the wrath of the villagers as the action amounts to snatching away their livelihood. The forest department threat is injustice to the sons of the soil and the matter must be resolved with discussion between elected representation and forest officials. We will take all the villagers into confidence and offer all necessary cooperation to the forest department. However, the drive must be cancelled taking into Covid-19 lockdown and the problems the villagers are facing due to it.” Rahul Patil, deputy conservator of forests (Pune) said, “The road that leads to Sinhagad is with forest and no construction work involving cement, bricks and sand will be allowed. The permission from Public Works Department (PWD) and Pune Metropolitan and Regional Development Authority (PMRDA) is essential. We will take strong action and remove the encroachments soon.” Box In October 2020, the forest department issued notices to four villagers staying on Sinhagad fort and had directed them to submit a written explanation failing which they will have to vacate their residing properties on immediate basis. The families which have been asked to vacate have been residing there for the past five to six generations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/forest-department-to-clear-encroachments-at-sinhagad-fort-101621607449217.html
21-05-2021||Pune||Prolonged power cuts irk Keshavanagar residents in Mundhwa||Residents of Keshavnagar in Mundhwa had to face power cuts for nearly 50 hours on multiple days in the month of May which caused untold suffering for citizens, patients and work from home professionals. According to the residents, the main supply duct was tampered from the motive of power theft which led to the breakdown. According to residents, the alleged illegal tampering of the electricity supply line has been done near Bolhaimata Mandir locality. Sanjay Bhoir, who has recently recovered from Covid-19 said, “We had to face power cuts for many times during the month. The summer heat has been unbearable, and I had to stay without a fan for hours together. Also, a lack of electricity made other tasks difficult for women of our house like water. As there were power cuts, water could be filled in the overhead tank and women had to go down to fetch water from the common tap and climb back home. I hope that the MSEDCL corrects its mistake and provides electricity without any breakdown.” Citizens staying on the banks of the river in the area complained that they had to face mosquito bites in the absence of electricity. “Power failure caused total disruption of our sleeping habits and we found it difficult to complete the household chore work. We have small kids and aged people in our house and performing daily tasks had become a challenge this May. The sudden power failure early morning and evening affects cooking and leads to frustration,” said Sandhya Ghogare. Atul Lonare, another resident said “We are worried about the power failure impact on sensitive and expensive electronic equipment such as LCD televisions and air conditioners, stabilisers and inverters. It is very difficult for an ordinary resident to buy these gadgets and their maintenance is costly. We are worried that the outages should not destroy our gadgets. The MSEDCL must take active steps to mitigate our sufferings.” MSEDCL authorities maintained that due to private and public works underway the MSEDCL power supply lines ( high and low tension) were broken at 85 spots at least which was causing untold suffering to over 33,000 area residents and even resulting in financial losses in the entire Mundhwa area. The cable wires are broken late night either by private operators or persons and it becomes a cumbersome task to attend to the faults. The MSEDCL staffers ensure that the faults are repaired, and power restored.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/prolonged-power-cuts-irk-keshavanagar-residents-in-mundhwa-101621607389343.html
21-05-2021||Pune||Pune receives 8mm rain on Friday, more rain likely||Due to moderately strong western winds, Konkan and Central Maharashtra including Pune may receive rainfall in the next few days. Cyclone Yaas may affect monsoon progress over Bay of Bengal thus affecting the progress over Maharashtra as well, said meteorologists from the India Meteorological Department (IMD). However, Maharashtra and Pune city will receive rainfall before the monsoon begins, according to the weather department. As of Friday, the onset of Southwest monsoon occurred Nicobar Island, according to IMD. Conditions are favourable for further advance of Southwest monsoon into some more parts of southwest Bay of Bengal, most parts of southeast Bay of Bengal, the entire Andaman Sea and Andaman Islands and some parts of east central Bay of Bengal until May 23. Anupam Kashyapi, head of weather forecasting department at IMD Pune said that cloudy weather will continue in Pune city. “We have forecasted that cloudy weather will remain in Pune city and there are chances of light rainfall. Due to moderately strong westerlies winds, Konkan, Central Maharashtra will get isolated light rain and Pune will also receive light rain in the next few days,” said Kashyapi. On Friday, Pune recorded a total of 8mm rainfall. “Cloudy weather along with light rainfall towards afternoon is likely in Pune city until May 26. This rainfall may be accompanied with thunderstorm and lightning,” said IMD officials. On Friday, cyclonic circulation over Southwest Bay of Bengal and neighbourhood now lies over Southeast and adjoining Central Bay of Bengal. Under its influence IMD officials said that a low-pressure area is very likely to form over east central Bay of Bengal and adjoining north Andaman Sea around May 22. The IMD said that it is very likely to intensify into a cyclonic storm by May 24. It is very likely to move north-westwards and reach Odisha-West Bengal coast around morning of May 26. “This system may not directly affect Maharashtra. However, it may affect the progress of monsoon over Bay of Bengal,” said Kashyapi. Speaking about the delay in Monsoon advancement, OP Sreejith, scientist, climate monitoring and forecast, IMD Pune said that the picture will be clear after the cyclone conditions are over. “The clear picture about the advancement of monsoon can be seen only after the cyclone is clear. The cyclone may affect the cross-equatorial flow of winds but because of the cyclone many parts of the country will receive rainfall,” said Sreejith. He added that Maharashtra is also likely to continue receiving rainfall due to other active weather systems. “So even if there are chances of delay in Monsoon advancement, there will be rainfall in many parts,” said Sreejith.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/pune-receives-8mm-rain-on-friday-more-rain-likely-101621607269230.html
21-05-2021||Pune||Petrol price reach ₹99 mark in Pune, diesel price at ₹89.31||The price of petrol has reached the mark of ₹99 per litre in the city on Friday. The diesel price soared as well and recorded a price of ₹89.31 per litre. After a two-month hiatus, fuel prices began to soar from the first week of May. If the trend continues, petrol prices will touch ₹100 in Pune. On Friday, the petrol price hiked by ₹0.18 and diesel price hiked by ₹0.30. After February 27, the fuel prices in the city had started to record a hike from May 4. On May 4, the hiked prices of fuels were petrol at ₹96.62, premium petrol at ₹100.30 and diesel at ₹86.32. This was the first hike in the fuel prices after almost two months. In the months of March and April, fuel prices had marginally declined but from May 4, the prices soared again. As the fuel price has been soaring, transporters are getting more and more worried about the prospect of their business. “Now, because of lockdown, there is less transportation at present but increasing fuel prices is adding to the misery. If the restrictions are eased and transportation of goods increases, then everyone will feel the burn of these soaring prices as we won’t be able to continue our business with current rates. We are already going into the loss, and it is becoming difficult to survive for those who are in the transportation business. If the cost of transportation increases then the cost of everything in the market is bound to increase,” said Ram Kadam, president, Pune district motor goods transport association. Ali Daruwala, spokesperson All India petrol dealers’ association did not comment on when the fuel price hike will discontinue. Experts say that the only way to provide immediate relief to common people is to waive taxation imposed on the fuels. “There are heavy taxes imposed by the state and the Central government. Steps must be taken to ease the burden on the common people,” said Vivek Velankar, president, Sajag Nagrik Manch Pune. “After the lockdown, the government will have to reduce the fuel prices. People are already stressed out because of the pandemic and the exceeding cost of the treatments. Soaring fuel prices will just add to the misery,” said Ram Kadam, president, Pune district motor goods transport association.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/petrol-price-reach-99-mark-in-pune-diesel-price-at-8931-101621607209323.html
21-05-2021||Pune||Pune rural accounts for 48% of Pune’s Covid cases in the dist, available beds only 17%||Pune: The rise in cases from Pune rural has now become evident as over 48% of the cases from the district are reported from its 1,405 villages. However, despite the spike in cases, only 17% of the beds in the district is reserved for Covid from rural Pune. The shortage of beds in rural areas will add the load on hospitals located on the periphery of city limits. The administration is convinced that the current number of beds is sufficient enough to handle the surge in Covid cases in the rural areas. As per the Covid-19 dashboard, the district has a total of 33,314 beds dedicated for Covid for the entire district of which 16,629 are vacant. While PMC has 14,156 dedicated beds for Covid, PCMC has 10,563 beds, Pune rural has only 5,920 beds of which, as of Friday morning as per the dashboard, only 2,110 are vacant. Of the vacant beds, 1,420 are isolation beds, 615 are isolation beds with oxygen and 67 are ICU beds without ventilators and 8 are vacant ICU with ventilator beds. On Thursday, as per the district health office report, Pune district reported 3,801 new Covid cases of which 1,854 were from rural areas. As per the progressive Covid count, rural has 210,046 total cases of which 179,015 have recovered, 2,755 declared dead and 28,276 are active cases (8,166 in hospital and 20,110 in home isolation). The overall positivity rate of rural Pune is 24.06% while on Thursday the positivity rate of rural Pune stood at 20.08%. However, zilla parishad officials who overlook the administration in the 1,405 villages claimed that the current number of beds in rural Pune is sufficient enough. Ayush Prasad, chief executive officer, zilla parishad said, “We just got 25 ventilators for rural Pune through CSR and other funds, of which we have distributed 14 and 11 are about to be distributed. Also, we are hoping to get more ventilators through CSR and PM Cares. Also, we are pushing more private hospitals to invest more money into their hospitals and ramp up their infrastructure as well. We have a smooth coordination system at taluka level to ensure that no bed skips our radar and that every patient gets it.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/pune-rural-accounts-for-48-of-pune-s-covid-cases-in-the-dist-available-beds-only-17-101621606969348.html

We have taken a decision on lockdown. We had strict restrictions till 24th May. As per the opinion of experts, we are extending the strict restrictions till 7th June at 6am," said Karnataka chief minister BS Yediyurappa.He said that the government has decided to give free treatment for mucormycosis (black fungus) patients in the government district hospitals.Yediyurappa said that there are no changes in the restrictions but added that people were not following the lockdown norms and has allowed the police authorities to take action against the violators."Same guidelines will continue. People are roaming after 10am as well which is creating a lot of problems throughout the state. That's why such movements must be stopped. I urge people to stop unnecessary movements," he added.Many ministers and experts have suggested an extension of the lockdown as the number of deaths and Covid-19 cases have increased, according to the Chief Minister's Office. They are of the opinion that the current lockdown is yielding results with the number of fresh Covid-19 cases gradually declining.The Karnataka government initially announced a 14-day lockdown from April 27, but later on imposed a complete lockdown from May 10 to May 24, as the state was reporting over 10,000 fresh Covid-19 cases every day.Karnataka on Thursday reported 28,869 new Covid-19 cases, 52,257 recoveries and 548 deaths.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/karnataka-extends-covid-19-lockdown-from-may-24-for-14-days-till-june-7-101621604487039.html

He said by Friday the district had more than 300 cases of mucormycosis (black fungus) and there is demand for almost 1,800 injections per day. The minister said the medicine count is not available in this proportion and there is no more shortage of Remdesivir. “Currently in Pune there are more than 300 cases of black fungus. In Pune, patients from outstation are also hospitalised. There is a shortage of injections for this disease. Six injections have to be given to a patient on a daily basis. The issue of this shortage has been raised with the Prime Minister.“We have contacted the manufacturer of these medicines and they have said that we have to give it to the Centre first and then it will be allocated to states. At least 1,800 injections are required in Pune district in a day, but those many are unavailable. We are trying to do what we can,” said Pawar.A control room was established at Pune collectorate on May 18 to regulate the supply and distribution of the medicines required to treat mucormycosis patients. On Thursday, the first round of the medicine distribution to the private hospitals was done by the district administration. According to the details issued by the authorities, there were 247 patients being treated in 33 private hospitals in the district. In Deenanath Mangeshkar hospital in Erandwane there are currently 55 mucormycosis patients admitted. Hospital administration claimed that there is only 15-20 per cent supply of the medicines than the requirement. “Currently, it is not possible to administer the required daily dose of medications to the mucormycosis patients because of the shortage. The plight of the relatives for these medicines continues. There is only 15-20 per cent of the supply than the demand,” said Dr Dhannajay Kelkar, medical director, Deenanath Mangeshkar Hospital.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/more-than-300-patients-of-mucormycosis-in-district-need-1-800-injections-per-day-ajit-pawar-101621605889165.html
21-05-2021||Pune||PMC will hire skilled firemen on contract for Covid centres||Pune: Manpower crunch forces the Pune fire department to appoint firemen on contract basis to be deputed at Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC)-run Covid-19 care centre (CCC). PMC issued a tender to call agencies to provide trained firemen. After fifteen people died in the Virar (Mumbai) fire incident at a Covid hospital last month, a minor fire incident was reported at the Kamala Nehru hospital parking lot in Pune. As many as 24 Covid patients had died after oxygen supply was disrupted due to a leak in the main oxygen storage tank at a Nashik hospital on April 21. Following these incidents, PMC issued an order to depute two firemen for 24x7 on 16 Covid-19 care centres (CCC) for surveillance as well as nodal officers to the medical oxygen supply system of PMC hospitals. However, it was not applied because of manpower shortage. Now, the corporation has floated tender and invited agencies to supply trained firemen to depute on Covid care centres. Prashant Ranpise, PMC head of fire department, said, “Due to lack of manpower, we have taken the decision to hire trained firemen from private agencies such as government recognised fire institutes. At present, Pune city has 14 fire stations and 296 staff. As per the state government sanctioned staff, we need 910 firemen. In 2014, the strength was 510. After that, there is no recruitment at the fire department and firemen retire every year. Around 15 firemen are going to retire next month.” In a week, the department receives 35-40 fire calls and the count touched 70 during summer. The main station is located at Bhavani peth which has 40 firemen. There are nine firemen at work daily in each shift.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/pmc-will-hire-skilled-firemen-on-contract-for-covid-centres-101621605469077.html
21-05-2021||Mumbai||Malavika’s Mumbaistan: In The Eye of The Cyclone||This Monday, Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) chief Iqbal Singh Chahal woke up at his usual hour of 6am at his stately official bungalow on tree-lined Carmichael Road, but despite his salubrious surroundings, the senior bureaucrat was circumspect. Four days earlier he had received an alert from the India Meteorological Department (IMD) of the very severe Cyclone Tauktae that would be approaching Mumbai that day. Chahal, who credits his Army officer father for his ethic of never leaving anything to chance, had immediately convened a meeting with his senior colleagues where standard operating procedures (SOPs) to tackle flooding, tree falls and damage to life and property had been established. The next day, at a four-hour meeting called by Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, these preparations were reviewed and finessed. As a matter of abundant precaution, it was decided to shut the sea link and the airport and shift all 580 Covid patients from jumbo facilities into hospitals. As soon as he awoke, Chahal began receiving half-hourly updates from his colleagues. Then, at 8am he set off on his rounds to assess the situation himself, first stopping at Worli Koliwada, then Bandra and Andheri. By 11.30am he was headed back to BMC headquarters, from where he began monitoring developments on the mammoth screen at the central control room adjoining his office. Its 5,500 camera feeds afforded him a real-time, vantage view of the unfolding situation. Despite the gathering storm, things seemed under control, except for a small hiccup at 6pm, when he received a red alert that an 18-kilometre-thick cloud had appeared over Mumbai. Fortunately, the crisis was managed and by 11pm, realising that the worst was over, the father of triplets returned home. “Despite a wind speed of 130kms and the highest recorded rainfall since 1948, there wasn’t a single fatality in the entire BMC area of 406 square kms with a population of 16 million,” he said when we spoke the next day. Most importantly, the decision to move the 580 Covid patents had been a crucial one as there had been considerable damage and flooding at the jumbo centres. Extreme challenges and catastrophes are no stranger to Chahal, who has the distinction of clearing his IAS entrance exam on his first try at the age of 22. Consider his first month as Mumbai’s municipal commissioner: When he took over on May 8 last year, the city was reeling from the blow of the first wave of the pandemic; positivity was at its highest, with Dharavi on fire and corpses being found on footpaths and road dividers. “My friends and relatives sent me WhatsApp messages asking if they should congratulate or commiserate, as I had inherited a deadly situation in what was considered the most difficult job in the country,” he said. A lesser man would have been daunted, but not Chahal — a national-level swimmer, half-marathon runner and yoga practitioner. Realising that Mumbai’s 3,700 beds would be woefully inadequate to service the expected demand, Chahal managed to convince CEOs of private hospitals to surrender 80% of their beds, telling them that their short-term commercial losses would be nothing compared to the long-term pain of losing a foothold of the future medical tourism industry. Their compliance had immediately taken the bed count to almost 9,000. Simultaneously, with support from Thackeray, who he credits for his visionary, empowering leadership, he requisitioned the construction of eight new jumbo centres across the city, taking the bed count to a staggering 23,000. It was in the same month that Chahal took the controversial decision to scrap BMC’s central Covid control room and instead created war rooms in the city’s 24 wards — a decision that earned him much criticism. “Every day by 7pm, when about 1,500 patients would be informed by labs that they were Covid positive they would generate around 10 panic calls each,” he explained. “Our 30-line control room would collapse between 7pm and 9pm under their onslaught of 15,000 calls. Then, the media and opposition would begin relaying that Mumbai’s health system had collapsed creating more panic,” he says. Chahal’s next move was even more controversial. He decided to scrap direct communication between labs and positive patients, making Mumbai the first city in the country to do so. The plan was that the city’s daily results would instead be fed by the labs into a software which would split the list. “If 10,000 cases came in one day, they got divided into roughly 400 cases per ward, and with each war room having 10 dashboards, every doctor would get about 40 names, of which 80% would be asymptomatic, requiring allotment of only seven to eight beds,” he says. But the plan would only work if Chahal could find 1,000 doctors to man those dashboards. Overnight, he enlisted medical interns from across Maharashtra. “We hiked their stipend from ₹11,000 to ₹50,000 deciding that money was not an issue. And they were housed in five-star hotels, with free boarding and lodging, at walking distance from their ward war rooms,” he says, adding, “And they worked remarkably well.” With all this in place, Chahal began to get a grip on Mumbai’s out-of-control pandemic. Dharavi was the first to benefit from his strategy, attracting international attention and winning praise from WHO when its positivity rate dropped significantly. Chahal further explained this “Chase the patient” approach of the now-renowned Mumbai model, “Once the doctors in the war rooms received confirmation of positive patients, they would visit them at their homes, check their markers and find them an appropriate hospital bed for treatment. The same ambulance would then transport them to the hospital, where a universal subsidised rate had been organised.” Sangitaa Advani, founder-director of Skill Shakti Institute, is one among the many beneficiaries of this strategy. When members of her household tested positive, they were pleasantly surprised to receive daily calls from BMC doctors, enquiring about their condition. “What’s more,” she said, “They were always polite, professional and caring.” The efficiency of Chahal’s plan had been further tested when one Sunday the oxygen level of Advani’s staff member began dropping alarmingly. Recollecting the episode, she describes it as a miracle. “Within 20 minutes, BMC had sent a well-equipped Covid ambulance and transported the patient to a jumbo centre.” That wasn’t all. Once admitted, the patient was made comfortable and received nourishing timely food and medicines. “Most importantly, he received humane, thoughtful care from the entire medical team,” said Advani. For an organisation notorious for being at the receiving end of the city’s wrath for its apathy and inefficiency, this validation, shared by many, is perhaps among Chahal and Thackeray’s greatest achievements. But, even as Mumbai’s success at tackling Covid-19 has won it praise and new cases are down to almost three digits, a devastating tragedy is unfolding across the country as the pandemic wreaks havoc across rural India, where 70% of India’s population resides. This surge has been marked by dire shortages of hospital beds, oxygen and medicines, and media reports of hundreds of corpses floating in the Ganges and of thousands of unmarked graves. What’s worse is that many suspect there is a deliberate attempt to undercount and underreport the extent of fatalities. “It’s as if we are saying these people have not mattered much to us when they were alive, and they don’t matter now that they’re dead,” said Dr Rajesh Parikh, one of the authors of The Coronavirus: What You Need to Know about the Global Pandemic, adding “Future generations will regard it as a genocide as shameful as the Holocaust.” Who will come to the rescue of India’s rural poor in their hour of dire need? Who will save the loved ones of these simple, hardy, men and women from dying, one by one? When he was appointed as the head of BMC, Chahal recalls thinking, “A pandemic like this comes once in a century. Hundred years before me and hundred years after me, no municipal commissioner will get this opportunity to serve humanity and save thousands of lives. Maybe I am the blessed one chosen by God.” If only Chahal’s mother had given birth to another hundred like him.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/malavikas-mumbaistan-in-the-eye-of-the-cyclone-101621605290236.html
21-05-2021||Mumbai||Amphotericin-B: States race against time to procure mucormycosis drug||As the challenge of mucormycosis grips the country, the health ministers of Maharashtra and Karnataka on Friday said that both states are working hard to acquire Amphotericin-B drug which is required for its effective treatment.Karnataka and Maharashtra have both reported a surge in cases of mucormycosis, a disease which happens due to a fungus called mucormycetes which can enter the body through breathing or skin injuries, and has been widely reported in Covid-19 patients. The disease can be fatal if left untreated and requires several vials of Amphotericin-B to be administered to the patient. Experts say high blood sugar and unregulated administration of steroids during Covid-19 treatment increases the risk of contracting the disease.Pune, which reported a high number of Covid-19 cases, currently has 300 cases of mucormycosis. “Currently, there are more than 300 cases of mucormycosis in Pune, which also includes people of other districts. We are facing a shortage of injections for these patients. If there are 300 patients, we will need more than 1800 injections per day which is not available in the required numbers,” Maharashtra deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar was quoted as saying by news agency ANI.He also highlighted that patients require 6 injections a day and said that the state will include its treatment in Mahatma Jyotiba Phule Jan Arogya Yojana. He also said that health minister Rajesh Tope asked the Prime Minister to ensure adequate injections are released to treat patients.According to the treatment protocol, when Mucormycosis infects the nose, sinus or palate, doctors will administer a 5mg dose per kilogram (kg) of body weight. For example, if a person weighs 60kgs, he would require 300mg of the dose. Each vial has 50mg of the drug. Hence, a patient suffering from the disease will require six vials which costs ₹60,000 on a daily basis. If the infection reaches the brain, doctors have to administer 8-10mg per kilogram of the patient’s body weight, according to a report by HT.Maharashtra currently has 1,500 cases of mucormycosis and 90 deaths have been reported due to the deadly fungal disease.Karnataka, which has reported at least 97 cases of mucormycosis, is also taking measures to contain the disease. Deputy chief minister Dr. Ashwathnarayan CN said that the state is working hard to procure Amphotericin-B. “Based on the number of Mucormycosis cases, we are trying to procure Amphotericin-B drug to address the demand. The allocation of the drug by the Centre will be done based on the number of cases in Karnataka,” the deputy chief minister was quoted as saying by news agency ANI. Karnataka chief minister later on Friday said that the government hospitals will treat mucormycosis patients for free, according to news agency ANI.Prime Minister Narendra Modi in a meeting held earlier today with frontline workers from his constituency highlighted the need of taking precautionary measures against the disease. He also said that amid the battle against Covid-19 second wave, Mucormycosis has arisen as a fresh challenge.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/amphotericinb-states-race-against-time-to-procure-mucormycosis-drug-101621603819294.html

Only bonafide voters could enter.However, 8 per cent of the people surveyed declared the PMC work as completely unsatisfactory. The rest were undecided on the question.Among the results of the survey released by Sarvagya Media on Thursday, voters surveyed also strongly supported the Pune Metro and expressed satisfaction with works like the Smart City project; 24-hour water supply for the city; electric buses; five-km travel for Rs5 on PMPML buses; and the bringing of water supply from Bhama Askhed. The voters complained of a lack of co-ordination between different the PMC departments leading to rampant road digging.However, local BJP corporators were found wanting in getting in touch with citizens about different schemes of the PMC.

Malana, nestled in the Himayalas at 9,900 ft in Himachal Pradesh’s Kullu district, which made headlines recently for shunning the Covid-19 vaccination drive in the absence of the local deity’s blessings, has had a change of heart. Residents started registering themselves for vaccination two days ago with local deity Jamdagni Rishi or Jamlu Devta believed to have given his approval after a hard-fought debate in the two Houses of the village parliament. Members of both Houses agreed that vaccination is important but left the decision to the deity. Also read: Unregulated online classes affecting health of school children in KashmirMalana panchayat comprises the two villages of Saura Behad and Dhara Behad with a total population of 2,041 in 475 households, including 1,039 men and 1,002 women. So far, none of the residents has contracted Covid-19. Break from tradition “It’s not easy for these people to give up their tradition. But now we are hopeful,” says health educator Birma Thakur, who visited the village along with three staff members on Thursday. Panchayat pradhan Raju Ram and secretary Tek Singh Negi, along with lone accredited social health activist Nirma Devi, have been trying to convince the villagers to take the vaccine for the past two months. The team of health workers from Jarhi, the nearest town from Malana, would trek 7km on alternate days to reach out to the villagers. Raju Ram played a vital role in changing the mindset. He took the help of the panchayat and mahila mandals to convince the villagers. “Belief is one thing, but science is another. I categorically told the villagers that we can’t live in isolation for long. We now have the blessings of the deity,” he said. The panchayat had called a meeting and requested both Houses to deliberate on the matter. People coming forward good sign So far, 142 people have registered themselves. There are nearly 350 people above 60 in the panchayat. Of them, 40 have got themselves registered. “The state government has deputed two teachers to register the villagers for vaccination, few have come forward and the rest are still reluctant,” said panchayat secretary Tek Singh Negi. Nirma Devi is elated that people are finally coming forward for vaccination. She admits that she has not been inoculated either. “I’ll take the vaccine along with the villagers. It’s a good sign that people have started coming forward,” she says. Meanwhile, National Rural Health Mission state director Nipun Jindal has sought a report from the chief medical officers to identify remote villages where not a single person has been vaccinated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/malana-to-take-shot-at-covid-vaccine-after-deity-gives-nod-101621598869169.html
21-05-2021||Other||Unregulated online classes affecting health of school children in Kashmir||Last year in August, five months into her online classes, Nisar Dharma’s 8-year-old daughter suddenly woke up to blurred vision and headache. Her parents were shocked when they saw that she couldn’t tell the number of fingers her father was waving in front of her.“She couldn’t tell what was going on the TV screen and couldn’t even read anything from her books. ‌She couldn’t see my face and could only see some blurred patches,” Dharma, a 34-year-old journalist, said.The class-3 girl had been attending video classes on zoom daily from 10:00 am to 2:00 pm on a smartphone with just 20 minutes of break in between.“Her eyes kind of gave up. It was absolutely scary to the point that if she would stand up, she would just fall,” the father said.For two months, Dharma consulted paediatricians, neurologists and ophthalmologists but could not conclude on an exact illness her daughter was suffering from and its cause. “In desperation, I even went to a faith healer,” he said.Fortunately, he consulted a doctor from Hyderabad on the phone who concluded that her daughter’s illness was directly related to her online classes.“I sent all her tests reports to the doctor and then visited him in September. The doctor told us that the muscles of her eyes had weakened by the constant use of a mobile phone. He called it ‘accommodative spasm’,” he said.The doctor gave her some eye exercises and now her vision has improved a lot, though she has to wear thick eyeglasses.“From then on, she has not attended any online classes. I am totally against online classes, though I have been submitting the fees regularly,” Dharma said.For the second year in a row as the second wave of Covid-19 pandemic is wreaking havoc, the educational institutions have been closed again. The schools, particularly private institutions, have been aggressively pursuing online classes for the students, even for those who are as young as 4-years-old. While government schools have been holding online classes mostly from Class-5 onwards, the private institutions have been even asking KG students to attend online interactions with teachers.Parents and experts are saying that the prolonged exposure of children to screens is affecting the physical as well as the mental health of the children. Some schools have now increased the daily overall class duration from three hours to even five hours causing outrage among the parents. The students have to attend 6 to 8 classes daily on online video apps. “It is very taxing and torturous for children to force them to sit for hours at a stretch on mobiles or laptops. The timings should be minimum as these screens are detrimental to their eyes and are more dangerous for their overall health,” said Ishfaq Shah, a parent whose daughter studies at a prominent school on the city outskirts.Sajad Ahmad Khanday, associate professor of ophthalmology at Shri Maharaja Hari Singh (SMHS) Hospital, said that the more the children use near-vision devices like mobiles and laptops, their eyes become more nearsighted (myope).“Their accommodation power overplays and slowly their far-vision gets compromised. And as children remain wedged to the devices inside, they get less exposure to sunlight which contains vitamin D which is important for the development of vision. So with the excessive use of screens and inadequate exposure to sunlight, their myopia increases. And it becomes a very vicious circle,” he said.He said that since the online classes started after March 2020 they were witnessing an increase in the cases of children with myopic eyes.“It has definitely increased. Not only myopia but overall eye discomforts like dryness and allergies have also definitely gone up among children,” he said.The increase in the screen time of children has not only resulted in physical effects on their bodies but has also led to some behavioural changes in the children.“My son is in class-1 and constantly attending online classes have made him temperamental. He feels irritated after spending four hours in front of a camera and runs away. He says he does not understand things on camera. I have now decided to allow him to skip some classes daily,” said a parent who is also a teacher at a prominent private school in Srinagar.“As a teacher, I also feel that the classes tend to get boring online and after some time the students loses interest. They put the zoom classes on mute. Even the teachers become exhausted delivering eight classes on screen every day,” she said.Dr Syed Karrar Hussain, a child and adolescent psychiatrist of the valley, said there is emerging evidence of the developmental impact on children with the increase in screen time.“We as human beings are wired to have ‘human touch’ in our mundane affairs… From my clinical experience, I see emerging flare-ups in behavioural issues following school closure. Unpredictability, lack of structure, poor socialisation, parental pressure in disciplining, temperamental vulnerabilities all contribute somehow to the behavioural problems. We need to learn quickly to find ways to minimise the negative consequences of online academic learning,” he said.He said that children tend to get distracted and find it difficult to focus as there is no face to face supervision.“There is a tendency to digress to other channels on the internet, sometimes adult-oriented content. These are not ideal times. Since online classes are the need of the hour, parents need to take supervisory roles during the classwork,” he said.Parents, teachers and doctors are demanding a reduction in the number of hours of online teaching.“As a parent, I would say the interaction of children with their teachers, even though online, is important. But online teaching can’t replace the classroom. The schools should reduce the number of hours of screen time to 2 hours. This can’t go on like this,” said Javaid Ahmad, a parent of two school-going children.Associate professor of ophthalmology, Dr Khanday, said that children up to 2 years should not be exposed to screens at all. “Those up to 5 years should have around 1-2 hours of screen time. As you go up you can increase the exposure marginally. The problem is that the child does not stop the use of gadgets after their online classes and parents have to maintain discipline on the use of their phones by their children,” he said.GN War, president of private schools association of Kashmir, said that they have received multiple complaints from parents over the conduct of online classes by the schools.“We are looking into the issue to devise a uniform system so that the children are not put under undue pressure and there is no mental trauma,” he said.“We will see what best can be done so that online classes are conducted reasonably with limited timing,” he said.He said that the government should have come out with a uniform system for online classes in government and private schools. “The government issued no guidelines creating chaos and confusion. It should have specified the number of hours students could attend classes and the syllabus. There should have been an open system of teaching with classes not only online but even on radio and TV so that there was no digital divide,” he said. Meanwhile, while the attendance of students for online classes in private schools has been more than satisfactory, the majority of those from government schools have not been able to join online classes owing to a lack of smartphones. Rafiq Rather, chairman of the government teachers’ forum, said there was below 40 per cent attendance of online learning in government schools. “It is not encouraging as there are no android phones with our students. Most of them are first generational learners. The purpose of online classes is not fulfilled in government schools,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/unregulated-online-classes-affecting-health-of-school-children-in-kashmir-101621596829322.html

The curfew that was belatedly announced bars people from moving out of their houses except to buy essential commodities, for medical reasons or work. Only stores selling essentials are allowed to operate between 7 am and 1 pm The decision was taken at a meeting of the cabinet held on Friday. Sawant, who was initially reluctant to announce any statewide lockdown measures, finally announced a two-week-long curfew that many, including his own health minister Vishwajit Rane, said arrived around two weeks too late. The curfew was finally announced but only after villages in Goa began announcing their own lockdown measures that were in variance with the state’s government’s stand that a curfew or a lockdown was not a solution to the cases that were then rising. “Despite numerous requests from the government, people are not taking adequate steps. If people had followed the law, the positivity rate would not have been 51 per cent,” Sawant said two weeks ago while trying to explain why he was forced to announce a lockdown despite speaking against it. Goa’s positivity rate, which had touched 51% across the first week of May, has since fallen to around 31% but remains higher than the rest of the country while deaths continue to be around 40-50 per day. The chief minister also announced the creation of a special task force to deal with a possible third wave of the pandemic. “We have set up a special task force for Covid third wave. The 15-member team is headed by me and the vice-chair is the health minister and includes professionals from the medical field, etc. There will also be a special expert committee of doctors who will review the treatment protocols. It will be headed by the Dean (of Goa Medical College) Dr Bandekar. It will include paediatrics since there is news that the third wave will affect children,” Sawant said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/goa-extends-curfew-till-march-31-sets-up-task-force-to-deal-with-3rd-wave-101621596769542.html

Delhi has been allocated around 2,000 doses,” said Jain in a press briefing. “Delhi had 197 people with the infection admitted to various hospitals till Wednesday night. Every patient needs several injections each day; if Delhi’s requirement is, say, 4,000 injections, and we are given 1,000, there will be a problem. It is similar to the oxygen situation; when Delhi needed 600 MT of oxygen we were given 300 MT and then people said that there was a problem in distribution.” The Delhi government has set up a four-member committee that looks at hospitals’ demand for the drug after patient information is submitted and gives a go-ahead for the Directorate General of Health Services to dispatch it. As per submissions in the Delhi high court, every patient needs 42 vials of the injection per week. Also Read | DRDO lab develops Covid-19 antibody detection-based kit DipcovanMucormycosis, which is referred to as Black Fungus, is an opportunistic infection which usually happens in Covid-19 patients with uncontrolled diabetes, especially if they have been given high or longer dose of steroids. If untreated, it kills up to 80% of the people and in others, it can lead to loss of eye or disfigurement of face as surgeons debride the dead tissue. To prevent the infection, Jain said, “Please take steroids only on the advice of a doctor. Do not continue taking the medicine even after the doctor has stopped it. In some diabetics, the sugar level shoots up because of steroid use and they have to be prescribed injection insulin. But, they stop taking it once they are home. Please don’t do that. At the moment, controlling diabetes is more important, you will be able to get off the injection in a few days.” He added, “People who have been administered steroids should be alert for up to a week after the medicine has been stopped. And, control the blood sugar level.” The minister reiterated that the stock for vaccines for people between the ages of 18 and 44 years is almost exhausted and several centres would be closed Friday onwards.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/availability-of-antifungal-med-the-issue-not-its-distribution-delhi-health-min-101621595749146.html

It was her seat and I was just protecting it,” Sobhandeb said.West Bengal assembly speaker Biman Banerjee said that he has spoken to Chattopadhyay and ensured that he was not coerced into taking the decision. “I have enquired from him if he has resigned voluntarily and without coercion. I am satisfied and have accepted his resignation,” the Bengal assembly speaker was quoted as saying by news agency ANI.Chattopadhyay is likely to contest from Khardah assembly constituency as a bypoll has been necessitated following the death of party leader Kajal Sinha, people familiar with the developments told news agency PTI.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/mamata-likely-to-contest-from-bhabanipore-constituency-to-retain-cm-s-chair-101621594897849.html

Meanwhile, he developed internal gastrointestinal bleeding so his haemoglobin dropped to critically low levels.Also Read | Tested positive for Covid, Asaram seeks interim bailAsaram’s counsel JS Choudhary told the court that the convict has expressed his desire in writing that he does not desire to take the allopathic line of treatment and instead, his followers may be allowed to set up a fully functional medical facility at his Ashram at Pal Village, Jodhpur, so that he can be treated by ayurveda. Choudhary added that if Asaram’s sentences are suspended, he will abide by any condition imposed by the court. He said Asaram may be sent to the Rajasthan Ayurveda University for treatment of his gastrointestinal bleeding and other ailments.Observing that Asaram is also facing trial in another case in Gujarat involving the offence under Section 376 IPC and is in custody in connection with the said case as well, the court quoted the medical reports that his condition is stable but he requires further investigation and follow-up for his gastrointestinal bleeding. “This treatment is unquestionably available at the MDM Hospital, Jodhpur,” the bench said.“Suspending the sentences awarded to the appellant in this case would be nothing short of an exercise in futility because immediately on his release from the Central Jail, Jodhpur, he would be required to be taken to State of Gujarat in connection with the case pending trial as a production warrant certainly would be in force,” the court said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/rajasthan-hc-dismisses-plea-for-temporary-suspension-of-asaram-bapu-s-sentences-101621595149420.html
21-05-2021||Other||Global Village Idiot: Settings in the matter of individual versus social media||Last week, a friend asked me what my opinion was on the WhatsApp privacy settings controversy, and if I knew anything about it. “What’s your opinion about it?” I asked him.“I think it’s unfair. It’s an intrusion and they are going to take my data and give it to people.”“Are you sure? What data?”“Everything, what I am browsing, who I am talking to, what I am reading, sharing.”“Who are they going to give this data to?”“Facebook and its business partners and advertisers.”“Are you really sure about this?”“That’s what I have heard.”“And you don’t want them to do that?”“No!”“So stop using WhatsApp.”“All my family and friends are on the platform. I have to stay connected.”“Then stay on it.”“You are not helping.”“I am not here to help. I am just here to enjoy this ping-pong match you’re playing. Besides, I can’t tell you what to do.”“Well can you tell me what you are planning to do - stay or leave the platform?”“I am staying on it.”I have had similar conversations with other friends and family. And it’s a classic conflict of the addict: torn between compulsive desire and the fear of the consequences of that desire.Now there are two problems at hand. First, the addiction to WhatsApp. Second, the new privacy settings. The way I see it, the compulsion on account of the addiction clouds the judgment when it comes to the settings. So first, I shall share my wealth of knowledge on the matter of Individual versus Social Media. During my years of grappling with the problem, I designed many devices to help me overcome the problem. Like the One Tight Slap robot, whose job it was to slap me hard if I opened any social media during the day time. And the Drag Me Away By My Hair robotic hand, whose job it was to drag me away from my phone if I had been on it for more than 30 minutes at a time. Sadly, none of the devices worked, but they paved the way to the super top secret method I developed to deal with this problem. I was going to file patent on it but I have some time today, and so I will tell you, from the goodness of my heart, how you can have your social media and keep it too: The secret is to Not Share. That’s right. You just have to stop sharing stuff. Let me explain how.First of all, I do not exceed the 30-minutes-in-a-day restriction for platforms. Secondly, I access only through the laptop. The only exception is WhatsApp which is on the phone. Thirdly, I read what is of interest to me (and ignore everything else). I share almost nothing. I forward nothing. I re-share less than nothing. If I have to make up a statistic, 99% of what I receive/read, never leaves my device. Since I don’t share, I do not look for reactions, and therefore, I have no reason to go to the platform obsessively. I have rules for sharing, and the rules are simple: share only my original work or works of people I know. I occasionally share jokes and funny videos, but only if they have no agendas or political overtones. If I see a conversation going long, I pick up the phone and call the person.This super top secret method has been very effective and as a result, over the past year, I have moved out of Facebook, Pinterest, phased out of Twitter, Instagram, Tumbler, and drastically reduced Wordpress and LinkedIn. I still use Wordpress and LinkedIn since they are somewhat productive applications, but I go to them when I have something to publish.On the question of the new privacy settings on WhatsApp, well, I read all end-user agreements (Apple, Microsoft, FB, sundry software) and also read the additional terms, the links within each set of terms and all updates to terms; and they all want the same thing: more information and more rights to share your information, but related to their business goals, which of course is to become the centre of your attention, always. Amazon, Google, Apple, Orange, Mango, Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, your news channels, the government, the school, the company you work … they all want you to spend more time with them. They already have all the info about you, much of it government mandated. Here’s a pop-quiz: You know all those telemarketers who call you selling insurance and loans? How do you think they get your number? There are regulations which require sharing of customer info, that’s how. As far as WhatApp is concerned, there are a lot of settings to ensure your privacy. You just have to enable them. What WhatsApp has to change is to stop hiding the terms of use - I should be able to read the terms whenever I want (at the moment, you can’t because the terms of use are not available on the app). As far as the legal stuff goes, the government and courts are looking into this, and when they come to a conclusion, we can consider our options afresh. Laws in such matters, in my humble opinion, have to be revisited to make agreements more balanced and fair from its current one-sided avatar where consumers’ options are really limited to one choice: accepting or not accepting terms of use.Meanwhile, if you are worried about what Facebook is sharing with who, you should also start thinking about what information Google, Amazon, your grocery app, the payment banks, and UPI apps have on you. They make life convenient, but these are not critical to existence.As far as the ethical, moral questions go … we should never have left the Garden of Eden.

Mumbai police commissioner Hemant Nagrale on Friday issued an order under Article 311(2) (B) of the Constitution of India, dismissing Kazi without a departmental inquiry.Kazi is former colleague of Sachin Vaze, also arrested by NIA for allegedly being the mastermind of Antilia bomb scare and the murder of Hiran, an auto parts dealer. Vaze has already been dismissed from service on May 11.Kazi was arrested by NIA on April 11 in connection with the cases and is in judicial custody.He was posted in the crime intelligence unit (CIU) of the Mumbai crime branch, which Vaze headed when, on February 25, a Mahindra Scorpio was found abandoned near Antilia, the South Mumbai residence of industrialist Mukesh Ambani, with 20 loose gelatin sticks and a threatening note addressed to the industrialist’s family.Also Read | Bombay HC declines Deshmukh’s plea for interim protection from CBIVaze was the investigating officer of the case which was eventually transferred to Maharashtra anti-terrorism sqaud (ATS). NIA took over the case on March 8, three days after Hiran, to whom the SUV was linked, was found dead in creek near Mumbra. It arrested Vaze on March 13, after his alleged involvement in the bomb scare came to light.NIA claimed that as his colleague Kazi was aware of Vaze’s plans and purportedly took active part in destruction of evidence during initial investigation of the bomb scare case. They allegedly seized several CCTV footages and DVRs under the garb of investigation and destroyed the same.Kazi was shunted out of CIU last month after NIA arrested Vaze allegedly for devising the plan to regain his lost glory in Mumbai Police by parking the explosive-laden SUV outside Antilia. Kazi was transferred to Tardeo local arms division, which is considered a side branch.Beside Kazi and Vaze, the NIA has also arrested police inspector Sunil Mane, also from Mumbai Police.Former constable Vinayak Shinde, a convict serving life imprisonment in a fake encounter killing of Lakhan Bhaiya, and bookie Naresh Gaur have also been arrested in the case for alleged aiding and abetting Vaze in executing the crimes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/antilia-bomb-scare-vaze-s-colleague-riyazuddin-kazi-dismissed-from-service-101621593589172.html

The incident happened within the Mokama police station limits of rural Patna, the police said.“Prima-facie police investigation suggested that Chandan, doubted his wife’s fidelity and picked up a fight with her which led to the gruesome incident, resulting in the death of a nine-year-old son and a five-year-old girl,” said Rural SP (Patna) Kantesh Mishra said, adding that police have recovered a sharp-edged weapon from the spot which was used in crime. “Based on our investigation till now, Chandan committed the crime suspecting that they were his illegitimate children,” SP Mishra said.Kamal Nayan alias Chandan and his wife lived in Kanhaipur village with their children, a boy aged nine years and a five-year-old daughter. The boy was a student at a nearby private school. The couple was reportedly having marital issues over the past few years and used to engage in frequent quarrels, as per the police.On Thursday morning, Chandan and his wife fought over something. His wife, in a fit of rage, stormed off to her parents’ house in rural Mokama, leaving the children to their father’s care.On Friday morning, one of the relatives reached Chandan’s house only to see the children lying dead inside the house. Shocked to see their bodies, the relative immediately alerted the police who rushed to the spot and conducted a preliminary inquiry.The locals claimed that Chandan, who is said to be mentally ill, surrendered before the police and narrated the entire incident. The gruesome incident occurred between 2.30-3 am on Friday. He allegedly killed the children by slitting their throats with a sharp-edged weapon.Speaking to HT, the SHO of Mokama police station, Rajnandan Sharma, said Chandan was in an inebriated state on Thursday when the fight broke with his wife.

The health department sub-centre in the village rarely opens. Afraid of the recent deaths, villagers are not coming forward for Covid-19 tests and treatment. According to a rough estimate, only 20 per cent have been vaccinated, HT has learnt. “From April 17 to May 5, 15 people have died but the exact reason is not specified. The screening team of the health department came on May 7 and two people were found Covid positive. They are in home isolation,” said Aman Chahar, a student in Agra who is also the district secretary of Bharatiya Kisan Union. He said only 20 to 25 per cent of people had been inoculated for Covid-19 in the village. Located about 12 kilometres from Agra city, Lalau is a gram panchayat that is part of Akola block in Agra district. The population of Lalau, which also has Laxmipur, another smaller village or majra, is about 6,000 with an equal number of Jats and Dalits and a few from the backward Baghel caste. The village has a primary and junior high school till Class 8 and those interested in further studies either go to Akola, Malpura or Agra. The village has a literacy rate of 40 per cent and most of the villagers, mainly Dalits, work as labourers at local shoe factories or in Agra city while Jats work as both farmers and labourers. ‘Marghati’ is a place on gram panchayat land in the village where the deceased are cremated. After panchayat poll voting on April 15, ‘Marghati’ was a much-frequented place as villagers cremated about 15 people, including youths, facing untimely demise. “There was no sanitization drive and village youths collected money on their own to carry out sanitization after so many deaths,” said Chahar. “The sub-centre of the health department rarely opens, that also when the vaccination of the newborns is to take place. Otherwise, it remains locked for most of the year,” complained Omkar Chahar (39), a villager. “As many as 15 deaths took place after voting for panchayat elections on April 15. No specific reason could be assigned to these deaths but most of those who died had a fever while some had breathlessness too. However, they did not get themselves tested for Covid-19 or any other disease,” said Omkar Chahar. “We have never seen so many deaths in such a short time. Still, no public representative or official came here,” said a worried Omkar. Villagers revealed that due to lack of health facilities, they fell prey to quacks practising in and around Akola and Malpura, the towns near Lalau village. Villagers are at ease paying ₹20 to ₹30 for medicines provided by these practitioners active at Naumeel crossing on Jagner Road. Defecation in the open is a common trend, despite government-constructed toilets and raging pandemic. However, Dr Sushil Kumar, medical officer in charge of Akola Community Health Centre (CHC), said he visited the village apart from the screening team that visited Lalau on May 8 as part of the statewide campaign in rural areas to trace, test and treat the villagers. “The screening team referred one case for testing and one of the villagers was found corona positive. He was handed over a medicine kit on May 9 and advised home isolation. Medicine kits were also given to those complaining of fever and sore throat all over the village,” said Dr Sushil Kumar. According to Dr Kumar, Lalau reported no corona deaths as yet. “With respect to other deaths, no communication was made to us,” he said. When asked about health facilities in the village, Dr Sushil Kumar informed that there was a health department sub-centre in Lalau. “The sub-centre is run by an ANM who has to visit nearby villages also besides remaining on constant move. So the sub-centre is closed at times,” Dr Kumar said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/up-village-reports-15-deaths-in-month-scared-villagers-shun-tests-inoculation-101621588969932.html
21-05-2021||Delhi||Plea in Delhi HC over ‘misbranding’ of plant-based products as that of milk||The Delhi high court has asked the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) to take instructions on a plea by National Cooperative Dairy Federation of India (NCDFI) alleging misbranding of plant-based products as milk products. Justice Rekha Palli posted the plea for hearing on Monday after the FSSAI counsel sought time.NCDFI, functioning as the apex body of the cooperative dairy industry said that its members, totalling 17,216,000, are engaged in manufacturing and marketing of milk and milk products. They also include dairy product giant Amul India.The petition said that there are various business entities which have been misbranding and mislabelling their plant-based food or beverages extracted from almond, soya, and oats etc., as milk and other dairy terms such as paneer, curd, and yoghurt.It said that the statutory scheme of the Food Safety Act, 2006, and its allied regulations prevent the use of the word ‘milk’ and other dairy terms for any plant-based food/extracts as these do not qualify as milk, milk product or composite milk product.The petitioner has made Hershey’s India and Epigamia as parties in the petition which would be now heard on May 24.Also Read | ‘Covishield for 18-44 age group over, centres to be shut’: Satyendar JainReacting to the petition, Gauri Maulekhi, trustee of People for Animals, said; “The dairy sector is riddled with cruelty to animals in a variety of ways. The dairy cooperatives are villianising innovations that provide sustainable healthy alternatives like the plant-based milk and plant-based milk products. Not only are they attempting to dictate to the regulator to create lopsided policies but are also utilising judicial systems to bully startups that are bringing solutions to unsustainable dairy practices.”Alokparna Sengupta, managing director of Humane Society International India said; “In the middle of a raging pandemic, usurping the court’s time to punish a sector which is not even a competition to the dairy industry not only insensitive but makes a mockery of the suffering we are seeing around. Plant-based alternatives to dairy are being chosen for various reasons -- whether ethical, environmental or health.”“Despite this trend [of plant-based milk and its products] across the world, India has only seen a slow increase...We were making and using coconut milk and cream for centuries. How can that suddenly be changed because the said cooperative is now imagining a threat? Coconut milk, soy milk, tofu and milk from plants have been in existence for centuries. There cannot be an exclusive claim to the term milk!” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/plea-in-delhi-hc-over-misbranding-of-plant-based-products-as-that-of-milk-101621588968459.html
21-05-2021||Kolkata||Arrest of 3 ex-mayors by CBI puts Kolkata in unique list; citizens recall Netaji||As two heavyweight Bengal ministers, Subrata Mukherjee and Firhad Hakim, and former Trinamool Congress (TMC) leader Sovan Chatterjee, waited in judicial custody for the next hearing of their bail petition in the Narada sting operation case, mixed reactions were heard in Kolkata as all three had served as mayor of the 300-year-old city which was also the capital of British India till 1911. Though arrest of serving or former mayors is not new in India or other countries, Kolkata became unique for the wrong reasons on May 17 since no other city in the nation witnessed the arrest of three former mayors on the same charge, academicians and lawyers said. Recorded in 2014, the sting videos were made public by Narada News a month before the 2016 Bengal assembly polls but the TMC leadership dismissed the clips as doctored. The Calcutta high court and the Supreme Court asked the CBI to start an investigation in March 2017 after hearing a case filed by another former city mayor and noted lawyer Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharya. He held the chair between 2005 and 2010. Mukherjee served as mayor between 2000 and 2005 while Chatterjee took oath in 2010 and resigned in 2018. He was succeeded by Hakim who served till last year when the elected body outlived its tenure. Hakim was appointed head of the board of administrators since civic polls were not held because of the Covid19 pandemic. He was also the first Muslim mayor of Kolkata after Independence. Some iconic figures in Bengal’s history served as mayor of Kolkata. Among them was the legendary barrister and freedom fighter Chittaranjan Das. He was the city’s mayor from 1924 to 25. His political protégé, Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose, held the chair between 1930 and 31. “Arrest of mayors, be it in Brazil’s Sao Paulo or some of the east European cities, is related to corruption that crept in when capitalism replaced socialism. It is a product of neo-liberal politics. In Kolkata, most of the former mayors were part of the freedom movement. I cannot draw a comparison between them and today’s leaders. Subhas Bose, too, was arrested when he was a mayor but it was because he led a political movement demanding the removal of the Holwell monument. He was injured in baton charge,” said Shouvik Mukhopadhyay, a professor of history at Calcutta University. “This is the first time three former mayors of an Indian city were arrested on the same charge and on the same day. But many more have been accused in this case. They have not been arrested yet. In 2016, we all saw the sting videos,” Mukhopadhyay added.Anup Ghosh, an executive with a top private sector company and resident of Kolkata, said, “This is a unique and hilarious situation. There are no holy cows in politics and corruption charges are pending against many more. I smell politics in these arrests.”Film director Subrata Sen, a south Kolkata resident, said, “Nobody is guilty till the crime is proved in court. It is just a coincidence that four of the three arrested men are former mayors of Kolkata. Going by the history of similar cases probed by the CBI, proving the bribery charge in this case, may not be easy.”Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharya, who also served as advocate general of Tripura is now a Rajya Sabha member of the Communist Party of India (Marxist), or CPI(M). “Arrest of three former mayors is unique as well as unfortunate. It is shameful for Kolkata because that chair holds a special position in history. People like Bose, Dr Bidhan Chandra Roy (first chief minister of Independent Bengal), freedom fighter Jatindra Mohan Sengupta, educationist Triguna Sen were among many luminaries who served as mayor. Mamata Banerjee has blended corruption with politics. The case would not have started had we not moved court,” said Bhattacharya. The three former mayors, who also served as ministers, are considered heavyweights in state politics. Mukherjee, 75, took oath as panchayat and rural development minister on May 10, set a record by winning his Ballygunge seat in south Kolkata by a margin of about 72,000 votes. He started his political career in the 1960s as a Youth Congress leader and close associate of former Union minister Praya Ranjan Dasmunsi. Both were known to be close to Prime Minister Indira Gandhi. Between 1972 and 1977, Mukherjee served as the youngest face in the cabinet of then chief minister Siddhartha Shankar Ray. As deputy information and cultural affairs minister, Mukherjee’s job during the Emergency was to clear news reports that the Bengal media wanted to publish. While he criticised the Emergency later in life, Mukherjee acknowledged that he came to know the media better during those years.Aged 62, housing minister Firhad Hakim is considered one of the most influential leaders in the TMC. He rose from the ranks in the TMC as a civic body councillor. He was given charge of important departments such as municipal affairs and urban development after Banerjee came to power in 2011. Chatterjee, 57, was the mayor of Kolkata till he resigned in 2018 following differences with the leadership. Chatterjee also served as a cabinet minister. He joined the BJP in 2019 and was made election observer for the Kolkata zone. He quit the BJP after being denied a ticket.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/arrest-of-3-ex-mayors-by-cbi-puts-kolkata-in-unique-list-citizens-recall-netaji-101621587888479.html
21-05-2021||Other||Akhil Gogoi alleges manhandling while being brought to assembly to take oath||Newly elected MLA and president of Raijor Dal, Akhil Gogoi, who has been under arrest since December 2019 for his role in the anti-Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) protests, alleged on Friday that he was manhandled by the police and other officials while being brought to the state assembly to take an oath as an MLA, HT has learnt. “I am an elected member of the state assembly. Why am I being targeted and pushed around like an animal? This is an insult to the people of Assam and Sibsagar. No one can silence my voice or the development of my constituency,” Gogoi said on arrival at the assembly. He alleged that no Covid-19 protocol was maintained while he was brought from Guwahati Medical College Hospital (GMCH), where he is now lodged, to the assembly for the oath-taking ceremony. “I was brought in a run-down bus along with nearly 20 policemen. I was threatened by the magistrate present on the bus and not allowed to interact with anyone. Once we reached the assembly premises, my dress was pulled and I was nearly dragged inside,” said Gogoi. The matter was later brought to the notice of chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma who is reported to have entrusted parliamentary affairs minister Pijush Hazarika to inquire into Gogoi’s allegations. “We are hurt by the police’s behaviour with Gogoi. He is an elected representative and we condemn the incident of him being insulted inside the assembly. We urge the state government to take appropriate action and punish those guilty,” All India United Democratic Front (AIUDF) MLA, Aminul Islam, said. The 45-year-old, who contested from the Sibsagar seat, defeated Surabhi Rajkonwari of BJP without campaigning himself. Gogoi became the first person in Assam to win an election while being under arrest. Earlier this month, a National Investigation Agency (NIA) court allowed Gogoi to take oath as a new MLA. The first session of the new assembly began on Friday with the oath-taking of newly elected members. Pro-tem Speaker Phani Bhushan Choudhury administered the oath to all new MLAs while following Covid-19-related safety measures. Raijor Dal was formed in October last year and Gogoi was named as the president of the party later. He filed his candidature from the hospital. For this election, Raijor Dal had tied up with the Assam Jatiya Parishad (AJP), another newly formed outfit. Gogoi was the lone winner from both parties. Gogoi was arrested in December 2019 after a case against him was lodged in Chabua police station in Dibrugarh district under various sections of the Indian Penal Code for criminal conspiracy, unlawful assembly, rioting etc. Subsequently, sections 15(1) (a)/16 of UAPA were added to it. The trial in the case is yet to commence. The case was later transferred to the NIA the same month and a charge sheet was filed in June last year which alleged that Gogoi had led the anti-CAA movement which turned violent and led to arson and attacks on police personnel. It alleged that the peasant leader hatched a conspiracy to target a particular community to disturb the unity and integrity of the country.

The Yellow Gate police station have based the case on a complaint lodged by the barge engineer.The First Information Report is lodged under sections 304(II) (an act done with knowledge that it is likely to cause death), 338 (causing grievous hurt by an act endangering life or personal safety of others) and 34 (common intention) of the Indian Penal Code against the barge captain and others.“We have registered a complaint against the captain (of the barge) and others on the basis of a statement given by chief engineer Rahman Shaikh who has complained that an alert was issued by the meteorological department but was not taken seriously by the captain and others who should have moved the barge to a safer place,” said joint commissioner of police Vishwas Nangre Patil (Law and Order).“It is at a very preliminary stage but investigation has started,” added Patil.Also Watch | Navy officers recall rescuing survivors of sunken barge Another police officer said they have recorded the statements of more than 100 survivors who were rescued by Indian Navy and Coast Guard from barge P305. The concerned company has also been asked to submit the details of employees working on the barge, he added.According to Afcons Infrastructure, which leads the consortium that had chartered the barge along with its marine crew, the master of P305 chose to stay in the sea despite instructions for returning to Mumbai harbour in the wake of warnings for Cyclone Tauktae.The barge was deployed at a platform in Heera oil fields, one of the largest of the ONGC rigs in the Arabian sea. It got de-anchored on Sunday night and according to deputy chief of naval staff, vice admiral Murlidhar Sadashiv Pawar, sank at about 7pm on Monday, forcing most of its 261 crew members to jump in a very choppy sea and rough weather that made the Navy’s search and rescue operation one of the most challenging operations the force has undertaken in four decades.The Navy has so far rescued 186 crew members of the barge and recovered 49 bodies even as search is on for 37 missing persons -- 26 from P305 and 11 crew members of a tug boat, Varaprada, who also went missing during the cyclone.The Navy has so far rescued two crew members of Varaprada.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/fir-registered-in-mumbai-against-captain-of-barge-p305-101621582968337.html

The exchange of fire began at 5.30am when, responding to a tip-off, around 200 jawans of C-60, an elite anti-Maoist squad of the district, raided a hideout. “At least 15 members of the CPI (Maoist) were killed in the encounter in the jungle,” confirmed Sandip Patil, the deputy inspector general of police, Gadchiroli. “We kicked off the operation early morning after learning about Maoist presence in the forest. So far, 13 bodies have been recovered from the site. Searches are still on,” Patil said. Also Read | NIA takes over probe into 2019 Maoist encounter in ChhattisgarhDistrict police superintendent Ankit Goyal said the C-60 commandos have recovered some arms, weapons and Maoist literature from the site. According to him, several Maoists escaped and also took away the bodies of some of their slain colleagues. Among those killed is reportedly the commander of the local dalam (squad). The bodies were yet to be identified, and search operations were still on, said the senior police officer. Police got the information that the local squad of the CPI (Maoist) was trying to organise a meeting with the villagers and tendu leaf contractors over wages for collection of tendu leaf. Many contractors from Telangana and other states buy rights for plucking of tendu leaves from Gadchiroli district every year. These contractors have to pay huge protection money to the CPI (Maoist) every year during the season. Earlier this month, the Gadchiroli police gunned down four suspected senior Maoist leaders, including two women, in two separate gunfights in the district.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/15-maoists-killed-in-gunfight-in-maharashtra-s-gadchiroli-101621580148208.html

My only worry is that many people from other states also have booked this, the portal being online and our slots are going to others. We have reported this to the Government of India and have asked them to take appropriate steps. The ministry has also been informed,” Goa state immunization officer Dr Rajendra Borkar, said.The health secretary’s assertion came after the state immunization officer Dr Rajendra Borkar said he was ‘worried’ that since Goa had limited vaccine doses for the 18-44 age group, vaccines that were procured by the state are being availed off by those from ‘outside’. The health secretary, however, countered such ‘fears’ saying that no state, including the neighbouring states of Maharashtra and Karnataka, was discriminating against who is booking slots. “The government has taken a considered decision not to discriminate against anyone when it comes to administering vaccines in Goa and that is in line with what all states have done. Whether it is the neighbouring state of Maharashtra or Karnataka. We do not discriminate,” health secretary Ravi Dhawan said. The Goa government has opened limited slots for the 18-44 age group to get them vaccinated owing to limited vaccines being available. However, since the pre-booking for a slot is mandatory via the CoWin App for those in the age group of 18-44 years, several people have been booking slots wherever they are available irrespective of how far the centre is from one’s place of residence. Till date, Goa has been able to administer 4.56 lakh doses out of which 2.65 lakh people have been administered one dose while 95,687 people have received both doses and are considered fully vaccinated. The fully vaccinated population makes up roughly about 5 per cent of the state’s total population.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/we-don-t-discriminate-goa-health-secy-on-complaints-of-non-residents-booking-vaccine-slots-101621580088418.html

The officials said about nine places were being searched in Delhi-NCR, including Kalra’s residence, office of Matrix Cellular -- a company named in the case -- and others to collect any documentary evidence available there. Kalra is currently in judicial custody and has been trying to get bail from the high court through a battery of lawyers. The ED’s money laundering probe is based on the Delhi Police case in which it has been alleged that Kalra was selling oxygen concentrators, bought for ₹14,000 to ₹15,000, at an inflated price of ₹70,000 to ₹75,000. The central agency has already taken relevant documents from the Delhi Police and is set to approach a court to take Kalra’s custody soon.

21-05-2021||Patna||Bihar Jewellers Federation wants implementation of new hallmarking rule to be extended||The All India Jewellers and Goldsmiths Federation (AIJGF), Bihar, has requested that the implementation of the new hallmarking rule to be extended due to the Covid-19 pandemic, HT has learnt. In letters addressed to Union telecommunication minister Ravi Shankar Prasad, Bihar’s industry minister Syed Shahnawaz Hussain and deputy chief minister Tarkishore Prasad, the AIJGF has also requested to set up hallmarking centres in all the 38 districts of the state before the implementation of the new rules.As per the new hallmarking rules, hallmarking of gold jewellery and artefacts, which is in fact the certification of the precious metals, will be mandatory and that the jewellers have to get themselves registered with the Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS). This hallmarking rule is to be effective from June 1st this year.“But it needs to be deferred and be implemented from May 31, 2022,” Ashok Kumar Verma, convener, the AIJGF, Bihar, said.Many jewellers in the state have not prepared for hallmarking which will be mandatory once the new rules would be made effective. Violation of this rule will incur severe punishment and imprisonment in some cases, he added.“But where is the facility to get prepared for the new rules? In our state, there are only five hallmarking centres. What will be the situation with the jewellers located in other areas? During the lockdown, how can they travel to the hallmarking centre located in other districts?” he asked.The infrastructure for the implementation of the new rules is yet to be developed. First, the hallmarking centre should be developed in every district to stop any violation of the rule, he added.“All the ministers have assured that the AIJGF’s request and demand would be forwarded to Union minister of commerce and industries, Piyush Goyal. Earlier also, he considered the requests made by the Confederation of All India Traders. In fact, the hallmarking rule was to be implemented from January 2021 and considering the status of the pandemic, the Confederation requested to extend the implementation to June 2021. Let’s see how he responds to our requests now,” he said.Dhananjay Roy, a jeweller from Bari Path in the state capital, said lots of preparations need to be made on part of the jewellers and from the government’s side as well. “In the current situation, a jeweller based on the Indo-Nepal borders will have to travel to the state capital to get the certificate of purity which is quite difficult during the lockdown. Then he will have to wait for the certificate at the laboratory to check the purity of the precious metals located at few places in the country like in Bangalore and Kolkata,” he said. These are the basic practical problems and things that need to be addressed at the ground level, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/bihar-jewellers-federation-wants-implementation-of-new-hallmarking-rule-to-be-extended-101621579128044.html

21-05-2021||Chandigarh||Wrong signal: 5G towers blamed for rise in Covid cases in Haryana||Mobile towers can transmit coronavirus! Well, that’s the latest misconception being spread across Haryana that has the already stretched administration gearing up to grapple with before it becomes a law and order problem. Alarmed by the swiftness with which the misinformation blaming mobile towers for the rising Covid-19 fatalities in the state is spreading, the Haryana government has directed deputy commissioners (DCs) and superintendents of police (SPs) to crack down on rumourmongers. Also read: India records 2.59 lakh new Covid-19 cases in 24 hrs, fatalities go above 4,000“Misinformation attributing the Covid-19 fatalities to the testing of 5G towers is doing the rounds. This has led to damage to mobile towers by misguided elements,” state chief secretary Vijai Vardhan said in his communication to the DCs and SSPs on Thursday. Misinformation campaign to vaccine hesitancy This is the latest misinformation campaign that the Manohar Lal Khattar-led BJP-JJP government is battling after facing vaccine hesitancy in Haryana’s hinterland. Villages dominated by a particular community, opposed to the BJP-led Centre’s farm laws, is asking people to violate the Covid lockdown. It is in this backdrop that the one-page order of the chief secretary becomes significant and reflects the gravity of multiple challenges the administration is facing in fighting Covid-19. Virus can’t travel on radio waves/mobile network Vardhan said the World Health Organisation (WHO) has clarified that such rumours are misplaced as viruses cannot travel on radio waves/mobile network. Other organisations have also debunked such claims, the order says and advises the DCs and SSPs to safeguard telecom infrastructure and related assets in their districts. “Take strict, coercive and immediate action against any miscreant spreading such misleading rumours,” the chief secretary said. The department of telecommunication, in its May 10 press statement, also clarified that linking the 5G network technology with Covid-19 has no scientific basis. Not just this, Vardhan said, the testing of 5G network has not yet started in India. “Hence, the apprehension that 5G trials/networks are causing coronavirus in India is baseless and devoid of any merit,” he added. Telecom providers express concernTR Dua, the director general of the Tower and Infrastructure Providers Association, said he had sought Vardhan’s intervention. “Four towers were damaged in Jind and Rohtak districts. Fifteen villages wanted towers shifted due to the misleading campaign.The operation and maintenance of telecom towers was becoming challenging,” Dua said.Residents of Masudpur, Rakhi Shahpur, Khanda Kheri, Koth Kalan and Majra villages of Hisar district also raised concern amid the rising Covid cases. They met Narnaund sub divisional magistrate Vikas Yadav in this connection.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/wrong-signal-5g-towers-blamed-for-rise-in-covid-cases-in-haryana-101621574207841.html

Her report turned negative on May 16 but, no one from her family visited or enquired about her during her treatment,” Kumar said.District administration and health officials put their all efforts to find out trace of her family. “Since she speaks only Telugu, it was hard to understand her language. After failing to find her family members, the woman was shifted to an old age home in Nagri by the administration on Wednesday where 30-35 old people reside,” he said.“Finally, I put her story on social media with her photograph on Wednesday. Soon, one Sanjiv Mishra gave a lead about her family. Mishra said her children reside in railway colony Ranchi,” he said.Madhu has six children including three sons and three daughters. Three children including two sons and a daughter live in Ranchi.Madhu’s younger son Govind Rao, who works as gangman in the railway, said, “My mother lived with my elder brother in Ranchi. When she felt unwell, she was shifted to my sister’s house. After her health deteriorated, my sister admitted her to Sadar hospital.”When he was asked why they did not visit their mother, Rao said, “I went to the hospital once but I was not allowed to enter the hospital premises.”Rao said they saw the picture of her mother on social media on Thursday morning. “We are happy to meet our mother again,” he said.Rao’s sister Dhan Laxmi said she could not meet her mother because she also tested positive for Covid-19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ranchi-news/deserted-by-children-septuagenarian-woman-defeats-covid19-101621573007464.html

Till then, the four accused would be kept under house arrest,” said Manishankhar Chatterjee, advocate. The two Cabinet ministers, Firhad Hakim and Subrata Mukherjee, TMC legislator Madan Mitra and former mayor Sovan Chatterjee, who were arrested by the CBI on Monday have already spent four nights in judicial custody. The case pertains to a two-year-long sting operation whose videos were uploaded months ahead of the 2016 assembly elections. The sting, conducted by online news portal Narada News, purportedly caught several senior TMC leaders accepting money in exchange for favours to a fictitious company.

The court rejected the requests made by the TMC leaders’ advocates for their release on interim bail until the matter is heard by a larger bench. It also turned down the CBI’s plea to keep them in jail. Even though all four leaders were sent to judicial custody, all of them had to be admitted in hospitals after their complaint of illness on Tuesday.

As many as 51 lives were lost in the incident that took place on Monday. The captain was booked on the basis of the complaint of rescued barge chief engineer Rahman Shaikh.Mumbai's Yellow Gate police station registered the case under sections 304(II) (an act done with knowledge that it is likely to cause death), 338 (causing grievous hurt by an act endangering life or personal safety of others) and 34 (common intention) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC).Also Read: 11 more bodies recovered, search on for 47 after cyclone sank barge off Mumbai“We have registered a complaint against the captain and others on the basis of a statement given by chief engineer Rahman Shaikh. He has complained that alert was issued by the meteorological department but it was not taken seriously by the captain and other people concerned who should have taken the alert seriously and move the barge to a safer place," said joint commissioner of police Vishwas Nangre Patil (Law and Order).According to Afcons Infrastructure, which leads the consortium that had chartered the barge, the captain of P305 chose to stay in the sea along with his crew despite receiving instructions to return to the Mumbai harbour in the wake of Cyclone Tauktae.The Indian Navy and the coast guard have so far rescued 188 crew members and recovered 51 bodies. Out of the rescued members, 186 are crew members of P 305 and 2 are crew members of a tug boat, Varaprada, which too went missing during the cyclone.

21-05-2021||Delhi||Delhi gets highest 24-hr rain for May||Over 119mm of incessant rainfall, induced by cyclonic storm Tauktae and a western disturbance, lashed Delhi in the 24 hours to 8.30am on Thursday, breaking the Capital’s all-time 24-hour rainfall record for the month of May.The spell of rainfall was so heavy that it surpassed what is generally received in the entire month, according to India Meteorological Department (IMD) data. The last time Delhi saw more rain in all of May was in 2008, when the city recorded 165mm rain in the entire month.IMD said that in the 24 hours till 8.30am on Thursday, Delhi recorded 119.3mm rainfall, which was around twice the rain recorded on a “regular” monsoon day – around 55-65mm. The rain and the gusty winds also led to the pollution levels in the city dropping to “satisfactory” levels on Wednesday for the first time since September 23, 2020, or after a gap of 238 days, according to Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) recordings.Kuldeep Srivastava, head of IMD’s regional weather forecasting centre, said that till 8.30pm on Wednesday, Delhi had also recorded 60mm rainfall, which was equivalent to the previous all time record lodged on May 24, 1976. “The rainfall activity intensified at night and by 8.30am on Thursday, Delhi had received 119.3mm rainfall, which broke the all-time (24-hour) record for May,” he said.The rain continued to give Delhi residents a cool summer with the maximum temperature at Safdarjung weather station, which is considered the official marker for the city, touching 31.4 degrees Celsius, nine degrees below what is considered normal this time of the year. The minimum temperature was also 19.3 degrees Celsius, seven degrees below normal.An unusually high number of western disturbances in March, April and now in May has subdued the searing heat normally felt in the city and north India through April and May, IMD has said.Scientists explained that rainfall activity began in parts of Delhi and the National Capital Region (NCR) from Tuesday night under the residual impact of cyclone Tauktae. “The heavy rainfall was the impact of the remnant of cyclone Tauktae. Only such rare weather phenomenon can do this in peak summer in Delhi,” said Rajendra Kumar Jenamani, senior scientist, IMD.According to weather expert Navdeep Dahiya, the cyclone-induced rainfall also broke records in several cities, including Gurugram that recorded 100mm rainfall (previous record of 58mm on May 2, 1987), Meerut recorded 86mm (previous record of 64.3 on May 29, 1886), Varanasi recorded 83mm (previous record of 55mm on May 2, 1969), Narnaul at 77mm (previous record of 60.3mm on May 14, 1982) and Sultanpur at 73.4mm (previous record of 70.5mm on May 25, 1970).Cyclone Tauktae that intensified into an “extremely severe cyclonic storm” made landfall on Gujarat coast late on Monday evening with wind speed between 150kmph and 160kmph.CPCB data shows that the air quality also drastically improved following the day-long rainfall. The overall air quality index (AQI) of Delhi on Thursday was 58, in the ‘satisfactory’ category. On Wednesday, the overall AQI was 78, also in the ‘satisfactory’ zone.While the rain brought relief from the heat and pollution, it also wreaked havoc on the city’s infrastructure, which could not match the intensity of the downpour.Late on Wednesday night, a portion of road at Khaira Road Dhansa Stand metro station in Najafgarh caved-in after a drainpipe burst due to excess flow of rainwater. The cave-in caused partial damage to an adjacent building, and a truck fell into the crater, but was pulled out without anyone getting hurt.“Repair work of the caved-in portion is in progress and all efforts shall be made to complete the work at the earliest. DMRC is now filling the road with additional concrete to avoid the recurrence of this problem in the future,” the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) said in a statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-gets-highest-24-hr-rain-for-may-101621563001031.html
21-05-2021||Delhi||Delhi govt to set up oxygen plants of 300 MT for third Covid wave: CM Kejriwal||Sweta Goswamisweta.goswami@htlive.comNew Delhi Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Thursday said the state government will buy oxygen tankers and set up pressure swing adsorption (PSA) oxygen plants of up to 300 metric tonnes (MT), and set up more beds to better prepare the Capital for another potential wave of Covid-19, even as ongoing surge appeared to be ebbing.“Day before yesterday (Tuesday), I held a meeting to decide on the steps to be taken to prepare for the third wave. The people of Delhi should not face the problems that emerged during the second wave of Covid-19 again. We have made a team of officers that will list all preparations to be made,” he said.The chief minister added that this team is inspecting all aspects of health care infrastructure that need to be bolstered and managed in preparation of any possible surge.“The number of oxygen beds required; whether we should set up 35,000-40,000 oxygen beds and 10,000 ICU beds? Further, of those oxygen and ICU beds, how many should be reserved for children? We have already prepared 6,500-7,000 ICU beds,” Kejriwal said while speaking to reporters on the sidelines of his visit to the family of a school teacher who died of Covid-19.Kejriwal also said the Delhi government will buy its own oxygen tankers and install PSA oxygen plants on in the city on a “war footing”. He said Delhi’s regular oxygen consumption on a daily basis is about 250 MT.“Therefore, we are planning to install oxygen plants with a total capacity of 250-300MT at least, so that we do not have shortage of oxygen when the next wave hits,” he said.“Delhi also needs to set up its own storage tanks for oxygen. This is another aspect being looked into. So things like these need to be fine-tuned. By next week, the team will prepare the basic plan and work will then begin on a war-footing based on that plan,” Kejriwal said.For children, he said the government has made a separate team that is looking into aspects ranging from the line of treatment if they contract the infection to the medical supplies they will need. “For example, oxygen masks for children need to be smaller. So, the team is looking into things like this. If we had completed the vaccination drive, we would have got some relief from Covid-19, but this is not the case. We have repeatedly asked the Centre for more vaccine doses, because we have just a day’s stock left. We hope the Centre sends doses soon,” he said.Decision on lockdown soon, say officialsWhen asked about the lockdown which has been in place for almost five weeks now, the chief minister said he will have a meeting with Lieutenant Governor (L-G) Anil Baijal over the weekend, and take decisions necessary. “Whatever is decided, I will let you know well in time,” he said, without elaborating if the government will spell out relaxations this week.Senior officials in the government said the lockdown will be eased in phases from next week.“The relaxations will be very gradual, as we cannot afford to lower our guard now,” a senior government official said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-govt-to-set-up-oxygen-plants-of-300-mt-for-third-covid-wave-cm-kejriwal-101621559571309.html
21-05-2021||Delhi||Antifungal drug supply short of govt estimates||Owing to the limited supply of Amphotericin B from the central government, Delhi is on the brink of facing a crisis of the antifungal medicine required to treat mucormycosis.As on Thursday, the city had 203 active black fungus cases. The Centre allocated the city 2,750 vials of the drug, which, officials said, would suffice for only 30 patients for the full 15-day treatment regimen.State health officials said that of the allocation of 2,750 vials, Delhi had not received 600 vials till Thursday. Going by the number of active cases, the Delhi government has projected it needs at least 18,000 vials to treat the existing number of patients.“Delhi was earlier allocated 2,150 vials of Amphotericin B by the Centre for the month of May. On Wednesday, it increased the allocation by 600 vials, making it a total of 2,750 vials. But, at least till 6pm (on Thursday), we did not receive the 600 vials,” said a senior state health official.According to doctors, as of now, Amphotericin B is the only effective last-line medicine to treat mucormycosis.“What is worrying is the increasing number of cases -- from 185 cases on Wednesday, the number of patients affected by black fungus stood at at least 200 on Thursday. We hope fresh stocks arrive soon,” said another state health official.Since supply is less than demand, the Delhi government is regulating the distribution of Amphotericin B to ensure judicious and equitable distribution to the needy patients. On May 18, the city administration formed a technical expert committee (TEC) to examine applications from various hospitals for the medicine and approve the requisite number of vials.Of the 2,150 vials available, the TEC, till Wednesday, cleared distribution of 1,800 vials to hospitals that are treating black fungus patients, documents seen by HT showed. This indicates that the Delhi government is left with only about 350 more vials, unless fresh stocks arrive.“The treatment protocol is for 15 days and, usually, 300mg dosage is recommended for one day. So, one patient needs approximately 90 vials of Amphotericin-B (50mg) during the full course of treatment,” said a second health official.“The Delhi government has written to the department of pharmaceuticals, the Government of India (GoI) and the Drugs Controller General of India, requesting for 18,000 vials of Amphotericin-B (50mg) at least. Apart from this, we have also calculated that Delhi will need approximately 15,000 vials of 50mg each on a weekly basis. This also has been communicated to them,” said the official.Deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia also wrote a letter to the Centre demanding an allocation of 100,000 vials of Amphotericin-B (50mg) for Delhi, health minister Satyendar Jain said on Wednesday.Union minister of state for chemicals and fertilisers, Mansukh Mandaviya, on Thursday said shortages of the drug will be resolved soon.“Within three days, five more pharmaceutical companies have got new drug approvals to produce it in India, in addition to the existing six pharma companies. The existing companies have already started ramping up production,” said Mandaviya in a statement issued on Thursday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/antifungal-drug-supply-short-of-govt-estimates-101621548897692.html
21-05-2021||Delhi||Oxygen hoarding case: Cops’ plea for Navneet Kalra’s custody junked||A Delhi court on Thursday rejected a Delhi Police plea seeking five more days of custodial interrogation of businessman Navneet Kalra, and instead sent him to 14 days in judicial custody.Kalra, who has been charged with hoarding oxygen concentrators and selling them at inflated prices, was arrested on Sunday evening from a Gurugram farmhouse. The Delhi Police recovered 524 oxygen concentrators from three restaurants – Khan Chacha, Town Hall and Nege & Ju – owned by Kalra and from the office of Matrix Cellular between May 5 and May 7.He was sent to three days in police custody by a court on Monday.Metropolitan magistrate Akanksha Garg said that even if the accused is remanded to judicial custody or released on bail, there is no impediment before the investigating agency to confront or interrogate the accused.The court also rejected the police contention that Kalra’s custody was required for recovering the mirror images of the recovered mobile phone, saying, “I do not find any force in it”.The magistrate said the fact that replies of various banks with regard to financial transactions were still awaited cannot be a ground to deny the accused his “valuable right”.Public prosecutor Atul Shrivastava told the court, “Almost 516 transactions were made and 23 banks were involved and he has to be confronted with this. These bank accounts are voluminous.”Senior advocate Vikas Pahwa, representing Kalra, requested the court to not grant further custody of the businessman to the police, as all the recoveries have been made and his presence is not required. He said that all transactions were routed through a single bank account and that Kalra was not required to verify the same.Advocate Vineet Malhotra, representing Kalra, also showed the Instagram page of actor Salman Khan, contending that the concentrators he was distributing were similar to the ones being sold by Kalra. The public prosecutor responded that Khan was donating and not doing business with them.On May 5, a case was registered against Kalra under Section 420 (cheating), 188 (disobedience to order promulgated by public servant), 120-B (criminal conspiracy) and 34 (common intention) of the Indian Penal Code, Essential Commodities Act and Epidemic Diseases Act.The Enforcement Directorate (ED) has also registered a money laundering case against Kalra.Five persons, including the manager of Nege & Ju restaurant, chief executive officer (CEO) and three senior officers of Matrix Cellular, were also arrested in the case. However, all five were later released on bail with the court observing that it was unable to understand the offence they had committed as the government did not regulate the prices of the devices.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/oxygen-hoarding-case-cops-plea-for-navneet-kalra-s-custody-junked-101621548268202.html
21-05-2021||Delhi||‘Get black fungus medicine from wherever in world’: Delhi HC to Centre||The Delhi high court on Thursday suggested that the Centre should procure Amphotericin B, a drug required to treat mucormycosis, internationally to meet the shortage in the country, saying that this is the only way to bridge the gap between demand and supply.An unprecedented surge in mucormycosis infections, which was typically rare, has caused a clamour for the anti-fungal drug. Doctors have said that where they would previously see 10-15 cases a year, they now have close to a 100 within weeks.“We are not questioning your allocation… you are doing good work… You need to import this to bridge the gap between your plan to enhance the capacity and completing manufacture before we lose more precious lives. So act fast on this… Float a global tender and ask internationally... Make a global enquiry,” a bench of justices Vipin Sanghi and Jasmeet Singh said.Seeking a status report from the Centre, the bench said, “You can make emergency imports… And we want you to act today… You have to get the medicine from wherever in the world. You have to take steps right now. Wherever it is available in the world get it…Time is at a premium and so are human lives.The court also directed the Union government to file a status report, detailing the present production, the producers, their capacity, their enhanced capacity and by when can the enhanced capacity be put in use.Amphotericin B, an antifungal drug, is used to treat mucormycosis, or black fungus, a rare fungal infection caused by a group of mould called mucormycetes. It causes blindness, organ dysfunction, loss of body tissue and even death if not treated in time. There has been a large number of cases since steroid overuse during Covid-19 has left many, particularly those with uncontrolled diabetes, particularly susceptible to the disease.The issue of shortage of Amphotericin B was first raised by petitioner-lawyer Rakesh Malhotra. The court directed both the Delhi and Union governments to respond to reports of the shortage of the drug.Senior advocate Rahul Mehra, for the Delhi government, told the court that the Centre has allocated 2,150 vials of Amphotericin-B (50mg) to Delhi for the period up to 31 May 2021, which includes 1,850 vials through Bharat Serums and Vaccines Ltd. and 300 through Mylan Laboratories.He said that 600 vials have also been allocated through Cipla Ltd. However, stock has not yet been received. Mehra argued that the supply is much less than the demand.The Centre told the court that there are 197 patients in Delhi and each requires 42 vials for a week, not 90 vials, as claimed by Delhi government. It said that, by this calculation, Delhi would require 8,400 vials per week.The central government’s standing counsel Kirtiman Singh told the court that there is a shortage due to rise in the cases of mucormycosis.On the suggestion of the court to procure it from foreign countries, Singh said that the drug is generally used for a disease known as Kala Azar, or black fever in some countries. He said the Centre will request for the drug from the countries which are producing it and also list steps to increase its production.He also said that one of the five companies, Bharat Biotech, has already agreed to double its production capacity.He said on May 20 when the overall allocation across the country was 15,960, 430 vials were given to Delhi. He also said that there are 7,251 patients of black fungus in the country and 200 in Delhi, so the case load in the national capital is 3% of the country’s.Mehra said that Delhi government is seeking 100,000 vials of the medicine, which the city is estimated to need in the next five weeks, and the state government was not misplaced in asking the Centre for these vials.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/get-black-fungus-medicine-from-wherever-in-world-delhi-hc-to-centre-101621545808555.html
21-05-2021||Delhi||Delhi CM orders 3 hospitals to set up black fungus care centres||Three Delhi government hospitals will set up dedicated wards to treat patients who contract mucormycosis, also known as black fungus, Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal announced on Thursday, after medical facilities in the city reported an increase in the number of cases of the fungal infection over the few days. He also said the state will ensure the adequate supply of an anti-fungal medicine needed to treat the infection, following an order the previous day that the state government will directly regulate its supply to hospitals.“Chaired an important review meeting with experts in the light of increasing black fungus cases. We have to stop black fungus cases and ensure that those infected by it get treatment. We have taken some important decisions to contain spread and treatment of black fungus,” Kejriwal tweeted.At least 203 patients are currently admitted with the infection to Delhi hospitals, hospitals and officials have told HT over the past two days.The wards have been set up in Lok Nayak, Guru Teg Bahadur, and Rajiv Gandhi Superspeciality hospitals – three of the Delhi government’s largest hospitals treating Covid-19 patients.Both Guru Teg Bahadur and Lok Nayak hospitals have earmarked 20 beds each, while Rajiv Gandhi hospital has set up a 16-bed ward.Black fungus has been found mostly among people with uncontrolled diabetes, whose immunity is compromised, or among people who are given excessive steroids or immunity-modulating drugs such as tocilizumab. According to doctors, if left untreated, it could kill up to 80% of those infected. If not detected early, it affects the orbit of the eye and the mouth, resulting in people losing their vision or jaw during debridement — the process of removing dead tissue from an infection or wound.“A team of five specialists — an ENT surgeon, a general surgeon, a chest physician, and doctors from the medicine department — has been created to treat patients. All of the cases received at the hospital are referred here from other facilities and smaller nursing homes in the city where medicine to treat the infection (Amphotericin B) is unavailable,” said a senior doctor from Lok Nayak hospital who asked not to be named.Doctors have said Amphotericin B is the only drug which can treat the fungal infection.He added, “We haven’t had any case of mucormycosis in patients treated for Covid-19 at Lok Nayak. These cases usually happen due to an overuse of steroids.”There are three patients with the infection admitted to GTB hospital, according to a senior doctor, all of whom have been referred from other hospitals for the want of the drug.“The treatment for the infection needs specialists from various departments including ENT, ophthalmology, and neurosurgery doctors since dead tissues need to be debrided from the nose and eyes. The brain may also be affected in some cases. The key is to detect the infection early. However, the medicine needed is manufactured by only one company and is currently in short supply,” said a doctor from Guru Teg Bahadur hospital.On Wednesday, the Delhi high court asked the Delhi and central governments to report on the steps taken to resolve the shortage of Amphotericin B.Currently, the Centre supplies the medicine to the states. In Delhi, a four-member committee evaluates hospitals’ applications for the medicine and allocates it when doses are available.“We are seeing a large number of mucormycosis cases because of several reasons. One, the sheer number of people who got Covid-19 during the second wave; when there is a huge denominator more cases of such secondary infection are likely to be detected. Two, the infection this time around was more severe, meaning patients were on steroids and oxygen for longer. Three, there was also indiscriminate use of steroids by people, some of whom might have been pre-diabetic and might not have monitored their sugar levels putting them at risk. Four, Covid-19 in general leads to an increase in ferritin level in blood; ferritin contains iron which is a food source for mucormycosis,” said Dr Ameet Kishore, senior consultant of ENT at Apollo hospital.Meanwhile, chief minister Kejriwal urged doctors to control the use of steroids on Covid-19 patients to prevent a rise in instances of mucormycosis.“We appeal to all doctors and hospitals to reconsider the use of steroids in Covid-19 treatment. It has come to light that the excessive use of steroids have contributed to cases of black fungus across states. Also, people should maintain their sugar levels,” Kejriwal said later in the day, on the sidelines of his visit to the residence of a frontline worker who died of Covid-19.He also acknowledged the shortage of the antifungal drug, but said he was confident the Centre will help with its stocks.“We are also preparing an SOP (standard operating procedure) for hospitals for treatment of black fungus cases,” he said.On being asked whether Delhi too would declare black fungus an epidemic, Kejriwal said, “We will take all necessary steps”.Earlier in the day, the Union health ministry asked states and union territories to declare mucormycosis a notifiable disease under the Epidemic Diseases Act.So far, several states, including Telangana and Rajasthan, have declared black fungus an epidemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-cm-orders-3-hospitals-to-set-up-black-fungus-care-centres-101621545493720.html
21-05-2021||Chandigarh||Live-in couples entitled to protection, rules Punjab and Haryana HC||Live-in relationship is not prohibited nor does it amount to commission of any offence, the Punjab and Haryana high court has held . “Such couples fear for their safety from relatives and not from the society, further holding that in law such a relationship is not prohibited nor does it amount to commission of any offence. Hence, such persons are entitled to equal protection of laws as any other citizen of the country,” the court said in its May 18 order. The order comes days after two different benches had refused to grant protection to live-in couples. While one of the benches observed that the “entire social fabric of the society will get disturbed” if the plea is accepted, the other said “the petitioners, in the garb of filing the present petition, are seeking seal of approval on their live-in-relationship, which is morally and socially not acceptable.” The fresh order comes from justice Sudhir Mittal, passed on plea of a couple from Jind in Haryana, who had submitted that both are major but fear for their life and liberty as the girl’s parents are against the relationship and are threatening to cause physical harm to the boy. State counsel had contended that live-in relationships are not legal and are frowned upon by the society. Thus, no protection can be granted to the petitioners. “The Constitution of India is the supreme law of the land. Right to life and liberty is enshrined therein and is treated as a basic feature. The said right includes the right of an individual to full development of his/her potential in accordance with his/her choice and wish and for such purpose, he/she is entitled to choose a partner of his/her choice. The individual also has the right to formalise the relationship with the partner through marriage or to adopt the non-formal approach of a live-in relationship,” the bench observed. It further added that the concept of live-in-relationships has crept into the Indian society from western nations and initially, found acceptance in metropolitan cities, probably because individuals felt that formalisation of a relationship through marriage was not necessary for complete fulfilment. “Slowly, the concept has percolated into small towns and villages as well, as is evident from this petition. This shows that social acceptance for live-in-relationships is on the increase. In law, such a relationship is not prohibited nor does it amount to commission of any offence and thus, such persons are entitled to equal protection of laws as any other citizen of the country,” the bench added. The court further observed that the constitutional courts grant protection to run away couples who apprehends threat to their lives and liberty at the hands of their parents and it does not make any difference whether they are in a live- in relationship or have formally got married.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/livein-couples-entitled-to-protection-rules-punjab-and-haryana-hc-101621544989499.html
21-05-2021||Chandigarh||Mutant virus variants found in 94% samples from Punjab||Mutant strains of the coronavirus are actively present in Punjab with 94% of fresh genome sequencing reports coming positive for such variants, posing challenge to the state health department in containing the second pandemic wave. Of the 188 samples from across Punjab tested for genome sequencing at the central government’s epidemiology testing units, 176 were tested positive for the “mutant strains”, health department officials said. Genome sequencing attempts to draw out complete genetics of viruses. Of the 176 samples, 81 carried the UK virus strain (B.1.1.7) and 92 had the Indian variants (B.1.617). Of the new strains (UK, South Africa and Brazil) detected in India, the former is believed to be 70% more infectious than others. Health experts believe that the high prevalence of mutant strains in Punjab is the prime reason for the spike in infections amid the second wave. In March this year, the UK variant was found in 326 (81%) of the 401 samples from Punjab tested for mutant strains.“So far, the state health department has sent around 2,000 swab samples of randomly infected people from all the districts of the state. The samples were sent mostly from government medical colleges (GMCs) in Amritsar and Patiala to the Centre’s epidemiology units for testing. We have received results of only 900 samples till now,” said state Covid-19 nodal officer Dr Rajesh Bhaskar. “The national epidemiological units have huge pendency of samples as gene sequencing is not done commonly. It takes around one month to get reports from these units. The mutant strains are definitely a big challenge to us,” Dr Bhaskar added.According to the health department, in March’s reports, the UK strain was active in 12 Punjab districts, including Mohali, Jalandhar, Patiala, Kapurthala, SBS Nagar, Hoshiarpur, Gurdaspur, Amritsar, Ludhiana, Rupnagar, Bathinda and Tarn Taran.“The state health department will regularly send swab samples for genome sequencing as better detection can help us in planning safety measures. Also, people must follow social distancing norms and must wear masks to protect themselves from the mutant strains as they are highly communicable,” Dr Bhaskar said. Hussan Lal, principal secretary (health), Punjab, said, “The UK strain is highly active in Punjab.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/mutant-virus-variants-found-in-94-samples-from-punjab-101621543729623.html

He also demanded action against the Bir Talab gurdwara management committee for allowing Khalsa’s address at the shrine. Senior superintendent of police (SSP) BS Virk said a case was registered under sections 295A (deliberate and malicious acts, intended to outrage religious feelings of any class by insulting its religion or religious beliefs) of the Indian penal code.“A team will probe the role of other persons named in the complaint,” said the SSP.Meanwhile, BJP state secretary Sukhpal Sra shot a complaint to the National Commission for Schedule Castes that Khalsa was arrested for raising a pro-Dalit sentiment of attaining more political power in Punjab.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/bathinda-pathi-held-for-holding-ardas-for-sirsa-dera-chief-s-release-from-jail-101621543725647.html

On May 14, as many as 421 patients were under treatment with oxygen consumption at 10 metric tonnes against 9.9 metric tonnes on April 22 when only 177 patients were receiving medical care at the hospital’s 450-bed isolation facility.The hospital is catering to critical Covid-19 patients from Bathinda, Mansa, Muktsar, Moga, Ferozepur, Fazilka and Faridkot districts. The Covid isolation wards at the hospital were divided into two zones — high flow and low flow — according to the requirement of oxygen. “The high flow oxygen zone has been set up on the ground floor, where level-3 facility is for critical patients, while low-flow zone wards have been set up on the first floor. Oxygen concentrators were placed at 50 points where oxygen supply was not required,” said Dr Ruhee Dugg registrar, Baba Farid University of Health Sciences (BFUHS).“To ensure the hospital does not face oxygen shortage, an audit committee was constituted. The team visits Covid wards regularly to prevent any wastage,” she said. The BFUHS has also conducted a research study on the zoning of Covid wards, which they have now sent to other facilities so they can ‘replicate’ it.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/faridkot-medical-college-plugs-o2-wastage-treating-twofold-patients-with-same-supply-101621543666499.html

The state department of medical education and research on Wednesday relieved the nursing officers of duty and sent them back to their parent institute after they against “pathetic” accommodations provided to them. AIIMS, Bathinda, director Dr DK Singh said the matter needed to be thoroughly probed before fixing any accountability or contemplating action against the staffers. Dr Singh added that since the incident took place at Patiala’s medical college, they have limited information about what actually happened as no senior faculty member accompanied them. “We have set up the committee comprising senior doctors who will submit report to me. Further action will be initiated accordingly,” Dr Singh said. The nursing officers reached Patiala three days ago and were deployed in the government medical college’s Covid wing. Besides poor sanitation, the nurses complained of substandard meals in the hostel mess and deplorable living arrangements. The AIIMS, Bathinda, which has recruited 400 staff nurses and only 45-level 2 beds and 20 level-3 beds, had decided to send them in groups of 50 each for duty in four government medical colleges of the state with the approval of the Union health ministry. The Punjab State Medical and Dental Teachers Association has demanded termination of the services of the AIIMS nurses. Association president Dr DS Bhullar and general secretary Dr Darshanjit Singh Walia, said the nurses left the duties by making irresponsible and baseless allegations against the hospital authorities and have defamed the institution. “This is gross dereliction of duty. Besides termination of their services, criminal cases under the Epidemic Act and Disaster Management Act should be registered against them,” Dr Bhullar said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/row-over-nurses-aiims-bathinda-constitutes-3-member-inquiry-panel-101621543665557.html
21-05-2021||Chandigarh||Ban on kirpan: Sikh bodies take up issue with New South Wales govt||Enraged over the ban on wearing kirpan by Sikh students in the government schools of New South Wales (NSW) state of Australia, as many as 56 Sikh bodies have written a joint letter to the NSW government, terming the ban “wrong” and “unfair”. The Sikh community is in talks with NSW education minister Sarah Mitchell to get the order withdrawn. They have also asked the government to stop bullying of Sikh students, which leads to such incidents. The ban was enforced after a 14-year-old boy allegedly used a kirpan to stab a 16-year-old at a Sydney school. “The Sikh community has been hit hard by the knee-jerk reaction of the NSW government in the blanket banning of the Kirpan in NSW schools. The NSW government’s decision to impose a ban contravenes a statutory right to wear a kirpan for religious reasons. The right is not due to a ‘loophole’ in the law, as referred to by the education minister Sarah Mitchell. The ban has been imposed without taking the Sikh community into confidence, or consultation, in response to an alleged incident involving a 14-year-old Sikh student, who is believed to have been bullied in school,” reads the letter. Sources said the minister was urged to consider a compromise, including allowing the kirpan in schools under the condition that they remain locked in a case. Manjinderpal Kaur, volunteer of United Sikhs, who was among the Sikh panel engaging with the minister, said, “The state government is seeking inputs from the Sikhs in this matter and almost all the organisations, including largest Sikh body in the country Australian Sikh Association (ASA), have signed the letter.” “The minister told us that this ban is temporary. However, this issue must be resolved at the earliest as it has dire consequences for the Sikhs globally. And the Sikh leaders in Australia are trying their best to get it resolved as per the Sikh sentiments,” she added. SGPC president Jagir Kaur also wrote to external affairs minister S Jaishankar and Australian high commissioner in India urging them to ensure revocation of the ban order.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ban-on-kirpan-sikh-bodies-take-up-issue-with-new-south-wales-govt-101621543425994.html
21-05-2021||Chandigarh||10 villages in Fazilka district declared containment zones||As many as 10 villages of Fazilka district have been declared containment zones, the highest number of villages in any Punjab district, following surge in Covid-19 cases. According to the official data, Fazilka saw a two-fold increase in new infections and Covid-related mortalities in May. In this month so far, the district saw a daily average of 404 new cases and 11 fatalities. Sources said most of these cases were from the rural pockets. The home district of state Congress president Sunil Jakhar has no facility to treat critical patients requiring ventilator, neither in government hospitals nor private health institutes. Health authorities say a cluster of five villages adjoining the Rajasthan border reported sizeable virus cases. Experts say attending weddings and visiting crowded places in Sriganganagar without Covid-appropriate behaviour contributed to the fast spread of infections in villages. On May 1, Fazilka had 7,906 positive cases and the tally was 8,085 on Thursday. Similarly, 137 deaths were reported in the district this month, taking the total number of fatalities to 348. District epidemiologist officer Dr Sunita said Bazidpur Kattanwali village was the first village to be declared a containment zone earlier this month. “Total 172 people have been tested positive for Covid-19 and casualties were also reported at Bazidpur Kattanwali. Several patients and deaths were reported from Ruhariawali, Dutrawali, Kular, Bhagsar, Panjkosi and other villages. After initial hesitancy, villagers have now started approaching the health department whenever they develop Covid-19 symptoms,” she said. Three localities in Arniwala, Bhagu and Ghallu are micro-containment zones. Civil surgeon Dr Parminder Singh said two weeks ago, a task force started a testing drive in villages. “A sharp increase in positive cases is due to aggressive testing. We have been focusing to mobilise panchayats to contain the infection spread,” he added. Sources said the civil hospital at Fazilka district headquarter has no Covid care facility and only the government hospital at Jalalabad has a 60-bed facility for patients needing oxygen support. “A community health centre at Ramsra village near Abohar town is being prepared as the level-2 facility. The health department had four ventilators which were handed over to Ludhiana as Fazilka has no trained personnel to handle ventilators,” says a district functionary.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/10-villages-in-fazilka-district-declared-containment-zones-101621543065131.html

Repeated endoscopic examination of the nose, saline irrigation and surgical debridement can help treat the infection.”Mucormycosis is an invasive infection caused by a class of moulds called mucormycetes. The fungus enters the body by inhalation and affects the sinuses or lungs.“The infection is primarily found in Covid positive patients and is caused by indiscriminate use of steroids, uncontrolled diabetes, prolonged stay in the ICU and comorbidities,” said Dr Ashok K Gupta, director, ENT, Fortis Hospital, Mohali, who has been treating black fungus patients.Patients may experience swelling, pain, watering and redness of eyes; drooping of eyelids, double vision and in some cases, loss of vision. Further, black discolouration of the skin, facial swelling, ulceration in the nasal cavity and facial nerve paralysis have also been observed.All health facilities to report every case: UT health secretaryIn the order notifying black fungus as an epidemic, Chandigarh’s principal health secretary Arun Kumar Gupta said under Section 2 of the Epidemic Diseases Act, 1897, the UT administrator had notified the Chandigarh Administration Epidemic Diseases (Mucormycosis) Regulations, 2021, under which all healthcare facilities, including government and private, will follow the guidelines for screening, diagnosis, management of mucormycosis, issued by the Union health ministry.All healthcare facilities will report every suspected or confirmed case of mucormycosis to the health department. No person, institution or organisation will spread any information for management of mucormycosis without prior permission from the health department, the order added.A committee under the chairpersonship of the UT health director, with specialists of internal medicine, ophthalmology, ENT and epidemiology as members, will be constituted to review any violation of the notification.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/six-cases-of-black-fungus-detected-among-mohali-s-covid-patients-101621542885692.html

The teachers’ body will also be holding a protest on campus at 10am. Phillaur police had registered a case under Sections 428 (killing, poisoning, maiming, or rendering useless any animal or animals of the value of ten rupees or upwards) and 34 (common intention) of the Indian Penal Code, and Section 11 of the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act against Dr Charanjit Singh of the veterinary hospital. GADVASU teachers’ association president Dr Ashwani Kumar alleged that the FIR was registered under pressure as the dog belongs to a high-ranking official. “The FIR against Dr Charanjit Singh was registered without conducting a preliminary investigation. If the FIR is not cancelled, we will suspend OPD and emergency services,” said Dr Ashwani Kumar. In a statement, the teachers’ association said the dog belonged to a high-ranking official in the state government and was brought to the hospital by the guards of the VIP. The statement further read, “The attendants were unwilling to handle and control the animal. The allegation about the use of a jute bag to handle the canine is false. The fact is that the animal was restrained with a muzzle by the guards themselves. The said dog was suffering from ocular discharge and subcutaneous nodule on chest and the post-mortem has revealed that the dog was tentatively suffering from liver cancer. The said case had been examined by a very senior, competent and kind-hearted clinician.” GADVASU has the region’s biggest veterinary hospital which receives approximately 30,000 cases from Punjab and other parts of north India annually.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/fir-against-vet-for-dog-s-death-gadvasu-teachers-threaten-to-suspend-opd-emergency-services-101621542225602.html

In the re-designed version of the game, the benefits of the DSR technique are shown as ladders and the common mistakes, faulty practices, and myths in agricultural practices are presented as snake bites. The university has also shared a booklet that explains the DSR technique in detail and provides contact numbers of experts from PAU and Krishi Vigyan Kendra (KVKs’) from across the state. Anil Sharma, assistant director, communication centre, PAU, who is also known for writing jingles to exhort farmers to give up stubble burning, is the brain behind modified board game. Sharma said he had conceptualised the game nearly six months ago with the aim of promoting eco-friendly agriculture techniques. “We have been conducting farm visits, seminars, and discussions to promote DSR among farmers. Science is a dry subject. To make it simple and entertaining, we are coming up with such games so that farmers can grasp it quickly. Right now, the challenge is to keep farmers up-to-date with the rapidly changing agricultural technology,” said Sharma. Available at an introductory price of ₹50, the university is planning to distribute boxes, containing the game and relevant information, in all villages across the state. Dr TS Riar, additional director communication, said, “It is a crucial juncture for us. We want to circulate as many copies as possible before the start of the rice sowing season next month. A game on similar lines has also been developed for cotton crop. In that game, farmers have been told about the best and safe practices of sowing of the cotton crop.” Dr JS Mahal, director, extension education, said such experiments should be promoted. “Our targets are farming families. Once such games reach their homes, children, as well as adults, will play these and subconsciously learn about the benefits of DSR. The elders may even reach out to PAU experts, on the numbers mentioned behind the box.” Earlier, Sharma had created furniture from paddy residue to encourage farmers to look for alternative use paddy stubble instead of brazenly burning it and polluting the air.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/pau-tweaks-snakes-and-ladders-game-to-teach-farmers-benefits-of-dsr-101621542045704.html

Deputy superintendent of police (DSP) Harjinder Singh, who has been with the police department for the last 28 years, had contracted the virus in early April. He managed to recover from the disease but due to post-Covid complications, his lungs were damaged and doctors recommended a transplant. His brother Harjinder Singh said, “The procedure will cost ₹70 lakh but our family does not have that much money. We have approached the police department for help. They said that they sent my brother’s reports to a panel of doctors who will go through it and recommend the further course of action. But we don’t have much time. Every minute is important for us and more delay could prove fatal.” “For the lung transplantation procedure, we may have to take my brother to Mumbai or Hyderabad and then wait for a donor. We are feeling helpless,” he added. The family members of the cop have also met police commissioner Rakesh Agrawal, requesting him to speed up the process for fund allocation. The DSP, who was deployed in the securities department of Ludhiana central jail, has also sent a letter to the commissioner through Whatsapp. Delay causes resentment among fellow cops The delay in the response from the police department, meanwhile, has caused resentment among his colleagues. Whatsapp groups of the police are being flooded with messages decrying the apathy of the department. One message that has been doing the rounds of Whatsapp, reads, “After the death of an officer of good conduct, the department gives ₹50 lakh as compensation and job to the next of kin. But the department is delaying treatment of an officer whose life can be saved.” A decorated cop Harjinder Singh had served as the station house officer of Daresi and Koomkalan, besides being deployed in the chief minister’s security. He has earned DGP commendation disc and a number of appreciation letters from the department for his service. When contacted, police commissioner Rakesh Agrawal said, “The department stands with the DSP. We are arranging funds for his treatment. The department will speed up the process.” On Thursday, the police commissioner sent a letter to the prison department for approval for treatment of the DSP.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/ludhiana-khaki-warrior-on-life-support-awaits-funds-for-lung-transplant-101621541865579.html

These infants will be given expert physiological and even medical care, as necessary, during their stay at hospital while the parents recover.This programme has been announced by the hospital only for children under 28 days given that the first month of life is the most crucial period wherein immunity levels are the lowest, making babies highly susceptible to any form of virus or infection in the air.

There is a belief among them that if they test positive, they’ll be shifted to isolation centres and have to spend time alone. But the infection might spread among their family members, which might have serious consequences if they continue to conceal their symptoms.”As per figures, 10 isolation centres are operational in Ambala villages and more will come up at areas where active cases are more than 10.Dr Kaur said the centres are almost empty and the teams are struggling to motivate infected patients to avoid home isolation in joint families.Sources said that the villagers still prefer to consult local practitioners or doctors, as they fear that if admitted to a health centre, “they might never return”.“This fear has confined most of the villagers to their homes. Reluctance to get tested or vaccinated may have gone down, but the patient or beneficiary has to travel a lot to avail facilities,” one of the residents of a village declared containment zone said.SDM (City) Sachin Gupta said the administration is trying to rope in former sarpanchs, teachers and other influential people in villages to motivate residents to undergo testing.Peri-urban areas hit tooAs per figures provided by the health department, peri-urban areas like Babyal, Jandli, Boh, Durga Nagar and Saha are the most affected in Ambala. These areas report to rural health centres but come under the limits of civic body.District epidemiologist Dr Sunil Hari said all these areas are the extension of mainline areas, hence have a larger density of population and poor hygiene behaviour.In an order, deputy commissioner Ashok Kumar Sharma has assigned municipal commissioner Parth Gupta to ensure screening in these areas on the lines of rural areas.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/fear-of-isolation-death-drive-ambala-s-rural-population-away-from-testing-101621541205955.html

21-05-2021||Mumbai||Cyclone Tauktae: Barge toll now 49, hope fades for 37 still missing||The Indian Navy on Thursday recovered 23 more bodies of crew members of accommodation barge P305, which de-anchored and sank in the Heera oil fields in the Arabian Sea, hours before the powerful cyclone Tauktae battered the region late on Monday. The toll has risen to 49, as rescuers continue to search for 37 more personnel.Three barges and an anchor boat deployed by private contractor Afcons for a project it was doing for the Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC), and a drillship of a state-owned firm lost anchors and drifted away in cyclonic winds of up to 210 kmph. While 440 personnel on two barges and the drillship were brought to safety, barge P305, carrying 261 personnel, sank. Of the 261, 186 were rescued and the bodies of 49 have been recovered, officials said. Search for the remaining 26 is still on. Of the 13 on anchor boat Varaprada, two have been rescued, while the search for the remaining 11 is on.Also Read| Cyclone Tauktae maintained intensity even after landfall, affected hit 9 statesCommander Mehul Karnik, chief public relations officer of the Western Naval Command, said search and rescue (SAR) operations were renewed from Thursday morning and the SAR involves Indian Navy Ship (INS) Kochi, Talwar, Tejas, Betwa and Beas.The efforts are being augmented by the aerial surveys undertaken by P-8I surveillance aircrafts and two Sea King helicopters, Chetak and advanced light helicopters. Coast Guard units have also joined the search for the missing crew.Navy officials said the search was initially limited to an area of 550-750 square kilometres, and after bodies were found to have drifted further, the search area was increased from Wednesday night and by Thursday evening it was widened to 1,800-2,300 square kilometres. Officials said the area would be further increased, if required.Barge P305 was deployed at a platform in Heera oil fields, one of the largest ONGC rigs in the Arabian Sea. It got de-anchored on Sunday night and according to deputy chief of naval staff, vice admiral Murlidhar Sadashiv Pawar, sank around 7pm on Monday in a very choppy sea and rough weather, making the subsequent search and rescue operation “one of the most challenging operations undertaken by the Navy in four decades”.Also Read| Firm that ran cyclone-hit barges says people on board had life jackets, raftsAfcons Infrastructure, which leads the consortium that had chartered barge P305, along with its marine crew — mostly skilled and semi-skilled labourers — said there were in all 261 crew members on board the barge, including 13 Afcons employees. The Navy had received an SOS from the barge on Monday morning, following which, three warships — INS Kochi, INS Talwar and INS Kolkata — were dispatched for the SAR operation, along with two Sea King and two Chetak helicopters. The aerial surveillance was augmented by two P-8I surveillance aircrafts.Meanwhile, the Yellow Gate police station in Mumbai registered 22 accidental death reports (ADRs) after 22 bodies were brought to Mumbai, of the 49 recovered, on Thursday.

21-05-2021||Chandigarh||Yamunanagar breathes cleanest air of the year||Yamunanagar on Thursday recorded its cleanest air day this year as the air quality index (AQI) hovered between good (0-50) and satisfactory (51-100) categories for almost the entire day.The website of the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) that displays hourly levels from the device installed at Gobindpura showed the levels as low as 50 (good) at 3pm.The AQI defines overall air quality. As per CPCB, it is calculated only if inputs are available for a minimum three pollutants out of which one should necessarily be either PM2.5 or PM10. Nirmal Kashyap, regional officer of the Haryana State Pollution Control Board (HSPCB), said this was an abnormal situation where the levels dropped to such an extent for the first time this year.“This could have happened as there is almost negligible industrial operations under the limits of municipality and rural areas. The rain due to the Tauktae cyclone has also settled the pollutants emitted from vehicles and other sources,” he added.Haryana is under complete lockdown for past almost three weeks owing to the rising cases of coronavirus in its second wave. The district is an industrial hub of plywood, mica, aluminium, and utensils, factories of which emit carbon to certain levels and as it is situated on the banks of the Yamuna, mining activities have always contributed to its air quality.In March, it was placed at 26th position in the top-30 most-polluted cities in the world and was among eight polluted places of the state and 22 of the country in a report released by IQAir, a Swiss air quality technology company.As per an order by the National Green Tribunal (NGT), HSPCB has also prepared a time-bound district environment plan last month and assigned tasks to various departments.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/yamunanagar-breathes-cleanest-air-of-the-year-101621540965610.html
21-05-2021||Delhi||Delhiwale: A ‘qabr’ by the chowk||In this city of many tombs and grave-centric pilgrimages, it is probably the only chowk, or intersection, to be named after a qabr, or grave.And yet this very grave is the most ignored aspect of Chitli Qabar Chowk. The Old Delhi intersection is forever teeming with various street sounds—people hawking, squabbling, abusing, singing, shouting, laughing, begging... Like New York City, the chowk never sleeps. A fish seller parks his cart right at its centre every morning, and from then on the activity doesn’t stop until far beyond midnight, bustling around the flower sellers and groceries, the bakeries and tea shacks, the biryani stalls, and more. The qabr (grave) that gives its name to the chowk lies right at its heart, inside a small room recently painted pale pink that looks like a Sufi shrine. Its solo window remains closed, with an artificial jewellery stall installed right in front on the pavement.Everybody can go in, but you rarely see anybody going in.This evening the tiny chamber is bustling with rows of ants, busily running about the tiled grave covered in the offerings of green chadars, or sacred fabric, and some fistfuls of rose petals. A few flower baskets are piled up on one corner, probably belonging to one of the florists outside. Despite the organised clutter, the smallness, and the proximity to so much chaos, the grave chamber is dappled in serenity. A wall clock is ticking on loudly though. There’s also a hole in the facing wall that reveals a view of the adjacent street—it gives the feeling of a secret opening in a prisoner’s cell, doomed to an eternity of captivity. Pendant lighting hangs from the ceiling but is covered in transparent plastic, perhaps to keep it dust-proof.Nobody in the surroundings could confidently enlighten on Chitli saint’s life and times. The general consensus assumes him to be a long-ago Sufi mystic.At about midnight the jewellery stall owner shuts down his street-side stall and keeps his stuff inside Chitli’s shrine. He locks the door, which he opens the next day around noon, on coming back. Until then Chitli’s qabr stays undisturbed.These days, due to the pandemic-triggered lockdown, the shops are closed, the noisy pedestrians have disappeared, the jewellery seller hasn’t surfaced for weeks, the shrine’s door is locked and the chowk is lying as still as a grave.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhiwale-a-qabr-by-the-chowk-101621539716032.html

21-05-2021||Chandigarh||Amid Covid surge, Punjab farmers leave for Delhi to join stir||Amid surge in Covid cases, especially in the rural Punjab, a large group of farmers left for Delhi on Thursday from the district’s Harike Pattan town to take part in the protest against three farm laws.The protesters, including women and elderly, left Harike Pattan in tractor-trailers, cars and mini-buses. Before embarking on their journey, the farmers shouted slogans against the central government. No one was seen wearing face mask and social distancing norms were also not followed. More than 40 people were seen huddled in some trailers. The procession, which is expected to reach Delhi on Friday, was organised under the banner of Kisan Mazdoor Sangharsh Committee (KMSC) having a considerable hold in the Majha region and some districts of Malwa. It was the 13th procession of the KMSC from Tarn Taran since the beginning of the Delhi agitation. KMSC’s district president Sukhwinder Singh Sabran said: “The Centre is spreading misinformation about Covid to weaken our protest. This virus is pretty much similar to the other viruses. Covid will not kill farmers, but the black farm laws will.”He said besides revoking the three farm laws, the government should also apologise to the farmers for forcing them to stay on roads for six months.He said the farmers will continue to throng the national capital until the government revokes these laws, adding that they will also hold marches in villages to observe May 25 as a black day.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/amid-covid-surge-punjab-farmers-leave-for-delhi-to-join-stir-101621540485695.html

The accused have been identified as Sukhwinder Singh, owner of Atulya Laboratory and Avinash Chawla of Regimen Pharmacy near Guru Gobind Singh Medical College and Hospital at Faridkot.In a joint operation, a team of the CIA staff and CID unit nabbed both the accused after conducting an undercover operation. The private lab was providing fake positive or negative Rapid Anitgen Test reports. The CIA sleuths also seized Covid-19 testing records and other documents from the lab.CIA staff in-charge inspector Amritpal Singh Bhati said they got a tip-off that the private lab is providing fake Covid-19 reports. “An undercover cop was sent to the lab who asked for a fake positive report. They demanded ₹8,000 from him and later, the deal was struck at ₹5,000. “They did not collect any swab sample of that person and kept only a copy of his Aadhaar Card. They took the money and told him to collect a positive report in the evening. When they provided a fake Covid positive report to our man, we nabbed them,” he said. He said they are interrogating both the accused to find out whether there are more labs or persons involved in such illegal activity, which is endangering lives of the people.A case has been registered under Section 420 (fraud) and 120-B (criminal conspiracy) at the Faridkot city police station.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/faridkot-private-lab-pharmacy-owners-held-for-providing-fake-covid-reports-101621540366370.html

The Congress government did not punish the culprits of sacrilege and its ministers and other leaders were now afraid to go to the villages, he said.AAP MLAs Kultar Singh Sandhwan, Manjit Singh Bilaspur and Amarjeet Singh Sandoa, state general secretary Harchand Singh Barsat and state treasurer Neena Mittal were also present.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/covid-crisis-call-all-party-meeting-special-assembly-session-bhagwant-mann-asks-capt-101621539945439.html
21-05-2021||Chandigarh||Be wary of leaders furthering own agenda, Jakhar tells party workers||Amid efforts by a section of chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh’s detractors to regroup themselves, Punjab Pradesh Congress Committee president Sunil Jakhar on Thursday cautioned party workers against such leaders who were always trying to seek opportunities in any crisis situation. Reiterating that the biggest challenge before the state at present is to save the people from the Covid pandemic, Jakhar said any attempt to divert attention from this core issue cannot be termed as public interest. “After the decision of the high court to inquire afresh into the sacrilege related issue the people of Punjab, as well as Congressmen, were more than concerned regarding the case, but the Punjab government and the Congress high command are very serious about it and justice will be assured in the case,” he said in a statement here, taking a dig at Rajya Sabha MP Partap Singh Bajwa and others for trying to foment trouble in the party. Bajwa and former minister Navjot Singh Sidhu have been openly targeting the chief minister ever since the Punjab and Haryana high court quashed the SIT report in the 2015 Kotkapura police firing case. They are blaming the chief minister and his aides for the legal setback. Jakhar said that in such a challenging time, the behaviour of a few leaders trying to further their own agenda cannot be justified in any way. “By giving false figures of the people reportedly attending their meetings, some leaders were creating the illusion of leading a campaign which is a figment of their own imagination,” he said. Though he did not name anyone, the jibe is aimed at Bajwa who had on Tuesday claimed that five ministers and seven MLAs were present at a meeting held at cabinet minister Charanjit Singh Channi’s house whereas not more than half-a-dozen Congress leaders, including two ministers and three MLAs, attended it. Jakhar is also learnt to have spoken to central leaders about Bajwa’s efforts to fuel dissent in the party. Cong high command watching closely The Punjab Congress president said the party high command was monitoring the actions of leaders who were trying to seek accolades by giving an ultimatum to the government. “Any kind of support to such leaders would be a losing proposition. Instead of using their position to consolidate and strengthen the party, these self-styled leaders are creating fissures in the party cadre to further their not so hidden agenda,” he said, accusing them of pursuing their own goal instead of fighting the real issue, Covid-19. He said the party high command was seized of the matter and working to sort out the issues in an amicable manner, advising all the party leaders to focus on the programme given by the government to check the spread of Covid. On May 21, the death anniversary of former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi should be observed by doing service to prevent the further spread of coronavirus, he added. AICC general secretary in-charge of Punjab affairs Harish Rawat had also spoken to some of these leaders and told them that the central leadership was watching the developments and would intervene soon. (Box) Sidhu exhorts MLAs to meet central leaders Congress MLA and former minister Navjot Singh Sidhu asked the party MLAs and workers to go to Delhi and tell the high command about the situation in Punjab. In a tweet, Sidhu said he had started seeking justice for sacrilege of Guru Granth Sahib and punishing the culprits during the campaign for the parliamentary polls three years ago. “Now, our MLAs and party workers must go to Delhi and speak the truth of Punjab to our high command, as I regularly do!” he posted with a video clip of his speeches during the 2019 Lok Sabha polls. Rajya Sabha MP Partap Singh Bajwa, who has also been critical of the chief minister, had indicated two days ago that some MLAs might go to Delhi to meet the central leadership on these issues.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/be-wary-of-leaders-furthering-own-agenda-jakhar-tells-party-workers-101621539766828.html
21-05-2021||Chandigarh||Explore possibilities of floating global tender for vaccines: Capt||Punjab chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh on Thursday directed the health department to explore possibilities of floating a global tender for the procurement of vaccines from all possible sources to ensure early inoculation in the state. The state government will also reach out directly to all vaccine manufacturers for direct purchase of Covid vaccines, including Sputnik V, Pfizer, Moderna, and Johnson & Johnson, he said.Punjab has storage space for 35 lakh Sputnik V vaccines, which require storage temperature of minus 18 degrees Celsius. The CM said efforts would be made for procurement of vaccines to meet the acute shortage in the state, which had received fewer than 44 lakh vaccine doses so far from the Union government, of which only 1 lakh is currently available for use and which will also be exhausted within a day.The state government was forced to stop vaccination for Phase 1 and 2 categories in the last three days because of non-availability, said the CM, directing the departments concerned to continue pursuing the matter of supply aggressively with the Centre.As per Government of India allocation for Phase 3 (18-44 age group), the state government has been able to buy only 3.6 lakh vaccine doses, including 63,000 received on Wednesday. A total of 2.3 lakh doses have already been used, leaving only 1.3 lakh for use as of now, said the CM.Pointing out that almost 1 lakh unregistered construction workers and their family members had so far come forward for getting vaccinated in line with the state government’s prioritisation of vaccination for 18-44 category, the CM asked the labour department to ensure the registration of these workers on priority. DGP Dinkar Gupta said Punjab Police lost 21 personnel to Covid in the last five months, and of these, 50% were not fully vaccinated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/explore-possibilities-of-floating-global-tender-for-vaccines-capt-101621539765898.html

In the case of families whose breadwinner has died, these would be provided for an initial period of three years, after which their situation will be re-assessed, and where the vulnerability continues to exist, the period may be appropriately increased. The CM also announced the constitution of a monitoring committee, headed by the minister for social security & women and child development, to review progress and relief measures for every single case. The committee will meet at least once a month, he said. CM for house-to-house surveillance Amid projections and concerns of a possible third wave of Covid and its impact on children, Amarinder ordered the health department to go into mission mode with preparation, which will include specialised training of all doctors in the health department by June-end, while directing house-to-house surveillance to control the current spread of the disease in the rural areas. Expressing concern over the spread of Covid in rural areas, the CM directed teams of the health and other departments to start house-to-house surveillance in every village. Stressing the importance of involving sarpanches in this exercise, the CM ordered their prioritisation, along with that of panches, as well as block samiti and zila parishad Chairmen and members, in vaccination. A day after Punjab government notified black fungus as a disease under the Epidemic Diseases Act, the CM directed the health department to ensure that the necessary medicines for treating the same are made available to all the government hospitals.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/free-education-rs-1-500-per-month-to-kids-orphaned-during-pandemic-in-punjab-101621539706155.html

The India-Nepal border was currently sealed due to Covid-19 and only transport vehicles carrying essential goods were permitted to cross the border, he added.Rajbhar told the jawans that he was going across the border to a chemist at Bahuar Bazar in Maharajganj district to buy medicines for his ailing father, according to the official. The medicine prescribed by the doctor was not available in the shop near his village in Nepal. The NAPF men told him that border was sealed, and people were not allowed to cross it from either side, the official said. When Rajbhar insisted, there was an argument between him and the jawans. Soon, local villagers arrived at the spot, opposing the NAPF’s stance and this led to a tussle between the jawans and the villagers, the official said. NAPF personnel opened fire, hitting Rajbhar and he was rushed to hospital but succumbed to injuries, the official said. India-Nepal Friendship Society president Anil Kumar Gupta said the society had sent a letter to the Union home ministry as well as the Nepal government to permit people from Nepal to procure life-saving medicines from chemists in Maharajganj on humanitarian grounds. Covid- 19 had infected people on both sides of the border, he said, adding that people residing in villages across the border in Nepal often visited towns in Uttar Pradesh to purchase medicines or for treatment in hospitals. The movement of people across the border had been restricted after the Covid pandemic, he said. Often, there was scarcity of medicines in Nepal and patients had to try and get it from shops in Maharajganj or other districts in UP, he said. To escape detection by SSB and NAPF, they sneak into UP border through agricultural field. Villagers’ clashes with SSB and NAPF were reported in March and April, leading to tension on the border, he added. The governments of both the countries should permit patients to get treatment or procure medicine on the valid prescription of a doctor, he said.A Nepal government official who did not wish to be named said, “The Nepal government has constituted a five-member probe team to inquire into the episode and submit a report. The members of the team will visit the bordering village on Friday. They will also hold a meeting with the district administration officers of Maharajganj.”Caption: File photo of Nepal police deployed on the international border near Sonauli in Maharajganj district of UP.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/vigil-up-as-nepal-man-shot-by-napf-jawan-while-trying-to-cross-border-for-medicine-101621539644923.html

He formed four teams of health and volunteers who first conducted house-to-house surveys of an entire village and shifted every infected person to the isolation centre for further treatment. People who first hesitated to go to the centre, got ready after teams ensured taking over their day-to-day duty responsibilities towards their farms and animals. Bhosale said that similarly they appointed separate nodal officers for testing, vaccination and charges levied by private hospitals and it brought more consistency in the work. He added that in the second wave, home isolation was stopped completely and patients were treated in Covid care centres that brought down the case load in the district. After the meeting, Thackeray called up Bhosale and congratulated him for the work, a CMO statement said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/at-pm-narendra-modi-s-virtual-meet-ahmednagar-covid-19-model-gets-praise-101621538204825.html

As of Thursday afternoon, 80 animals – largely birds, some of which were pelagic and migratory birds – have been rescued. The birds include an Amur falcon (rescued from Khar), one sooty tern (rescued from Santacruz East), a one-bridled tern (rescued from Jogeshwari), a black-headed ibis (rescued from Goregaon with a fractured wing) and two Indian pittas (rescued from Mira Road in Thane). Rescuers said these birds were not usually seen in interior Mumbai and were probably displaced by the strong winds that lashed the city earlier this week.“These birds are uncommon in Mumbai, except the ibis which is sometimes seen in mangrove areas around the coast. The birds we found were likely displaced from their migratory paths, and were mainly found in a state of extreme exhaustion,” said Pawan Sharma, founder of the Resqink Association for Wildlife Welfare (RAWW).Two other rescue groups, Owls and the Wildlife Welfare Association, rescued sea birds, including a brown nadi and a wedge-tailed shearwater, from Pune and Thane, respectively. These sea birds are not typically seen in interior Maharashtra. Wildlife workers saying the birds had likely been thrown very far off course due to strong winds during the cyclone.Other birds affected by the extreme weather event include two juvenile red-wattled lapwings, 33 black kites, two cattle egrets, a pond heron, six house crows, a little egret, six pigeons, one common-hawk cuckoo, seven rose-ringed parakeets, a purple-rumped sunbird and four Alexandrine parakeets. Another seven birds – including two crows, two crows, an ibis, a tern and a parakeet –had already died or died soon after rescuers got to them.Other animals that had to be rescued include a golden jackal from Pimplas in Thane district, which was suffering from a 103-degree fever. Additionally, one monitor lizard, five rat snakes, seven palm squirrels, four checkered keelback snakes and six spectacled cobras, a wolf snake and three buff-striped keelback snakes were also rescued from Mumbai, Thane and Palghar districts.“As predicted, we are seeing the after-effects of the cyclone on resident and migratory wildlife. Incidents of such birds being injured and displaced are still being reported every hour to our helpline. We are trying to reach to as many cases as we can in MMR,” said Sharma, adding that his team of 20 wildlife volunteers has been working round the clock for the past 72 hours. Treatment and rehabilitation of the rescued animals is also underway, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/cyclone-tauktae-80-birds-animals-rescued-in-3-days-from-mumbai-metropolitan-region-101621538084870.html

The state had utilised 15.1 million ha for kharif crops in 2020-21, despite setting the 14 million ha target. The state is also expecting a record 128.52 million tonnes of production this year from kharif season, officials said. The higher targets were set in a meeting chaired by chief minister Uddhav Thackeray (CM) on Thursday to take stock of the preparedness for the kharif season starting from June. Thackeray also asked officials to encourage farmers to go for ‘Vikel Te Pikel (sow crops that are in demand)’ model and create their own brand in the market. The ‘Vikel Te Pikel’ initiative enables farmers to take up the crop based on the demand of value chains that will guarantee sale of their produce at proper prices. It also will help them in minimising the post-harvest loss of the crops as the produce will be sold out without any delay. “It is necessary to research the market for agricultural commodities. Increasing crop production alone is not vital, but Maharashtra should also work for producing quality crops and build its brand by adopting modern technology and research methods,” Thackeray said in the meeting. “Take crops being sold by their demand in the market. Whatever we grow should be of good quality. Maharashtra should become a brand in the agriculture sector by bifurcating agriculture produce into regions,” CM said. Total land under cultivation in Maharashtra is 16.8 million ha and the average rainfall prediction between June and September is 1075.3mm. State agriculture minister Dada Bhuse informed that the maximum area (4.35 million ha) for sowing is expected to be used for soya bean, followed by cotton (4.3 million ha), cereals (2.3 million hectare) and rice (1.55 million ha). Around 884,000 ha is expected to be used for sowing maize. For this, the state will require 6.364 million metric tonnes of chemical fertilisers and 1.826 million quintal of seeds for the farming community. Maharashtra has around 15.2 million farmers. Of them, 28.40% are small farmers, while are 51.10% are marginal farmers. “The state has set a target of ₹42,388 crore as crop loans by commercial and district banks for kharif season. Of this, ₹6,091 crore has already been disbursed to 0.929 million (929,000) farmers by May 15,” said a senior official from the state agriculture department. The total target set for crop loans this year is ₹57,143 crore. Deputy CM and finance minister Ajit Pawar directed the chief secretary Sitaram Kunte to hold a meeting and ensure that farmers get crop loans from the banks without any delay.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/sowing-area-in-maharashtra-increased-to-15-7-million-ha-for-kharif-season-101621538025502.html

The spot assessment of losses in Ratnagiri, Sindhudurg, Raigad and other districts is expected to be completed in a day or two.Cyclone Tauktae, that hit the coastal districts on Sunday and Monday, caused damage to structures and horticulture in the state. The death toll rose to 19, after the body of one of the missing sailors from Devgad was found on Thursday.CM will hold review meetings with officials from Ratnagiri and Sindhdurg, following his visit to the affected areas of the two districts. In Sindhudurg, Thackeray will be visiting the villages at Vengurla and Malvan tehsils. “The assessment of losses after following due procedure will be completed in next couple of days. CM is visiting the affected districts on Friday. The relief package will be announced after the assessment is completed,” said relief and rehabilitation minister Vijay Wadettiwar, who is also on a visit to Konkan.According to preliminary estimates, crops and horticulture on more than 12,000 hectares (ha) have been damaged. “Total losses are expected to be around ₹60 crore as the damages this time are much lesser than last year [caused due to Cyclone Nisarga]. Coastal districts do not grow any seasonal crops, and thus there was not much damage to the crops. Horticulture has sustained losses as Alphonso mango trees and chickoo plantations were damaged largely. We have asked district collectors to immediately release ex-gratia of ₹4 lakh to the next of kin of the people who died due to the cyclone,” said an official from the relief and rehabilitation department.As per the set norms of the National Disaster Response Fund, the compensation for crop losses ranges between ₹6,800 and ₹18,000 per hectare and between ₹6,000 and ₹95,000 for damages to houses. The state government had increased the relief amount as a special case for the damages in last year’s Cyclone Nisarga.Meanwhile, thousands of households in Raigad, Ratnagiri and Sindhudurg continue to remain without electric supply as the restoration work is underway. Energy minister Nitin Raut on Thursday said restoration of power will be completed within the next few days. “We have diverted workforce from other districts such as Kolhapur, Nanded and Nashik so that the restoration work is completed fast. We have suffered losses of about ₹62 crore due to the damages caused to the electric infrastructure,” he said.Leader of Opposition in legislative Assembly Devendra Fadnavis also went to various affected villages in Ratnagiri on his second day of Konkan visit, on Thursday. He alleged that the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi government led by Thackeray was “biased” towards Konkan. “The government has been discriminating the cyclone-affected coastal districts by stating financial constraints as reasons. Some of the favourite districts get ₹500 crore through various schemes. But it’s not ready to announce a relief package of ₹150- ₹200 crore for Konkan,” he said.Meanwhile, Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader Ashish Shelar visited Palghar and held a meeting with chickoo growers who have sustained huge losses. Shelar said that he has received complaints from farmers about the “faulty assessment” of losses by district authorities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/maharashtra-cm-to-visit-cyclone-affected-ratnagiri-sindhudurg-today-101621537964826.html
21-05-2021||Mumbai||Final-year MBBS students with ATKT wait for summer exam schedule to start working||A day after state minister for health education Amit Deshmukh clarified that exams for undergraduate medical and dental students will be conducted in the physical mode between June 10 and 30, a bunch of final-year MBBS students, who cleared their degree exams with one or two subjects in Allowed to Keep Term (ATKT) in April, are still waiting for their degree. There are 240 such final-year students who now have to wait for the summer exams session to be conducted, in order to appear for the pending exams and gain their MBBS certificates.“Our results were announced in April and only 240 of us have failed in one or two subjects which, as per rule, is conducted in the summer session. However, this year, the pending winter session exams from December-January are being scheduled to take place in June, so we are not sure when our exams will be conducted,” said one of the students, requesting anonymity. He added that without clearing the ATKTs, these students do not get their degrees from respective institutes. While second- and third-year medical, dental and para-medical exams were postponed due to high number of Covid-19 cases, final-year MBBS exams were conducted in March and the results for the same were announced in the last week of April. “The idea behind conducting final-year MBBS exams in March despite rising Covid-19 cases was to ensure more students clear the degree and join the work force across the state. However, with no degree in hand, we are stuck at home unable to be of any help at present,” said another student, with one ATKT. Since May this year, these 240 students have approached the Maharashtra University of Health Sciences (MUHS) as well as the Directorate of Medical Education & Research (DMER) for clarity in this matter, but no official word has come out yet. “As per rules, we can conduct supplementary exams for this with ATKTs only after a 90-day period. So as per that, exams for summer session should be conducted in July and students will be informed about this soon,” said Dr TP Lahane, director, DMER.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/finalyear-mbbs-students-with-atkt-wait-for-summer-exam-schedule-to-start-working-101621537845355.html
21-05-2021||Other||Of 656 teachers at IIT-KGP, only one from SC community, 10 from ST: RTI data||Only 0.15% of all faculty positions at the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT)-Kharagpur are held by teachers from Scheduled Tribe (ST) communities. Teachers belonging to Scheduled Castes (SC) form 1.5% of all faculty positions and 4.1% are from Other Backward Classes (OBC), according to responses received under the Right to Information (RTI) Act. The replies come a week after the institute suspended a professor after videos of her purportedly abusing students from SC, ST categories and those with physical disabilities emerged on social media. The RTI query was filed by Egalitarians, a not-for-profit group working for democratising the Indian academia, on April 28. Responses from the institute, which have been reviewed by HT, were received Monday. Of the 656 teaching staff at IIT-Kharagpur, only one belongs to SC community, 10 are from ST category and 27 from OBC category. Only 88 of them are women. There are three faculty positions at IITs — assistant professor is the entry-level position, followed by associate professor and then professor. The representation of faculty from these marginalised groups was worse in senior faculty positions. The institute does not have even one associate professor or professor who belongs to the ST category. Only two associate professors are from SC category and seven from OBC category. Among professors, five are from SC category and three from OBC. According to government of India (GoI) norms, 10% of all faculty positions in IITs are reserved for candidates belonging to economically weaker sections — 27% for OBC category, 15% for SC, 7.5% for ST, and 5% for candidates with physical disabilities. Until 2019, these reservations were applicable only for recruitment of assistant professors. A detailed questionnaire sent to institute director Virendra Kumar Tewari remained unanswered. Registrar Tamal Nath said the institute had a defined recruitment process for faculty positions. “We follow the recruitment process of the institute. A selection committee is set up and external members are appointed to the committees. The selection is based on academic proficiency of the candidate and performance in the selection process. We do not compromise on the quality of our faculty members,” Nath said. Egalitarians refuted Nath’s claim and said lack of diversity among faculty positions was institutionalised injustice. “Elite institutions such as IITs do not take into account the financial and social capital of candidates when they consider merit, which is primarily focused on academic performance,” said a member of Egalitarians. The group’s members said the data revealed in the RTI puts into context the alienation of dalit and adivasi students at the hands of faculty members such Seema Singh, who was suspended last week. On April 24, video recordings of Singh, an associate professor of English from the department of Humanities and Social Sciences at IIT-Kharagpur, were posted anonymously on the confessions page of the institute, an informal group of students on social media. The recordings are those of preparatory classes, allegedly taught by Singh online and attended by over 100 students and parents, where she can be heard hurling abuses repeatedly. Avatthi Ramaiah, chairperson, Centre for Study of Social Exclusion and Inclusive Policies at Mumbai’s Tata Institute of Social Sciences (TISS), said the discrimination was systemic. “If a reserved category candidate has applied, the law mandates that the selection committee should have a member from the category. Most times, it is this member that bats on behalf of the reserved category candidate alone. There is resistance from all quarters because the department members have a set idea of who they want,” said Ramaiah, who has served on several selection committees. In March, HT had reported that IIT-Bombay has not recruited a single associate professor from ST and OBC categories since 2006. RTI data showed that of the 317 candidates hired as assistant professors over the past 12 years, 97% were from the general category, 1.9% were OBC, 0.9% SC and 0% ST. Between 2006 and 2020, 42 general category candidates were hired as associate professors and 97.7% of all associate professors were from the general category, while 2% were SC, ST while there was no one from OBC category.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/of-656-teachers-at-iit-kgp-only-one-from-sc-community-10-from-st-rti-data-101621537725861.html

21-05-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra gave first vaccine dose to 16.12 million||Of the targetted population of 33.8 million, Maharashtra has administered the first vaccine dose to 16.12 million people across all age group till Thursday. A total of 4.34 million (12.84% of the targetted 33.8 million) have got both the doses. It means, against the state’s total population of 125 million, around 3.47% or 4.34 million people have been vaccinated with both the doses. Very few districts such as Mumbai, Thane, Pune, Nagpur and Kolhapur have crossed the state average, while most of the backward districts are way behind it. Hingoli in Central Maharashtra, Gadchiroli in Vidarbha and Sindhudurg in Konkan are lagging much behind with 126,383, 137,405 and 172,565 people vaccinated with their first doses. The percentage of the vaccinated population against its targeted population of 45-plus hovers around 20-25%. “There is huge hesitancy among people over vaccination for various reasons, including illiteracy, apprehension about safety, availability of resources and in some cases low percentage of infection. The districts which have taken proactive steps to motivate people for the vaccination have improved the percentage,” said an official from the health department. Districts like Gadchiroli, Nandurbar, Hingoli and Washim are lagging behind the state average. Some of the tribal districts have undertaken special drives to encourage the people for the jabs. In Nandurbar, district collector Rajendra Bharud has mobilised logistical resources to take people to the vaccination centres from far-flung areas. It yielded the results and helped the district improve the percentage. “The hesitancy is basically because of illiteracy among people. We have made video clips of prominent social workers such as Abhay Bang appealing people to come forward for vaccination. Still our percentage is low comparing other districts,” said Dr Anil Rude, civil surgeon, Gadchiroli another tribal district. Kolhapur district has led the way and vaccinated 57% of the eligible population above 45 years with first dose. “A total of 1.15 million people of the 1.59 million eligible in this age group have been vaccinated with first dose and 0.22 million have been vaccinated with second doses. We reached out to every village with the help of our sub-centres for vaccinations, which have helped us in reaching near the target. We also paid attention to keep the wastage low by training our vaccinators. We could give 13,000 doses more than the expected doses by saving additional drops in the vials. Our wastage rate of vaccine is -0.5%,” said Dr Farooque Desai, district immunisation officer. The state is currently facing shortage of vaccines, forcing it to suspend the drive for the 18-44 age group. The state is expected to resume the drive for the age group in the last week of May. Until May 19, Maharashtra received 20,709,240 doses of vaccines. It included 2,672,370 doses of Covaxin, while the remaining were Covishield. A total of 1,9891,50 were procured by the state government for the age group of 18-44. The state has inoculated 661,016 people in the age group of 18-44 years with first doses. The state has floated global tenders for procurement of 50 million doses of vaccines that have been approved by WHO and USFDA. Three days after the expression of interest, the state has not received any response. “Despite relaxing the terms, we have not received response from any manufacturer. We will urge the central government to facilitate the import of vaccine as well as other drugs required to treat Covid-19. We have been requesting the Centre for integrated national policy on import of the vaccine. It will help in distributing the vaccine quota to all states and also decide which vaccine suits the requirement of the country,” Tope said. The shortage of vaccines resulted in drastic drop in weekly vaccination rate. In six days between May 15 and 21, 722,528 people were inoculated, against 1,834,369 in the preceding week of May 8-14 and 1,433,165 during May 01-07. In the last week of April from 24 to 30, 2,080,998 doses were administered.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-gave-first-vaccine-dose-to-16-12-million-101621536524766.html

The vaccination would be on a payment basis and the payment per vaccine would need to be mutually decided by the private centre (hospital) and private establishments/housing societies, as per the BMC guidelines.Post this, several housing societies and private establishments have started approaching private hospitals for vaccination but it has not yet taken off due to shortage of vaccines.A spokesperson for Fortis Hospital said, “We have received several requests from housing societies and workplaces to begin Covid-19 vaccination drive for its residents and employees. Following the local municipal guidelines, we are working on the logistics that will be needed to initiate these camps. We hope to start with this engagement very soon.”Under the guidelines, private hospitals will organisation vaccination session at the premises of the housing society or private establishment. Beneficiaries are needed to be registered with the Co-Win app. The vaccination team would be needed to have a doctor, vaccinator, vaccination officer to verify Co-Win details and one person to manage the crowd. An ambulance is mandatory to be stationed at the place of vaccination drive be it housing society or private offices. It is expected to be used to rush vaccine beneficiary to the hospital in case of adverse effects post-inoculation.Dr Santosh Shetty, executive director, Kokilaben Dhirubhai Ambani Hospital said, “We are in touch with corporate house and housing societies for the administration of Covid vaccines, and we will start it once we get a fresh stock by month-end. Currently, we have got few request letters and are in touch with 10-12 big housing societies nearby our hospital and the same number of corporate houses.”Borivli resident Ankit Arora said, “We contacted several private hospitals but they expressed their inability to start such a drive. Unless we have sufficient stock, I don’t think it is of any use to have such facilities.”Meanwhile, from Friday, vaccination for all age groups will be conducted on an appointment basis. The BMC has decided that vaccination will be done on a walk-in basis for three days for those above 60 years of age between Monday to Wednesday and appointment basis between Thursday to Saturday, while the vaccination drive will remain shut on Sunday.Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner of the BMC said, “Currently, for next week we will continue walk-in vaccination for those above 60 years of age, but in the week after that, we might change our policy depending on the vaccine doses that we will get from the global tender that we have floated.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/housing-societies-private-establishments-rush-to-private-hospitals-for-covid-vaccination-101621536465439.html
21-05-2021||Mumbai||Kin of patients affected by Mucormycosis shelling out lakhs for treatment||Even after winning the battle against Covid-19, there is no respite for many patients who are falling prey to a black fungus infection — mucormycosis. A serious but rare fungal infection, mucormycosis is caused by a group of molds called mucormycetes. It causes blindness, organ dysfunction, loss of body tissue and even death if not treated on time, said doctors.Due to the sudden surge in the price of life-saving antifungal medicines, patients at private hospitals have to shell out lakhs during their treatment that stretches between four-six weeks.Siddhesh Parulekar, 71, who recovered from Covid-19, lost his left eye to mucormycosis. The Girgaum resident was detected with Covid-19 in April. With moderate infection - his oxygen saturation levels were around 92 -he underwent treatment at the Worli Covid care centre for almost two weeks and returned home. But within a month, his left eye started drooping and he started squinting. When he was rushed to an ophthalmologist, his MRI report revealed that he had been infected with mucormycosis. On May 9, he was admitted to Saifee Hospital. Struggling to arrange ₹10 lakh for the treatment, the family has started a campaign on the crowdfunding portal—Impactguru.com.“Last week, he underwent surgery where his left eye was removed. His condition is quite critical as the fungus has reached his brain. Currently, he is in the intensive care unit (ICU),” said his son Sunil Parulekar.In another case, Sudhir Mishra, 56, is raising funds for his father’s treatment who has been diagnosed with mucormycosis. Only last month, Mishra spent ₹4 lakhs on his father Anand who was tested positive for Covid-19. Currently, Anand is at Lotus hospital, Borivali that has given the family an estimate of ₹12lakhs towards the treatment of mucormycosis.Pre-Covid-19, patients with mucormycosis were treated at half the current expense. With the sudden surge in mucormycosis cases, however, there has been a severe shortage of life-saving drug — Liposomal Amphotericin B in the market. Taking advantage of the increasing demand, drug suppliers have increased the price of one injection from ₹8,000 to over ₹10,000, said doctors.“There are two types of drugs—Liposomal Amphotericin B and plain Amphotericin B.During pre-Covid days, the first one used to cost ₹3000-5,000. The latter one was ₹150. However, we preferred giving Liposomal Amphotericin B as it is more effective even for Rhino mucormycosis when the infection reaches the brain. So, during the second wave, when cases increased, suppliers surged their price to over ₹10,000. While the price of Amphotericin B has been raised to ₹500,” said Dr ChandraVeer Singh, consultant otorhinolaryngologist, head and neck onco-surgeon, Wockhardt Hospital, Mira Road.As per treatment protocol, when the black fungus infects the nose, sinus or palate, doctors give 5mg dose per kilogram (kg) of body weight. For instance, if a person is 60kgs, he would require 300mg of the dose. Each vial consists of 50mg of the drugs. So, a patient needs six vials which costs ₹60,000 daily. But when the infection reaches the brain, doctors have to give 8-10mg per kg of the body weight. This doubles the daily medical expenditures.Dr Milind Navalakhe, consultant ENT, Global Hospital, Parel said that plain Amphotericin B often affects the kidneys so patients who can afford the medical expenditure opt for Liposomal Amphotericin B. “Patients have to spend a minimum of ₹60,000 daily on the medicines for four-six weeks,” he said.After receiving several complaints of overcharging and channelise the supply of these drugs, hospitals have been instructed to procure the injections directly through the collector’s office.“For the last two-three days, case wise, we send the details to the collector’s office who then supply us the injections. This has helped break the chain of middlemen and over-pricing of doses,” said Dr Singh.Abhay Pandey, national president of All Food and Drug Licence Holder Foundation (AFDLHF) said mucormycosis before Covid-19 was considered an extremely rare fungal infection. A handful of pharmaceutical companies produce the Liposomal Amphotericin B. Now, with the surge in cases, companies are struggling to meet the demand and arrange for raw materials. “When the pandemic started in March last year, the suppliers increased the price of masks and sanitisers for their profit. So now, as cases of mucormycosis have increased, they are using the opportunity by surging prices of the injections,” he said.A spokesperson from Cipla which is one of the manufacturers of the injection said, “The demand for the antifungal medicines has increased by 3-4 times. We are getting orders from all across the country. We have escalated the production and we believe the demand will soon be met.”Meanwhile, doctors said unlike last year the black fungal infection during the second wave is more aggressive which deteriorates the condition of the patients faster.“In the second wave, the infection rate is not only more but it is also affecting younger patients. I have a patient who is just 25-year-old. Also, the infection is so aggressive that it is quickly spreading to eyes, palate and even brain,” said Navalakhe.Doctors said incidences of mucormycosis can be controlled by stopping the unregulated usage of insulin. “This black fungus was earlier visible among patients with immunosuppressants like diabetes and cancer. Patients with Covid-19 are unnecessarily given a large number of steroids which compromises their immunity. So, it (dispensing steriods) needs to be controlled,” said Dr Shashank Joshi, part of the state’s Covid-19 task force.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-mucormycosis-treatment-costs-lakhs-say-patients-kin-101621536404706.html

After covering around 35 nautical miles, we got a message on the wireless to return to the nearest coast due to the cyclone warning. Following this we started to return, but around 15 nautical miles off Uttan, we were caught in the cyclone. We conveyed this to Bernard D’mello, fishermen leader, so that our family members would get some hope.”The fishermen initially decided to go to Dahanu coast, but as it would take around 12 hours, they decided to drop the anchor and stay at the spot. “We dropped the anchor after we covered only nine nautical miles in three hours. However due to the gusty winds, it broke. The second and third anchor also broke, and we were drifting four nautical miles in the opposite direction. Our boat was tossing in the sea and we just had a long rope for support,” said Miranda. Due to the tossing, the steering wheel of the trawler also got partially damaged. After the condition improved on Tuesday, they decided to move towards Uttan and reached Chowk village in their partially damaged boat around midnight.“We could see the Indian Navy chopper coming to our rescue, but they had to return thrice due to inclement weather and we were at the mercy of Mother Nature,” said Miranda.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/cyclone-tauktae-6-uttan-fishermen-return-after-3-days-101621536345314.html

The accused was arrested from Mira Road where he sold the e-passes for ₹400 each.According to DN Nagar police, the accused, Amir Imtiyaz Munshi, had sold around 400 e-passes since the beginning of the second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic.Police officers said that when travel restrictions were announced during the second wave, the government started a portal for e-passes for emergency travel within the state and districts. The officers said they had received information that a person had been selling online e-passes illegally.On tracking the IP address of the computer, police reached Munshi’s house and arrested him after seizing his computer.During interrogation, Munshi confessed to selling e-passes and also revealed that an employee of the collector’s office used to take ₹300 for each pass.“We are now looking for the government employee who was helping Munshi in procuring the e-passes. We are also looking for people who have bought the passes from Munshi,” said a police officer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mira-road-resident-arrested-for-illegal-sale-of-travel-passes-101621536286731.html
21-05-2021||Mumbai||Centre must allot Amphotericin B injections to Maharashtra under any circumstances: Tope||As cases of mucormycosis are increasing in Maharashtra, state health minister Rajesh Tope said that the Centre must allot Amphotericin B injections to Maharashtra at the earliest. Looking at the increasing cases, the state Covid task force has prepared guidelines for the treatment of such cases in the state. Tope said that the guidelines will soon be issued and the department will also hold training programmes across districts.“Maharashtra has several cases [of mucormycosis]. Depending on the severity of the case, a patient needs anywhere between 60 to 100 injections during the treatment. The task force has prepared a detailed guideline for the treatment of mucormycosis. It will be issued soon and the state will be holding training programmes for districts as well,” Tope said.The minister said that rising cases of mucormycosis is a “real concern” for the state government and have therefore pressed for the Centre’s approval to get the injections needed for the treatment of mucormycosis, which is also referred to as Black Fungus, colloquially. So far, Maharashtra has about 1,500 cases and have reported around 90 fatalities due to it. The state, according to Tope, has placed orders for over 200,000 injections but the manufacturers need permission from the Centre to supply it to the State. “The real concern for us now is mucormycosis and our stress remains that Centre must allot Amphotericin B injections. We have given purchase orders for 200,000 injections to various companies that manufacturer these injections, but the Centre is not allocating the quota and till then these companies cannot deliver these orders,” he said.The minister said that another challenge for the pharma companies is the availability of the active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) or raw material to manufacture the drug, which has to be imported from Germany. “The Centre must overcome these issues and make Amphotericin B injections available to Maharashtra under any circumstances,” Tope said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/centre-must-allot-amphotericin-b-injections-to-maharashtra-under-any-circumstances-tope-101621536285399.html
21-05-2021||Mumbai||Bombay HC asks NEGVAC to check possibility of door-to-door vaccination for elderly, disabled||The Bombay high court (HC) has directed The National Expert Group on Vaccine Administration for Covid-19 (NEGVAC) to look into the possibility of door-to-door vaccination for those who are above the age of 75 and differently-abled. The expert committee, under the aegis of the health ministry, is required to submit its report before June 2. The bench further observed that if the NEGVAC comes out with a policy favourable to the select group of citizens, then the same may be implemented immediately without waiting for the high court order. A division bench of chief justice Dipankar Datta and justice Girish Kulkarni, while hearing the public interest litigation (PIL) filed by advocates Dhruti Kapadia and Kunal Tiwari, was informed by the counsel for Brihanmumbai Mumbai Corporation (BMC) that as per the directions of the bench on Wednesday it had filed a response. The HC had asked the BMC commissioner to inform it whether the civic body was in a position to conduct door-to-door vaccination for elderly and disabled citizens and if the response was in the affirmative the court would permit it to do so even if the centre did not permit it. The affidavit filed by Dr Mangala Gomare stated that the civic authority was willing to implement door to door vaccination if the Central government comes out with a policy for the same and issued guidelines to that effect. Dissatisfied by the response the bench observed, “What was the praise in the newspaper and media for.. publicity? You cannot think for the elderly and bedridden. If you do not have stock, you stop vaccines for all. Why is this selective vaccination going on? Can you discriminate like that?” The latter observation was in light of the petition on issues for booking of vaccination slots on the Co-Win vaccination portal which is also being heard by the bench. Kapadia, a petitioner-in-person submitted that the village of Behrampur in Odisha had a door to door vaccination policy which was discontinued today morning. To this, the court noted that the reason for discontinuation of the door-to-door vaccination drive was not because of some Adverse Effects Following Immunization (AEFI) but because the centre did not have a policy. Suggesting a change in approach for the vaccination drive the court said, “Officers are thoroughly insensitive. Instead of having people rush to the centres, you should chase them for vaccinations. Why can’t this approach be thought of? This is not how you deal with such an important issue. Your officials have disappointed us.” The bench then noted that as NEGVAC had been constituted in August 2020 specifically for dealing with Covid vaccination directed it to consider the possibility of the door to door Covid vaccination policy for elderly and disabled citizens. The court further directed additional solicitor general Anil Singh for the Union of India and NEGVAC to get instructions from the chairman of NEGVAC and ask him to submit their opinion on the door to door vaccination policy to the court within two weeks. With regards to the plea to have a separate Co-Win portal for Mumbai in light of complaints of registered patients not getting vaccines though they have been given appointment slots due to walk-in vaccines being administered at centres, the court directed BMC to give preference to online registrants who have confirmed appointments over the on the spot registrants. They also added that the respondent authorities will make “honest endeavours to ensure that the elderly citizens are not made to wait in long queues and that immediate steps are taken to vaccinate them at the centre”. The court has posted a hearing of both petition on June 2, 2021, and has asked the authorities to respond to the specific queries raised by them by then.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/bombay-hc-asks-negvac-to-check-possibility-of-door-to-door-vaccination-for-elderly-disabled-101621536224703.html
21-05-2021||Mumbai||God save education system: HC raps Maharashtra govt on SSC tests||The Bombay high court (HC) has rapped the state government for not having a contingency plan in place for assessing students before cancelling the Class 10 exams and asked it to file an affidavit on the measures it plans to take to address the issues raised in public interest litigation related to admission to Class 11 given the cancellation of the Class 10 exams.The court said that as the Class 10 exams were the last schooling examination for students, they could not be promoted without having been assessed, as it would have an adverse effect on their future. A division bench of justice SJ Kathawalla and justice SP Tavade, while hearing the PIL filed by retired professor and Pune resident Dhananjay Kulkarni, was informed by advocate Uday Warunjikar that though the notification announcing the cancellation of Class 10 exams in the state was issued on May 12, as per news reports the decision was taken on April 15. He added though the government resolution was issued a month after the decision was taken, the state had not prepared a plan for assessing the students. Warunjikar added that while other boards like CBSE, ICSE and IB had an internal assessment to evaluate their students and declare their class 10 results, the students of the state board were not assessed from class 1-8 as the Right to Education (RTE) Act did not permit exams till then and due to the pandemic, Class 9 students were also not assessed last year and promoted to Class 10, hence there was no internal assessment based on which the state board students could be assessed like students from other boards. Government pleader Priyabhushan Kakade for the state submitted that the issue of coming up with an evaluation system for students of the state board had been referred to the State Council for Education Research and Training (SCERT) and their response was awaited. He submitted that SCERT had control over the marking system and performance standard in Maharashtra, hence the state would have a formula on marking within a week. When Kakade said did not respond to the court’s query on whether an examination would be held for class 10 state board students, the court said, “Are you thinking of promoting them without examination? God save the education system of this country. This is the only examination and the last examination of their schooling. If you are waiting for suggestions from them (SCERT), who took this decision?”After the court sought to know whether such Class 10 examinations were cancelled in other states as well both Kakade and an intervenor informed that the states of Tamil Nadu, Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh had also done so. The court then questioned as to why Class 10 exams were being cancelled while Class 12 exams were being conducted and then sought to know from other boards how they would be assessing and promoting students if they had also cancelled Class 10 exams. Advocate Mihir Joshi for CBSE said that the board had conducted internal assessments which is part of the final assessment. He added that the performances of students of the last three years would be considered to ensure no student gets over and above what they usually get. Advocate Pratik Kothari for ICSE submitted that the board conducted internal assessments and had exams till Class 9. He added that the board would appoint experts and come up with a formula like they had done last year which was approved by the Supreme Court. After hearing all submissions, the court addressed Kakade and said that as a decision was yet to be taken on how to assess the state board students for Class 10 the state should have had a blueprint in place before making the decision. “Exams have to be conducted now or later. If you are cancelling then you have to have some blueprint, not just some getaway for students. Checks and balances have to be in place. There are law firms which say we will not take students who get above 90% in exams.” The court then permitted the state to submit the decision of SCERT within a week and posted a hearing of the PIL thereafter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/god-save-education-system-hc-raps-maharashtra-govt-on-ssc-tests-101621536164725.html
21-05-2021||Mumbai||Congress, Sena demand petroleum minister’s resignation over barge tragedy; NCP calls for case against ONGC officials||Terming the barge incident wherein at least 37 workers drowned in Arabian Sea a “manmade tragedy” and a failure of the Narendra Modi-led Union government to avert it, Maharashtra Congress has demanded resignation of petroleum minister Dharmendra Pradhan on moral grounds.Former chief minister and senior Congress leader Prithviraj Chavan has asked as to why the 600 people on-board the barge were not brought to offshore immediately after cyclone warnings. He said the responsibility should be fixed for criminal negligence. State Congress general secretary Sachin Sawant has demanded for Pradhan’s resignation on moral grounds. “The tragedy in which 37 people have lost their lives is manmade. More than 38 people are still missing. This is clearly a manmade tragedy as warning of cyclone was given in advance. It is the responsibility of the people who put the lives of 700 people in danger, and action should be taken against the people responsible. The moral responsibility should be taken by the minister by resigning from the post,” he said.Sawant said it was negligence of the people at the helms of the affair due to which the tragedy took place. “Lakhs of people of lost their lives because of the mishandling of the Covid-19 crisis in the country. Similar failures have come to the fore from the irresponsible management in other ministries too. We want to ask whether the Modi government is going to learn anything from its blunders it has committed so far,” he said.Chavan has said ignoring Coast Guard warnings has led to the tragedy. “Ignoring Coast Guard warnings has caused a huge tragedy. Why did the 3 accommodation barges hired by #ONGC with more than 600 persons on board not forced to return offshore. Responsibility must be fixed for this criminal negligence and compensation given (sic),” he tweeted on Thursday. Shiv Sena MP from south Mumbai Arvind Sawant, in a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, demanded that he seek resignation of Pradhan and ONGC CMD. Sawant, who is also Sena’s chief spokesperson, demanded an inquiry under a retired Supreme Court or high court judge over the “callousness” of ONGC management and the ministry of petroleum and natural gas as to why they could not alert the staffers who were on duty on the barge. He also sought financial assistance for the families of the deceased and the 52 missing employees.The Nationalist Congress Party (NCP), too, has demanded that a culpable homicide case be registered against ONGC officials responsible for risking the lives of the 700 employees working at the barge. “There were alerts of Cyclone Tauktae from concerned authorities, but ONGC chose to overlook them and risked the lives of 700 employees. Around 37 employees lost their lives after the sea barge drowned in the cyclone and over 40 are still missing. Search and rescue operations by the Coast Guard and Indian Navy are still on. Declaring a probe by Union petroleum minister Dharmendra Pradhan in the matter is not enough. We want the responsibility of the officials concerned to be fixed. They should be suspended with immediate effect and should also be booked for culpable homicide,” said Nawab Malik, state minority affairs minister and NCP chief spokesperson.P305 barge had gone adrift off Heena oil fields in Bombay High area. The oil fields are located around 70km southwest of Mumbai.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/congress-sena-demand-petroleum-minister-s-resignation-over-barge-tragedy-ncp-calls-for-case-against-ongc-officials-101621536044687.html

21-05-2021||Mumbai||Barge master chose to stay close to oil field: Afcons Infrastructure||Afcons Infrastructure, the company which chartered Papaa 305 (P305) that sank off the coast of Mumbai on May 17 due to Cyclone Tauktae claimed on Thursday that the barge master chose to stay close to the oil field where P305 was anchored though he was warned of the storm three days in advance.The weather forecast received on May 14, 2021 “predicted sustained wind speed of maximum 40 knots (classified as a “Tropical Storm” by our service provider) was likely to occur at our specific work location late 16th or early 17th May 2021.”“While the other barges moved to Mumbai port or outer anchorage, the Master of P305 chose to move 200m away from the platform where they were working, and to remain at that location, deciding this as a safe location since the maximum predicted wind speed was only 40 knots and his location was 120 NM [nautical miles] way from the eye of the tropical storm,” a statement issued by Afcons on Thursday read.“Durmast is the owner and the responsibility for marine operations rests with the vessel owner and his marine crew stationed on the vessel... Afcons, as charterer deploys its construction workmen and supervisors, who stay on the barge and carry out construction or revamp work on the platform,” the statement added.Afcons further claimed that the responsibility for the marine side of the operations, namely safe vessel operation, navigation and vessel management, come under the scope of work of the vessel owners, carried out through the vessel’s master, officers, and the crew appointed on the vessel by the owner.A statement from Durmast Enterprises is awaited.P305, an accommodation barge with 261 personnel on-board, sent out a distress call on Monday morning, following the intensification of Tauktae to an extremely severe cyclonic storm. The people on board comprised marine crew, labourers on contract, as well as 13 employees of Afcons. Till now, 186 people have been rescued, while 49 bodies have been recovered in the Search and Rescue (SAR) operations launched by the Indian Navy and the coast guard late Monday.The barge, owned and operated by M/s Durmast Enterprises Limited, was chartered by Afcons and consortium partner Halani-TES-Nauvata to work on a project for the Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) in the Western Offshore fields in the Arabian sea. The barge was located 72 km off the coast of Mumbai in the Heera Oil Fields in Bombay High, where some of the country’s biggest offshore oil rigs are located. Two other barges chartered by Afcons were battered by the cyclone, but all on board were rescued, including 137 on board barge Gal Constructor, which ran aground about 90km north of Mumbai’s Colaba Point, and 196 on board barge SS-3. The 101 on board oil rig Sagar Bhushan, which was also set adrift due to the gusty winds, were brought to safety as well, an official involved in the SAR operations said. However, a tugboat with 11 members on board, remains missing.The statement said that the consortium followed the standard practise of offshore contractors to hire a service provider for location-specific weather forecast, which is issued twice a day.“The sudden deterioration of weather left no time at all for any further action to be taken by the Master of the vessel,” the statement added.Afcons has also set up a 24-hour help desk to address concerns of all distressed family members of the affected crew. The helpline provides updates to family members about every development of the rescue operation. “We’re fully committed to stand in this crisis together and offer our full support to the families, including financial assistance,” Afcons stated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/barge-master-chose-to-stay-close-to-oil-field-afcons-infrastructure-101621535984773.html
21-05-2021||Mumbai||Barge tragedy: Kin identify bodies, some wait for missing family members||Thirty-five-year-old Satyendra Singh, a resident of Devaria district in Uttar Pradesh, survived Cyclone Tauktae — the most powerful storm to hit the west coast in more than two decades that packed sustained winds of up to 210km per hour and nine- to 10-metre-high waves. Singh and two of his cousins reached to the safety of Mumbai port in nick of time, but on Thursday he learnt that his elder brother, Upendra, who was working as a rigger on the ill-fated barge Papaa305 (P305), died. Singh and his two cousins were on another barge —Trinity Nissi — deployed in the same area in the Arabian Sea before Cyclone Tauktae hit Mumbai coast. Their barge left high sea in the evening of May 14 as they received warning for the cyclone and reached Mumbai coast the next morning. He, however, wandered as to why P305 chose to remain where it was and expose the 261 crew members to the vagaries of the storm. Singh was angry at his brother’s employer for failing to bring barge P305 back to the harbour. “There were around 250 people on barge Trinity Nissi who had to wait till 9pm on May 19. Later we were allowed to go from Barge. After coming out from the ship, I heard my brother is missing and P305 has sunk and several people died. I inquired with the company who hired us and came to Sir JJ Hospital, identified the body,” he said. He added, “He was everything to me. We lost the main person of the family.” Upendra has three children — two daughters aged 12 and 3 years and a 5-year-old son. Ajay Singh, a 39-year-old from Ajagara village, Azamgarh in Uttar Pradesh, who was working on Barge P305 since a few months is among those missing. His distant relative JP Singh, who resides in Koperkhairane, said, “I got a call from the family after the company informed them about the incident and asked them to come to Mumbai to identify Ajay. We were shown few bodies and photos at Sir JJ Hospital but I could not identify Ajay, as I had not seen him in the past 20 years. Last I saw him was at his wedding. We informed Ajay’s father and are now waiting for the family to come from their hometown.”Ajay, who is listed as a missing person, has two kids — a son studying in Class 10 and a daughter studying in Class 7. He is the only earning member of the family.Arjun Pandey, 29, is another person listed as missing. Pandey, a resident of Gopalganj in Bihar, worked on barge P305 since January this year. “He came to Mumbai on January 10 and stayed at his brother-in-law’s house in Navi Mumbai. He went to work on the ship in the last week of January through a company which provides manpower to these ships,” said his cousin Prince who has been waiting at the hospital to identify the body since morning, without eating anything. Prince said, “Arjun last called his wife, who is expecting, on May 17 around 7am. He informed her about the condition on the ship. We got no news of him since. He is the only earning member of the family.”Prince had visited the Nerul office of the company Pandey worked at to check the list of survivors, but as he could not find his name there, he came to identify the body at Sir JJ Hospital on Thursday. “We were asked to reach JJ hospital to identify the bodies. But so far we have not found him,” he said.Prince, in tears, said the family has been calling him every hour but he is yet to inform them about Pandey.Meanwhile, the body of 44-year-old Nilesh Pitale, a fire safety officer of barge P305, was identified by his younger brother Vishwanath at the hospital, but he and his relatives claimed they will not accept the body till the company assured them of compensation. “Pitale was the only earning member in the house. Both his father and mother are heart patients. He has a 17-year-old daughter and a 12-year-old son,” said his cousin Dinesh Madhukunta, adding, “We have not informed parents till now and his wife.”“The cyclone alert was given, so why was the barge not sent to Mumbai coast? Who will take care of the families of the people who died? It is a complete failure of the company due to which many people lost their lives,” said Madhukunta. Of the 49 bodies recovered from P305, 26 have arrived at Sir JJ Hospital. Among them, 16 have been identified by their family members, relatives and colleagues, said an officer from Yellow Gate police station. So far, only one body has been handed over to the family. Most of the people are from outside the state, so the hospital has been conducting Covid tests of the deceased so as to ensure there will be no hurdle while traveling from Mumbai to another state, said the officer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/barge-tragedy-kin-identify-bodies-some-wait-for-missing-family-members-101621535924716.html
21-05-2021||Delhi||All Delhi hospitals should install oxygen plants: HC||All hospitals in Delhi having more than 100 beds should install pressure swing absorption (PSA) oxygen plants with a capacity of at least twice their requirement of medical oxygen in view of the “bitter experience” that the city had recently due to shortage of supply and the lessons learnt from it.A bench of justices Vipin Sanghi and Jasmeet Singh directed the principal secretary, Delhi government, to look into the issue and file a status report by May 27.“The bitter experience that everyone in the NCT of Delhi has had with huge shortage of medical oxygen has certainly left a lesson to be learnt particularly by hospitals and nursing homes operating in Delhi,” the bench said.“Considering that the pandemic is once in a century and hopefully we will see the end of it sooner or later, we are of the view that larger hospitals with 100-bedded facilities or more should have their own PSA plants which should have a capacity of at least two times of their normal requirement,” it added.The bench also said that even the smaller hospitals and nursing homes with 50 to 100 beds should also have PSA plants to meet their requirement, which will help if “such a situation arises again in the future”.A PSA plant uses sieves that absorb nitrogen from ambient air to concentrate oxygen for supply to hospitals or the industry. The oxygen is then supplied either through a pipeline or is compressed to fill cylinders.The court said these directions should be complied with by all the hospitals in the national capital, which comes under the Delhi government, the central government, municipal corporations and others and it should also be followed in case of new hospitals.The Centre’s counsel told the court that some plants which are to be installed have not been received as they form part of the aid being received from several countries.Senior advocate Rahul Mehra, appearing for the Delhi government, told the court that for the Delhi government, five plants have been commissioned and 32 are yet to come up.He said the Centre and the Delhi government shall designate nodal officers, sufficiently senior, to monitor the aspect of supply and installation of PSA plants inhospitals, if not done already.The court warned authorities that they should not relax after the recent dip in Covid-19 cases in the national capital as “there is a likelihood that the virus would again raise its ugly head”, and reminded them to create a buffer stock of liquid medical oxygen (LMO).The high court said it is the duty of the Centre and the Delhi government to ensure that they are again not caught underprepared to deal with the situation.“If you have not taken steps, we will come and chase you again. We are telling you, we mean business. Please don’t take it lightly we are again warning you,” the bench said.The Delhi government told the court that it has created a buffer stock of 419 metric tonnes of LMO at different locations here and they are making arrangements for creating further stock in next 10 days.The court also asked the Delhi government to make its Delhi Fights Corona website bilingual since many people don’t understand English.The bench also warned private hospitals and nursing homes here that failure to comply with directions to update data on occupancy and availability of beds for Covid-19 patients in their institutions will invite precipitate actions.The bench also asked the Centre, the Delhi government and municipal corporations to provide accommodation to all the health workers, who are willing to avail it, so that they do not carry the Covid-19 infection to their homes and infect their family members.The high court also asked the Delhi government to examine issuing an order under the Disaster Management Act so that such facilities are also made available to health workers of private and charitable hospitals in the city.“In our view, it is desirable that such a facility is available to all frontline workers since it is likely that they may carry the infection to homes and infect family members,” the court said.The court, which asked the Delhi government, Centre and the MCDs to file their respective reports in this regard, also directed Delhi Police to file a status report on the facilities available to their personnel and listed the issue for hearing on May 24.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/all-delhi-hospitals-should-install-oxygen-plants-hc-101621535025210.html
21-05-2021||Delhi||Delhi woman recovers from Covid after 35 days on ventilator||‘Dilliwali Meenu’ was a popular name in a Kurukshetra hospital which doctors and nursing staff used to refer to a patient from Delhi who was on ventilator support for 35 days battling Covid and survived severe lung infection to beat the disease.Meenu Chauhan, the principal of a private school in Delhi, lives in the national capital with her husband Rohit Chauhan and daughter. She had reached her maternal home in Kurukshetra on April 1 to fetch her daughter back to Delhi when she developed Covid symptoms and was forced to stay back, said her husband.Doctors said she tested positive for Covid on April 3. Her condition became critical after her oxygen saturation plummetted to 70 (the optimum is 90% and above) and the infection spread to both her lungs.She was taken to the private hospital in Kurukshetra and when her condition started deteriorating, she was put on oxygen support, said the doctors who treated her. A few days later, the infection had spread to her lungs, they said.When she was unable to breath normally, the doctors shifted her to the intensive care and put her on ventilator support on April 8.Recalling her month-long battle against Covid, Meenu said, “It was a very critical time that I had to face. I was very tense when doctors shifted me to the ICU. I began to realise that I may not recover or see my family again.”“But the doctors and staff members of the ICU gave me strength to fight this invisible enemy and I started recovering after over a month,” she said.Dr Anurag Kaushal, who treated Meenu, said she is a very strong woman and every staff member of the hospital was in awe of her willpower to fight. “But I think luck also plays a crucial role in the recovery of many a critically ill patient.”He said Meenu’s battle against Covid-19 and her almost miraculous recovery is inspiring other patients to fight against the deadly viral infection.Chauhan said Meenu has been discharged from the hospital, but she will still stay in Kurukshetra to recuperate as she is too weak to travel to Delhi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/delhi-woman-recovers-from-covid-after-35-days-on-ventilator-101621535024671.html
21-05-2021||Delhi||Delhi University postpones final semester exams to June 7||Delhi University (DU) on Thursday postponed semester exams for final-year undergraduate and postgraduate students for the second time and announced that these will now commence on June 7.The exams, which will now be held in the open-book format online, were earlier scheduled to start from May 15 but were postponed to June 1 owing to the spike in coronavirus disease (Covid-19) cases across the country.Dean of examinations DS Rawat said the university has decided not to conduct exams for students of intermediate semesters -- first and second-year students-- and to promote them on the basis of internal assessments. “We will conduct online open-book exams -- the way it was done last year -- for final semester students from June 7. Detailed guidelines will be issued on Friday,” he said.In the last academic session, DU had conducted open-book exams (OBE) online for final year students in August, amid widespread opposition from students and teachers. The university also conducted another round of OBE in October for students who could not appear in the first round.This year, too, several students and teachers have questioned the feasibility of conducting exams amid the raging pandemic. Abhigyan, a final-year BA (Hons) in Political Science student at Ramjas College and a member of the All India Students Association (AISA), said the association had conducted a survey of over 2,000 students across DU colleges who were overwhelmingly against holding exams amid the pandemic.“Many students have lost their loved ones and their families are witnessing huge financial crises. How can we expect students to take their exams in such a situation? The university should come up with some alternative mode of assessment for this year, considering the unprecedented times we are living in,” he said.Rajesh Jha, a faculty member at Rajdhani College and former member of the university’s executive council, said, “Both teachers and students have been going through tough times. DU has lost over 35 teachers in the past month to the pandemic. Several students have lost their family members, including parents. The university should review its decision to conduct exams.”Rawat, meanwhile, said the varsity will ensure that “no students is left behind”. “DU Colleges are conducting practical exams in the online format these days and as per the data collected from over 15 colleges, over 97%-98% students are appearing for these exams… In case any student won’t be able to sit for the exams owing to any reason, the university shall surely help them,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/du-postpones-final-semester-exams-to-june-7-101621534964658.html
21-05-2021||Delhi||Delhi: Deceased govt teacher’s kin get financial aid of ₹1 crore||Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Thursday met the family of a government school teacher -- who was deployed on Covid-19 management duty and died of the disease in June last year – and offered financial assistance of ₹1 crore under a government scheme and a government job for the man’s elder son.“Late Shri Sheoji Mishra was a very hardworking and dedicated teacher in our Delhi government school. He passed away after getting infected while being on Covid-19 duty last year. I can understand the pain and grief of his family. While we cannot bring him back, I, on behalf of the Delhi government, have provided him with the monetary support of ₹1 crore. He is survived by his wife and two sons... the Delhi government will provide his elder son with a job. We will also stand beside them should they need any assistance in future.”In June last year, when the first lockdown was in place, Mishra was deployed at a night shelter and entrusted with screening, arranging beds and providing food to migrant workers taking shelter there. He tested positive for Covid-19 on June 4 and died at a hospital on June 7, said the CM’s office in a press conference.Under a Delhi government scheme notified in May 2020, families of health workers and frontline workers in the city who die of Covid-19 are entitled to financial assistance of ₹1 crore from the government.Earlier this week, Kejriwal also announced ₹50,000 financial assistance for families of individuals who died of Covid-19, and an additional financial assistance of ₹2,500 a month for orphaned children and those who have lost the sole breadwinners in their families. These announcements have to be cleared by the Delhi Cabinet, after which they can be implemented.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/delhi-deceased-govt-teacher-s-kin-get-financial-aid-of-1crore-101621534906402.html

21-05-2021||Delhi||DU teacher dies of Covid-19 days after her husband, leaves behind two sons||A 45-year-old assistant professor at a Delhi University (DU) college succumbed to Covid-19 on Monday, less than 10 days after her husband died of the illness Covid-19, orphaning two children.Chetan Jassal, an assistant professor in the commerce department of Mata Sundri College for Women, and her husband, Pawan Kumar Jassal,were rushed to Chandigarh by relatives on April 25 after reportedly failing to find a hospital bed in Delhi. Her husband died on May 8, said her Chetan Jassal’s relatives.Her colleagues, and friends said she was unaware of her husband’s death. “She called me on April 24 asking for some leads for an oxygen cylinder for her husband. He was having difficulty breathing and they were trying to find a hospital bed. They were both infected at the time. After failing to get a bed here, she took her husband to Chandigarh with the help of her relatives. In that time, her condition got worse, and she was hospitalised as well. She was on ventilator support since April 30. She did not know about her husband’s death,” said Veenakshi Sharma, a colleague and close friend of Chetan Jassal’s.“She was a very dear friend. I can’t believe a person as lively as her has gone so early,” she said.The DU Teachers Association (DUTA) said more than 35 faculty members from across colleges in the university have died of Covid-19 since March.Veena Agarwal, an associate professor at SGTB Khalsa College also succumbed to the infection on Monday. Last week alone, at least five DU faculty members lost their lives to the deadly disease.Harpreet Kaur, principal of Mata Sundri College for Women, said Jassal sent her documents to the college for a pending promotion, days before she left for Chandigarh.“She would have been promoted to the post of associate professor soon. It’s so shocking for us to believe she is not among us any longer. She was a very hardworking and responsible colleague. We will never forget her ever-smiling face and lovable personality,” Kaur said.Kaur said the two are survived by two sons — a 20-year-old studying psychology in DU, and a 14-year-old in Class 10.“At the college’s level, we are trying to help the family. The chairperson of the college’s governing body has promised he will sponsor their sons’ education,” Kaur said.Jassal’s brother Dr Maheshwar, who last met her in September, said, “We tried our best to find beds for them in Delhi, but to no avail. We had to call them here [to Chandigarh] then. It’s a difficult time for the family.”Several students and colleagues also posted messages expressing shock over Jassal’s untimely demise on social media. Students had also organized a virtual prayer meet in her memory on Wednesday. “A moment of grief for all of us, as we have lost a very dear teacher who not only guided us but was also a pillar of strength… It’s very hard to believe that you are not with us and the college anymore,” said Sifat Kapoor, a student in a Facebook post.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/du-teacher-dies-of-covid-19-days-after-her-husband-leaves-behind-two-sons-101621534845203.html
21-05-2021||Delhi||Mother and son found dead in East Delhi, cops suspect they were strangled||A 56-year-old woman and her 29-year-old son were found dead at their home in north-east Delhi’s Karawal Nagar on Thursday morning, the police said, adding that they suspect that the duo may have been murdered by strangling.The suspected double murder comes three weeks after the woman’s husband died of complications arising from a hernia surgery, the police said.The police identified the dead by their first names as Umlesh and her son Ashok. The mother and son ran a grocery store from the ground floor of the building in which they lived. Ashok was unmarried.Umlesh’s husband, Shyam Sunder, died on April 29. Until his death, he lived with his other son in another house in the same neighbourhood, the police said.The police said the deaths came to be known around 8am on Thursday when a relative noticed that the grocery store had not opened at the usual time.“The relative checked on the duo to find the door of the house open and them lying dead inside. Ashok was frothing from the mouth while his mother was bleeding from the mouth,” said the police spokesperson.The police were informed and they visited the spot to move the bodies to a hospital. Since Umlesh and Ashok were the only people in that house, it was difficult to immediately ascertain if anything was stolen, the police said.The police said though, prima facie, it appeared to be a case of double murder by strangling, they would await the autopsy reports to determine the cause of death. No case has been registered yet in the matter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/mother-and-son-found-dead-in-east-delhi-cops-suspect-they-were-strangled-101621534844641.html
21-05-2021||Delhi||Over 300 Covid-19 cheats arrested in Delhi in 35 days||Over 800 oxygen concentrators, 557 vials of remdesivir, 288 oxygen cylinders and over 680 pulse oximeters — these were among the 3,267 Covid-19 treatment-related medical essentials that the Delhi Police have seized from over 300 people arrested on charges of cheating, hoarding and black marketing over the past five weeks, shows data.The arrests and seizures have been made in 601 first information reports (FIRs) registered between April 13 and May 18. Of these, 492 cases pertained to cheating by individuals as well as organised groups on the pretext of providing products essential for the treatment of Covid-19 patients.Instances of hoarding and black marketing of oxygen cylinders and oxygen concentrators were most frequent between mid-April and the first week of May, when Covid-19 cases were at their peak and there was an acute shortage of such products in the city, said a police officer.However, as the Capital’s Covid-19 graph dips, the data shows also shows a consequent drop in incidents of hoarding and black marketing of oxygen cylinders, oxygen concentrators, medicines and injections used to treat the viral infection.“Apart from filing cases, arresting suspects and recovering the items, we are also releasing the seized goods and sending them to hospitals and Covid care centres with approvals from the courts concerned. We have also been issuing advisories about the kind of cyber frauds taking place during the pandemic,” said Delhi Police spokesperson Chinmoy Biswal.Crime branch and special cell teams, along with forces from Delhi’s 15 police districts, have been tasked to act on complaints of cyber frauds, hoarding and black marketing of such medical essentials.The police data shows that of the 109 cases of hoarding and black marketing, West zone registered the most (38), with South zone (34) next. The Central zone, crime branch and special cell have registered 22, 14 and one case respectively. Similarly, of the 492 cheating cases, West zone topped the list with 230 cases, as South zone filed 211 cases. The Central zone, crime branch and special cell registered 128, 17 and 15 cases each, respectively.Police data shows they had seized 537 fire extinguishers in two separate raids in outer and southwest Delhi. The suspects were allegedly trying to pass them off as oxygen cylinders after painting them black. Additionally, of the 557 seized remdesivir vials, over 200 were fakes, tests showed.“Many individuals and gangs saw the crisis as an opportunity to make money. As desperate people posted SOS messages on social media along with their contact numbers, these fraudsters began tricking them into transferring money by promising to deliver the essentials. However, these items never reached them,” the first police officer quoted said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/over-300-covid-cheats-arrested-in-delhi-in-35-days-101621534784631.html
21-05-2021||Pune||First dose for 45-plus resumes in Pune; no vax drive on Friday||Pune: The first dose vaccination for beneficiaries above the age of 45 years restarted within the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) limits from Thursday. However, beneficiaries trying to book a slot faced many issues.Meanwhile, no vaccination will be done at government hospitals on May 21 due to shortage of vaccine stock, said PMC officials.Rubal Agarwal, additional municipal Commissioner, PMC said that vaccination will not continue on May 21 in government hospitals.“Due to vaccine shortage we are unable to continue the drive on May 21. However, when the doses are available, the process will restart with priority to second dose and first dose beneficiaries,” said Agarwal.She said the vaccination drive will continue on the same lines as carried out on Thursday.“We will give priority to first dose beneficiaries who are HCW, FLW and are above the age of 45 years. Also, second doses for Covishield beneficiaries will be given to those who have completed 84 days since the first dose,” said Agarwal.In the PMC limits, 21 centres were administering Covishield vaccine. These centres were giving both, first and second dose. Around 60 per cent doses were administered by online booking, as per PMC officials. And 20 per cent doses were given to healthcare workers, frontline workers and 45 years and above beneficiaries by on-spot booking. Remaining 20 per cent doses were for beneficiaries with the second dose who have taken the first Covishield dose before February 24.Dr Sanjay Deshmukh, deputy director of health, Pune circle, said that in spite of vaccine crunch, about 20 per cent population in Pune circle is vaccinated. “Till May 20, we are able to vaccinate more than 3.7 million that is, approximately 20% population in Pune circle. In Pune district, over 2.5 million, that is 23% of population is inoculated,” said Deshmukh.On Thursday, there were 15 centres functional in PMC limits which were administering Covaxin. Each center had 150 doses and a second dose was given to beneficiaries who had taken the first dose before April 22. Smita Kakade, a 55-year-old beneficiary, said that her son booked her an appointment for Thursday.“I was lucky enough to get the slot. It is a good thing that vaccination for the first dose has started again for beneficiaries above 45 years of age,” said Kakade.Arun Shinde, a 48-year-old beneficiary who tried booking the slot on Thursday, said that as many beneficiaries were trying to book a slot, the slot got filled quickly.“It was very difficult to book an appointment at a centre as there was a lot of rush. I could not get a slot on Thursday. But will try again the next day,” said Shinde.However, even on Thursday, many second dose beneficiaries were turned away from the vaccination centres as they have yet to complete the 84 days from the first dose.Asmita Joshi, a 52-year-old beneficiary, said that she was asked to come again later after completing 84 days from the first dose.“I have completed 60 days from the first dose. It is extremely frustrating to go back from the vaccination centre after booking the appointment and standing in line. Earlier, there was no vaccination stock available. And now the central government has changed the guidelines. I had to apply for leave at work to come to the centre today,” said Joshi.Vax driveOn Thursday, 4,579 beneficiaries from PMC and 1,680 beneficiaries from Pune rural were inoculated. However, there was no vaccination drive in PCMC on Thursday. A total of 6,259 beneficiaries were inoculated on Thursday and only 101 centres were functional.

21-05-2021||Pune||22,000 school drivers face loss of livelihood in Pune||Pune: The closure of schools for the past 14 months has left those ferrying students face loss of livelihood for the second consecutive year. Last year, the nationwide lockdown led to shutdown of schools and loss of business for around 22,000 school drivers from Pune and Pimpri-Chinchwad. The driver category comprise school vans, school buses and auto drivers. According to a driver association, most of the drivers have taken up odd jobs like selling vegetables, labour work to eke out a living. Some have doubled up as drivers for other private operators. The association stated that most of the drivers were unable to pay vehicle loan due to lack of earnings. The insurance cover on their vehicles has also expired and the reserve funds they had kept to run their families have been spent on daily expenses. Some opted for alternative businesses and sustained losses, the association stated. Sanjay Dahiwale, a school van driver from Baner, said, “I have been a school van driver for last ten years before the lockdown hit my income. I tried my hand at autorickshaw but failed. I am left on my miniscule savings to look after my parents, wife and three children. It is a tough time and I hope school reopen soon.” Amresh Nalge, an auto driver, said, “I am now working as a Swiggy executive to earn for my family. Parents must also think about us and provide financial help during this distressing times. Since the government has ordered closure of schools, they should compensate us with taxpayers’ money.” School bus driver Arun Shinde said, “I am in the profession for the last 30 years and never faced a crisis like this before. I am currently selling vegetables to feed six members in my family. The state must give us financial assistance.” Bapu Bhave, president, PMC and PCMC Vidyarthi Vahtuk Sangh said, “Some of our drivers are selling fruits and vegetables. They are facing the worst financial crisis. Government must provide funds to save drivers from poverty.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/22000-school-drivers-face-loss-of-livelihood-in-pune-101621515463292.html

21-05-2021||World||Covid-19: California to drop social distancing requirements in June||California’s top health official said Friday that the state no longer will require social distancing and will allow full capacity for businesses when the state reopens on June 15.State health director Dr. Mark Ghaly said that dramatically lower virus cases and increasing vaccinations mean it’s safe for the state to remove nearly all restrictions next month.“We will continue to have some masking," but in conformance with national guidelines, Ghaly said. California’s workforce regulators are separately developing safety rules that will continue to apply to employers, he noted.The state will still recommend that organizers of outdoor events with more than 10,000 people require that attendees provide verification that they have been vaccinated or have tested negative for the coronavirus. Those who can’t or don’t provide the verification should be encouraged to wear masks, Ghaly said.The state will require vaccine verification or negative test results for indoor events with more than 5,000 attendees, but Ghaly said that can be “by self-attestation” with details to come from health officials on how that process will work.State officials do not anticipate that they will create or require a vaccination “passport” or other formal verification, he said.He said California plans to follow U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines on wearing masks and traveling domestically and overseas.That means no more discouraging travel unless there are certain countries where visiting is not advised, and no more voluntary quarantines when people return to California.California was the first state to issue a statewide shutdown as the virus emerged in March 2020 and at the start of 2021 it was the nation’s epicenter for the disease. Nearly 63,000 people have died from the virus in California, the most in any state in the nation.Gov. Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, and state health officials have said for weeks they expected to generally lift most business and social restrictions by June 15. Ghaly said the state remains on track to do so just months after the worse surge abated.The state of 40 million people has administered nearly 35.5 million vaccine doses, and more than three-quarters of residents over age 65 have received at least one dose, he said.“Vaccines are widely available and we’re proud of where we are,” Ghaly said.On some days, newly reported infection cases have fallen below 1,000 and there currently are just over 1,300 people in hospitals with the virus.“We haven’t enjoyed that level since the very early months and weeks of the pandemic,” Ghaly said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-california-to-drop-social-distancing-requirements-in-june-101621620532800.html

But top officials stressed the need to remain vigilant.“We can be glad that (infection rates) have declined so far in recent days and in the last two weeks that we can think about opening steps,” Merkel told reporters in Berlin.“I hope that, after the long time with closures and opportunities they didn't have, that people will treat these opportunities very responsibly,” she added. “The virus has not disappeared.”The country’s disease control agency reported 8,769 newly confirmed Covid-19 cases Thursday and 226 deaths. The country has reported 87,128 virus-related deaths since the start of the pandemic.State authorities have pushed vigorously to reopen hospitality and tourism for the three-day weekend, despite misgivings from federal officials.“It feels good to finally get a bit of freedom back,” said Christian Klimpke, 48, an account manager who was joined by friends at Berlin's Cafe am Neuen See beer garden.“I lived here now exactly six months. I came here the day that bars closed, said Luke Siglmans, 29, who is originally from Amsterdam. ”So it’s amazing to finally drink a real draft German beer on a terrace. So I am really happy.”Merkel said continuing to wear masks and observe social distancing is essential. “We must take care,” she said.But “I believe that, with the necessary responsibility and care that hopefully many — most people — will take, we won't have to talk about having to shut down again.”Health Minister Jens Spahn said Friday the government was closely watching the spread in Britain of a virus variant first detected in India, and would decide during the day whether to impose further travel restrictions for the UK. By early evening, though, there was no word of any changes.About 40% of the population in Germany has received at least one dose of Covid-19 vaccine so far. About one in eight — more than 10 million people — have been fully vaccinated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/germany-lifts-more-covid-19-restrictions-chancellor-merkel-urges-caution-101621618438705.html

21-05-2021||World||Canada extends suspension of flights from India till June 21||Canada has extended its suspension of direct flights from India for an additional 30 days, till June 21.This was announced by Canadian minister of transport Omar Alghabra on Friday, a day prior to the original suspension period ending. “Until June 21, we are suspending all commercial and private passenger flights arriving in Canada from India and Pakistan for an additional 30 days,” he said.He tweeted that the “temporary flight restrictions on India and Pakistan have significantly reduced the risk of importing cases and new variants. We are extending these temporary measures to protect the health and safety of Canadians”.The suspension was originally announced on April 22 and was to expire on Saturday, May 22. The move by the Canadian government was precipitated by increasing pressure upon it to act on this matter after multiple cases of the B.1.617 variant of Covid-19, which was first detected in India were reported in Canada.Transport Canada had issued its directive last month and elaborated that passengers from India who arrive via an indirect route, through a third country, have to provide a pre-departure negative coronavirus test result from the last port before continuing their journey. Those conditions continue to apply with regard to extension.In a statement released by Transport Canada in April, the ministry responsible for aviation stated, “These measures will help manage the elevated risk of imported cases of Covid-19 and variants of concern into Canada during a time of increasing pressure on our health care system.”Air Canada had already announced last week that it only accepting bookings for its direct flights from India beginning in late June, in anticipation of a possible extension of the air travel suspension.Prior to the suspension of flights, both Air Canada and Air India were operating almost daily flights between the Canadian cities of Toronto and Vancouver and New Delhi in an air corridor arrangement that came into effect last summer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canada-extends-suspension-of-flights-from-india-till-june-21-101621619512244.html

Biden referred to his six calls with Netanyahu during the 11-day conflict, and “intensive high-level discussions, hour by hour, literally” that US officials had with Egypt and the Palestinian Authority with the goal of “avoiding the sort of prolonged conflict we’ve seen in previous years”.The United States did not talk to Hamas, which controls Gaza, as it considers it a terrorist organisation. Egypt engaged Hamas.“I believe the Palestinians and Israelis equally deserve to live safely and securely and to enjoy equal measures of freedom, prosperity, and democracy,” Biden said, adding, “My administration will continue our quiet and relentless diplomacy towards that end. I believe we have a genuine opportunity to make progress, and I’m committed to working for it.”But, Biden was clear he is standing with a long-time ally, by reiterating US support for Israel’s right to defend itself and said he had assured Netanyahu all necessary help in upgrading the Iron Dome defence system, which has been jointly developed by the US and Israel.The American president also pledged to work with the United Nations and other international organisations to provide “ rapid humanitarian assistance”.“We will do this in full partnership with the Palestinian Authority - not Hamas, the Authority - in a manner that does not permit Hamas to simply restock its military arsenal,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/gaza-ceasefire-presents-genuine-opportunity-for-progress-biden-101621617230945.html
21-05-2021||World||Canada extends ban on passenger flights from India, Pakistan by 30 days||Canada has extended its ban on passenger flights from India and Pakistan by 30 days to June 21 as part of a campaign to fight Covid-19, Transport Minister Omar Alghabra said on Friday.Alghabra said Canada had seen "a significant reduction" in coronavirus infections among arriving airline passengers since Ottawa first announced the bans on April 22 as the number of cases in India soared. The move does not affect cargo flights."These ongoing measures will remain in place to help protect Canadians and to manage the elevated risk of imported cases of Covid-19 and variants of concern," he told a briefing.As vaccinations pick up across Canada, the number of daily new cases has dropped by 25% since last week and it now averages around 5,000, deputy chief public health officer Howard Njoo told the briefing.Canada has so far recorded a total of 25,111 deaths from Covid-19 and more than 1.3 million cases overall.The ban on Indian and Pakistani flights is part of a series of restrictions Canada has imposed to lower the transmission of the virus, including curbs on non-essential travel across the long land border with the United States.Canada said on Thursday that the measure, first applied in March 2020, would be extended by another month to June 21. Government officials said they were in no hurry to open up travel across the border, citing the need to protect public health.Ontario, the most populous of the 10 provinces, announced on Friday that it would begin administering second doses of AstraZeneca Inc's Covid-19 vaccine after earlier halting roll out due to concerns about rare blood clots.The province has tens of thousands of AstraZeneca doses set to expire at the end of May.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canada-extends-ban-on-passenger-flights-from-india-pakistan-by-30-days-report-101621614170348.html
21-05-2021||World||Boko Haram chief Abubakar Shekau 'badly wounded': What we know||In the 12 years since Nigeria's jihadist insurgency erupted in the northeast, Boko Haram leader Abubakar Shekau has been reported dead several times, only to reappear.On Wednesday, intelligence sources say, rival Islamic State-allied jihadists launched an attack on Shekau's faction in their stronghold in the Sambisa forest in Borno state.Shekau was seriously wounded after trying to kill himself to evade capture by the IS jihadists who surrounded him after a series of battles, the sources said.Nigerian media was filled with speculation that the man who made international headlines for kidnapping nearly 300 schoolgirls in 2014 might finally be dead.But 24 hours after the news broke, the army was still investigating and details about what happened and where Shekau may be remain unclear.Here is what we know.- Who are the factions? -More than 40,000 people have been killed and over two million displaced from their homes by the conflict in northeast Nigeria since 2009, and fighting has spread to parts of neighbouring Chad, Cameroon and Niger.Since 2016, two rival factions emerged from the Boko Haram movement after disagreements over Shekau's indiscriminate attacks on Muslim civilians and use of children and women as suicide bombers.On one side, Shekau's Boko Haram faction, known formally as Jama'tu Ahlis Sunna Lidda'awati wal-Jihad or JAS, was based in the Sambisa forest. It also operates in the far northern border of neighbouring Cameroon as well as frontier areas of Chad and Niger.The other was Islamic State in West Africa Province or ISWAP with its stronghold in Alagarno forest and areas of Lake Chad, a vast body of water with scattered islands.Both groups target Nigeria's armed forces and those from states bordering northeast Nigeria. But sporadic clashes have also erupted between the two factions over influence and territory.According to the local intelligence sources, a new round of infighting erupted in April during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan.Boko Haram fighters ambushed an ISWAP brigade as they transported weapons to one of their main camps, sources said. Several ISWAP men were killed.In retaliation, ISWAP launched an attack on a Boko Haram camp located on Lake Chad. Both sides suffered losses. But, the sources said, ISWAP took the fight to Boko Haram directly in Sambisa forest located further south.- What happened in Sambisa? -According to details from two intelligence sources, on Monday a convoy of ISWAP trucks mounted with machine guns entered the Sambisa forest area.One group headed directly to the Boko Haram camp in Sabilul Huda, where Shekau had sought refuge. His faction had recently been weakened by air strikes by the military.ISWAP fighters managed to neutralise his guards and surrounded the house where Shekau had been holed up, the sources said.What happened next is not fully clear, but Shekau was seriously wounded when he tried to kill himself to avoid being taken alive.Intelligence sources said Shekau shot himself in the chest and was later rescued unconscious by some of his men and taken to an unknown location."The truth is he may hardly survive his wounds," one source said.- Dead or wounded? -If sources are unclear about whether Shekau survived, the jihadist commander has surprised analysts before after multiple reports of his death over the years.The Nigerian army spokesman could not confirm any of the details and said an investigation was still ongoing.Neither ISWAP or Boko Haram have released any communique about the attack on Sambisa or the whereabouts of Shekau.- What happens next? -Whether he is seriously wounded or dead, the loss of Shekau would be a huge blow to his Boko Haram faction where he was a central figure for years, analysts said.ISWAP had already became the more dominant force in Nigeria's northeast showing its capacity to carry out complex attacks on the armed forces.Its fighters have recently overrun several army bases.Taking Shekau's Sambisa forest stronghold would allow ISWAP to consolidate territory it already holds in Alagarno forest and southern Lake Chad, potentially allowing the group to control roads leading to the Borno state capital Maiduguri.While some pro-Shekau brigades along the Cameroon border and in Niger and Chad may want autonomy, ISWAP may now access a pool of Shekau's fighters and a partial reunification may be in the works, said Vincent Foucher, a fellow at French National Centre for Science Research."Surely it is under discussion, all these guys are connected, they know each other and there must be negotiations going on. There are still some unknowns but what is clear is that it is a big win for ISWAP," he said."A lot of people are happy to see Shekau dead, but it is not very good news if ISWAP becomes the single jihadist force in the area."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/boko-haram-chief-abubakar-shekau-badly-wounded-what-we-know-101621609593178.html
21-05-2021||World||UK's Covid-19 cases from variant found in India rise to 3,424||The number of U.K. cases of a worrying coronavirus variant from India more than doubled for a second week as authorities also monitor a new mutation of the virus, adding fresh doubt to U.K. plans to fully unlock the economy.Health officials have now detected 3,424 cases of the B1.617.2 variant, also known as VOC-21APR-02, Public Health England said Thursday in a statement. That’s up from 1,313 last week, and 520 a week earlier. They’re also investigating a mutation called VUI-21MAY-01, with 49 cases logged so far.Scientists at PHE say there is currently no evidence to suggest vaccines will be less effective in protecting people against severe illness from the India variant, but believe it could be more transmissible than the fast-spreading Kent variant that led to the country’s third lockdown in January.Prime Minister Boris Johnson said last week that he was “anxious” about the Indian variant, and warned that it could affect the country’s plans to reopen the remaining bits of the economy from lockdown on June 21.Those concerns prompted authorities to alter the country’s vaccination program, shortening the interval between doses. And even though stage 3 of the government’s reopening plan went ahead Monday, the fast spread of the new variant remain a cause for concern.“As we start to get back to normal life, it is very important that we do not become complacent,” Health Security Agency Chief Executive Officer Jenny Harries said in PHE’s statement. “All of us need to remain responsible and vigilant.”Nevertheless, ministers and officials this week have struck an increasingly optimistic tone, with the premier saying Wednesday that he has “increasing confidence” vaccines are working against all coronavirus variants. More than 70% of U.K. adults have now had at least one dose of vaccine, making the country’s program one of the most advanced in the world.Justice Secretary Robert Buckland told Sky News on Friday that caution was the “watchword” when it came to reopening the economy further. He said that even if social distancing rules were lifted as planned, he would continue to wear a mask if he had signs of a cold.Most of the 49 cases of the new variant under investigation are in Yorkshire and the Humber, in Northern England, according to PHE. “There is currently no evidence that this variant causes more severe disease or renders the vaccines currently deployed any less effective,” it said.On Monday, international holidays were allowed again, and pubs and restaurants were allowed to serve customers indoors. The government has said the final stage of reopening -- which will be June 21 at the earliest, is dependent on the evolution of the virus.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uks-covid-19-cases-from-variant-found-in-india-rise-to-3424-101621608166771.html
21-05-2021||World||Covid-19 herd immunity may be unrealistic: South African experts||Achieving herd immunity against the Covid-19 may be unrealistic due to the mutations of the virus that causes it, South African experts have said, as they called for long-term vaccination strategies amid uncertainty about current vaccine efficacy.“Many governments are targeting herd immunity, but it is unachievable in the same way it is unachievable for flu,” said Professor Alex van den Heever, health and social security systems specialist of the University of the Witwatersrand (Wits) School of Governance.Van den Heever was speaking on an expert panel hosted by leading managed care provider and medical scheme administrator Agility Health.The other panellists were virology expert Prof Sim Mayaphi and clinical pharmacology expert Dr Jacques Snyman.“If we are vaccinated this year, this could mean we don’t necessarily have immunity for the strains that emerge next year,” said Snyman.“Various vaccines are targeting various sites of the virus. That particular antibody will only be effective as long as that part of the virus has not mutated.“The Johnson & Johnson and Pfizer vaccines are only partially effective, but they reduce the likelihood and severity of illness,” he added.Snyman said nobody knew whether the current vaccines would protect in the future.“The next strain may not be affected by the antibodies we have vaccinated for. It is therefore likely that long-term vaccination strategies will be required,” Snyman said.Mayaphi, who is head of the Department of Medical Virology at the University of Pretoria, said the pandemic had caught everyone by surprise, as he called for better planning to prevent the next pandemic.“Surveillance programmes are needed to look at the animal-human interface of viruses and the prevalence of viruses in animal hosts to see if we can predict these viruses being transmitted from host animals to humans. We already have many examples of this, including Covid-19,” Mayaphi said.Van der Heever also expressed concern about the late discovery that Covid-19 was an airborne virus.“This poses the most extreme risk for a pandemic (as) it is the fastest (way in which) it could be transmitted.“That is the one that is going to overrun testing and tracing - it’s going to overrun border controls,” he said.Data by Johns Hopkins University on Friday showed 3,431,904 deaths and 139,963,964 cases globally due to the coronavirus.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-herd-immunity-may-be-unrealistic-south-african-experts-101621607693806.html
21-05-2021||World||China built villages near LAC, boosted military infra to keep up pressure on India||China has combined a policy of building villages close to the Line of Actual Control (LAC) from Xinjiang to Bhutan with simultaneously bolstering military facilities and dual-use infrastructure such as airports to keep up the pressure on India, people familiar with developments have said. Details of the way in which China systematically pumped in money for almost a decade to build “villages of moderate prosperity” along the 4,000-km border of Tibet, most of which aligns with the LAC, emerged in a new policy paper on Tibet Autonomous Region (TAR) released by the State Council Information Office on Friday. By the end of 2020, many border villages in the remote region were better connected to highways, and all had access to mobile communication, according to the policy paper titled Tibet Since 1951: Liberation, Development and Prosperity. Indian security agencies too have gathered extensive information on the campaign to speed up building of border villages along the LAC, ranging from Xinjiang to Arunachal Pradesh. Work on houses and roads to these villages is being completed at a rapid pace even during the pandemic, the people cited above said on condition of anonymity. “Residents are moved into the villages, mostly located in disputed regions, from other areas. Some are at a short distance from strategic features on the Indian side of the LAC,” one of the people cited above said. “We have received inputs on such villages coming up on the western sector of the LAC in Xinjiang and Tibet and the eastern sector in Arunachal Pradesh. The worrying aspect is the new pressure on Bhutan in the eastern sector of its border with China, which appears to be aimed at making Bhutan give up territory in the Doklam region,” the person added. The pressure on Bhutan is being mounted apparently with an eye on the planned 25th round of boundary talks with China, dates for which are yet to be decided, the people said. Several villages have come up in the tri-junction between India, Bhutan and China, and a new village is said to have come up close to Longju, near Arunachal Pradesh, which witnessed the first clash between India and China in 1959, according to India-based Tibet expert Claude Arpi. The policy paper said 118,800 km of highways were built to provide access to all administrative villages in TAR. Ninety-four per cent of towns and 76% of administrative villages have direct access to asphalt and concrete roads. “A number of feeder airports have been built, including Bamda Airport in Qamdo, Mainling Airport in Nyingchi, Peace Airport in Xigaze, and Gunsa Airport in Ngari,” the paper said. Many new airports are located close to border areas, especially with India. The people cited above said Chinese authorities also have plans to build three more airports in Lhunze, Tingri and Burang counties as part of an expansion project that will involve the construction of a second runway at Lhasa Gonggar airport. “These are all dual-use infrastructure and can be used by the military in contingencies,” said a second person. At the same time, the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) air force is retiring its ageing Chengdu J-7 jets at an air brigade in Lintao under the Western Theatre Command, which covers Tibet and Xinjiang, and replacing them with Shenyang J-16 and Chengdu J-20 jets. “This will bring in more capable aircraft for operations along the LAC, where the older jets can’t perform very well,” the second person said. There are also reports of China developing a unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) specifically for use in Tibet. The UAV reportedly completed its first flight at Gar Gunsa in TAR. “The UAV took off from an elevation of 4,700 metres and completed its task of patrolling, control and search in the Kailash mountain region,” the second person said. The policy paper’s statement on border villages matches recent reports, many based on independent satellite imagery, that show China is building villages along the LAC to bolster its contested territorial claims. “Under the guidance of the (Communist Party of China) Party Central Committee, financial input has been increasing year by year for border development in Tibet. Particularly since 2012, border villages, townships and counties in Tibet have been granted more preferential state policies on infrastructure construction...,” the paper said. The paper didn’t give details on the number of new villages or how many received financial and infrastructure help. However, a 2019 report in the official TAR news portal said the government plans to build 624 “well off” villages and farms on Tibet’s borders. The policy clearly tallies with what President Xi Jinping had said in 2013. On March 9, 2013, when joining a delegation from Tibet in a panel discussion at the National People’s Congress, Xi had said: “To govern the country well we must first govern the frontiers well, and to govern the frontiers well we must first ensure stability in Tibet.” In 2017, Xi also wrote a letter to Tibetan herdsmen living near the Arunachal Pradesh border to “set down roots” and safeguard “Chinese territory”. TAR has the longest international border with India, besides shorter frontiers with Nepal and Bhutan, and the shortest with Myanmar. China has land boundary disputes with India and Bhutan that haven’t been resolved despite protracted negotiations over decades. Sameer Patil, fellow for international security studies at Gateway House, said: “China had the first mover advantage by beefing up border infrastructure on its side some years ago. Then the Indian side began strengthening infrastructure on its side. The Chinese side’s thinking appears to be that they were losing the advantage and they’re now undertaking a host of measures retain that advantage.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-built-villages-near-lac-boosted-military-infra-to-keep-up-pressure-on-india-101621607030306.html
21-05-2021||World||'Share dollars and doses': Richer nations try to tackle vaccine inequalities||Major drugmakers and rich nation leaders faced up on Friday to the startling global imbalance in fighting COVID-19 and made big pledges to up supplies of cut-price vaccines to poorer regions.Lavishly-funded mass inoculation campaigns are helping the West and others slash infections, but few shots have reached poorer nations where the virus is still raging, sometimes uncontrollably, drawing accusations of "vaccine apartheid".More than 80% of the first billion shots went to wealthy countries, compared to just 0.2% for low-income nations, US philanthropist Bill Gates told a special Group of 20 summit focussing on the global health crisis."If we do not close this immense gap, more people will die needlessly. There are two immediate actions countries can take: share dollars and doses," he said.The summit was to call for voluntary licensing and technology transfers to boost vaccine production, but will sidestep a push from the United States and other nations to waive valuable patents, a joint declaration showed.The European Union promised to invest 1 billion euros ($1.2 billion) to set up vaccination manufacturing hubs in Africa.At the Italian- and EU-hosted virtual summit, Pfizer and BioNTech also pledged to make available 1 billion cut-price doses this year to poorer nations. Another 1 billion vaccines would be provided next year, Pfizer boss Albert Bourla told the summit.Johnson & Johnson promised 200 million doses of its vaccine to COVAX, a vaccine-sharing programme co-led by the World Health Organization (WHO)."As we prepare for the next pandemic, our priority must be to ensure that we all overcome the current one together. We must vaccinate the world, and do it fast," Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi said.CHINA PLEDGES BILLIONSChina's President Xi Jinping pledged $3 billion in aid over the next three years to help developing countries recover from the pandemic and proposed setting up an international forum to promote fair distribution of vaccines.US President Joe Biden was not among the speakers, organisers said. His administration has backed calls from many developing countries for a waiver of patents for COVID-19 vaccines, in the hope that would boost production and allow for more equitable distribution.However, the final declaration seen by Reuters did not mention such a mechanism. It has been contested by some European nations, who have instead called for the removal of US trade barriers that they consider the main bottleneck preventing a ramping up of vaccine production.European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said existing global agreements already allowed countries to force companies to share their licences in an emergency.She added that the EU will make a proposal to facilitate the use of those clauses and added that Europe would donate at least 100 million doses to poorer nations by the end of the year, including 30 million each from France and Germany.In their declaration, the world leaders noted the importance of the so-called ACT-Accelerator, a tool of the WHO to distribute COVID-19 vaccines, drugs and tests across the world.However, dashing initial expectations, the declaration did not include a clear commitment to fully fund the programme, which is still $19 billion short.Leaders agreed that one option to help poorer nations was sharing vaccines that wealthy countries have already purchased, but there were no firm commitments on this in the final text.The COVAX program, which is dedicated to equitable global vaccine distribution, was mentioned as one option for providing donated doses to countries.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/share-dollars-and-doses-richer-nations-try-to-tackle-vaccine-inequalities-101621605546378.html

"It is imperative for us to reject vaccine nationalism and make vaccines more accessible and affordable for developing countries."China has already supplied 300 million vaccine doses to the rest of the world and will provide more to the best of its ability, he added.Furthermore, Beijing supports the transfer of technologies from its vaccine companies to other developing countries and trying out joint production with them, Xi said.The forum on cooperation would be "for vaccine-developing and producing countries, companies and other stakeholders to explore ways of promoting fair and equitable distribution of vaccines around the world," Xi said.He called on major countries to take up the responsibility to provide more vaccines to developing nations in urgent need.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/xi-pledges-3-bn-covid-aid-for-poor-nations-proposes-vaccine-cooperation-forum-101621605554427.html

21-05-2021||World||Study finds Iran using crypto mining to reduce impact of sanctions||Around 4.5% of all bitcoin mining takes place in Iran, allowing the country to earn hundreds of millions of dollars in cryptocurrencies that can be used to buy imports and lessen the impact of sanctions, a new study has found.At its current level of mining, Iran's bitcoin production would amount to revenues close $1 billion a year, according to figures from blockchain analytics firm Elliptic.Iranian officials could not immediately be reached for comment.The United States imposes an almost total economic embargo on Iran, including a ban on all imports including those from the country's oil, banking and shipping sectors.While, exact figures are "very challenging to determine", Elliptic estimates are based on data collected from bitcoin miners by the Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance up to April 2020, and statements from Iran's state-controlled power generation company in January that up to 600 MW of electricity was being consumed by miners.Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are created through a process known as mining, where powerful computers compete with each other to solve complex mathematical problems. The process is energy intensive, often relying electricity generated by fossil fuels which Iran is rich in.The country's central bank prohibits the trading of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies mined overseas, although the currencies are widely available on the black market, according to local media reports.Iran officially recognized crypto mining as an industry in recent years, offering it cheap power and requiring miners to sell their mined bitcoins to the central bank. The prospect of cheap power has attracted more miners, particularly from China, into the country. Teheran allows cryptocurrencies mined in Iran to pay for imports of authorised goods."Iran has recognised that bitcoin mining represents an attractive opportunity for a sanctions-hit economy suffering from a shortage of hard cash, but with a surplus of oil and natural gas," the study finds.The electricity being used by miners in Iran would require the equivalent of around 10 million barrels of crude oil each year to generate, around 4% of total Iranian oil exports in 2020, according to the study."The Iranian state is therefore effectively selling its energy reserves on the global markets, using the Bitcoin mining process to bypass trade embargoes," the study reads."Iran-based miners are paid directly in Bitcoin, which can then be used to pay for imports - allowing sanctions on payments through Iranian financial institutions to be circumvented."Financial firms that have started offering cryptocurrency services, particularly in the United States, should consider potential sanctions they are exposed to due to Iranian bitcoin mining, Elliptic said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/study-finds-iran-using-crypto-mining-to-reduce-impact-of-sanctions-101621601475889.html
21-05-2021||World||UK govt mulls action against BBC after Princess Diana cover-up||The British government on Friday warned of potential action against the BBC, after unprecedented criticism from the royal family about its use of deception to secure a 1995 interview with princess Diana, piling pressure on the corporation as it fights attacks on several fronts.Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden, whose brief includes media, said an independent inquiry into the affair highlighted "damning failings at the heart of the BBC", which is publicly funded.Ministers would now "consider whether further governance reforms at the BBC are needed", as talks approach for renewal of its royal charter covering its running and regulation, he added.Diana's interview with journalist Martin Bashir was a global scoop, and saw the princess detail her crumbling marriage to heir-to-the-throne Prince Charles, as well as admitting to adultery.But a retired senior judge on Thursday concluded Bashir had faked documents to falsely claim Diana was being kept tabs on by her closest aides, which persuaded her to take part.Diana and Charles' eldest son and second-in-line to the throne, Prince William, was scathing in his criticism on Thursday, accusing the BBC of failing his mother and the public -- and worsening his parents' relationship.William's younger brother Harry also waded in, adding: "The ripple effect of a culture of exploitation and unethical practices ultimately took her life."Prime Minister Boris Johnson, a former journalist who was once sacked from The Times for making up a quote, said: "I hope very much the BBC will be taking every possible step to make sure that nothing like this ever happens again."- BBC under pressure -The revelations could not have come at a worse time for the BBC, as its annual licence fee funding model comes under ever closer scrutiny.Newer, subscription-based platforms and streaming services have prompted mounting calls for the charge -- currently set at £159 ($226) -- to be scrapped.The BBC is also fighting regular complaints of political bias from all sides, and jealously guards its editorial independence from attempts at government influence.Johnson's government has sought to load BBC senior management with politically sympathetic allies.BBC director-general Tim Davie, who issued a full apology for Bashir's underhand tactics and the corporation's cover-up, once ran for election as a councillor for Johnson's Conservative party.He has reportedly planned to axe some "left-leaning" comedy shows that are said to be biased on issues such as Brexit.GB News, a new 24-hour television news channel soon to launch, is promising to appeal to BBC viewers turned off by claims it is too London-focused and liberal.The report's findings dominated British newspapers on Friday, condemning the BBC for breaking journalistic standards then covering up, as well as "rogue reporter" Bashir, who quit as religion editor last week citing ill health.The BBC's own media editor Amol Rajan on Thursday night said blanket criticism from government ministers to the future king and his brother left the BBC "severely injured, probably scarred"."For an organisation that exists on the whim of public affection and respect, that is a dreadful place for the BBC to be," he said.London's Metropolitan Police, which has previously ruled out a criminal investigation into alleged unlawful activity surrounding the interview, said it would now assess the report "to ensure there is no significant new evidence".William and Harry's criticisms claimed Bashir's deception played into their mother's fears and paranoia in the years leading up to her death in a high-speed car crash while being chased by paparazzi photographers in 1997.- Need for change -Former culture minister Ed Vaizey told Times Radio the BBC had to prove it had changed after a series of scandals, including wrongly implicating a former Tory lawmaker in child sex abuse claims.The Daily Mail suggested the BBC "could face millions of pounds in compensation claims" from those smeared by Bashir, who went on to have a high-profile career on US TV networks.In meetings with Diana's brother Charles Spencer, Bashir showed fake bank statements implying royal staff took money for information on Diana, influencing her words and future choices.Spencer said he could "draw a line" from the interview to her death, suggesting it led her to reject security protection.Prince William said the way the interview was solicited meant the show gave a "false narrative" and the BBC should not air it again.But the Evening Standard's royal editor, Robert Jobson, questioned this, however, telling Sky News Diana had a "very clear narrative" and "wanted to get her point of view across".||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-govt-mulls-action-against-bbc-after-princess-diana-coverup-101621599063219.html

They are dealing with these disturbances in order to contain the situation," he added.A Reuters eyewitness said Palestinians threw stones and Molotov cocktails towards police near the Al-Aqsa Mosque complex, which sits atop the Old City plateau known to Muslims worldwide as al-Haram al-Sharif, or The Noble Sanctuary, and to Jews as Temple Mount. Police also hurled stun grenades at a group of Palestinians marching through the grounds.The site is one of the most sensitive sites in the Middle East conflict and a buildup of clashes there earlier in May touched off the Israel-Hamas conflict when the militant group began firing rockets from Gaza in response and Israel countered with air strikes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/palestinians-clash-with-israeli-police-in-jerusalem-hours-after-ceasefire-101621598901842.html
21-05-2021||World||Japan gives nod to more Covid-19 vaccines to speed up vaccination campaign||Japan expanded a state of emergency to cover the southern island of Okinawa on Friday, as authorities approved two more coronavirus vaccines to speed a lagging inoculation campaign.The newly approved vaccines, from Moderna Inc and AstraZeneca PLC, will join the one co-developed by Pfizer Inc and BioNTech SE in a vaccination drive that began in mid-February.AstraZeneca's vaccine will not be used for the time being, the company said. Earlier media said the government would hold off on its use because of concerns over blood clots and bleeding in some."We'll do our utmost in working to ensure that all elderly people who seek vaccinations can get their two shots by the end of July," Economy Minister Yasutoshi Nishimura, who is leading the coronavirus response effort, told reporters.Japan has vaccinated just 4.1% of its population, according to Reuters' global tracker, the slowest rate among the world's larger, rich countries.In contrast to some other Group of Seven (G7) nations that are beginning to end pandemic-busting lockdown measures, much of Japan remains under emergency curbs amid a fourth wave of infections.On Friday, the government added Okinawa to its list of nine prefectures placed under the strictest emergency measures. They include Tokyo, where the Olympic Games are due to start in about two months.JAPAN INC, PUBLIC FEARS OVER OLYMPICSFears that the Olympics would turn into a super-spreader event have persisted, ensuring opposition by the majority of the public to holding the Games this year.A Reuters corporate survey https://jp.reuters.com/article/us-olympics-2020-japan-companies-poll/fretting-about-covid-most-japan-firms-say-olympics-should-be-cancelled-or-postponed-reuters-poll-idUSKCN2D12SZ published on Friday showed nearly 70% of Japanese firms also want the Games either cancelled or postponed.The state of emergency for Okinawa would run for about a month, from Sunday through June 20, Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga said, beyond the May 31 end-point of the other nine.It is the third consecutive week that Japan is expanding the state of emergency. With about 695,000 infections and 12,000 deaths, Japan is finding its medical system increasingly strained by a spike in more infectious variants.With the Olympics starting on July 23, Tokyo is under particular pressure to cut infections and the strain on the medical system and emerge from the emergency on schedule this month.After a 30-minute meeting with Suga on Friday, Tokyo Governor Yuriko Koike said she sought vaccine supplies for the capital, which begins mass vaccinations next week.The two agreed to work towards a "safe and secure" Olympics this summer, they later told reporters.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/japan-gives-nod-to-more-covid-19-vaccines-to-speed-up-vaccination-campaign-101621597476856.html
21-05-2021||World||How BBC used 'deceit' to interview Princess Diana? All you need to know about inquiry findings||The BBC has been facing scathing criticism from the British royal family after an inquiry found that the sensational 1995 interview with Princess Diana was obtained through deceit and the broadcaster covered up the deception. Prince William, Diana’s eldest son and second-in-line to the throne, called the inquiring findings “extremely concerning”, adding that the “lurid and false claims” about the royal family played on “her [Diana’s] fears and fuelled paranoia.”The interview with Diana, Princess of Wales, was aired as a part of the BBC documentary series ‘Panorama’ on November 20, 1995. During the interview, Diana shared details of her unhappy marriage to Prince Charles, admitted to an affair, and said that there were "three of us" in her marriage, referring to Camilla Parker Bowles, whom the Prince of Wales would later marry.It was a sensational triumph for the BBC and journalist Martin Bashir who took the interview.In 1997, two years after the interview, Princess Diana died in a car crash alongside her partner, Dodi Fayed, and driver, Henri Paul, while being chased by paparazzi on motorcycles.While Buckingham Palace was blindsided by the interview, Diana’s brother, Charles Spencer, questioned the tactics of Bashir to win that interview. After 9th Earl Spencer went public with the allegations, the BBC last year commissioned an independent inquiry, headed by retired judge Lord Dyson.Also Read | 'I was afraid': Prince Harry, Oprah Winfrey discuss mental healthAccording to the inquiry report, Bashir had shown fake bank statements to Spencer, falsely suggesting that two senior aides were being paid to keep her under surveillance. Dyson found that Bashir used fake documents to deceive Spencer into introducing the journalist to the princes."It is my view that the deceitful way the interview was obtained substantially influenced what my mother said. The interview was a major contribution to making my parents' relationship worse and has since hurt countless others," William said in a statement after the findings of the inquiry were published on Thursday.However, Dyson also noted that Diana was keen on the idea of a television interview and she would “probably have agreed to be interviewed by any experienced and reputable reporter in whom she had confidence even without the intervention of Mr Bashir.”Here are some of the key findings of the inquiry:||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/how-princess-diana-was-tricked-into-bbc-interview-all-you-need-to-know-101621596891202.html

21-05-2021||World||'I was afraid': Prince Harry, Oprah Winfrey discuss mental health||For Harry, returning to London to attend Prince Philip's funeral last month meant once more facing a place where he felt trapped and hunted by cameras. It would be a test of his ability to cope with the anxiety that was bubbling up again.“I was worried about it, I was afraid,” Harry told The Associated Press during a recent joint interview with Oprah Winfrey to promote a mental-health series they co-created and co-executive produced for Apple TV .He was able to work through any trepidation using coping skills learned in therapy.“It definitely made it a lot easier, but the heart still pounds,” said Harry, the Duke of Sussex and grandson of Britain's Queen Elizabeth II and her late husband Philip.In “The Me You Can’t See,” which debuted Thursday night on Apple’s streaming service, Harry reveals that he first saw a therapist approximately four years ago at the encouragement of then-girlfriend Meghan. They'd had an argument and she recognized his anger seemed misplaced.The series is another chapter in the unprecedented openness that Harry has brought to his life and his royal family relationships since stepping away from his duties and moving with his wife to California. In March, he and Meghan gave a headline-making interview to Winfrey that elicited a rare public response from the palace.Harry's self-work may be relatively recent but he and older brother William, The Duke of Cambridge, have long championed the importance of mental health. In 2016, Harry, William and his wife Catherine, the Duchess of Cambridge, launched Heads Together, an initiative to speak up and not be ashamed to ask for help when mental well-being is at stake.Their collective work led to interactions with people across the globe, from all walks of life, and they recognized a common thread. “Sharing your story in order to be able to save a life or help others is absolutely critical," said Harry.Harry is practicing what he preaches and laying bare his own struggles with trauma and grief. He describes in “The Me You Can't See,” the instances of feeling helpless as a young boy while riding in the car with his mother, Princess Diana, who cried as they were surrounded by paparazzi and she struggled to drive.Years later, Diana was killed in Paris after the car she and friend Dodi Fayed were riding in, crashed during a high-speed chase to flee cameras. Harry was 12 and suppressed his own feelings to meet the mourning public gathered outside Kensington Palace.Cameras rolled and snapped away as he walked behind her casket to Diana's funeral, alongside William, father Prince Charles, Philip and Diana’s brother Charles Spencer.Harry’s revelations coincide with Queen Elizabeth's official confirmation a few months ago that he and Meghan will not return to their senior royal positions within the family, following a one-year trial period.The couple now lives about 90 minutes north of Los Angeles in an exclusive area near Santa Barbara called Montecito. They count Winfrey, Katy Perry and Orlando Bloom as neighbors. The paparazzi still lurks but it's less intense than in Los Angeles.This new, outspoken prince who shares his emotions is a contrast to the “never complain, never explain," “keep calm and carry on” mantras that are part of the prototypical British way.The British tabloids have had a field day picking apart his statements. Some royal commentators have also cried foul over a contradiction between seeking a private life yet granting interviews and revealing family strife.Harry appears to be cautious in choosing what he wants to speak about, and neither he nor Meghan seem interested in sharing their every move with the world. They do not operate a social media account.He is undeterred by naysayers, he says, because there's a greater good in being honest about his struggles. “I see it as a responsibility. I don’t find it hard to open up," he said. "Knowing the impacts and the positive reaction that it has for so many people that also suffer, I do believe it’s a responsibility.”Winfrey was already working with Apple to develop a series on mental health when a conversation with Harry sparked the idea to join forces.“We were having a conversation and I asked him, ‘What are the two most important issues you think facing the world today?’ And he said immediately, ‘climate change and mental health.’ She mentioned the project and Winfrey recalls him later saying , ‘Oh, by the way, if you ever need any help with that … give me a call.’ And I went and turned around and said, ‘What’s your number?’”Winfrey's existing partnership with Apple created a rare opportunity to reach the vast number of people who use the company’s devices, Harry said.“If that’s in a billion pockets on a billion screens, then maybe we can really start a global conversation about this,” he said.Winfrey recalls some of her own childhood traumas in “The Me You Can’t See.” In addition to her and Harry’s stories, the series also features accounts from both regular people and celebrities including Lady Gaga and Glenn Close, who speak candidly about their own experiences with mental illness.Winfrey said Harry pushed to present a global perspective. “This has got to be a world thing and not just a US thing,’” she recounted him saying, adding: "I think we’ve accomplished that really well.”Harry jokes he's “slowly catching up” to Winfrey's decades of inner-work and encouragement of others to do the same whether on “The Oprah Winfrey Show" or her “Super Soul Sunday" interviews on OWN. Even Winfrey said she's had a lot to learn.“I have dealt personally with one of the girls from my school (Oprah Winfrey Leadership Academy for Girls in South Africa), who had schizophrenia," Winfrey said. “Only after hearing the doctor say that ‘it’s a diagnosis. It’s not your life, it’s not who you are,’ that I had my great awakening about it. … ‘That is not you. You are a person who has a diagnosis of schizophrenia.’ That is powerful."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/i-was-afraid-prince-harry-oprah-winfrey-discuss-mental-health-101621594081573.html
21-05-2021||World||Palestinians claim victory as Gaza truce faces early test||Palestinians rallied by the thousands early Friday after a cease-fire took effect in the latest Gaza war, with many viewing it as costly but clear victory for the Islamic militant group Hamas over a far more powerful Israel.The 11-day war left more than 200 dead — the vast majority Palestinians — and brought widespread devastation to the already impoverished Hamas-ruled Gaza Strip. But the rocket barrages that brought life to a standstill in much of Israel were seen by many Palestinians as a bold response to perceived Israeli abuses in Jerusalem, the emotional heart of the conflict.The truce faces an early test on Friday, when tens of thousands of Palestinians attend weekly prayers at the Al-Aqsa Mosque compound in Jerusalem, a flashpoint holy site revered by Jews and Muslims. Celebratory protests could spark confrontations with Israeli police, setting in motion another cycle of escalation like the one that led to the war.Thousands took to the streets of Gaza as the cease-fire took hold at 2 a.m. Young men waved Palestinian and Hamas flags, passed out sweets, honked horns and set off fireworks. Spontaneous celebrations also broke out in east Jerusalem and across the occupied West Bank.An open-air market in Gaza City that was closed throughout the war reopened and shoppers could be seen stocking up on fresh tomatoes, cabbage and watermelons. Workers in orange traffic vests swept up rubble from the surrounding roads.“Life will return, because this is not the first war, and it will not be the last war,” said shop owner Ashraf Abu Mohammad. “The heart is in pain, there have been disasters, families wiped from the civil registry, and this saddens us. But this is our fate in this land, to remain patient.”There was little to celebrate in the hard-hit northern town of Beit Hanoun, where residents, many of whom had lost loved ones, surveyed the wreckage of their homes.“We see such huge destruction here, it’s the first time in history we’ve seen this," said Azhar Nsair. “The cease-fire is for people who didn’t suffer, who didn’t lose their loved ones, whose homes were not bombed.”The mood was also somber in Israel, where Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu faced angry accusations from his right-wing base that he had halted the war too soon.Like the three previous wars between the bitter enemies, the latest round of fighting ended inconclusively. Israel claimed to have inflicted heavy damage on Hamas with hundreds of bruising airstrikes but once again was unable to halt the rockets.Hamas also claimed victory, despite the horrifying toll the war took on countless Palestinian families who lost loved ones, homes and businesses. It now faces the daunting challenge of rebuilding in a territory already suffering from high unemployment and a coronavirus outbreak.At least 243 Palestinians were killed, including 66 children and 39 women, with 1,910 people wounded, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, which does not break the numbers down into fighters and civilians. Twelve people in Israel, including a 5-year-old boy and 16-year-old girl, were killed.In Gaza, rescue workers were still recovering bodies from areas that had been too dangerous to enter. The Red Crescent emergency service said it recovered five bodies in the southern town of Khan Younis on Friday, including the body of a three-year-old child.The fighting began on May 10, when Hamas militants in Gaza fired long-range rockets toward Jerusalem. The barrage came after days of clashes between Palestinian protesters and Israeli police at Al-Aqsa. Heavy-handed police tactics at the compound, and the threatened eviction of dozens of Palestinian families by Jewish settlers had inflamed tensions.The competing claims to Jerusalem lie at the heart of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and have repeatedly triggered bouts of violence in the past.The cease-fire was brokered by neighboring Egypt after the U.S. pressed Israel to wind down the offensive. Netanyahu announced that Israel had accepted the proposal late Thursday, while emphasizing that “the reality on the ground will determine the future of the campaign.”U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken plans to visit the region in the coming days “to discuss recovery efforts and working together to build better futures for Israelis and Palestinians.” the State Department said.Hamas and other militant groups fired over 4,000 rockets at Israel throughout the fighting, launching the projectiles from civilian areas at Israeli cities. Dozens of projectiles flew as far north as Tel Aviv, the country’s bustling commercial capital.Israel, meanwhile, carried out hundreds of airstrikes targeting what it said was Hamas’ military infrastructure, including a vast tunnel network.The United States, Israel’s closest and most important ally, initially backed what it said was Israel’s right to self-defense against indiscriminate rocket fire. But as the fighting dragged on and the death toll mounted, the Americans increasingly pressured Israel to stop the offensive.Biden welcomed the cease-fire. He said the U.S. was committed to helping Israel replenish its supply of interceptor missiles and to working with the internationally recognized Palestinian Authority — not Hamas — to provide humanitarian aid to Gaza.Netanyahu faced heavy criticism from members of his hawkish, nationalist base. Gideon Saar, a former ally who now leads a small party opposed to the prime minister, called the cease-fire “embarrassing.” Itamar Ben Gvir, head of the far-right Jewish Power party, tweeted that the cease-fire was “a grave surrender to terrorism and the dictates of Hamas.”In a potentially damaging development for the Israeli leader, the Palestinian militants claimed Netanyahu had agreed to halt further Israeli actions at the Al Aqsa Mosque and to call off the planned evictions of Palestinians in the nearby Sheikh Jarrah neighborhood.An Egyptian official said only that tensions in Jerusalem “will be addressed.” He spoke on condition of anonymity because he was discussing behind-the-scenes negotiations and provided no details.Hamas and the smaller Islamic Jihad militant group both appear to have suffered significant losses. The two groups said at least 20 of their fighters were killed, while Israel said the number was at least 160 and probably higher.Some 58,000 Palestinians sought shelter in crowded United Nations schools at a time of a coronavirus outbreak. Thousands returned to their homes as the truce took hold.Since the fighting began, Gaza’s infrastructure, already weakened by a 14-year blockade, has rapidly deteriorated, and airstrikes have damaged schools and health centers.Medical supplies, water and fuel for electricity are running low in the territory, on which Israel and Egypt imposed the blockade after Hamas seized power from the Palestinian Authority in 2007. Since then, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas has governed autonomous areas of the Israeli-occupied West Bank and has limited influence in Gaza.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/palestinians-claim-victory-as-gaza-truce-faces-early-test-101621592765708.html
21-05-2021||World||Moon Jae-in- Joe Biden to discuss North Korean strategy on Friday meet||South Korean President Moon Jae-in is set to make a last-ditch attempt to bring the US and North Korea together under his watch when he meets Joe Biden at the White House on Friday, trying to revive dormant nuclear talks in his final year in office.But Pyongyang, which has displayed disdain for both leaders, has shown no interest in their diplomacy. That raises the stakes for the Friday summit as Moon tries to find fresh enticements to lure his neighbor back to table and the Biden administration undertakes a new strategy to end a nuclear program it sees as a serious threat to America and the world.A key part of Biden’s foreign policy has been turning to allies for support in addressing the security risks posed by the likes of China and North Korea, trying to mend relations strained by his predecessor Donald Trump and placing a greater emphasis on the Indo-Pacific region. The summit with Moon is emblematic of that, being Biden’s second White House meeting with a foreign leader since coming to office, after an April summit with Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga.But persistent troubles in the Middle East have flared up and the violence between Israel and Hamas militants in the Gaza Strip could be a distraction for the summit where the focus is supposed to be on North Korea.Moon left Wednesday for the five-day visit and was expected to seek US cooperation on Covid-19 vaccines, aiming to step up production at home. Biden has been looking for help from South Korea’s advanced semiconductor industry for chips as Washington seeks to secure supply chains in its trade battles with China. Biden and Moon will hold a joint press briefing on Friday.Moon is likely to visit an SK Innovation plant in Atlanta on Saturday, according to his office, while the chairman of the SK Group, Chey Tae-won, was part of the contingent accompanying Moon. Ford Motor Co. and SK Innovation Co. are poised to announce Thursday they’ve reached an agreement to jointly build electric-vehicle batteries in the US, according to people familiar with the deal who asked not to be identified.In what might be a conciliatory gesture, the Biden administration appears willing to accede to a denuclearization agreement reached between Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un at a historic 2018 summit in Singapore. Moon helped bring the two leaders together and has been looking for Biden’s backing of the pact that Seoul sees as a launching point for future discussions.The Singapore summit resulted in a bare-bones declaration that included a call for the two sides “to work toward complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.” But the US and North Korea never agreed on what they meant by “denuclearization” and the accord resulted in no tangible steps for Kim to wind down his arsenal, which only became larger and more lethal.A senior US official told reporters that the Biden administration was looking to build on not only the Singapore agreement, but other agreements made by previous administrations. The official said the US believed nuclear negotiations would be challenging and Biden -- in contrast to his predecessor -- wasn’t orienting his diplomatic effort around achieving a grand bargain.The official, who asked not to be identified as a condition of participation in the briefing, sought to play down the likelihood the meeting would result in a splashy new North Korea announcement. While the leaders would consult on the best path forward, the White House doesn’t expect to publicly detail changes to its diplomatic strategy, the official said.Instead, the US looks eager to highlight other elements, including a push for better collaboration amid a global semiconductor shortage, the official said. Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo is expected to hold a meeting with South Korean Minister of Trade, Industry and Energy Moon Sung-wook on supply chain issues.Moon is slated to attend the Medal of Honor ceremony for Korean War veteran Ralph Puckett, Jr., becoming the first foreign head of state to participate in the awarding of the highest decoration for US service members.The Biden administration has indicated it may be ready to ease some sanctions in exchange for steps by Kim to freeze, cap and wind down his nuclear arsenal. That could help the North Korean leader fix an economy that has only shrunk since he took power about a decade ago.Moon has said he wants to use the final year of his single, five-year term to reach an “irreversible peace” on the Korean Peninsula, but his role as a bridge between the US and North Korea has waned.North Korea froze out Moon as talks with Trump faltered. This month it released a 151-page photo book of Kim’s diplomatic achievements where Moon was conspicuously absent, despite three summits with Kim.“From Kim Jong Un’s point of view, while Moon may not be able to play a pivotal role in US-North Korea diplomacy, he may be able to steer the Biden administration in a direction that would be more palatable to Kim,” said Rachel Minyoung Lee, a nonresident fellow with the 38 North Program at the Stimson Center.Kim has turned up pressure early on Biden, starting 2021 by saying he wanted to develop more advanced nuclear technologies. In March, he test-fired ballistic missiles for the first time in a year and more launches could be coming soon.“Kim Jong Un continues to rebuff South Korea and perceives a new US administration as an opportunity to negotiate, but is prepared to take provocative and coercive steps with long-range missile tests or possibly even demonstrate its nuclear capability,” General Paul LaCamera, the nominee to lead US Forces Korea, said in his written response to questions from Senate Armed Services Committee members this week.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/moon-jae-in-joe-biden-to-discuss-north-korean-strategy-on-friday-meet-101621591151908.html
21-05-2021||World||Princes William, Harry condemn BBC ‘deceit’ over Diana interview||Britain's Prince William accused the BBC of failing his mother Princess Diana and poisoning her relationship with Prince Charles after an inquiry found a journalist for the broadcaster deceitfully obtained an interview with her in 1995.William's astonishing rebuke to the public broadcaster comes after a report published Thursday said the inquiry found that BBC journalist Martin Bashir used deceit to win a sensational 1995 interview with Diana, and that the broadcaster covered up the deception.During the "Panorama" interview, watched by more than 20 million viewers in Britain, Diana shocked the nation by admitting to an affair and sharing details of her marriage to the heir to the throne and William's father, Prince Charles.Diana died in a Paris car crash in 1997 at the age of 36."It is my view that the deceitful way the interview was obtained substantially influenced what my mother said. The interview was a major contribution to making my parents' relationship worse and has since hurt countless others," William, 38, said in a statement."It brings indescribable sadness to know that the BBC's failures contributed significantly to her fear, paranoia and isolation that I remember from those final years with her."In a separate statement issued at the same time, William's brother Harry did not mention the BBC by name, but drew broader aim at the media and the "ripple effect of a culture of exploitation and unethical practices (which) ultimately took her life.""To those who have taken some form of accountability, thank you for owning it. That is the first step towards justice and truth," Harry, 36, said."Yet what deeply concerns me is that practices like these - and even worse - are still widespread today. Then, and now, it's bigger than one outlet, one network, or one publication."Harry and his wife Meghan quit their duties as members of the royal family and moved to California last year. Harry, who has sued several British tabloids, has spoken out previously about his worries that his mother's experience of the intense glare of the press would be repeated with his wife.'LET MY MOTHER DOWN'The BBC set up the investigation, headed by former senior judge John Dyson, in November following allegations from Diana's brother Charles Spencer that he had been tricked into introducing her to Bashir.Dyson's report found that Bashir, then a little-known reporter, had shown Spencer fake bank statements suggesting that Diana was being bugged by the security services and that two senior aides were being paid to provide information about her.After it was aired, Bashir repeatedly lied to his bosses about how the interview was obtained, the report said. As questions continued, BBC managers failed to scrutinise his version of events properly and covered up facts about how Bashir had secured the interview.The inquiry found that the BBC had fallen short of the "high standards of integrity and transparency which are its hallmark," and the BBC has written to Buckingham Palace to apologise.Bashir apologised for the fake statements, but said he stood by his evidence from 25 years ago and he did not believe they had prompted Diana to give the interview.William said that the BBC should have properly investigated when concerns were first raised in 1995."(Diana) was failed not just by a rogue reporter, but by leaders at the BBC who looked the other way rather than asking the tough questions," he said."These failings, identified by investigative journalists, not only let my mother down, and my family down; they let the public down too."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/indescribable-sadness-royals-condemn-bbc-deceit-over-diana-interview-101621588955069.html
21-05-2021||World||China says it will approve Dalai Lama’s successor||China on Friday indicated that it would choose the successor to the India-based Dalai Lama through “drawing lots from the golden urn” with the candidate subject to the approval of the Communist Party China (CPC)-ruled central government.A new policy paper released on Tibet on Friday all but ruled out the 14th Dalai Lama himself choosing his successor.Citing historical precedence, the white paper said the reincarnation of the Dalai Lama and other grand Living Buddhas has been subjected to approval by the central government since an ordinance passed during the Qing Dynasty (1644-1911).“The ordinance stipulated that the reincarnation of the Dalai Lama and other grand Living Buddhas had to follow the procedure of ‘drawing lots from the golden urn’, and the selected candidate would be subject to approval by the central government of China,” the white paper, titled “Tibet Since 1951: Liberation, Development and Prosperity”, said.The 14th Dalai Lama, who is 85 now, fled to India in 1959 following a Chinese crackdown on an uprising by the local population in Tibet.The Tibetan leader was granted political asylum in India and the Tibetan government-in-exile has been based in Dharamshala in Himachal Pradesh since then.In 2017, the Chinese foreign ministry had told Hindustan Times about the process it would follow on the Dalai Lama’s reincarnation. “The reincarnation of the Dalai Lama must be conducted according to religious rituals and historical conventions including drawing lots from the Golden Urn in front of the Shakyamuni (Buddha) statue at the Jokhang Temple in Lhasa, which embodies the Buddhist spirit,” the ministry had said, adding: “(and) not by what the 14th Dalai Lama has said.”The primary rules of naming the successor will follow the “Regulation on Religious Affairs and Management Rules of Tibetan Buddhism Reincarnation,” the ministry said.“Finally, the result must be reported to the central government for approval. This rule was established early in 1793,” said the ministry referring to the 29-Article Ordinance for More Effective Governance of Tibet, passed by the Qing dynasty, which ruled future Dalai Lamas would be chosen through a draw of lots of names inside the urn at the temple.China routinely blames the Dalai Lama for inciting separatism in Tibet Autonomous Region (TAR) and has called him a “wolf in sheep’s clothing”.Beijing says the Dalai Lama seeks to use violent methods to establish an independent Tibet though the Tibetan leader, who has won the Nobel Peace Prize, says he only wants genuine autonomy for Tibet and denies advocating independence or violence.The Dalai Lama’s succession issue has been in focus, especially in the last few years after the US has stepped up campaign, saying that the right relating to the reincarnation of Dalai Lama’s successor should be within the exclusive authority of the Dalai Lama and the Tibetan people.The white paper slammed the Dalai Lama group for promoting “Tibetan independence”. “Over the years, the 14th Dalai Lama and his supporters have continued to try to promote ‘Tibetan independence’ by provoking incidents to jeopardise peace and stability in Tibet,” it said.After the failure of their armed rebellion in 1959, the reactionaries of Tibet’s ruling class fled to India and subsequently began to campaign for “Tibetan independence by force”, it said.No country or government in the world has ever acknowledged the “independence of Tibet”, it said.The white paper also said by 2020, a total of 92 reincarnated Living Buddhas had been identified and approved through traditional religious rituals and historical conventions for temples in Tibet.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-says-it-will-approve-dalai-lama-s-successor-101621589028535.html
21-05-2021||World||Covid-19 death tolls are likely a 'significant undercount', says WHO||Official tolls showing the number of deaths directly or indirectly attributed to the Covid-19 pandemic are likely to be a "significant undercount", the World Health Organization said on Friday, saying 6-8 million people may have died so far.Presenting its annual World Health Statistics report, the WHO estimated that total deaths from the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020 were at least 3 million last year or 1.2 million more than officially reported."We are likely facing a significant undercount of total deaths directly and indirectly attributed to Covid-19," it said.The U.N. agency officially estimates that around 3.4 million people have died directly as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic by May 2021."...This number would truly be two to three times higher. So I think safely about 6 to 8 million deaths could be an estimate on a cautionary note," said Samira Asma, WHO's Assistant Director-General in its data and analytics division at a virtual press briefing.WHO data analyst William Msemburi said that this estimate included both unreported Covid-19 deaths as well as indirect deaths due to the lack of hospital capacity and restrictions on movements among other factors."The challenge is that the reported Covid-19 [death toll figures] is an undercount of that full impact," Msemburi said.The WHO did not give a breakdown of the figure, referred to by health experts as ""excess mortality".||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-death-tolls-are-likely-a-significant-undercount-says-who-101621588066615.html
21-05-2021||World||Nepal: Opposition mulls options to 'oust' PM Oli as political crisis deepens||Nepal's Opposition parties met on Friday to chalk out the future course of action to oust Prime Minister K P Sharma Oli and resolve the current political crisis after the embattled premier expressed unwillingness to undergo another floor test to prove his government's majority in Parliament.Also Read | KP Sharma Oli sworn in as Prime Minister of NepalThe meeting came a day after Nepal President Bidya Devi Bhandari urged the political parties in the country to stake a claim to form a new government.The President has given parties a deadline until 5:00 pm on Friday to form a new government, at the recommendation of Prime Minister Oli.According to a press release issued by the president's office on Thursday, the government decided to pave the way for the formation of a new government as Prime Minister Oli, who is required to seek a vote of confidence within 30 days, thinks that the situation is no different from the one that existed on May 10 when the 69-year-old leader lost the trust vote in the House of Representatives.The meeting of the Opposition alliance was underway at the residence of Nepali Congress (NC) President Sher Bahadur Deuba. Top leaders of Nepali Congress (NC), Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist Center) and Upendra Yadav-led faction of the Janata Samajbadi Party (JSP) were attending the meeting.A senior leader of the ruling CPN-UML, Madhav Kumar Nepal, has also reached Deuba's residence for the meeting.A senior NC leader said they are considering all possible options to oust Prime Minister KP Oli from power as he is involved in violating the constitutional norms and values, myrepublica.com reported."President Bhandari is also supporting all unconstitutional moves of Prime Minister Oli," the senior leader said. "Discussions are underway whether to file an impeachment motion against the President," he said.The Nepali Congress earlier said the decision of Prime Minister Oli not to seek a vote of confidence in parliament as per Article 76(4) and ask President Bhandari to pave the way for forming a new government as per Article 76(5) is 'unconstitutional'.The party has maintained that the Prime Minister must resign from his post if Article 76(5) is to come into effect.Prior to the meeting with other opposition party leaders, the NC had held a meeting of the party's office-bearers to forge new strategies.The meeting concluded that both Prime Minister Oli and President Bhandari were involved in unconstitutional moves and were seeking to sabotage the Constitution and derail the ongoing political course.Experts also say the Oli government and the President both have violated the Constitution.“If that is the recommendation, it goes beyond the norms of the parliamentary system. The prime minister should resign to complete the course before recommending the government formation under any other article of the Constitution,” Bipin Adhikari, former dean of Kathmandu University School of Law, told the Kathmandu Post.The president's latest call comes after the ruling party's candidate for Upper House in Bagmati Pradesh lost the election clearly indicating that Oli doesn't possess majority support in Parliament.Home Minister Ram Bahadur Thapa lost the election to the rival candidate of the ruling party Khim Lal Devkuta during Thursday's election.As per Article 76 (5) of the Constitution, any lawmaker who commands a majority in the Lower House can stake claim to form the government.At present, any lawmaker who stakes a claim to form the government will need the support of 136 lawmakers in the 275-member House of Representatives.Oli's CPN-UML is the largest party in the House with 121 seats. The NC has 61 and the CPN-MC 49 lawmakers in the House.Nepal plunged into a political crisis on December 20 last year after President Bhandari dissolved the House and announced fresh elections on April 30 and May 10 at the recommendation of Prime Minister Oli, amidst a tussle for power within the ruling Nepal Communist Party (NCP).Oli's move to dissolve the House sparked protests from a large section of the NCP led by his rival Pushpa Kamal Dahal 'Prachanda'.In February, the apex court reinstated the dissolved House, in a setback to Oli who was preparing for snap polls.As parliamentary politics is rife with number games, Nepal grapples with shortages of medical supplies, mismanagement of the situation by the state, spiking infections and fatalities amid the raging second wave of the pandemic.Nepal on Thursday reported 8,227 new coronavirus cases, taking the nationwide infection tally to 488,645.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nepal-opposition-mulls-options-to-oust-pm-oli-as-political-crisis-deepens-101621588027627.html
21-05-2021||World||Internet Explorer to retire in June 2022: Microsoft||Microsoft has said that it is retiring its long-standing browser Internet Explorer on June 15 next year after serving the netizens for over 25 years.The veteran web browser was released with Windows 95, the tech giant said in a blog post on Wednesday.“The Internet Explorer 11 desktop application will be retired and go out of support on June 15, 2022, for certain versions of Windows 10.” Sean Lyndersay, a Microsoft Edge programme manager said while commenting on the decision."The future of Internet Explorer on Windows 10 is in Microsoft Edge. Not only is Microsoft Edge a faster, more secure and more modern browsing experience than Internet Explorer, but it is also able to address a key concern: compatibility for older, legacy websites and applications."Microsoft Edge has Internet Explorer mode (“IE mode”) built in, so you can access those legacy Internet Explorer-based websites and applications straight from Microsoft Edge," Lyndersay said.Internet Explorer mode in Microsoft Edge will be supported through at least 2029, the blog post said.Internet Explorer debuted in 1995 as part of Windows 95 and became an instant hit. It successfully killed off Netscape Navigator, and it achieved a virtual monopoly in the early 2000s. At its 2002 peak, Internet Explorer commanded 95 per cent of the browser market, CNN reported.Once the most-used web browser, Internet Explorer had been on a steady downward trajectory for nearly two decades. Its share of the browser market fell below the 50 per cent threshold in 2010 and now sits at about 5 per cent, the report said.Google's Chrome is the browser leader, commanding a 69 per cent share of the market.The tech giant has been phasing out the old browser for several years - but in 2019 it had to issue an emergency patch for it, for security reasons, the BBC reported.At that point it was estimated that around 8 per cent of people were still using it. Between 2000 and 2005, Internet Explorer enjoyed a 90 per cent market share.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/internet-explorer-to-retire-in-june-2022-microsoft-101621587378098.html
21-05-2021||World||Myanmar junta-appointed electoral body to dissolve Suu Kyi party: Report||Myanmar's junta-appointed election commission will dissolve Aung San Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy Party (NLD) because of what it said was fraud in a November election, news outlet Myanmar Now said on Friday, citing a commissioner.Myanmar Now said the decision was made during a meeting with political parties that was boycotted by many parties including the NLD.Myanmar's army seized power on Feb.1, overthrowing and detaining the elected civilian leader Aung San Suu Kyi, who fought for democracy for decades before tentative reforms began a decade ago.The military justified the coup by accusing Suu Kyi's NLD of obtaining landslide victory through a manipulated vote, though the electoral commission at that time had rejected its complaints.The election fraud conducted by the NLD in November was illegal "so we will have to dissolve the party's registration", the chairman of the junta-backed Union Election Commission (UEC), Thein Soe, was cited in the report as saying. Thein Soe said the people who committed the election fraud "will be considered as traitors" and action will be taken against them.A spokesman for the junta and for an underground pro-democracy national unity government, which includes ousted members of the NLD, did not immediately respond to requests for comment.A spokesman for the military-backed Union Solidarity and Development Party said it had representatives at the meeting, which was still going on, and he was unaware of the outcome.Security forces have killed more than 800 people since a wave of protests broke out after coup, the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners activist group says, though Reuters has been unable to verify the casualties due to a clamp down on media, with many journalists among the thousands of people detained.Fighting has also flared between the security forces and ethnic minority guerrilla groups.The turmoil has alarmed Myanmar's neigbours and the broader international community, but the generals have shown no sign of intention to seek a compromise with the pro-democracy movement.The NLD was formed around leading opponents of military rule during a student-led uprising in 1988 and has won every election it was allowed to contest.Co-founded by Suu Kyi, a figurehead of Myanmar’s struggle against dictatorship, the party won a majority of seats in a 1990 election, but the junta did not recognise the result and it took until 2015 for her to come to power with a landslide win.Nobel laureate Suu Kyi faces numerous charges filed in two courts, the most serious under a colonial-era official secrets act, punishable by 14 years in prison.Suu Kyi, 75, has been permitted to speak with lawyers only via a video link in the presence of security personnel. Her co-defendant is Win Myint, the ousted president.Japan, a major donor to Myanmar, will have to rethink its aid provision to Myanmar if the situation in the Southeast Asian nation does not improve, Foreign Minister Toshimitsu Motegi said in Tokyo.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/myanmar-junta-appointed-electoral-body-to-dissolve-suu-kyi-party-report-101621587389885.html
21-05-2021||World||New study says delayed shots could produce 300% more antibodies, bringing relief for vaccine-starved nations||Faced with a limited supply of shots and anxious populations waiting their turn, more countries are turning to an initially controversial strategy that’s now been vindicated by scientific studies: doubling or tripling the intervals between the first and second Covid vaccine dose.A delay in getting the second shot not only allows the existing supply of shots to be more widely distributed, it boosts their protective power by giving the immune system more time to respond to the first inoculation. Levels of antibodies produced to fight off the virus are 20% to 300% higher when the follow-up vaccine comes later, new research shows.That’s welcome news for places like Singapore, which is grappling with a rare, albeit small, rise in cases after strict mitigation measures contained the virus last year. The city-state is now extending dose intervals -- previously three to four weeks -- to six to eight weeks, in order to reach a goal of covering its entire adult population with at least one shot by the end of August. India, facing a catastrophic outbreak, is advising 12 to 16 weeks between shots.Other nations in similar straits - with few vaccine doses and antsy populations - are likely to follow.“If I could, I would push a button that says right now, this second, we give one dose to everybody we can reach,” Gregory Poland, a virologist and director of the Mayo Clinic’s Vaccine Research Group. “We’ll get around to second doses later.”“In the midst of a world on fire, you put out as many fires as you can, as quickly as you can,” Poland said.The reassuring evidence on longer dosing intervals wasn’t available when the vaccine rollout first started at the end of 2020. Then, countries limited their use to the highest-risk people and guaranteed a second shot was waiting for those segments. The U.K. was the first to abandon those constraints amid a massive outbreak in late 2020 - a move that was initially criticized but has now proved prescient.More powerfulThe research suggests that the first shot primes the immune system, allowing it to start making protective antibodies against the virus. The longer that response is allowed to mature, the better the reaction to the second booster shot that comes weeks or months later.The benefits from longer dose intervals is being seen across all types of vaccines.People over 80 given a powerful mRNA vaccine from Pfizer Inc. and BioNTech SE had an antibody response that was 3.5-fold higher if the second shot came after three months, rather than three weeks. Other studies concluded that delaying the final shot for nine to 15 weeks averted more hospitalizations, infections and deaths, while one from Canada suggested the biggest benefit came from a six month delay.There are drawbacks. The additional time between doses means it will take longer for countries to protect their populations. While one shot offers some level of benefit, people aren’t considered fully immunized until several weeks after their second dose.The interval is particularly dangerous when less potent vaccines are being used or more transmissible variants of the virus are circulating.Some countries are pushing the boundaries. India’s delay of three to four months between doses, among the longest in the world, means those scrambling to get vaccinated amid its current outbreak won’t be fully protected until the summer or the fall.While studies suggest the optimal spacing between AstraZeneca shots is 12 weeks, there is scant data on the impact of stretching that to 16 weeks. The British drugmaker’s shot accounts for the majority of inoculations in India now.The greater delay can also increase the logistical hurdles involved in getting millions of people to return to complete the series, especially if they feel they already have some coverage from the first shot. It’s already difficult to get people in developing countries to return given transportation and communication challenges.“When you have any kind of a two-dose schedule, it’s hard logistically,” said Gigi Gronvall, a senior scholar at the Center for Health Security at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. “You worry about when people will come back for a second shot, or if you will lose them entirely.”It’s a tradeoff many places are willing to make, particularly given the limits on vaccine availability. With a new variant first identified in India already spreading in Singapore, officials want to administer a first dose to about 4.7 million people by the end of the summer.“We’re vaccinating 40,000 people a day at the moment, so you can do the math and work out how long that’ll last,” said Dale Fisher, an infectious diseases professor at the National University of Singapore. “And that’s a fairly rigid pipeline. It’s not like you can just order more.”By delaying the second dose, several hundred thousand people will get their first injection sooner, he said.“We’re comfortable that there’s no downside to this.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-study-says-delayed-shots-could-produce-300-more-antibodies-101621585632083.html
21-05-2021||World||China building villages all along Tibet border, disputed with India, Bhutan||China has systematically pumped in money for nearly a decade to build “villages of moderate prosperity” all along the 4,000km border of Tibet, a large part of which aligns with the disputed boundary with India.A new policy paper on Tibet Autonomous Region (TAR) released on Friday by the State Council Information Office said by the end of 2020 many border villages in the remote province were better connected to highways and all villages in such areas had access to mobile communication.The TAR has the longest international border with India besides having shorter ones with Nepal and Bhutan and the shortest with Myanmar.China has land boundary disputes with India and Bhutan, which have not been resolved despite protracted negotiations carried on over decades.The policy paper’s statement on border villages matches several recent reports, many based on independent satellite imagery, which say China is building new villages along the border with India to bolster its contested territorial claims, especially close to Arunachal Pradesh.The white paper, titled “Tibet Since 1951: Liberation, Development and Prosperity”, was released on Friday. “Developing border areas and improving people’s lives”, is a section in the paper.“Under the guidance of the (Communist Party of China) Party Central Committee, financial input has been increasing year-by-year for border development in Tibet. Particularly since 2012, border villages, townships and counties in Tibet have been granted more preferential state policies on infrastructure construction, covering water, electricity, roads, and housing.”In 2017, the “Plan of TAR on the Construction of Villages of Moderate Prosperity in Border Areas (2017-2020) was released”, which, the paper said, was designed to ensure better access to housing, water, electricity, roads, communications, and internet among other aspects.“Through all these efforts in the border areas in Tibet, infrastructure has seen remarkable improvements, all industries are flourishing, and the people enjoy better living and working conditions,” the white paper said.The paper said the inhabitants along the “4,000-km external border line” have harsh living and working conditions and a high incidence of poverty.The policy paper did not share details about the number of new villages that were built or how many received financial and infrastructure help.However, a 2019 report in the official TAR news portal had said the government had plans to build 624 “well off” villages and farms on Tibet’s borders.The policy clearly tallies with what President Xi Jinping had said in 2013.On March 9, 2013, when joining the delegation from Tibet in a panel discussion at the first session of the 12th National People’s Congress, China’s parliament, Xi said: “To govern the country well we must first govern the frontiers well, and to govern the frontiers well we must first ensure stability in Tibet.”In 2017, Chinese president Xi Jinping had also written a letter to Tibetan herdsmen living near the Arunachal Pradesh border to “set down roots” and safeguard “Chinese territory”.Last August, Chinese state media reported on how the government has improved infrastructure in villages close to the Arunachal Pradesh border.State-owned Global Times tabloid cited authorities in Yadong county of TAR as saying that 27 households with 124 people had “voluntarily moved from... Yadong county to Pangda village in September”.A December 6, 2020, Hindustan Times report said that several villages had come up in the tri-junction between India, Bhutan and China, and the move had followed the upgrading and construction of Chinese military facilities, including heliports and missile bases, all along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in the aftermath of the 2017 standoff at Doklam.A new village is also said to have come up near Longju, near Arunachal, which witnessed the first clash between India and China in 1959, according to India-based Tibet expert, Claude Arpi.The policy paper also detailed the overall infrastructure development in TAR.“Highways with a total length of 118,800km have been built, providing access to all administrative villages in the region. Ninety-four percent of towns and 76 percent of administrative villages have direct access to asphalt and concrete roads,” it said, adding that some 700km of expressways and grade-one highways are in service.“A number of feeder airports have been built, including Bamda Airport in Qamdo, Mainling Airport in Nyingchi, Peace Airport in Xigaze, and Gunsa Airport in Ngari. Tibet now has 140 domestic and international air routes in operation, reaching 66 cities.”Many of the new airports are located close to border areas, especially with India.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-building-villages-all-along-tibet-border-disputed-with-india-bhutan-101621583628346.html
21-05-2021||World||Dalai Lama's successor will be appointed only after govt approval: China||China on Friday said that any successor to the present Dalai Lama should be approved by it, ruling out recognition to any heir nominated by him or by his followers.The reincarnation of the Dalai Lama and other grand Living Buddhas has been subjected to approval by the central government since the Qing Dynasty (1644-1911), claimed an official white paper issued by the Chinese government here.The document has also asserted that Tibet was an inseparable part of China since ancient times."In 1793, after dispelling Gurkha invaders, the Qing government restored order in Tibet and promulgated the Imperially Approved Ordinance for Better Governance of Tibet, improving systems by which the central government-administered Tibet," the white paper titled 'Tibet Since 1951: Liberation, Development and Prosperity" said.The ordinance stipulated that the reincarnation of the Dalai Lama and other grand Living Buddhas had to follow the procedure of "drawing lots from the golden urn" and that the selected candidate would be subject to approval by the central government of China, the document said.The 14th Dalai Lama fled to India in 1959 following a Chinese crackdown on an uprising by the local population in Tibet. India granted him political asylum and the Tibetan government-in-exile has been based in Dharamsala in Himachal Pradesh since then.The Dalai Lama is 85 years old now and the issue of his successor has gained prominence in the last couple of years due to his advanced age.The Dalai Lama’s succession issue was in the limelight, especially in the last few years after the US has stepped up campaign that the right relating to the reincarnation of Dalai Lama’s successor should be within the exclusive authority of the Dalai Lama and the Tibetan people.The Tibetan Policy and Support Act of 2020 (TPSA) passed by the US Congress makes it official United States policy that decisions regarding the reincarnation of the Dalai Lama are exclusively within the authority of the current Dalai Lama, Tibetan Buddhist leaders and the Tibetan people.Chinese Foreign Ministry officials have been asserting time and again that while the institution of reincarnation of the Dalai Lama has been in existence for several hundred years, the 14th (present) Dalai Lama himself was found and recognised following religious rituals and historic conventions, and his succession was approved by China’s central government.The white paper said by 2020, a total of 92 reincarnated Living Buddhas had been identified and approved through traditional religious rituals and historical conventions for temples in Tibet.Traditional religious activities are carried out regularly in accordance with the law and examination on scriptures and subsequent promotion in academic degrees are also held in monasteries on a regular basis, it said.The white paper termed the demand for Tibetan independence as a product of imperialist aggression against China.In the middle of the 19th century, the UK-led imperialist powers began to cultivate the idea of "Tibet independence," intentionally undermining China's sovereignty and territorial integrity, it said.It slammed the Dalai Lama group for promoting "Tibetan independence".“Over the years, the 14th Dalai Lama and his supporters have continued to try to promote "Tibetan independence" by provoking incidents to jeopardise peace and stability in Tibet," it said.After the failure of their armed rebellion in 1959, the reactionaries of Tibet's ruling class fled to India and subsequently began to campaign for "Tibetan independence" by force”, it said.No country or government in the world has ever acknowledged the "independence of Tibet," it said.China makes it mandatory to adhere to the 'One China' policy, recognising Tibet and Taiwan as an integral part of the country.Beijing made the 'One-China' policy a prerequisite for countries to establish diplomatic ties with it.About the incidents of over 100 Tibetans setting themselves on fire since 2011 demanding the return of the Dalai Lama from his exile, the white paper said the Dalai Lama and his supporters have incited Tibetan lamas into self-immolations.It also blamed the western anti-China forces for continuing to interfere in Tibetan affairs in an attempt to sabotage its social stability.Justifying China’s taking over of Tibet in 1951, it said with the peaceful liberation of Tibet 70 years ago, the people of Tibet broke free from the fetters of invading imperialism for good and embarked on a bright road of unity, progress and development with all the other ethnic groups in China.China is a unified multi-ethnic country with a long history. The Chinese nation is a community of shared future. Tibet has developed through the combined efforts of all the ethnic groups in China, it said.Rejecting allegations of curbs on religion, it said the province has more than 1,700 sites for Tibetan Buddhist activities with 46,000 monks and nuns besides four mosques serving 12,000 native Muslims, and a Catholic church with more than 700 followers, it said."Following the peaceful liberation, all ethnic groups in Tibet, united under the strong leadership of the Communist Party of China, have worked together and stood firm in safeguarding national sovereignty, unity and territorial integrity," it said.China is building a new modern socialist Tibet, it said.It also refuted criticism that the Tibetan language is being undermined to promote the official Chinese language. The Tibetan spoken and written language is widely used in Tibet, the white paper said.The study and use of the Tibetan language are protected by law.Tibet now has 16 periodicals and 12 newspapers in the Tibetan language and has published more than 40 million copies of 7,185 Tibetan-language books, it said.Tibet is also economically thriving and prospering in the new era, it said.All those counties formerly classified as poor have risen out of poverty, and the people are leading better lives in every respect.The system of regional ethnic autonomy has been fully implemented in Tibet it said.The average life expectancy in Tibet has reached 71.1 years in 2019 from 35.5 years in 1951, due to the development of health infrastructure, it saidIt also said the number of Tibetans in the legislature has increased.Of the 439 deputies to the 11th People's Congress of the Tibet Autonomous Region, 289 -- or almost two-thirds -- are from the Tibetan and other ethnic minorities, it said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/dalai-lama-s-successor-will-be-appointed-only-after-govt-approval-china-101621580864246.html

The biggest trade deficit in America is the trade deficit between White corporate America and Black America, and McDonald's is guilty of perpetuating this disparity," Allen added.McDonald's intentionally discriminated against Entertainment Studios and Weather Group through a pattern of racial stereotyping and refusals to contract, the lawsuit states.A McDonald's spokesperson told the Wall Street journal it would review the lawsuit.Earlier Thursday, McDonald's announced it would more than double the advertising money it pays to media companies owned by Blacks, Hispanics, women and other underrepresented groups over the next four years.Spending with Black-owned properties will increase from 2 percent to 5 percent of national advertising spend over this time period.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/mcdonalds-sued-for-spending-less-on-advertising-in-black-owned-media-companies-101621579216344.html

"They did not have an easily explainable pattern, and so, you know, I think that people still take seriously trying to investigate and figure out what that is," Obama also said.Without elaborating his own views on what these mysterious objects were, Obama concluded by saying, "I have nothing to report to you today."This comes as the American defence department and intelligence agencies are due to release a much-anticipated report on mysterious aerial sightings. The report will be released in June.Earlier on Sunday, a US government official on an American television acknowledged sighting of unidentified aerial phenomena (USP) and confirmed that the department posses recordings as well.One video was also leaked by a documentary filmmaker which captured an unidentified spherical object flying off the coast of San Diego. The video is claimed to be shot by the US Navy.The US Navy photographed & filmed “spherical” shaped UFOs & advanced transmedium vehicles; here is some of that footage. Filmed in the Combat Information Center of the USS Omaha / July 15th 2019 / warning area off San Diego @ 11pm PST. No wreckage found. No craft were recovered. pic.twitter.com/tK1YTG8sJ7Meanwhile, speaking on his life after the presidency, Obama said, he is very happy now as he not being blamed for "every single story" in the news. He also said that he feels less stressed and less burdened now.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/obama-on-ufos-us-military-have-footage-and-records-of-mysterious-flying-object-101621577587121.html
21-05-2021||World||Hour-by-hour: Joe Biden's behind-the-scenes manoeuvring for Israel-Hamas cease-fire||The diplomatic flurry was over and Israel's Benjamin Netanyahu was on the phone telling President Joe Biden that it appeared the furious fighting between Israel and Hamas was about to end.But Biden remained wary even after the afternoon phone call. Things still could go crosswise with hours to go before the cease-fire took effect, his team reasoned.Nervous White House aides dialed contacts in Tel Aviv and Cairo to suss out whether the truce would hold. Officials in both the US and Israel worried that another barrage of Hamas rockets still could sink the Egyptian-brokered agreement, according to an official familiar with the conversations.Then came another call from Netanyahu — his second to Biden in a matter of hours — with reassurances for the American president that the 11-day war really was halting.Biden's first extended foreign policy crisis — one he handled largely by avoiding the cameras and manoeuvring instead behind the scenes — had abated.The president went before cameras in the Cross Hall of the White House to describe “intensive high-level discussions, hour by hour, literally” by the US that involved Egypt, the Palestinian Authority and other Middle Eastern countries.All of it, he said, came "with an aim of avoiding the sort of prolonged conflict we’ve seen in previous years when the hostilities have broken out.”Biden and Netanyahu’s talks were just a small sample of the furious diplomacy that the White House conducted. The president and senior aides had over 80 engagements -- by phone or in person -- as it looked for an endgame to the fighting, according to the White House.Biden's speech celebrating the cease-fire lasted just 3 ½ minutes — delivered just in time for evening news broadcasts. He reiterated his belief that Israel has a right to defend itself, expressed condolences for Palestinian civilians who died in the Israeli bombardment and promised that humanitarian aid to Gaza Strip was on its way.It was an enigmatic, and perhaps fitting, bookend to the sort of messy Middle East crisis he had hoped to avoid, particularly early in a presidency already oversubscribed with managing the public health and economic tumult caused by the coronavirus pandemic.The conflict had also exposed a rift between Biden and members of his own party. The president who over nearly 50 years in national politics has burnished a reputation for unwavering support of Israel leads a Democratic Party that has trended toward a far more divided outlook on the correct path to peace between Israel and the Palestinians. And Republicans, for their part, were all too eager to use the raging violence as ammunition against Biden's presidency.Biden had studiously avoided extensive public comment about the Israeli military strikes as the conflict raged. But as the days wore on, he was facing mounting pressure from fellow Democrats to speak out against the Israelis as the death toll climbed in Gaza and as tens of thousands of Palestinians were displaced by the aerial bombardment.When it was over, Democratic Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut expressed relief at the cease-fire and commended Biden and his team for their work. But he also laid out ongoing worries, saying, "I am deeply concerned that without meaningful progress towards a two-state future, the conditions of despair will deepen, further fuel extremism and lead to a tragic renewal of the cycle of violence.”The cease-fire announcement came after Biden on Wednesday upped his pressure on Netanyahu, telling the Israeli leader in a phone call that he expected “significant de-escalation” of the fighting by day’s end, according to the White House. But the prime minister came right back with a public declaration that he was “determined to continue” the Gaza operation “until its objective is achieved."Biden's advisers were not overly concerned that Netanyahu’s comments seemed to reject the president's public call to ease off, according to the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because the person was not authorised to publicly discuss private discussions.US officials believed Netanyahu did not want to telegraph to Hamas in advance that he was ready to accept terms to end the violence, and the Israeli leader also was sending a message to a domestic audience that had become traumatised by the barrage of rocket fire from Gaza.But pressure was building on Biden, and he, in turn, was making that known to Netanyahu.On Tuesday, while in Michigan to visit a Ford facility, Democratic Rep. Rashida Tlaib confronted Biden on the airport tarmac and called on him to speak out forcefully against the Israeli strikes. Also this week, Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York introduced resolutions to block the sale of $735 million in military weaponry to Israel that had already been approved by the Biden administration.“Let us hope that the ceasefire in Gaza holds," Sanders tweeted Thursday evening. “But that’s not enough. Our job now is to support desperately needed humanitarian and reconstruction aid to Gaza’s people, and find a way to finally bring peace to the region.”Biden advisers had concluded in the first days of the crisis, as Hamas rained down hundreds of rockets on Israel, that a call from the president for Israeli restraint would have fallen flat. At the same time, early in the crisis, there was deep worry inside the White House that the fighting could morph into something that would take months to tamp down.As the outside calls for Biden to speak out more forcefully grew, the president and top aides privately made the case to Israeli officials that time wasn’t on their side.Biden and Netanyahu have known each other for more than 30 years and have frequently butted heads. Their conversations throughout the crisis probed one another as they tried to game out a path forward, according to officials.White House officials have pointed to some grim evidence to argue that Biden's attempts at behind-the-scenes diplomacy worked: The latest Israel-Hamas war — in which at least 230 people in Gaza and at least 12 in Israel died — was shorter and less blood was spilled than in some of the other recent major outbreaks of violence in the region.Biden, in his brief remarks about the ceasefire, noted that but for the Iron Dome, a missile defense system developed by the U.S. and Israel, the body count would have been far worse. The system is designed to intercept and destroy short-range rockets and artillery shells. Biden said he assured Netanyahu that his administration would work to quickly replenish it.He also pledged that humanitarian aid would quickly flow through the Palestinian Authority, which is in control of the West Bank but not Gaza.“We will do this in full partnership with the Palestinian Authority, not Hamas ... and in a manner that does not permit Hamas to simply restock its military arsenal,” Biden said.The details of missile system supplies and humanitarian aid, though, could wait for another day.Biden ended on a hopeful note: “I believe we have a genuine opportunity to make progress, and I’m committed to working for it.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hourbyhour-joe-biden-s-behind-the-scenes-manoeuvring-for-israel-hamas-ceasefire-101621576018554.html

21-05-2021||World||Israel-Hamas truce takes hold, Palestinians celebrate||An Egyptian-mediated truce between Israel and Hamas began on Friday, but Hamas warned it still had its "hands on the trigger" and demanded Israel end the violence in Jerusalem and address the damages in Gaza Strip after the worst fighting in years.US President Joe Biden pledged to salve the devastated Gaza. Aerial bombardment of the densely populated area killed 232 Palestinians, while rocket attacks killed 12 people in Israel during the conflict.Palestinians, many of whom had spent 11 days huddled in fear of Israeli shelling, poured into Gaza's streets. Mosque loud-speakers feted "the victory of the resistance achieved over the Occupation (Israel)."Cars driving around East Jerusalem’s Sheikh Jarrah at dawn flew Palestinian flags and honked horns, echoing the celebratory scenes in Gaza.In the countdown to the 2 am (2300 GMT Thursday) cease-fire, Palestinian rocket salvoes continued and Israel carried out at least one air strike.Each side said it stood ready to retaliate for any truce violations by the other. Cairo said it would send two delegations to monitor the ceasefire.The violence erupted on May 10, triggered by Palestinians' anger at what they saw as Israeli curbs on their rights in Jerusalem, including during police confrontations with protesters at Al-Aqsa mosque during the Ramadan fasting month.The fighting meant many Palestinians in Gaza could not mark the Eid al-Fitr festival at Ramadan's conclusion. On Friday, throughout Gaza, postponed Eid al-Fitr meals were held instead.In Israel, radio stations that had carried around-the-clock news and commentary switched back to pop music and folk songs.Death tollGaza health officials said 232 Palestinians, including 65 children, had been killed and more than 1,900 wounded in aerial bombardments. Israel said it had killed at least 160 combatants.Authorities put the death toll in Israel at 12, with hundreds of people treated for injuries in rocket attacks that caused panic and sent people rushing into shelters.Hamas, the Islamist militant group that rules Gaza, cast the fighting as successful resistance of a militarily and economically stronger foe."It is true the battle ends today but (Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin) Netanyahu and the whole world should know that our hands are on the trigger and we will continue to grow the capabilities of this resistance," said Ezzat El-Reshiq, a senior member of the Hamas political bureau.He told Reuters in Doha that the movement's demands also include protecting Al-Aqsa mosque in Jerusalem and ending the eviction of several Palestinians from their home in East Jerusalem which Reshiq described as "a red line"."What comes after the battle of 'Sword of Jerusalem' is not like what came before because the Palestinian people backed the resistance and know that the resistance is what will liberate their land and protect their holy sites," Reshiq said.In Israel, relief was bittersweet."It's good that the conflict will end, but unfortunately I don't feel like we have much time before the next escalation," Eiv Izyaev, a 30-year-old software engineer, said in Tel Aviv.Amid growing global alarm, Biden had urged Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to seek de-escalation, while Egypt, Qatar and the United Nations sought to mediate.In a televised address on Thursday, Biden extended condolences to bereaved Israelis and Palestinians and said Washington would work with the United Nations "and other international stakeholders to provide rapid humanitarian assistance" for Gaza and its reconstruction.Biden said aid would be coordinated with the Palestinian Authority - run by Hamas' rival, President Mahmoud Abbas, and based in the Israeli-occupied West Bank - "in a manner that does not permit Hamas to simply restock its military arsenal".Hamas is deemed a terrorist group in the West and by Israel, which it refuses to recognise.Power struggleAnalysts saw a key goal of Hamas's rocket campaign as being to marginalise Abbas by presenting itself as the guardian of Palestinians in Jerusalem, whose eastern sector they seek for a future state.Making the link explicit, Hamas named the rocket operation "Sword of Jerusalem".Abbas, 85, remained a marginal figure during the 11-day conflict. He secured a first telephone call with Biden during the crisis - four months after Biden took office - but his western-backed Palestinian Authority exerts little influence over Gaza, and he made no public comment after the truce was announced.Prime Minister Mohammad Shtayyeh, an Abbas appointee, said “We welcome the success of the international efforts led by Egypt to stop the Israeli aggression against our people in Gaza Strip,” in comments published by Palestinian media.In perhaps a worrying sign for Abbas in his West Bank heartland, some Palestinians waved green Hamas flags in Ramallah, the seat of his government.Hamas previously demanded that any halt to the Gaza fighting be accompanied by Israeli drawdowns in Jerusalem. An Israeli official told Reuters there was no such condition in the truce.The State Department said that Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken planned to travel to the Middle East, where he would meet with Israeli, Palestinian, and regional leaders to discuss recovery efforts.UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said Israeli and Palestinian leaders had a responsibility beyond the restoration of calm to address the root causes of the conflict,” he told reporters with serious dialogue.“Gaza is an integral part of the future Palestinian state and no effort should be spared to bring about real national reconciliation that ends the division," he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/videos/world-news/israelhamas-truce-takes-hold-palestinians-celebrate-101621571723485.html

You're talking about history repeating itself? They're not going to stop until she dies," Harry says in the mental health documentary series "The Me You Can't See.""It's incredibly triggering to potentially lose another woman in my life," he added, referring to Meghan. The "Me You Can't See" series, which Harry produced with U.S. talk show host Oprah Winfrey, is released on Apple TV on Friday.Princess Diana died in 1997 at age 36 in a crash in Paris after the car in which she was traveling with her Egyptian-born boyfriend Dodi Fayed was chased by paparazzi. Harry was 12 years old.Harry, whose American wife Meghan is bi-racial, spoke of racist reporting in the mainstream British press about his wife, as well as abuse on social media. Meghan has said her experience in Britain drove her to thoughts of suicide when she was pregnant with their first son Archie.In the documentary, Harry spoke of walking behind Diana's coffin through the streets of London with his brother William, father Prince Charles and uncle Charles Spencer."The thing I remember most was the sound of the horses' hooves going along the Mall," he said. "It was like I was outside of my body, just walking along, doing what was expected of me, showing one tenth of the emotion that everyone was showing."Years earlier, he recalled sitting in the back of his mother's car while she, in tears, was pursued by photographers."One of the feelings that comes up for me always is the helplessness. Being a guy and being too young to help a woman, in this case your mother, and that happened every single day," he said.Harry said he buried his feelings, but drank heavily and suffered panic attacks and anxiety in his 20s, and still freaks out when he sees cameras."I was so angry with what happened to her (Diana) and the fact there was no justice at all... the same people that chased her through that tunnel photographed her dying on the back seat of that car," he said."The clicking of cameras, and the flash of cameras makes my blood boil. It makes me angry. It takes me back to what happened to my mum, what I experienced as a kid."Even now, at age 36, he said that returning to London makes him feel tense and hunted.Harry said he started serious therapy almost five years ago, when he met Meghan."I quickly established that if this relationship was going to work, I had to deal with my past," he said. The couple married in May 2018.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/haunted-by-diana-s-death-prince-harry-talks-of-how-he-feared-losing-meghan-too-101621571863348.html

In the spirit of that effort, I urge the federal government to assist the Indian Government in its Covid-19 vaccine distribution effort as soon as it has the capacity to do so,” he said in the letter, a copy of which is with the PTI.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageHe said in the recent weeks, India has become a global epicenter of the Covid-19 pandemic.The past week was one of the deadliest phase of the pandemic in India, which recorded 4,205 deaths on Wednesday, carrying the total number of confirmed deaths due to Covid-19 to more than 250,000.India’s healthcare system is under tremendous pressure and doctors and patients alike are in urgent need of assistance, he said.“We know that increasing vaccination rates is one of the most important tools available to combat the pandemic. Unfortunately, less than 10 per cent of Indians have received at least one dose of a Covid-19 vaccine at this time, As Covid-19 continues to spread through the unvaccinated Indian population, the risk of new variants greatly increases and thousands more will lose their lives,” Suozzi said.Welcoming the efforts of the Biden administration to provide USD 100 million worth of relief to India, Suozzi wrote that given the scope of the ongoing health crisis, the United States must continue to coordinate with the Indian Government to bolster and support vaccine distribution programme.“The United States has long played a crucial role in supporting other nations through health initiatives, and it is imperative that we do so again in the global Covid-19 vaccination effort,” Suozzi wrote in his letter to Biden.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-congressman-urges-president-biden-to-assist-india-in-anti-covid-vaccination-101621558000522.html

21-05-2021||World||US Prez Joe Biden praises Israel-Hamas deal, vowing continued US diplomacy||President Joe Biden praised a truce between Israel and Hamas after an 11-day conflict over the Gaza Strip killed more than 200 people and led to rising pressure in the US to distance itself from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s government.“I believe the Palestinians and Israelis equally deserve to live safely and securely and enjoy equal measures of freedom, prosperity and democracy,” Biden said at the White House on Thursday. “My administration will continue our quiet relentless diplomacy toward that end.”Israel and Hamas agreed late Thursday to an Egyptian-mediated cease-fire designed to end their 11-day conflict. The announcement came amid growing pressure from the Biden administration to stop the fighting, which killed an estimated 232 Palestinians and 12 Israelis.Israel’s security cabinet unanimously voted to approve Egypt’s proposal for an unconditional truce with Hamas, according to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office. The cease-fire will take effect at 2 a.m. local time on Friday, Lebanon’s Al Mayadeen TV reported, citing senior Hamas official Osama Hamdan.Biden on Wednesday urged Netanyahu to end the fighting, telling the Israeli leader during a phone call he expected a “significant de-escalation today” according to the White House.The president also faced pressure from some Democrats to take a harder line against the Israeli government and voice stronger support for the Palestinians, who suffered heavy losses in the fighting. But in a signal to Democrats who wanted to halt weapons sales to Israel, Biden said he is willing to help “replenish” the Iron Dome missile defense system Israel deployed to stop Hamas’ rockets from the Gaza Strip.Biden had been hesitant to publicly criticize the Israeli government, delaying for several days any public call for a cease-fire. And on Thursday he reiterated previous remarks that Israel has a right to defend itself.The conflict also showed the limits of the administration’s power to act as a mediator in matters related to Hamas, which runs Gaza and is designated a terrorist group by the US, European Union and others.Palestinians, including the rival Palestinian Authority that oversees the West Bank, are wary of the US government playing the role of peacemaker after four years of being sidelined by former President Donald Trump.In this conflict, the Egyptian government, which has ties with both Israel and Hamas, was called on to broker a truce. Biden spoke to his Egyptian counterpart Abdel Fattah El-Sisi earlier Thursday to discuss the cease-fire negotiations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-prez-joe-biden-praises-israel-hamas-deal-vowing-continued-us-diplomacy-101621550177408.html
21-05-2021||World||Israel approves unilateral cease-fire in Gaza offensive||Israel on Thursday announced a cease-fire in the bruising 11-day war against Hamas militants that caused widespread destruction in the Gaza Strip and brought life in much of Israel to a standstill.Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office announced the cease-fire after a late-night meeting of his Security Cabinet. It said the group had unanimously accepted an Egyptian proposal, though the sides were still determining exactly when it was to take effect.Senior defense officials, including the military chief of staff and national security adviser, recommended accepting the proposal after claiming “great accomplishments” in the operation, the statement said.Defense Minister Benny Gantz wrote on Twitter that “the reality in the field will determine the continuation of operations.”One member of the Security Cabinet said the cease-fire would take effect at 2 a.m., roughly three hours after the announcement. He spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss the closed-door talks.A Hamas official said the declaration of a truce was a defeat for Netanyahu and “a victory to the Palestinian people.”Ali Barakeh, a member of Hamas’ Arab and Islamic relations bureau, told The Associated Press that the militants will remain on alert until they hear from mediators. Once Hamas hears from mediators, the group's leadership will hold discussions and make an announcement, he said.Shortly after the announcement, air-raid sirens indicating incoming rocket fire sounded in southern Israel.The agreement would close the heaviest round of fighting between the bitter enemies since a 50-day war in 2014, and once again there was no clear winner. Israel inflicted heavy damage on Hamas but was unable to prevent the rocket fire that has disrupted life for millions of Israelis for more than a decade.The fighting began May 10, when Hamas militants in Gaza fired long-range rockets toward Jerusalem after days of clashes between Palestinian protesters and Israeli police at the Al-Aqsa Mosque compound, a flashpoint site sacred to Jews and Muslims. Heavy-handed police tactics at the compound and the threatened eviction of dozens of Palestinian families by Jewish settlers had inflamed tensions.Israel launched hundreds of airstrikes during the operation, targeting what it said was Hamas’ military infrastructure, including a vast tunnel network. Hamas and other militant groups embedded in residential areas have fired over 4,000 rockets at Israeli cities, with hundreds falling short and most of the rest intercepted.At least 230 Palestinians were killed, including 65 children and 39 women, with 1,710 people wounded, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, which does not break the numbers down into fighters and civilians.Hamas and the militant group Islamic Jihad said at least 20 of their fighters have been killed, while Israel said the number is at least 130. Some 58,000 Palestinians have fled their homes, many of them seeking shelter in crowded UN schools at a time of a raging coronavirus outbreak.Twelve people in Israel, including a 5-year-old boy, a 16-year-old girl and a soldier, were killed.Since the fighting began, Gaza’s infrastructure, already weakened by a 14-year blockade, has rapidly deteriorated.Medical supplies, water and fuel for electricity are running low in the territory, on which Israel and Egypt imposed the blockade after Hamas seized power in 2007.Israel considers Hamas, an Islamic militant group that seeks its destruction, to be a terrorist group and Hamas’ government is not internationally recognized.Israeli bombing has damaged over 50 schools across the territory, according to advocacy group Save the Children, completely destroying at least six. While repairs are done, education will be disrupted for nearly 42,000 children.Israeli attacks have also damaged at least 18 hospitals and clinics and destroyed one health facility, the World Health Organization said. Nearly half of all essential drugs have run out.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/cabinet-approves-cease-fire-in-gaza-israeli-media-101621540033862.html
21-05-2021||World||Record 55 million internally displaced world over||A key group that monitors internal displacement is reporting Thursday that violence and disasters — often caused or worsened by the impact of climate change — forced people to relocate within their countries more than 40 million times last year, the highest such tally in over a decade.The Internal Displacement Monitoring Center (DMC), in its latest annual global report, says a record 55 million people were living away from their homes but within their countries at the end of last year, as storms and floods, as well as both protracted and new conflicts, drove up the figures that have been growing for more than a decade. Sometimes people have moved two or three times.The Geneva-based centre, which is part of the Norwegian Refugee Council, said the number of internally displaced was more than twice that of refugees — those who flee to another country — at the end of last year. The group cautioned that the figures were likely a “significant underestimate” because Covid-19 travel restrictions impeded the collection of data.“It’s shocking that someone was forced to flee their home inside their own country every single second last year,” said NRC secretary-general Jan Egeland. “We are failing to protect the world’s most vulnerable people from conflict and disasters.”Of those displaced at the end of the year, some 48 million people had fled conflict and violence and 7 million had escaped from disasters, the group said.The centre pointed to escalating violence and wider activity from extremist groups in countries like Ethiopia, Mozambique and Burkina Faso last year, and ongoing wars in places like Congo, Syria and Afghanistan.It also noted intense cyclone seasons in the Americas, Asia and the Pacific, and long rainy seasons in the Middle East and sub-Saharan Africa, saying such weather woes uprooted millions.Overall, the highest number of internally displaced people last year was in China, which faces floods regularly and authorities encourage or require internal displacement to get out of the way of rising waters, followed by the Philippines and Bangladesh. More than 5 million people in China were forced into internal displacement last year.Numbers may riseIDMC director Alexandra Bilakk said it was “particularly concerning that these high figures were recorded against the backdrop of the Covid-19 pandemic”.Pointing out that movement restrictions obstructed data collection and “fewer people sought out emergency shelters for fear of infection”, she suggested the true figures were higher.The pandemic had meanwhile exacerbated socioeconomic conditions for displaced people, she added.Climate impactExperts say that climate change is increasing the intensity and frequency of such extreme weather events.“We can only expect with the future impacts of climate change for these disasters to become more frequent and more intense, and therefore for the numbers of internally displaced people to grow,” Bilak said. It also warned that a convergence of conflicts and natural disasters was making the problem worse, with 95% of last year’s new conflict displacements occurring in countries vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. “Climate change and the overexploitation of natural resources may aggravate instability and conflict, which in turn may trigger displacement,” it said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/record-55-million-internally-displaced-world-over-101621538356876.html
21-05-2021||World||Develop vaccines against Covid-19 in Africa, Latin America: WTO||The head of the World Trade Organization says it's paramount to diversify vaccine manufacturing and develop production in Africa and Latin America to contain the coronavirus pandemic.On the eve of a global health summit in Rome, WTO Director-General Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala told European Union legislators on Thursday that normal market forces for exports and imports can't apply when it comes to the life-or-death issue of Covid-19 vaccines. Many of the world's wealthiest nations were hoarding the shots for their own population.She says the world has the capacity to manufacture 5 billion vaccine doses overall but as the virus has spread “we require twice and three times that. So the capacity was not there.”A main challenges is diversifying vaccine production, which is now 80% concentrated in 10 European, North American and South Asian nations. She says “Africa, with 1.3 billion people, has 0.17 % of the manufacturing capacity of the world,” and Latin America has about 2% of global production capacity. “This has to change.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/develop-vaccines-against-covid-19-in-africa-latin-america-wto-101621534598548.html
21-05-2021||India||Export boom aids agribusinesses, not farmers||Rising agricultural exports from India, which shipped out a record 20 million tonne of foodgrains in 2020-21, have breathed new life into agribusinesses, but farmers say they have hardly gained because they had to sell cheap. Agricultural trading firms have benefited at the expense of farmers, export prices show. In the financial year ended March 2021, the country exported farm produce worth nearly $42 billion, a growth of about 18%, on the back of a rise in global commodity prices, official statistics show. The current boom is nearly of the same level seen in 2013-14, when exports peaked. India’s farm exports grew five times from just $8.7 billion in 2004-05 to $42.6 billion during 2013-14. They then fell sharply to $33 billion in 2016-17 and have been muted since. The country exported 17.72 million tonnes of rice till March 30. It also sold nearly 3 million tonnes of wheat and a similar amount of maize abroad. A firming up of global sugar prices, good news for India, the world’s second largest producer of the sweetener, prompted the government on Thursday to cut the subsidy on sugar exports from ₹6,000 a tonne to ₹4,000. Growing demand around the world for food staples such as rice, wheat and sugar are keeping Indian agriculture businesses and processing plants humming, as the pandemic began to ease in many nations. However, the issue is that farmers have gained the least. International food commodity prices rose for the 11th consecutive month in April, with sugar and cereals “resuming their upward trend”, the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) said on May 6. FAO’s Food Price Index in April rose 30.8% higher than its level in the same month last year. “A key reason for the surge of exports, especially in cereals, is that Indian produce has been very competitive (in terms of pricing) vis-à-vis countries like Australia and Thailand,” said Abhishek Agrawal of Comtrade, a commodities trading advisory firm. Competitive pricing simply means Indian exporters were able to offer cheaper prices to international buyers than their rivals . Moreover, rice producer Thailand’s shipments fell due to the drought and Vietnam too had a smaller crop in 2020. Indian exporters filled the gap. “Indian wheat is selling for about $280 a tonne (1000 kg), about 6% less than what competitors from Ukraine and Australia are asking,” said Vishal Tomar, who owns a wheat aggregator business in Indore. This rate for wheat exports is nearly the same as the minimum support price (MSP) of ₹1975 a quintal (100 kg). Analysts say this means the producer or farmer was likely paid much below MSP rates. An MSP is a federally fixed floor rate gives a return of at least 50% over cost of cultivation. Sunil Singh, a farmer from Bihar’s Arariya district, said he sold wheat for ₹1600 a quintal. “That was the highest rate available,” he said over phone. Ramesh Baranwal, a rice grower from Uttar Pradesh’s Balia, said he sold paddy (unmilled) for about ₹1400 a quintal, which is below the MSP of ₹1868. It is not difficult for exporters to buy produce below MSP. “They can always turn to states where the government’s procurement isn’t very robust,” Agrawal said. To be sure, the Union government has procured 36.6 million tonnes of wheat so far in the current season, which is nearly 30% more than the quantity bought from farmers during the corresponding period last year, food ministry data shows. However, procurement by government remains weak in states such as Bihar, Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal. The 70th round of National Sample Survey for 2012–13 showed only 32.2% of paddy farmers and 39.2% of wheat growers were aware of MSPs. It also revealed that only 13.5% paddy farmers actually benefited from MSP, while the figure for wheat growers was 16.2%.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/export-boom-aids-agribusinesses-not-farmers-101621621191979.html
21-05-2021||India||Ahead of Cyclone Yaas, Odisha is ready with evacuation plans||Ahead of cyclonic storm ‘Yaas’ heading towards Odisha, the state government on Friday asked officials at the Gram Panchayat level to ensure smooth evacuation of people residing in low-lying areas to safer places and asked fishermen not to venture out into deep sea from today.Special Relief Commissioner Pradeep Jena said a low pressure area is developing in the Andaman Sea and east-central Bay of Bengal around May 22 which may intensify into a cyclonic storm by May 24 and may move north-westwards and reach Odisha and the West Bengal Coast around May 26 morning. “It is likely to make landfall between Sundarbans near north Odisha coast and Bangladesh. The exact path of the cyclone is not yet known, but by tomorrow it would be clearer,” he said.Jena said all coastal districts are ready and officials at the Gram Panchayat level have been asked to ensure smooth evacuation of people residing in low-lying areas to safer places. “By now, the fisheries department has brought back nearly all the fishermen out at sea except 39. We hope by tomorrow those 39 would be brought back too. We have adequate workforce for rescue and relief operations. Fishermen have been advised not to venture into deep sea from today,” said the SRC.Jena further said the NDMA has asked all states to be prepared for the possible cyclonic storm. As part of preparatory measures, teams of the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) and Odisha Disaster Rapid Action Force (ODRAF) and Fire Services have been sent to the districts likely to be affected by the cyclone.Jena said all officials have been asked to bring down high mast lights installed at various locations in urban areas. Advertisement boards like billboards and hoardings will also be removed. The Regional Meteorological Centre, Bhubaneswar, has predicted heavy rainfall for several places including all six coastal districts of Ganjam, Bhadrak, Balasore, Kendrapara, Jagatsinghpur and Puri over the next 5 days. Besides, heavy to very heavy rainfall will occur in several interior districts.The Indian Coast Guard too, is closely monitoring the weather development and has initiated pre-emptive/preventive measures directing fishing boats to return to harbour for safety. Radar Stations of the Coast Guard in West Bengal and Odisha have also started transmitting weather warnings over VHF at regular intervals both in English and in vernacular language to alert Merchant Vessels and fishing boats operating at sea.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ahead-of-cyclone-yaas-odisha-is-ready-with-evacuation-plans-101621621132939.html
21-05-2021||India||Child rights panel plans database to help children who lost parents to the pandemic||New Delhi: the National Commission for Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR) is working on a centralised digital database to monitor and help children who have lost both their parents to Covid-19, officials familiar with the matter said. The database will help the Commission follow up regularly on the status of the vulnerable children and intervene wherever necessary. The platform, which is currently under development, is likely to go live before the end of the week. “The database and software will help in removing the bottlenecks in terms of the problems the vulnerable children are facing,” one of the officials said on the condition of anonymity. “The schemes available for child welfare, such as sponsorship will also be integrated with this database.”NCPCR, on May 2, sought details from the states regarding the number of such vulnerable children. The data, the officials added, is still in the process of being collated. The first official added that the database will help link the states with the centre to ensure seamless aid for the vulnerable children. The issue has become a point of concern after posts on social media seemed to suggest that children who had lost both parents to Covid-19 amidst the pandemic’s raging second wave, were up for adoption. The move prompted the ministry of women and child development to write to the union health ministry to seek the parents’ directions for children, in case neither of the parents survive the virus. The ministry had sought a that a section should be added to the hospital admission form, wherein parents may declare the details of trusthworthy person to hand the children over to in the event of unforeseeable circumstances. WCD minister Smriti Irani also took to Twitter to warn people from adopting children directly as it is illegal . The ministry fears that this could make orphans vulnerable to trafficking.According to state government officials, the number of such vulnerable children is not very high. A Rajasthan official said that only three such cases had been flagged to it. “The cases were found in Kota, Fatehpur and Sikar,” said state child rights Commission chair Sangeeta Beniwal. “We have ensured timely assistance and rehabilitation.”In Chhattisgarh, one such case was identified in Raipur. “Such cases are rare in the state,” said a State Commission for Protection of Child Rights official on the condition of anonymity. “One such case was found; the child was presented in front of the Child Welfare Committee (CWC) and has now been sent to stay with relatives.”The official added that the greater challenge was the impact of Covid-19 on children staying in welfare homes. “Many of these have been turned into Covid care centres,” the official said. “Across 90 homes, there is a strength of 2000 children, of which 128 have tested positive.” Officials in Odisha said that they are yet to find any such case in the state but a data collection exercise is ongoing. States such as Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Gujarat, and Delhi have already stated that the government will take responsibility for children orphaned due to the pandemic. Congress party president Sonia Gandhi on Thursday wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi to ensure free education for such children.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/child-rights-panel-plans-database-to-help-children-who-lost-parents-to-the-pandemic-101621621010686.html
21-05-2021||India||HC orders house arrest of 4 TMC leaders in Narada case||The Calcutta high court on Friday ordered four heavyweight Bengal politicians be kept under house arrest after a difference of opinion split the two-judge bench on granting the leaders interim bail in a corruption case. Senior ministers Firhad Hakim and Subrata Mukherjee, Trinamool Congress (TMC) legislator Madan Mitra and former Kolkata mayor Sovan Chatterjee will be placed under house arrest, the court said. A five-judge bench, headed by acting chief justice of Calcutta high court Rajesh Bindal, formed later in the day is expected to hear the matter at 11 am next week on Monday. The four have been in judicial custody since Monday after the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) arrested them in connection with the 2016 Narada bribery sting operation. “There was a difference of opinion between acting chief justice Rajesh Bindal and justice Arijit Banerjee over the bail plea of the four accused. So, the division bench ordered that a large bench be constituted to hear the matter. Till then, the four accused would be kept under house arrest,” said Manishankhar Chatterjee, Subrata Mukherjee’s advocate. The four had secured bail from a special CBI court on Monday but hours later, the high court stayed the order. CJ Bindal was opposed to vacating the stay but justice Banerjee favoured it.On Friday, advocate Kalyan Banerjee, representing Subrata Mukherjee, told the court that Hakim’s presence was necessary for managing the Covid crisis in Kolkata. “As two of the accused persons are ministers in the state government, the court also permitted them access to administrative files and to meet government officials through video conferencing,” said Manishankhar Chatterjee.As per the court order, “government officials will not have any direct access to the accused. Meetings can be held through video conference and files can be sent to them online. A complete log of the video conference will be maintained. Record of any person visiting the house of the accused has to be maintained. Jail authorities will install CCTVs at the entry point of the houses. Any lapse shall be seriously viewed.” The four leaders were hospitalised after complaining of illness on Tuesday. Hakim was admitted to Presidency Correctional Home’s hospital while the rest to state-run SSKM Hospital. The hospital authorities have set up a medical board to treat them. While Hakim returned home late on Friday, the other three accused were still undergoing treatment at SSKM Hospital. Soon after returning home, Hakim held a virtual meeting with officials of Kolkata Municipal Corporation to take stock of the preparedness for cyclone Yaas that is expected to hit the state on May 26. The case against the four pertains to news portal Narada News’s two-year-long sting operation. The videos of the operation were uploaded months ahead of the 2016 West Bengal assembly elections and purportedly showed some TMC leaders accepting money in exchange for alleged favours to a fictitious company. TMC has linked the arrests to Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)’s loss in the recently concluded assembly polls. It has questioned why CBI didn’t arrest Suvendu Adhikari and Mukul Roy, who were also seen in the sting videos but have since switched from TMC to BJP. CBI’s plea to transfer the Narada trial out of the state is also pending before the high court. The CBI hasnamed West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee, law minister Moloy Ghatak, and lawmaker Kalyan Banerjee as respondents in its plea to transfer the case out of the state. It claimed violent protests orchestrated by the TMC against the arrests hampered its probe and intimidated lower courts. Banerjee staged a six-hour dharna at the CBI’s office in Kolkata after the four were arrested on Monday. Ghatak led nearly 3,000 workers and supporters to the court premises. Outside CBI’s office, hundreds of TMC supporters staged a protest and threw bricks, bottles, and shoes at central forces.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hc-orders-house-arrest-of-4-tmc-leaders-in-narada-case-101621620891920.html

"It has come to our knowledge that a false statement is being circulated online which implies that an 'Indian variant' of coronavirus is spreading across the countries. This is completely FALSE. There is no such variant of Covid-19 scientifically cited as such by the World Health Organisation (WHO). WHO has not associated the term "Indian Variant" with the B.1.617 variant of the coronavirus in any of its reports," the ministry of electronics and information technology wrote.On May 12, the Centre clarified that there is no Indian variant of coronavirus as the World Health Organization does not name any variant after the country where it has been first reported from.Several reports categorised B.1.617 as an Indian variant after WHO classified this strain as a variant of global concern. This was the fourth variant after those first detected in Britain, Brazil and South Africa, but WHO did not mention it as an Indian variant as it does not conform to its practice of naming variant strains."WHO does not identify viruses or variants with names of countries they are first reported from. We refer to them by their scientific names and request all to do the same for consistency," WHO said.The Singapore government has also asked Facebook, Twitter to carry a correction notice to users in the country as Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal said the new variant found in Singapore is more dangerous to children. This comment snowballed into a political controversy as Singapore authorities said there is no Singapore variant and the recent spike of Covid-19 cases is actually due to the strain first detected in India. India's foreign ministry too reacted to Kejriwal's comment saying he does not speak for India.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/remove-content-that-mentions-indian-covid-variant-centre-writes-to-all-social-media-platforms-101621619319621.html
21-05-2021||India||Why the gap between Covaxin doses has not been extended, Centre explains||The gap between the two doses of Covid-19 vaccines has become a crucial issue as the Centre has revised the gap between two doses of Covishield twice since the beginning of the vaccination drive in January. First, the two doses were meant to be administered four to six weeks apart. Later, the Centre revised it to four to eight weeks. Now the gap has been increased to 12 to 16 weeks.However, the gap between the two doses of Covaxin, the vaccine developed by Bharat Biotech, has remained unchanged.Explaining the difference, Indian Council of Medical Research chief Dr Balram Bhargava has recently said that the decision to extend the gap for Covishield and not to extend the gap for Covaxin has been determined by the effectiveness of the first dose of the vaccine.The first dose of Covishield results in a greater immunity which remains effective for around 12 weeks. Hence, the decision to delay the second dose has been taken, but no such finding is available for Covaxin, Dr Bhargava said.Terming it as evolving science, Dr Bhargava said vaccines came for the first time in the world on December 15 and so new developments are coming and will continue to come. "It has been seen that the first dose of Covishield results in a great deal of protection, which can stay around 12 weeks. But you do not achieve a similar kind of protection after the first dose of Covaxin. It is only after both the doses of Covaxin are administered, the protection reaches the optimum level," Dr Bhargava said.It is the same reason why people recovering from Covid-19 infection are also being advised to delay their vaccination, Dr Bhargava said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/why-the-gap-between-covaxin-doses-has-not-been-extended-centre-explains-101621617812475.html

21-05-2021||India||Navneet Kalra, Gagan Duggal imported 7000 oxygen concentrators from China: ED||The Enforcement Directorate (ED) on Friday raided the premises of businessmen -- Navneet Kalra and Gagan Duggal - - in connection with its money laundering probe into alleged hoarding and black marketing of oxygen concentrators, people familiar with the development said. Among the places raided include their residences at Mandi Road at South Delhi’s Mehrauli, Kalra’s restaurants – Khan Chacha, Town Hall, and Nega & Ju as well as Dayal Opticals in upscale Khan Market, officials said. A team separately searched Kalra’s bank lockers. From Kalra’s residence, the ED team recovered 150 foreign brand liquor bottles, officials told HT. The agency said that UK-based businessman Gagan Duggal – managing director of Matrix Cellular International Services Limited (Matrix), was working with Kalra in importing the concentrators to India and selling them at inflated prices. ED’s probe, according to the two officials cited above, has revealed that both Kalra and Duggal had imported more than 7,000 oxygen concentrators from China in the past one month and sold them to people at exorbitant prices by claiming that the concentrators were made with German technology. “The forensic examination of the concentrators has revealed that they were low quality equipment. Kalra and Duggal bought these in China and the same were routed to India via Hong Kong,” said the first officer, who didn’t want to be named. The ED probe has further revealed that the import price per unit of oxygen concentrator for Kalra and Duggal was ₹15,000 but they were charging ₹69,999 per unit from people. “The duo took advantage of a raging pandemic and made huge profit by cheating the public,” said another ED officer, who also requested anonymity. The agency had registered a case earlier this week to investigate the money trail of sale and purchase of oxygen concentrators and beneficiaries of hoarded concentrators. The federal anti-money laundering probe agency has powers to attach properties if established that money made by the accused is proceeds of crime. Kalra’s dramatic arrest from a farmhouse in Gurugram took place on Sunday even as lawyers were trying to obtain an anticipatory bail for him from the Delhi high court throughout the week. He is currently in judicial custody. He was being looked for since the recovery of 524 oxygen concentrators from three of his restaurants – Khan Chacha, Town Hall and Nege & Ju – and from the office of Matrix Cellular on May 7. Duggal’s company – Matrix – had issued a statement after Delhi Police action stating that – “All materials procured by Matrix have been by way of import or purchase in India, after paying all relevant duties and taxes. Matrix has thereafter facilitated sale of such equipment / materials via its app or direct orders placed on the company, all of which have used formal banking channels based on tax invoices with an unimpeachable audit trail. Separately, as part of our corporate social responsibility program, the company has donated over 200 oxygen concentrators, 10,000 masks, across the country; while also committing a donation of 200 oxygen concentrators to reputable organizations” “The baseless allegations and misguided investigation, shall be fiercely contested by Matrix and very soon we will be back to doing what we should be - which is helping Delhi,” the company had stated. “Matrix has filed documents before the Delhi High Court that prove the allegations of exorbitant pricing and deficient quality of oxygen concentrators is misplaced and incorrect. Matrix unequivocally denies any wrongdoing in the matter. The matter is currently before the Courts and Matrix has faith that the legal process will vindicate it,” Samudra Sarangi, lead counsel for Matrix said. Kalra’s counsel - Senior Advocate Vikas Pahwa didn’t comment on the matter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/navneet-kalra-gagan-duggal-imported-7000-oxygen-concentrators-from-china-ed-101621615790904.html
21-05-2021||India||Rebel YSR lawmaker Raju gets bail from SC, barred from speaking on sedition case||The Supreme Court on Friday granted bail to rebel YSR Congress Party member of Parliament Kanmuri Raghurama Krishnam Raju but barred him from speaking to the media on the sedition charges filed against him. The top court accepted the lawmaker’s request after going through his medical report which confirmed that he had suffered a fractured toe and injuries in his leg. Raju, who was arrested last week by the Andhra Pradesh police on charges of sedition and hate speech, had attributed the injuries to torture by the police. The Andhra Pradesh police have denied torture. At Friday’s hearing, senior lawyer Dushyant Dave, who appeared for the state government, said the injuries could be “self-inflicted” but the bench questioned this theory, maintaining that he had been in police custody all along.The bench comprising Justices Vineet Saran and BR Gavai ordered Raju to furnish a personal bond of ₹1 lakh with two sureties of the like amount. But the bench also imposed a gag order, prohibiting him from speaking on the case with the media. The police can question him if required but will have to give him 24-hour notice. Also, the judges ruled that Raju’s lawyer will remain present at a distance during interrogation.Kanmuri Raghurama Krishnam Raju, who represents the Narasapuram Lok Sabha seat in Andhra Pradesh’s West Godavari district, has been a sharp critic of chief minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy for nearly a year. The state CID has accused Raju of sedition by pointing to his statements over the past year where he allegedly incited members of a community, religion or caste to beat and even kill members of another community or religion.The sedition case was filed against him weeks after he petitioned a CBI court to cancel the chief minister’s bail in a 2002 disproportionate assets case.Raju was arrested by Andhra Pradesh’s Crime Investigation Department on May 14. The following day when his application for remand was to be considered, the magistrate noticed injuries in his leg. Raju claimed he was tortured in custody by police but the state denied it.A three-member medical board of government doctors set up by the high court ruled out torture. Raju approached the top court for bail on May 15, alleging that he had been tortured by the police. Another medical board set up by the head of the army hospital in Secunderabad reported on Friday that the MP had a fractured toe and injuries in his leg leading to swelling of leg, contusions and clotting of blood at spots.The bench was prima facie convinced that the petitioner possibly was ill-treated during custody and noted his poor medical condition in the context of bypass surgery in December 2020.Dave pointed out that while being transported from Hyderabad to the army hospital, almost a 300-kilometre drive, Raju refused to travel in the state ambulance and insisted on traveling in his private car, flashing his injured leg to the waiting media persons. Deprecating this conduct, the bench told senior lawyer Mukul Rohatgi who was representing the MP. “This conduct of the petitioner to go in a private car was not proper. Tell him not to publicise his injuries. Next time we will take a strict view of this.”Referring to the charges against him, the Andhra government argued: “Even an ordinary citizen won’t get the protection of the law for making such statements and certainly not an MP who is expected to be responsible in his conduct.” Rohatgi objected to this charge claiming that the case against him amounted to “state-sponsored terrorism” as his client sought cancellation of bail granted to the chief minister in a clutch of criminal cases.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rebel-ysr-lawmaker-raju-gets-bail-from-sc-barred-from-speaking-on-sedition-case-101621614230729.html
21-05-2021||India||Kerala extends lockdown till May 30 as spike in daily Covid-19 deaths continue||Kerala on Friday extended the ongoing lockdown till May 30, chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan said. The triple lockdown too, imposed in the four worst-affected districts will be withdrawn except Malappuram. The CM indicated that both the test positivity rate and active cases had gone down slightly in the last two weeks but the time was not yet ripe to lower guard. One of the five states which registered the highest number of infections, Kerala has been under lockdown since May 7. Later, a triple lockdown (strict provisions) was imposed in four more districts-- Thiruvananthapuram, Ernakulam, Thrissur and Malappuram. “There is no let-up in cases in Malappuram. Its TPR is still high. Senior police officers will be camping in the district to take stock of the situation. We have to continue our vigil in other parts of the state though cases are coming down slightly,” he said. In the last three days, the average TPR in Malappuram was 33 per cent. Kerala reported 29,673 new Covid-19 cases on Friday when 1,33,558 people were tested with a test positivity rate of 22.22 per cent. But what is worrying is that the death rate is going up steadily. The state reported 142 deaths on Friday, the highest since the outbreak began last year. Its mortality rate is the lowest in the country 0.4 per cent against the national average of 1.30 per cent. In the last one-week the state reported 751 deaths. Active cases have also gone down slightly, 3,06,346-- two weeks back it almost touched 4.75 lakh, according to the health ministry statistics. Fearing an exodus of migrant labourers the government has started giving free food kits to them and asked contractors and builders to ensure their well-being. According to latest data around 20 lakh people from other states are working in the state especially in construction and unorganised sectors-- out of this nearly seven lakh people have left the state in three months after the second wave swept the state. Kerala is the first state to report a Coronavirus case in the country. A China-returned medical student last year was the first Covid-19 patient in Kerala. During the first wave, the state did well but in the second it floundered with healthcare like the rest of the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-extends-lockdown-till-may-30-as-spike-in-daily-covid-19-deaths-continue-101621613330765.html
21-05-2021||India||Supreme Court stays Allahabad HC's 'Ram bharose' Covid order, says 'not implementable'||The Supreme Court on Friday stayed the recent order passed by the Allahabad high court in which the high court suggested several measured for the development of medical infrastructure in the state and observed that the entire healthcare system in villages and small cities of the state was "Ram bharose" (at God's mercy), reports said.A vacation bench of Justices Vineet Saran and BR Gavai said the high court consider looking into the possibility of implementation while passing any directions and should refrain if such direction is not implementable.“Such directions cannot be implemented and it shall be treated as advice and not directions. The state government, which will work to provide facilities to the people will keep in mind the advice of the High Court”, it said.The observations of the vacation bench come as it was hearing the submissions made by solicitor general Tushar Mehta, who was representing Uttar Pradesh government. While the "directions" of the Allahabad high court are "well-meaning", they are difficult to implement, Mehta told the apex court, as reported by Livelaw.On May 17, the Allahabad high court chastised the Uttar Pradesh government's handling of the Covid-19 pandemic and said if the situation of Meerut is such that a patient goes missing and then his body is disposed of as unidentified, then the situation of the smaller cities and villages can only be "Ram bharose".Such observations will have a demoralising effect on the health care professionals in the state, Tushar Mehta said.The remark was for a specific incident of the death of one Santosh Kumar, who was admitted to an isolation ward of a hospital in Meerut. The body of the 64-year-old was disposed of as unidentified as the hospital could not locate his file.The high court bench comprising justice Siddhartha Varma and justice Ajit Kumar directed that all nursing homes should have oxygen bed facilities and the medical college hospitals of the states should be upgraded to the level of Sanjay Gandhi Postgraduate Institute within four months. The high court also directed they every village in the state should be provided with two ambulances with ICU facilities within a month.Taking note of this direction of providing all villages with two ambulances with ICU facilities, the Supreme Court bench said that it would not be "humanly possible" as Uttar Pradesh has 97,000 villages.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/supreme-court-stays-allahabad-high-court-s-ram-bharose-covid-order-101621612584654.html

21-05-2021||India||'Faster than the virus': India's financial hub gears up for a third Covid wave||India's crowded financial hub Mumbai won plaudits this year for tackling the second wave of the pandemic better than any other metropolis in the country - and it is gearing up to get ahead of a potential third wave that experts fear could affect children.Mumbai is building four mammoth centres across the city with units for children infected with Covid-19 and it is working closely with a special task force that includes some of India's top paediatricians, the city's civic chief said. "If a 2-year-old child becomes highly symptomatic, how can you deposit the child in hospital without the mother?" Mumbai's Municipal Commissioner Iqbal Singh Chahal told Reuters. "We have already started preparing for that. ... One should be faster than the virus." With more than 25 million infections, India has the world's second-largest caseload after the United States and many of its states have been grappling with a lack of hospital beds and inadequate oxygen and medical supplies. Mumbai, in India's richest state, Maharashtra, struggled initially with one of the highest caseloads in the country but reined in the virus with strict lockdowns, widespread testing and a decentralised Covid management system.Chahal, widely credited for successfully managing the surge there, said the four Covid care centres with paediatric units, as good as hospitals, will be able to house more than a thousand children along with a parent.The facilities, which will also have intensive-care units (ICUs), will be ready by next month, well before experts predict the third wave will hit, said Chahal, adding that there is ample funding from the state, companies and even Bollywood celebrities.The city is spending tens of millions of dollars to build the paediatric units and is already procuring ventilators, monitors and other medical equipment, Chahal said.Apart from these units, the government is also in talks with hospitals to increase the number of paediatric beds and ICUs. The paediatric task force, led by Dr Suhas Prabhu, plans to train about 660 paediatricians on how to handle children affected by Covid-19, and then broaden the training to more staff.The third wave might not end up affecting children greatly, but cities like Mumbai cannot afford to be caught off guard, Prabhu said. The Mumbai ModelChahal was handpicked by Maharashtra's Chief Minister Udhhav Thackeray in May last year to lead the city's response when the virus hit.Chahal, the son of an army officer, set up local Covid "war rooms" in 24 zones in the city to decentralise the pressure and hasten the response.Even as other cities in Maharashtra continue to report high numbers, Mumbai's cases have plunged, says Prince Surana, a doctor who runs three hospitals in the city.But Chahal says Mumbai is not out of the woods.The city, like the rest of India, is still grappling with an acute shortage of vaccines.The city has floated a global tender to acquire 10 million doses from private companies, Chahal said."If we get the vaccines, in 60 days we can fully vaccinate Mumbai and negate the threat of a third wave," he said. "That's my biggest challenge and we are on it now."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/faster-than-the-virus-india-s-financial-hub-gears-up-for-a-third-covid-wave-101621604867236.html
21-05-2021||India||Labour ministry hikes variable dearness allowance for workers in central sphere||The Ministry of Labour & Employment on Friday announced a hike in variable dearness allowance for more than 1.5 crore workers in the central sphere by ₹105 to ₹210 per month.The hike, which will be effective from April 1, 2021, will also result in an increase in rate of minimum wages for central sphere employees and workers.It will be for scheduled employment in central sphere and applicable to the establishments under the authority of central government, railway administration, mines, oil fields, major ports or any corporation established by the central government. These rates are equally applicable to contract and casual employees/workers.Talking to PTI, Chief Labour Commissioner Central (CLC) D P S Negi said, "the dearness hike ranges from ₹105 to ₹210 per month for workers in the central sphere".In a statement, the labour ministry said it has notified and revised the rate of Variable Dearness Allowance (VDA) with effect from April 1, 2021.This will be a major relief to different category of workers engaged in various scheduled employments in the central sphere at a time when the country is struggling with the second wave of the Co-19 pandemic, it added.The VDA is revised on the basis of average Consumer Price Index for Industrial Workers (CPI-IW), a price index compiled by the Labour Bureau.The average CPI-IW for of July to December 2020 was used for undertaking the latest VDA revision.Labour Minister Santosh Gangwar said the revision will benefit about 1.50 crore workers engaged in various scheduled employments in the central sphere across the country. "This hike in VDA will support these workers particularly in the current pandemic times".The enforcement of Minimum Wages Act in the central sphere is ensured through the Inspecting Officers of Chief Labour Commissioner (Central) across the country for employees engaged in the scheduled employment in the central sphere.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/labour-ministry-hikes-variable-dearness-allowance-for-workers-in-central-sphere-101621609114042.html
21-05-2021||India||Centre sends black fungus advisory to states, alerts about other infections||The Union health ministry on Friday wrote to all states and Union territories urging them to ensure all Covid-19 hospitals and other health care facilities adhere to infection prevention and control practices. This comes in the backdrop of PM Modi highlighting the threat of mucormycosis or black fungus. Taking note of the sudden rise in the number of black fungus cases, the centre said the states must remain prepared to tackle "secondary and opportunistic fungal infections which are getting amplified due to the present surge in Covid cases".In its advisory, the Centre said that in due course, the states and UTs are expected to establish surveillance with a focus on ventilator-associated pneumonia, catheter-associated blood stream infection, catheter-associated urinary tract infection, surgical site infections, gastro-intestinal outbreaks.Black fungus: Here is a list of states with highest number of mucormycosis casesOpportunistic infections are those which affects the body when the immune system is weak. Amid the sudden surge of black fungus cases in the country, doctors have emphasised that mucormycosis is not a new infection. The spores of this fungus are present in the air, soil and even food. Cases of this infection surfaced during the SARS outbreak in 2003 as well, but the so-called rare disease is on the rise in India at present because of certain medical conditions, partially caused by Covid-19 treatment. Hospitals must prepare and implement an overall Infection Prevention Control programme following the ministry's National Guidelines for Infection and Control in Healthcare Facilities, the Centre said. The emergence of mucormycosis amid the second wave of the pandemic caught the country's healthcare system unprepared as it was already under the pressure of rising Covid-19 cases. The production of Amphotericin b, a black fungus drug, was also limited till April. Now as the Centre is ramping up the production of the drug and states are setting up exclusive facilities to treat black fungus cases, the focus should be on being prepared for similar possible infections. "Infection Prevention and Control practices need to be enhanced in ICUs using a bundle-approach to prevent device-associated infections such as ventilator-associated pneumonia or catheter-associated blood stream, urinary infections etc," the Centre said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-sends-black-fungus-advisory-to-states-alerts-about-other-infections-101621608709013.html
21-05-2021||India||I want to inspire young ones, says Tashi Yangjom, the first Indian woman climber to scale Mt Everest in 2021||The pandemic could only delay, not dissuade Tashi Yangjom. The 27-year-old saw five years of practice bear fruit as she scaled Mt Everest, becoming the first Indian woman to climb the peak in 2021. She scaled the famed peak by 6am on May 11, completing the mission she had started on April 4. And accolades poured in for the climber from Lubrang village in Dirang tehsil of West Kameng district in Arunachal Pradesh. Among those who congratulated her were Union sports minister Kiren Rijiju, who tweeted: “I extend my heartiest congratulations to Ms Tashi Yangjom from Arunachal Pradesh for scaling Mt. Everest & becoming the first Indian woman climber to Everest in 2021…”“Congratulations Ms Tashi Yangjom for scaling Mt. Everest and becoming the first Indian lady climber to Summit Everest this Season. Regular Training at @DirangNimas has made her a strong mountaineer with blitzkrieg speed,” wrote chief minister of Arunachal Pradesh, Pema Khandu in his congratulatory tweet.Ever since Yangjom joined the National Institute of Mountaineering and Allied Sports (NIMAS) located in Dirang in 2016, where she’s now an instructor, she aspired to climb the peak. The target, set for last year, was delayed by the pandemic. “Main bohot khush hun. I always wanted to wave the Indian flag at the top and I’m very thankful for the support and financial aid I received,” says Yangjom, now stuck in Kathmandu where she reached after her climb, due to travel restrictions. Recalling her journey, she credits her persistent training and motivation from other trainers that kept pushing her. “Before joining, I didn’t know much about adventure earlier. I got the inspiration from instructors, and I understood the guidelines better. Main ek bohot chote pahadi area se hun, so not many people know about adventure or mountaineering here,” says Yangjom who is from the Brokpa, a yak herding tribe, as she also credits her childhood hill treks and persistence of instructors at NIMAS for her feat.She also adds, “I want to set an example and make path for young ones to get started and inspire them.”The love and appreciation received from her family after achieving this victory is beyond belief to her as Yangjom states that her parents were apprehensive of letting her choose mountaineering as a profession earlier. “Ek saal laga mummy papa ko convince karne mein kyunki they were scared of the consequences. Bohot dangerous laga unhe sun ke continuously glacier mein jaana hota hai.” She also expresses her view on Nepal’s recent appeal to Everest climbers to bring empty oxygen tanks from the peak. She says, “It all depends on the climber’s strength and sherpa’s assistance kyunki itna height pe ek water bottle uthani ki energy bhi nahi bachti hai. Par shayad dono mil ke kar sakte hai.”Yangjom is now aiming to create more records such as climbing Mt Makalu, the fifth highest mountain in the world and participating in Seven Summits.Author tweets @sanchita_kalra.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/i-want-to-inspire-young-ones-says-tashi-yangjom-the-first-indian-woman-climber-to-scale-mt-everest-in-2021-101621607749936.html
21-05-2021||India||'Such a travesty': Harsh Vardhan to Chidambaram's doubt over India's Covid data||Nothing but political compulsions are forcing Congress leader P Chidambaram to express unnecessary doubts over India's Covid-19 figures, Union minister Dr Harsh Vardhan said on Friday, in a scathing reply to one of Chidambaram's tweets. The Congress leader is "certainly" privy to the knowledge that the time duration between contracting Covid-19 and recovery or mortality mostly exceeds a few weeks, the health minister tweeted.What P Chidambaram argued was that if the positivity rate is going down in the country, then why the daily toll remains above 4,000. His tweet was meant for doctors and experts whom he urged to clarify whether the daily death toll is a result of any lack in the healthcare infrastructure. Going by the data of the Union health ministry, the number of daily Covid-19 infections has now come down to around 2.5 lakh, which was over four lakh a few weeks ago. But the same decline has not been noticed in daily deaths as the country on Friday too reported 4,209 deaths.Vaccines to all adults by end of year: Health minister Harsh VardhanWhy raise unnecessary doubts?As cases have been declining, recoveries have started reflecting an upward trajectory, & the mortalities shall show a decline too.Each death is most unfortunate, GoI is moving heaven & earth to fight this #pandemic#Unite2FightCorona @INCIndiaClarifying that it will take some time to reflect the decline in the number of daily mortalities, the health minister said, each death is most unfortunate and the government is moving heaven and earth to fight this pandemic. In his jibe against Chidambaram, the health minister also dragged the ongoing toolkit controversy and said such orders (to raise such questions) come from the "toolkit party".The BJP has accused the Congress of preparing a toolkit to defame PM Modi by building a biased and false narrative of the central government's handling of the second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic and the Central Vista Project. The BJP has also named Saumya Varma as the author of the toolkit, while the Congress said Varma is part of Congress's research cell.India's daily Covid-19 positivity rate has declined to 12.59 per cent though the number of tests being conducted per day remains around 20 lakh and is expected to go higher in the coming months.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/such-a-travesty-harsh-vardhan-to-chidambaram-s-doubt-over-india-s-covid-data-101621604112842.html
21-05-2021||India||Bengal minister quits assembly to help CM Mamata contest old seat||Bengal’s agriculture minister Sovandeb Chattopaddhyay, who won from the Bhawanipore constituency in south Kolkata in the recent polls, resigned from the state assembly on Friday so that Mamata Banerjee can once again contest the seat she represented twice since 2011. Banerjee took oath as chief minister on May 5 though she lost from Nandigram in East Midnapore district. According to rules, she has to get elected within six months. After serving in Banerjee’s cabinet, Suvendu Adhikari, who joined the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in December last year, defeated her in Nandigram, his old seat. He is now leader of the opposition in the state assembly. “My party did not ask me to resign. I was under no pressure. I took the decision as a sincere worker of the Trinamool Congress (TMC) so that Mamata can contest from Bhawanipore again,” Chattopadhyay said after putting in his papers. “Her role in state and national politics is more important right now,” he added. “Chattopadhyay came to my office a little after 2.30 pm and submitted his resignation. He said it is his voluntarily decision. I have accepted it,” said speaker Biman Banerjee. The TMC routed the opposition by winning 213 seats. Following Chattopadhyay’s resignation, Bhawanipore becomes the sixth assembly seat to fall vacant. The state assembly has 294 seats but polls were held in 292 as two candidates of two seats in Murshidabad district died of Covid-19 before elections were held. The BJP won 77 seats but its tally came down to 75 as two of its winning candidates resigned to retain their Lok Sabha seats. As a result, two seats are lying vacant in Nadia and Cooch Behar districts. The Khardah seat in North 24 Parganas is also vacant as the TMC’s winning candidate died of Covid-19 before the results were announced on May 2. The Election Commission (EC) has not declared poll schedule for any of these seats. TMC leaders said Banerjee will decide what role Chattopadhyay, one of the oldest leaders of the TMC, will play. He may contest any of the vacant seats. The party also has the option of sending him to the Rajya Sabha as a seat is vacant because Dinesh Trivedi joined the BJP. Chattopadhyay, 77, however said he is too old to go to Parliament. Like Banerjee, finance minister Amit Mitra also needs to get elected. He did not contest the polls. Mitra earlier represented the Khardah seat. On May 17, Banerjee cleared a cabinet decision to form Vidhan Parishad, or the legislative council of the state assembly, which she promised before the polls. Banerjee said eminent people as well as veteran leaders who were not nominated for the assembly elections would be made members of the Vidhan Parishad. Since Vidhan Parishad members can become ministers, Mitra can be inducted in the Upper House as the members are elected by civic body members and legislators. However, according to Article 169 of the Constitution, the Parliament has to pass a bill for creation of the Vidhan Parishad and the President’s assent is also mandatory. The process may take more than six months. In such a scenario, Mitra has to contest any of the vacant assembly seats, TMC leaders said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bengal-minister-quits-assembly-to-help-cm-mamata-contest-old-seat-101621603849670.html

21-05-2021||India||Centre asks Twitter to drop manipulated media tag from ‘toolkit’ tweets||The Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology has sent a strongly worded notice to microblogging platform Twitter, for affixing the manipulated media tag to “tweets made by Indian political leaders with reference to a toolkit created to undermine, derail and demean the efforts of the Government against the Covid-19 pandemic”. An official familiar with the matter said that in its communication, the ministry has stated that a complaint has already been made by one of the concerned parties before local law enforcement and the veracity of the toolkit is under investigation. The ministry has stated that Twitter’s decision to use the manipulated media tag appears “prejudged and prejudiced”. “While the local law enforcement agency is undertaking the investigation to determine the veracity of the ‘tookit’, Twitter has unilaterally drawn a conclusion in this matter and arbitrarily tagged it as ‘Manipulated Media’,” the ministry has stated, said the official. “Such tagging by Twitter appears prejudged, prejudiced and a deliberate attempt to colour the investigation by local law enforcement agency.” HT reached out to Twitter but did not receive a response immediately. The government’s directive comes barely hours after Twitter tagged a May 18 post by BJP spokesperson Sambit Patra as “manipulated media”, in which Patra alleged that the Congress had circulated a document that outlined ways to defame Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The BJP alleged the toolkit was aimed at building a biased narrative over the Indian government’s handling of the second wave of Covid-19, and the Central Vista Project. Many top BJP leaders, including its chief JP Nadda and Union ministers Smriti Irani, Ravi Shankar Prasad, Hardeep Puri, Anurag Thakur, Piyush Goyal, amplified Patra’s tweet. Congress accused the BJP of concocting the document on Covid-19 to defame the opposition party. It wrote to Twitter on Thursday seeking action against Patra and other BJP leaders for “grossly misusing” the platform. The Congress accused the BJP of indulging in “large-scale dissemination of false information”, which “has the potential to cause social unrest in the country”.The Ministry has termed the “unilateral action by Twitter as an effort to influence the fair investigation process and a clear overreach, which is totally unwarranted”. It further added that the action dilutes the credibility of the platform. “This action not only dilutes the credibility of Twitter as a neutral and unbiased platform facilitating exchange of views by the users but also puts a question mark on the status of Twitter as an “Intermediary”.The ministry has asked Twitter to remove the “prejudicial” tag in the interest of “fairness and equity”.Patra, on May 18, had tweeted, “Friends look at the #CongressToolKit in extending help to the needy during the Pandemic!

21-05-2021||India||Visit ENT doctor when you have these symptoms: What experts say on black fungus||Though most of the case of black fungus or mucormycosis are taking place among patients who are already admitted in hospitals for Covid-19 treatment, doctors are advising people to not neglect symptoms like swelling at any part of the face, eyesight problem or pain on one side the head. If a person recovering from Covid-19 encounters these issues, then the immediate next step is to consult an ENT surgeon.As the second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic in India is gradually coming under control with the number of daily infections coming down, the black fungus has emerged as the new threat. Prime Minister Narendra Modi during his interaction with doctors, paramedical staff on Friday mentioned mucormycosis as the new challenge and said there is a need for precaution and preparation.Amid outbreak, AIIMS director lists three key factors to prevent 'black fungus'ब्लैक फंगस को लेकर लोगों में काफी भय है, इसे कैसे समझें?@PrakashJavdekar @MIB_India @PIB_India @shashidigital #Unite2FightCorona pic.twitter.com/W3kdTWythfExperts including AIIMS director Randeep Guleria, AIIMS doctor Piyush Ranjan have said once infected, early detection of this fungal infection can save patients' lives. For this, a Covid patient should examine the full face in daylight for facial swelling around the nose, cheek and the eyes, discolouration, pain etc. Loosening of teeth, black areas inside the mouth are other red flags that should be reported to the doctor. one should also keep a check on the blood sugar level during and after the recovery from Covid-19, doctors have advised.Uncontrolled diabetes, misuse of steroid in Covid-19 patients when not required have led to the sudden spike in the number of black fungus cases.Mucormycosis is not contagious and there is no link among the simultaneous surge of cases in many states. The common link is the weakening of the immunity resulted from the probable misuse of steroids.How many cases of black fungus are there in India?According to rough estimates, there are over 7,000 cases of black fungus in the country. So far, Maharashtra has reported the highest number of infections in the country, followed by Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Haryana, Delhi, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Karnataka, Telangana.How many people have died from the infection?According to HT's rally, at least 219 people have died from the infection.How does mucormycosis spread?Mucormycosis is a fungal infection, which can not be transmitted from one person to another.Difference between black fungus and white fungusThere have been reports of white fungus too but not much is known about white fungus officially. The health ministry has not commented on white fungus as yet.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/visit-ent-doctor-when-you-have-these-symptoms-what-experts-say-on-black-fungus-101621601381325.html

To address the issue, the government has been taking measures to ramp up the production of Covaxin.Last week, V K Paul, Member (Health) in the Niti Aayog said Covaxin requires a Biosafety Laboratory-3, a facility which is not available with all.The DBT and the Drug Controller General of India (DCGI) have been asked to identify manufacturers having BSL-3 facility as well as those who can establish such a facility to increase manufacturing sites in India, sources said."The MEA (has been asked) to take up the exercise of identification of Covaxin manufacturing sites globally in consultation with DBT. DoHFW (Department of Health and Family Welfare) may take up the matter with WHO to boost manufacturing of Covaxin," a source said.The DBT has been asked to inform about incentives including royalty being given to Bharat Biotech for grant of licence to manufacture Covaxin on transfer of technology basis.Last month, the DBT announced a plan to significantly ramp up the production of Covaxin.This included roping in three public sector companies -- Haffkine Biopharmaceutical Corporation Ltd, Mumbai, a PSU under the Maharashtra government; Indian Immunologicals Limited (IIL), Hyderabad, a facility under National Dairy; and Bharat Immunologicals and Biologicals Limited (BIBCOL), Bulandshahr, a PSU under the DBT.Paul had said 7.5 crore doses are expected to be produced by August and 10 crore by September.The DBT last week also said Gujarat Biotechnology Research Centre, Department of Science and Technology of the Gujarat government, along with Hester Biosciences and OmniBRx, has also firmed up its discussions with Bharat Biotech to scale up the Covaxin technology and to produce minimum 20 million doses per month.Technology transfer agreements have been finalised with all manufacturers.Separately, plans are on to manufacture the vaccine in Maharashtra and Karnataka.  Last week, the government estimated that by December, the country will have 216 crore vaccines, including 75 crore doses of Covishield and 55 crore doses of Covaxin.Further, Biological E is expected to produce 30 crore doses, Zydus Cadila 5 crore, Serum Institute of India 20 crore doses of Novavax, and Bharat Biotech 10 crore doses of its nasal vaccine, while Gennova will make available 6 crore doses and Sputnik V 15.6 crore doses, he said.The vaccine candidates of Biological E, Zydus Cadila, Gennova, Bharat Biotech's nasal vaccine are in various stages of clinical trials.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/government-exploring-possibility-of-covaxin-production-outside-india-101621599263489.html

There should be no political pressure,” he added.Stalin wrote to President Kovind on Thursday asking him to release the 7 convicts- Nalini Sriharan, Murugan, Santhan, AG Perarivalan, Jayakumar, Robert Payas, and P Ravichandran, who are serving life sentences in various prisons in Tamil Nadu for assassinating Rajiv Gandhi in Sriperumbudur, on May 21, 1991.Stalin told the President that a majority of the political parties and the people of Tamil Nadu are in favour of a remission of their life sentence and an immediate release.“The majority of the political parties in Tamil Nadu have been requesting for the remission of the remainder of their sentence and for immediate release of all the seven convicts as they have been incarcerated for about three decades. It is also the will of the people of Tamil Nadu,” Stalin wrote in his letter.The demand for a release of all seven convicts was approved by the Tamil Nadu cabinet in 2018 through the passing of a unanimous resolution which was then sent to governor Banwarilal Purohit for his assent, who had taken the stand that the fate of the convicts should be decided by the President of India.Nalini Sriharan, one of the accused, donated ₹5,000 to Stalin’s chief minister Public relief fund on Tuesday to aid the state’s fight against Covid-19.

The situation is developing, the officials said.The central force had earmarked a total of 101 teams for the extremely severe cyclonic storm Tauktae that developed in the Arabian Sea and mainly affected the costal areas of Gujarat and states like Maharashtra and Goa, apart from a few others on the western coastline of the country.Tauktae made landfall on Monday night near Una town in Gir Somnath district of Gujarat and wreaked havoc for around 28 hours before it weakened into a depression.Each NDRF team has 47 personnel who are equipped with tree and pole cutters, communication gadgets, inflatable boats and basic medical aid.Due to the Covid-19 spread, these teams have been provided orange-coloured full-bodied personal protection gear that includes a face shield for each rescuer.The NDRF has earlier said that most of its troops deployed for these operations have been vaccinated for coronavirus.Talking about Yaas, the IMD had on Thursday said that a low pressure area is very likely to form over north Andaman Sea and adjoining east-central Bay of Bengal around May 22."It is very likely to intensify gradually into a cyclonic storm during the subsequent 72 hours. It is very likely to move northwestwards and reach West Bengal-Odisha coasts around 26th May evening," the Cyclone Warning Division of the IMD had said.The name Yaas has been given to the potential cyclone by Oman, as per a standard protocol of naming such cyclonic storms in rotation by affected countries in the same area.The name Tauktae was given by Myanmar, and it means gecko or a small lizard.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ndrf-prepares-for-cyclone-yaas-positions-teams-in-bengal-odisha-101621592546560.html
21-05-2021||India||Who gives 'unpronounceable' names to Covid meds, asks KTR. Shashi Tharoor replies||Telangana minister K Taraka Rama Rao, known as KTR, has a strange problem with Covid-19 medicines, which have become household names now amid the ongoing second wave of the coronavirus pandemic. The problem is not their shortage, but the fact that they have "unpronounceable" names, as the minister tweeted "on a lighter note". Listing out the names of the medicines, which includes Posaconazole, Cresemba, Tocilizumab, Remdesivir, Liposomal Amphotericin, Flavipiravir, Molnupiravir, Baricitinib etc. The list is long the minister said, jokingly hinting that Congress leader Shashi Tharoor may have something to do with these names.Playing along with KTR and his humour, Shashi Tharoor said he is not guilty of naming these medicines. Had it been left to him, the Congress leader would have happily called them 'CoroNil', 'CoroZero' and even 'GoCoronaGo'. "But these pharmacists are more procrustean..." Tharoor said. He also accused KTR of floccinaucinihilipilification.I suspect @ShashiTharoor Ji Pakka has a role to play in this 👇 https://t.co/zO024Pq0OaWhile it was made clear that the Congress leader had no hand in naming the medicines, Twitter users were quick to google floccinaucinihilipilification and procrustean. Floccinaucinihilipilification is estimating something asworthless while a procrustean is one who enforces conformity without allowing much variantion.Not guilty! How can you indulge in such floccinaucinihilipilification, @KTRTRS? Left to me I'd happily call them "CoroNil", "CoroZero", & even "GoCoroNaGo!" But these pharmacists are more procrustean.... https://t.co/YrIFSoVquoU guys can thank me anytime in my dm😌 pic.twitter.com/CazXl2DewVWhile 'Coronil', not how Tharoor has spelt it, is an immunity booster of Ramdev's Patanjali Ayurved, 'Go Corona Go' is a slogan given by the Republic Party of India leader Ramdas Athawale in 2020. Towards the end of 2020, Athawala claimed that his slogan was instrumental in driving Corona away and as the mutant strain of the virus found in the United Kingdom started being reported in India, Athawale came up with another slogan 'No Corona, Corona No'.With the resurgence of Covid-19 cases since March-April and that of mucormycosis in May, the names of several medicines have entered the everyday conversation as on various platforms doctors are sensitising people when to take medicine and when not. As 80 per cent of Covid-19 infections can be treated at home, the Union health ministry too has issued a detailed advisory of clinical management specifying which medicine can be taken at what stage of the infection. For example, Remdesivir is not to be given at the early stage — at home, doctors have said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/who-gives-unpronounceable-names-to-covid-meds-asks-ktr-shashi-tharoor-replies-101621590524052.html

He added that since March, Chhattisgarh has recorded a high positivity rate and since May a high number of Covid-19 fatalities have also been recorded.“In genome sequencing, in 20% of the samples we found presence of B.1.617 mutant,” said Vardhan during a video conference with health ministers of nine states and Union territories.The health minister also flagged Himachal Pradesh for recording a whopping number of 35,000 active cases with sample positivity rate of 9.5%. Vardhan said mass gatherings like marriage ceremonies, religious gatherings, local elections, and complacency regarding Covid norms have been highlighted as the cause behind the sudden spike.“In Himachal Pradesh, there are 35,000 active cases, sample positivity is 9.57%. In the past week, Kangra, Mandi, Solan, Shimla and Hamirpur have shown a surge in cases,” he said during the conference.Vardhan also identified Goa as an area of concern with 22,000 active cases and a fatality rate of 1.59%. The state also has four cases of mucormycosis or black fungus and the patients are currently being treated at Goa Medical College.The health minister emphasised that country-wide vaccination efforts need to be ramped up and whichever vaccine is available will have to be administered to people.“I'd like to emphasise that we need to step up Covid vaccination. Whichever vaccines are available to us, we have to give them as fast as possible. In the coming months, there'll be a significant increase in production capacity in the country,” Vardhan said.Chhattisgarh recorded 5,212 new Covid-19 cases and 113 fatalities on Thursday. The entire district of Raigarh was declared a containment zone by the state government on May 16, in a bid to contain the growing number of cases. Goa, which recorded 1,582 new Covid-19 cases on Thursday, has been placed under curfew-like conditions.

The 84-year-old Jesuit priest told the Bombay high court on Friday that he would prefer to die at Taloja jail than be shifted to even JJ Hospital.Swamy told the bench of justices SJ Kathawalla and SP Tavade via video conferencing that when he was arrested and brought to Taloja jail eight months back, he could walk, bathe and eat by himself, but due to the poor conditions inside the jail, his health has deteriorated so he would prefer to be sent to Ranchi instead of being shifted to some hospital. In an earlier hearing on Swamy’s bail application on May 19, the bench had directed the Taloja jail authorities to take him to Sir JJ Hospital. It had also asked the dean to form a committee of expert doctors to examine Swamy and submit its report on May 21. The court had also sought Swamy’s presence through video conferencing on May 21.

On the bench’s suggestion that he be shifted to Sir JJ Hospital, Swamy said, “The condition of prisoners is not good and I would prefer to die here than be shifted to Sir JJ Hospital. I have seen the hospital and would prefer to remain in Taloja jail.” Swamy also declined the suggestion of the bench to shift to some other hospital. The court allowed his counsel, senior advocate Mihir Desai, some time to convince Swamy and posted the hearing of the application on June 7. The court also permitted Desai to approach it if Swamy could be convinced to shift to some other hospital.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/would-rather-die-in-jail-than-be-shifted-to-hospital-stan-swamy-to-hc-101621587468394.html

Be it ramping up the capacity of the existing manufacturers or allowing new manufacturers or enabling the import of the drug, the Centre is on its toes, it said. As a result of this "whole of government" approach, around 5.7 lakh Amphotericin-B vials will be available in the country in June. The per-month availability will also go up as 11 manufacturers, including an importer, are now working towards increasing the supply of the drug in the country.Black fungus: Here is a list of states with highest number of mucormycosis casesMucormycosis is a fungal infection reported among Covid-19 patients, who have a high blood sugar level. Though the fungal infection is not a new occurrence, the number of cases has seen an unprecedented rise in India amid the ongoing second wave of the pandemic. The shortage of Amphotericin-B has added to the crisis, while prompted by the Centre, states and Union territories have now started notifying under the epidemic act. Separate wards, facilities are being brought in place to exclusively treat this fungal infection.Bharat Serums & Vaccines Ltd, BDR Pharmaceuticals Ltd, Sun Pharma Ltd, Cipla Ltd, Life Care Innovations are the five existing manufacturers, while Mylan Labs is an importer of Amphotericin-B drug. To this, five more manufacturers have been added, including NATCO Pharmaceuticals, Hyderabad, Alembic Pharmaceuticals, Vadodara, Gufic Biosciences Ltd, Gujarat, Emcure Pharmaceuticals, Pune and Lyka, Gujarat.Month-wise Amphotericin-B availability in numbers> Around 3,63,000 vials of Amphotericin-B are being imported in May.> In May, 5,26752 vials of the black fungus drug will be made available, including domestic production.> In June, 3,15,000 vials will be imported.> The total availability of Amphotericin-B in June will be 5,70,114, including domestic production.> The manufacturers which have received new licences for the production of Amphotericin-B will produce 1,11,000 vials of Amphotericin-B per month from July 2021.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/over-5-lakh-black-fungus-drug-vials-will-be-available-in-june-says-centre-as-mucormycosis-emerges-as-grave-threat-101621586785382.html
21-05-2021||India||Amid outbreak, AIIMS director lists three key factors to prevent 'black fungus'||All India Institute of Medical Science (AIIMS) director Randeep Guleria on Friday listed three factors important in the prevention of 'black fungus' or mucormycosis outbreak, prevalent in Covid-19 patients."Three factors are very important- good control of blood sugar levels, those on steroids must monitor blood sugar levels regularly, and be careful about when to give steroids and their dosage," news agency ANI quoted Guleria saying as the Covid-linked infection claimed more than 7,000 lives in the country.The AIIMS director also said that the mucormycosis was also seen to some extent during the Sars outbreak in 2002. "Uncontrolled diabetes with Covid can also predispose to the development of mucormycosis," ANI further reported him as saying.Amid the Covid-19 outbreak in the country, cases of mucormycosis have emerged in patients who were in the recovery phase of the disease. The fungal infection is more life-threatening and attacks those with weak immune systems.Doctors suspect that the sudden surge in mucormycosis may be linked to the use of steroids to treat Covid-19. It can result in breathing problems and coughing blood. Other symptoms include blackening or discolouration over the nose, blurred or double vision and chest pain.Guleria also acknowledged that steroid use has become much more prevalent during the ongoing second wave of Covid-19. "Those given high doses of steroids when not indicated can lead to high blood sugar levels and a high chance of mucormycosis," he said. Guleria called for judicious use of steroids.On Thursday, many states like Gujarat, Karnataka, Rajasthan declared mucormycosis a notifiable disease under the Epidemic Act after a letter from the Centre.However, in the national capital, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal said the city government will declare mucormycosis an epidemic if the need arises. He also urged hospitals to use steroids in a controlled manner.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/amid-outbreak-aiims-directors-list-three-key-factors-to-prevent-black-fungus-101621586565726.html
21-05-2021||India||Vaccines, raw material supplies to be key part of Jaishankar’s US visit||Covid-19 vaccines and the lingering impact of a US law on exports of vaccine raw materials are expected to figure prominently in external affairs minister S Jaishankar’s interactions with senior American officials during his visit to the US next week. Jaishankar will meet UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres in New York and secretary of state Antony Blinken in Washington as part of his visit to the US during May 24-28, the external affairs ministry announced on Friday. He will also meet cabinet members and senior officials of the Biden administration dealing with bilateral relations and have two interactions with business forums on economic and Covid-related cooperation between India and the US, the ministry said in a brief statement. People familiar with developments said on condition of anonymity that ways to ramp up India’s procurement and production of Covid-19 vaccines are set to be a key part of the minister’s interactions with his US interlocutors. “This will include discussions on allocation of vaccines from the US stockpiles of 80 million doses that are set to be distributed by June,” one of the people cited above said. Also Read | Indian-Americans reported highest rates of voting in 2020 presidential electionThe continuing impact of the US Defense Production Act, which was invoked by President Joe Biden in February to restrict exports of vaccine raw materials, is also expected to figure in the discussions, the people said. “The US hasn’t imposed a ban on vaccine raw materials and they diverted some of the raw materials from their own orders to India but this has resulted in the raw materials coming in dribs and drabs,” a second person said. “Indian vaccine manufacturers say they can’t draw up plans to ramp up production in a big way until they are assured of raw material supplies in a timely manner,” the second person added. Though the external affairs ministry didn’t provide details of Jaishankar’s planned meetings with business leaders, the people didn’t rule out the possibility of interactions with representatives of key US vaccine manufacturers such as Pfizer, Moderna and Johnson & Johnson. The US announced recently that it plans to distribute 20 million doses of Pfizer, Moderna and Johnson & Johnson vaccines from its surplus stocks by the end of June. This will be in addition to 60 million doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine which isn’t authorised for use in the US and will be donated after clearance by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Gayle Smith, the coordinator for the US global Covid-19 response, has said a substantial part of the 80 million doses will be rolled out through the WHO-backed COVAX facility. US officials have also spoken of plans for the joint production of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine in India. The people cited above said India is expecting doses from the US both through COVAX and directly. Reports have said India is lobbying to get at least 35% of the 60 million AstraZeneca doses. External affairs ministry spokesperson Arindam Bagchi said on Thursday India is engaged with US entities on procuring vaccines and manufacturing them in India subsequently. This will be Jaishankar’s second in-person meeting with Blinken since they held talks on the margins of a G7 foreign ministers meeting in London on May 3 and it will allow them to discuss issues such as resilient supply chains, the American pullout from Afghanistan, India’s dragging military standoff with China and the Indo-Pacific, the people said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/vaccines-raw-material-supplies-to-be-key-part-of-jaishankar-s-us-visit-101621585790431.html

Every prisoner has a right to get parole and it was granted after taking feedback from administration and the police. We gave him a day-long parole last year too,” the official said.Singh, who has been taken to Gurugram to meet his mother amid heavy police security, had sought parole four days ago.Before this, the Dera Sacha Sauda chief was given a day’s parole on October 24, 2020 to meet his mother, who was admitted in a Gurugram hospital. State jails minister Ranjit Singh had justified the parole at that time, saying it was given as per the law.“There is a provision under the law that if there is an emergency in the family of the convict, he is allowed to visit his family under police protection,” Ranjit Singh had said.Last week, Gurmeet Ram Rahim was hospitalised at Post Graduate Institute of Medical Sciences in Rohtak after his blood pressure dipped in the jail.

A sessions court on Friday acquitted the former Tehelka editor-in-chief who was accused of assaulting a former female colleague inside the elevator of a luxury hotel in Goa in 2013 during the ThinkFest event organised by the magazine."This is a victory for everyone, especially for Adv Rajeev Gomes, his associates and Tarun Tejpal also. It is also special because of the hard work and efforts of my senior advocate Rajeev Gomes. He has been acquitted of all the sections that he was charged with," Tejpal's advocate Suhas Velip said to mediapersons present outside the court. Velip was representing Tejpal as Gomes had succumbed due to complications from the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) last week.The former scribe was charged with sections 376 (punishment for rape), 354A (sexual harassment), 354B (criminal assault with intent to disrobe a woman), 341 (wrongful restraint) and 342 (wrongful confinement) of the Indian Penal Code."In November 2013, I was falsely accused of sexual assault by a colleague. Today the Hon'ble trial court of additional sessions judge Kshama Joshi, in Goa, has honourably acquitted me. In an awfully vitiated age, where ordinary courage has become rare, I thank her for standing by the truth," Tejpal said in a brief statement after his acquittal. Additional sessions judge Kshama Joshi acquitted Tejpal, who was accompanied with his family members as well as family members of Rajeev Gomes."As a family we owe Rajiv Gomes a profound and permanent debt. And we grieve alongside his wife Cheryl and his young son Sean. No client can ever hope for a better lawyer than Rajiv. The ever-struggling wheel of justice has lost a solid spoke," Tejpal further added.The trial against Tejpal began in 2017, four years after the incident occurred and the former scribe approached the high court and later the Supreme Court challenging the framing of charges and seeking his discharge in the case. The Supreme Court ordered that the trial must be completed by December 2020 but it encountered several delays. The court was to deliver the verdict on April 27 but it was adjourned several times due to the Cyclone Tauktae and Covid-19 pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/goa-government-to-move-high-court-against-tarun-tejpal-s-acquittal-in-2013-sexual-assault-case-101621581522368.html

The UNSC has been involved in discussions over the Israel retaliation to the Hamas rocket attacks from Gaza. However, with the help of Egyptian and US interlocutors both sides have now declared ceasefire. India has also made a statement on the skirmish last week.While India has decided to play an active role in the UNSC in the coming months, Jaishankar’s key meetings are in Washington to ensure that raw material pipeline from the US for manufacture of vaccines in India continues uninterrupted. On the coronavirus front, Jaishankar will be engaged with the US administration to secure unused vaccines particularly Astra Zeneca as well from the 80 million stock-pile under control of the Biden administration. New Delhi is also looking at joint production of Johnson & Johnson's vaccine in collaboration with the US in India. The external affairs minister will also be talking to other US-based vaccine developers as part of interaction under the aegis of India-American Chambers of Commerce.However, another important aspect of Jaishankar-Blinken meeting will be to discuss the resilient global supply chains as well as discuss the Indo-Pacific region with Chinese Army still not willing to restore April 2020 status quo in East Ladakh. The People’s Liberation Army (PLA) has still not gone back to its bases in Gogra-Hot Springs area around strategic Kongka la in East Ladakh and the Chinese are seriously ramping up military infrastructure all along the 3488 km LAC. On Thursday, Jaishankar made it clear that India-China bilateral relations will not be normalized till such time the PLA honours the 1993 and 1996 bilateral accords and restore peace and tranquilty on the LAC. The two leaders will also discuss the crisis in the Middle East arising out of Hamas rocket attacks at Israel from Gaza as well as Taliban’s role in continued violence in Afghanistan. With the US forces all set to exit out of Afghanistan in October, stage is already set for the Islamic republic to turn to Emirate with Taliban pushing their way towards Kabul through military might and tacit support of their handlers and ideologues in Pakistan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jaishankar-in-us-next-week-to-discuss-vaccines-and-indopacific-101621579100732.html

Lauding the medics, PM Modi said it is commendable how all nurses, doctors, ambulance drivers and ward boys came together against the Covid-19."Varanasi has set a great example by the way it has equipped Pt Rajan Mishra Covid hospital and increased the number of oxygen beds and ICU beds in the city, in such a short span of time," PM Modi said in the virtual interaction.He also said that he has been in constant touch with administration of Varanasi and have been taking stock of the situation.PM Modi also gave new slogan 'Jahan Bimar, wahin upchar' (treatment of the ailing person at his doorstep) and appreciated the micro-containment zone implemented by the holy city.PM Modi also praised the traders for keeping their shops closed to break the chain of Covid-19 infection and said the health infrastructure that came up over the last years, helped Varanasi fight the Covid wave.Further slamming opposition for its criticism of Yoga, PM Modi said, "when he started promoting Yoga, it was mocked, colour of communalism was given by some people. But now Yoga is helping people fight Covid-19.During the interaction, PM Modi also paid tribute to the people who lost their lives during the second wave of the pandemic. With teary eyed, PM Modi said, "this virus has taken away many of our loved ones from us."Warning against "black fungus", a life threatening infection, PM Modi said, "We must focus on taking precaution and preparation to deal with it." He also called for collective effort for the vaccination against the Covid-19.PM Modi is a Member of Parliament from Varanasi constituency. During the second wave of Covid-19, it was among the worst-hit region of the country's most populous state.PM Modi also asked the residents of Varanasi to not show any laxity in behaviour and continue following the Covid norms. "We have to keep the preparations tight even though Covid infected cases have decreased," he said."We have to remember our fight is against an invisible enemy," he told the frontline workers of Varanasi.Wishing good health for all, PM Modi said with the blessings of the Baba Kashi Vishwanath, Kashi will win the fight against Covid 19."Over the last few days, active cases have been going down in Uttar Pradesh.

21-05-2021||India||SC upholds IBC provisions of corporate debt recovery from personal guarantors||The Supreme Court on Friday affirmed the Central government’s November 15, 2019 notification which enabled financial institutions to proceed against the promoters in their capacity as personal guarantors of the defaulting corporate debtor. The court ruling will clear the decks for creditors to recover the remaining debt from personal guarantors after the conclusion of the Corporate Insolvency Resolution Process (CIRP). Industrialists such as Anil Ambani, Kapil Wadhawan, Sanjay Singhal, and Venugopal Dhoot had challenged the 2019 notification, which had extended the personal insolvency provisions of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) to the promoters as well. The bench of justices L Nageswara Rao and S Ravindra Bhat, reading out the operative part of the judgment, said that the notification has been held to be “legal” and “valid”. It added that approval of the resolution plan relating to the corporate debtor will not operate as an estoppel so as to discharge the liabilities of the personal guarantor. A batch of 75 petitions had raised questions over the validity of the 2019 notification, which brought into force provisions of the Part III of the IBC, extending insolvency and bankruptcy for individuals and partnership firms to the promoters too. Also Read | Arrests over PM Modi’s posters ‘illegal’, says plea in Supreme CourtIn view of the ambiguity over the provisions, the top court had, in October 2020, asked the high courts across the country not to pass any order in such cases. It had also passed an interim order, staying the insolvency proceedings against personal guarantors. In June 2020, the State Bank of India had moved the National Company Law Tribunal, Mumbai, to recover more than ₹1,200 crore from Anil Ambani as he had given a personal guarantee for loans extended to Reliance Communications Ltd and Reliance Infratel Ltd. Soon after, several promoters challenged the 2019 notification, prompting the Supreme Court to transfer all matters to itself last year. The promoters contended that the Centre did not have the power to bring in IBC provisions selectively to personal guarantors of corporate debtors while also claiming that singling out of guarantors was violative of the fundamental right to equality.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-upholds-ibc-provisions-of-corporate-debt-recovery-from-personal-guarantors-101621578107875.html

It is also the will of the people of Tamil Nadu,” Stalin said in his letter. The seven convicts are Nalini Sriharan, Murugan, Santhan, AG Perarivalan, Jayakumar, Robert Payas, and P Ravichandran who are in Tamil Nadu prisons.Rajiv Gandhi was killed in 1991 and his assassins sentenced to death by a TADA court in January 1998. The Supreme Court later upheld the death sentence for only four: Nalini Sriharan, Murugan, Santhan, AG Perarivalan. But the death sentence was later commuted to a life term.In his letter to the President, Stalin recalled that Nalini Sriharan’s death sentence was commuted to life under Article 161 of the Indian Constitution that gives Raj Bhavan to pardon a convict, and the Supreme Court also commuted the death sentence of other three convicts to a life term.In 2018, the Tamil Nadu cabinet passed a unanimous resolution for the release of the seven convicts and it was sent to Governor Banwarilal Purohit for his assent.In February this year, Purohit, who had refrained from taking a call, finally said that the President was the competent authority to decide on the resolution.“These seven persons have already suffered untold hardship and agony in the past three decades and have paid a heavy price. There has already been an inordinate delay in the consideration of their pleas for remission. In the present circumstances of the Covid-19 pandemic, courts are also recognising the need to decongest prisons,” he said.On Wednesday, Stalin had granted a month’s ordinary leave for Perarivalan on medical grounds after considering an appeal from his mother Arputham Ammal that since Covid-19 is spreading in prisons, he was at a higher risk due to his health condition.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/stalin-asks-president-to-release-7-convicts-in-rajiv-gandhi-assassination-case-101621576967718.html
21-05-2021||India||Ramp up your vaccination to permanently control this virus: Dr Faheem Younus||Hundreds of mucormycosis cases have been reported in India and prompted the Centre to ask states to declare the life-threatening Covid-19 complication notifiable under the Epidemic Diseases Act. Faheem Younus, the chief of infectious diseases at the University of Maryland, spoke to Sunetra Choudhury about the disease, Covid-19 vaccination, etc. Edited excerpts:Why have mucormycosis or black fungus numbers multiplied?...we have seen Covid ravaging through Europe and North America, but I do not think we have seen that degree of increased cases of mucormycosis. Now, why a higher incidence in Nepal or India or Pakistan. There are some hypotheses and of course, there is a tri-factor. ...the fungus is in the environment and the soil and what predisposes a human being is diabetes, steroids, or immunosuppressive drugs. Covid by itself... I do not think predisposes anyone to mucormycosis. But it is the treatment of Covid. If steroids are being used in very high doses or if patients have immune suppression or they are having cancer, dialysis, or those situations and also depending upon what kind of environmental exposure they get... if they get a big dose of soil that is carrying this fungus and they are immunosuppressed, then there are chances that they are going to have a higher risk.Watch : Will children be impacted in next Covid wave? Dr Faheem Younus answersAlso Read | How high courts intervened in Covid-19 management in IndiaThose conditions prevail more in the subcontinent as compared to Europe and America. ...the focus should be on the appropriate use of medications and theearly diagnosis. ...what I am hearing is people are just using steroids like water. ...it is precision that matters. When you are a good clinician, do not do more, do not do less. A good clinician does just right and as long as you do just right, you will not do harm.Are doctors jumping the gun or people are self-medicating?Both could be possible because... when they first talked about steroids [in the UK], it only helped in people who were hypoxic, meaning they needed oxygen support or were on a ventilator. If you are home, do not require oxygen, your pulse oximetry is over 94, then you are going to actually do harm by taking the steroids. That is what was shown in the [UK] trial. And what I have seen is that even doctors feel compelled to write eight or nine things in regular patients who typically are going to get better by routine paracetamol. ...[Patients] feel good when you give them three or four medications. So, I get that. But as clinicians, our job is to do the right thing. And I think once again, it could be both that the doctors are over-prescribing and that the people are self-medicating.What else should be done to curb the disease?...good action will lead to good results. We are in control, not the virus. So, I absolutely believe that it needs to be stopped. It can be stopped, and you have to give a multifaceted strategy. The best strategy is to prevent it which means that you, first of all, tell people that this does not go from a person to person. This is not contagious like Covid. ...you need to quell the panic around it. Then you need to educate people about good hygienic practices. You tell them, in soil, this fungus prevails, so anything that you are doing that is bringing you closer to that soil may increase your risk. So, first is public education. The second is quick diagnosis... mucormycosis...is a rare disease. Early diagnosis is really the key. [It] is not just Amphotericin, the drug that typically gets used, but a lot of these patients require aggressive early surgery. Sometimes the eyeball has to be removed. Much of these infections happen in the face and head and neck area. So, prevention, early diagnosis, aggressive treatment. But at the end of the day, this is going to go away.Also Read | How different regions are faring in Covid-19 vaccinationThere is a lot of confusion that if you have been infected with Covid, when should you go in for vaccination? The government has said people must wait for three months. But many are saying that India now has a shortage of vaccines which is why people are told to wait...There are some broad principles for this whole pandemic that we need to first keep in mind. Number one is that science will change all the time. ...every day we do things and there are different results, and we are always changing our strategies. So, changing information is nothing new to the world of medicine. Number two is assuming good intent. Yes, if you do not trust someone, do not listen. But once you trust a physician, then surrender your opinion because otherwise, you are really going to have a lot of anxiety. And number three, there can be more than one right answer in this situation...many areas are grey; some are black and white, but not all. ... the current [United States] CDC [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention] recommendations, which will be globally applicable... is once you fully recover from Covid, you can go for the vaccine shot. After that, there is pretty ample and strong data that you are not likely to get reinfected for three months. That immunity is going to last for three months... maybe six, 12 months....We cannot go and buy everything. We must make choices. The government must do the same thing. So, if the government is saying three months because of a shortage, I see nothing wrong with it. I would be very transparent.But the government has not admitted that there is a shortage...That is why I am a doctor, and they are politicians. That is why we have different professions. But I would simply tell people and I will also reassure them that for three months, your risk is minuscule. It is not like you are increasing your risk. ...whatever the reason is, I think three months is Okay.You have talked about one month being ideal to vaccinate after Covid. Suppose you have had the first dose of the vaccine and you get infected, is there an outer limit for the second dose?I have seen many patients, who had one dose and then got infected ...which means that their exposure was just a few days before the first dose, meaning that they were completely not protected. That happens to be a tricky area. After you get Covid, there is significant science developing that just a single dose of vaccine is enough because Covid essentially was your first dose and your first dose of the vaccine becomes your booster, I mean your second dose. So first, people should know that if they got the first dose, then got infected after that ...they have up to three months to get their second dose.Doctors in India were the first to get vaccinated. The Indian Medical Association recently said that 260 health workers had died in India. How is this happening?...last I checked 40 million people in India have been fully vaccinated. If 400 people died, that would be 0.001% of them. That is the context. ...now you compare the risk with Covid... I think nobody understands that better than the US and India because these two countries have been just ravaged by this virus. ...we do not know the baseline mortality rate out of a large population. People will die at random times.Also Read | Covid-19: What you need to know todayYou know, there is random mortality going on that we call baseline mortality. Unless you can say that your baseline mortality has gone up, it is very difficult to once again attribute something to a vaccine. ...we do not know the confounding variables. I do not know the ages of these doctors. I do not know that how many of them were obese, how many had immunosuppressive drugs, how many had diabetes. We do not know any of that. As a scientist, I always keep that final option open. Maybe there is an X factor. Maybe there is something different with this variant that is going on. ...I think the headlines, the raw numbers can be very misleading... The vaccine right now is a thousand times less risky because people need to understand if they refuse the vaccine, what option they have.What should I do if I do not get the vaccine?There are two choices. Stay in your home, locked up for the next year, or go out and take the risk of Covid. And both of them are horrible choices. This idea that somehow not getting a vaccine gives us a safer option. No. There is nothing safer than that [vaccine]. You are exchanging a much bigger risk. If there was a better option, I would love for people to present it, provided it is data-driven; it is published.In India, there is a feeling that despite the vaccine, it does not an assurance that you are going to be fine. What would you say to this?This is just like saying that I was wearing my seat belt but then why do people die despite the seat belts? See, they are going to prevent a lot of deaths, but they are not going to prevent every death. That does not mean we should not wear a seat belt.Where is your stand on naming variants with regard to their countries of origin, given the racist and other connotations?I stand on the side of the patient. The patient who is in the ICU either trying to get on a ventilator or trying to avoid a ventilator or looking at death. Does that patient care what you call this? I do not think so. I have seen hundreds of those patients; they do not care what you call them...They are looking at the horror of Covid. They have never experienced something like this before. They feel like they are drowning in their own fluids inside their lungs. So that is where I stand as a physician. To me, it does not matter. I think whatever gets the patient immediate help is important.Also Read | MHA asks states to help vulnerable sections, kids orphaned due to Covid-19...when you name a variant after a country, it will impact the economy. At least there is a fear that it will impact the economy and your image. It will impact travel and all those things and for some people, it is just a matter of political pride, national pride. I get all of that.Our top scientists have said children are likely to be impacted in the next wave. Do you agree?That is very irresponsible to say with all due respect. I would not make such a statement in the midst of a pandemic when there are so many bigger real challenges that India is facing. ...there is no scientific data that it is true. It is somebody’s personal projection. ...we have not defined what a child is or what young means. People throw these terms out but as physicians, we have very clear definitions. Are you talking about people between the ages of 18 and 35? Is that what the young are? Is under 18 a child or is under 10 a child? What do you really mean by these terms? What is clear is more younger people are getting impacted. But look at the elephant in the room. Is not it likely that the first wave infected a lot of the elderly? Now they are probably immune, and their immunity is still lasting, and they are somewhat resistant to reinfection. Now you have added another 40 million, though a small number, who are fully vaccinated. ...you have a lot of vaccinated people who are also likely to be elderly. ... the elderly may be a little bit as well staying home, staying out of trouble. Young people may be living a little bit more through a high-risk lifestyle, going out to offices, work parties, etc. There are so many reasons which are much more likely to explain why younger patients are getting infected now. It is concerning if they are getting bad outcomes, but the way to make these assertions is to publish them.Also Read | Child rights panel seeks info on preparations to tackle third Covid-19 wave... folks like me can look at real data rather than learning from the media. No disrespect to the media, but I do not think science works that way. I cannot look at a media story that does not answer my questions and then draw a conclusion. Till today, I have not seen it, and if somebody has, please let me know... If you think there is good data out there to suggest that children are at risk in India, send it to me and I would be happy to review it. But I have not seen good data to make such a conclusion. Children can get this virus. They can get infected, no question. This is more transmissible, and we are likely to see more infections in youth and children because it is more transmissible. But are we truly at a point where we should be afraid for the life of our children or worse outcomes? I do not have that information and I do not think we should say that.Are more waves inevitable?This is a tough one. Once this virus gets holed in a country like it has in India, think of it as a flat tyre, like a punctured tyre, you can push air into it and go another few miles, but you will lose air again. You can keep pushing air, but unless you fix that puncture or you change the tube, you are not safe. Every lockdown is like you are just pushing more air in the tyre. It is going to give you some time. But the permanent solution is to fix that puncture by vaccination. ...ultimately, you have got to get up to 70-80% [vaccinated]. But once you get to 50%, chances are you will at least not see big waves anymore... Unfortunately, we are not in control and the virus is driving us the way it wants. You get to switch seats around that 50% mark. That is what we are seeing here in the US. ...The only factor that has changed is about 60% of the country is now vaccinated. So, I think that is the key thing. ... You want to permanently control this virus, ramp up your vaccination. There is no other shortcut, no other treatment.CDC has said if you have been vaccinated, you can take off masks. How convinced are you with that? In the subcontinent, that seems to be years away...CDC is doing the right thing. They just did so a little abruptly. I would have preferred this to be slowly communicated in a little more gradual fashion over a couple of weeks. People felt that jolt of just complete freedom. But yes, more than 95% of transmissions occur indoors and more than 60% of the country is vaccinated. Another 10 to 15% may be Covid recovered. So, you are already at 70 to 75%. As far as other countries are concerned, it is just not possible to stay in lockdowns. It is perfectly fine to just accept the fact that a good quality mask for the next foreseeable future, perhaps the rest of this year. I do not want to say years and years. I think I always think in three-month increments. ...I think in the next three months, it is very likely that you will need a good mask mandate and then from there on reassess.Umar Sofi has contributed to the story||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/conditions-that-cause-mucormycosis-prevail-more-in-subcontinent-dr-faheem-younus-101621575527985.html

He was accused of raping a colleague at his magazine's event at a five-star resort in North Goa in 2013, and was arrested on November 30 the same year.He denied all charges against him and was later released on bail in May 2014.Issuing a statement after the verdict, Tarun Tejpal paid his tributes to his lawyer Rajiv Gomes, who died of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) last week."Last week my trial lawyer, Rajiv Gomes, died of Covid. Dynamic and brilliant, at 47 he was on the brink of a scintillating career as a criminal lawyer at the national level. No person fought harder, and with greater skill, to reclaim my life and reputation," he said.Tejpal further said he was thankful for Judge Kshama Joshi, who pronounced the judgement, for 'standing by the truth'."In November 2013 I was falsely accused of sexual assault by a colleague.

The kit, called CoviSelf, will be available in the market next week and it will cost ₹250.The kit comprises of a pre-filled extraction tube, a sterile nasal swab and one test card.Watch: How much will self-test kit cost? ICMR DG explains how to take testMylab is currently manufacturing seven million test kits per week, it said in a statement. The firm aims to ramp up production after the kit hits the market, and produce about 10 million tests per week in the next 14 days, it added.Explaining how to use the kit, ICMR chief General Balram Bhargava said it is an easy, secure and quick process. "It takes two minutes to conduct the test and 15 minutes to get the result," he said.Here is how to use CoviSelf:- Buy the test from a chemist shop and download the mobile application.- Register yourself on the application and read the user manual carefully.- This process ensures patient confidentiality as their data is stored in a secure server which is linked to the ICMR database, Dr Bhargava said.- The kit will use only nasal swab to find out the presence of the infection.- A test card - part of the kit - will have two bars named C (control) and T (test).- If the bar at C section changes colour, the test is negative.

At a media briefing, the director general of ICMR Dr Balram Bhargava said that the government plans to push up the number of Covid-19 tests being conducted in India daily from the current 16-20 lakh to 45 lakh by end of June.The Centre is also focussing on increasing the rapid antigen tests (RATs) instead of 'gold standard' RT-PCR. Out of the target of 45 lakh tests, 18 lakh will be RT-PCR, while 27 lakh will be RATs, according to the government.Dr Bhargava said that ICMR has so far approved a home-based RAT kit manufactured by Mylab Discovery Solutions Ltd, Pune. He added that kits by three more companies are in pipeline and likely to get the approval within a week.Bhargava said kits for home testing will be available in market in 3-4 days.The ICMR chief said that in large cities, focus was mainly on RT-PCR which is the standard test but in district level the backbone of testing has been TrueNAT and CBNAAT, while in rural areas RAT is the backbone of testing."In the second wave, we have to increase the RAT testing, we have written to all chief secretaries and they have acted upon it. Multiple 24X7 RAT booths to be set up in cities, towns and villages. RATs to be allowed at all government and private healthcare facilities (no accreditation required). RAT booths to be set up with the community in schools, colleges, community centres, RWA offices etc. All RT-PCR and RAT test results should be uploaded on ICMR portal," said Dr Bhargava.Bhargava said there are 2,553 government and private Covid testing laboratories established across the country over the last 16 months.Meanwhile, more than 20.55 lakh tests were conducted in a span of 24 hours (on Thursday), the highest ever conducted in a single day in India.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/as-centre-aims-to-ramp-up-covid-19-testing-focus-on-rapid-antigen-101621563990264.html

The curbs have been imposed to control the spiralling number of coronavirus disease (Covid-19) cases.The restrictions came into effect from 5am on Tuesday, except for a set of exemptions, as per an order of the Assam State Disaster Management Authority (ASDMA).The order was passed on Monday, when Assam reported its single-day highest 92 Covid-19 deaths and 6,394 cases of the disease in a 24-hour span - the highest till then."Whereas, it has been observed that with unabated inter- district movement, the COVID-19 containment measures are not yielding the desired level of reduction in COVID-19 cases," the ASDMA said in its order.

This consensus led to important border agreements in 1993 and 1996 that created three decades of peace and tranquillity on the LAC, he noted. “I think the relationship is at a crossroads and which direction we go depends on whether the Chinese side would adhere to the consensus, whether it would follow through on the agreements which we both have done for so many decades,” Jaishankar said, adding: “Because what is very clear in the last year is that border tensions cannot continue with cooperation in other areas.”“If there is continuing friction at the border, then it is going to tell on the relationship,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/indiachina-ties-at-crossroads-tensions-continue-on-lac-s-jaishankar-101621559432873.html

She said no discussions were held on the supply of vaccines, medicines, and oxygen or on the black fungus infection (mucormycosis).This was the PM Modi’s second virtual meeting after May 18 with chief ministers and district magistrates to review the situation in states where the Covid-19 caseload is high.But Banerjee said she and the others who attended the meeting felt insulted. “All the chief ministers were sitting like puppets, and none was allowed to say a single word. We felt insulted. Only four to five district magistrates, mostly from BJP-ruled states, were allowed to speak. The meeting ended with the Prime Minister’s speech, in which he claimed that Covid-19 cases were going down,” she said.The Trinamool leader said she was running a state, “but Delhi’s Shahenshah is not even looking at us and just saying ‘Sab thik hai’ (all is well)”.“When representatives of Uttar Pradesh spoke in the meeting the PM said, ‘Bahut badhiya chal raha hai’ (everything is running well), without raising any question why corpses were being dumped in the river,” Banerjee said, referring to the recent spate of bodies found floating in the Ganga and buried in the sand in UP and Bihar.The BJP shot back, accusing the CM of being disinterested in administration: a charge levelled earlier during electioneering ahead of the state assembly polls by top party leaders.“Today, our respected CM @MamataOfficial has once again shown her total disinterest in administration. True to her style, she has politicised a meeting Hon’ble PM @narendramodi held with District Officials, where grassroots level practices to fight COVID-19 were being discussed,” tweeted BJP’s Suvendu Adhikari, leader of opposition in the West Bengal assembly.He also contested Banerjee’s claim of only representatives of BJP-ruled states getting the chance to speak by claiming in another tweet that five of the seven district officials who spoke represented non-BJP states of Chhattisgarh, Kerala, Maharashtra, Rajasthan, and Andhra Pradesh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/felt-insulted-bengal-cm-mamata-banerjee-hits-out-after-meeting-with-pm-modi-101621556449182.html
21-05-2021||India||Oxygen demand rises in southern states, Odisha and Assam||The allocation of medical oxygen to Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Odisha and Assam has gone up, amid a surge in the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) cases in some of these states, officials familiar with the matter said.All India Industrial Gases Manufacturer’s Association (AIIGMA) president Saket Tiku confirmed that the demand from the states has increased as cases have increased there too.“The demand for oxygen [in the states] went from 850 MT in March last year, to nearly 3,000 MT in September 2020,” Tiku said. “There is now sale of nearly 9,000 MT per day. These are approximate figures. But now, there is no shortage, and the demand is being met.”According to a government official who spoke on the condition of anonymity, the buffer stock in Kerala has been ramped up in the last two days to ensure enough medical oxygen is available for the state. “The allocation is dynamic,” said the official. “It comes in response to which state requires how much medical oxygen in view of the active cases.”The O2 allocation to Tamil Nadu has gone up from 220 metric tonne (MT) in April, according to government data, to 650-700 MT being supplied to the state daily, said AIIGMA. In Kerala, the allocation last month was 99 MT, and the daily supply now is around 400 MT. Odisha and Assam (data for which is clubbed with the rest of the northeastern states), which did not even figure in the medical oxygen supply states, are now consuming nearly 150-160 MT and 90-100 MT respectively.Tiku said that even as the demand was falling in Maharashtra and Delhi, southern states, including Karnataka and Telangana had also asked for greater stocks.Kerala reported 8,196 cases on Thursday, Tamil Nadu 42,033, Andhra Pradesh 22,842, Odisha 152,824 and Assam 50,488.According to the data with the Oxygen Digital Tracking System, nearly 155,582 MT of medical oxygen has been allocated to states from May 1 to May 17. Of this, 128,617 MT has already been delivered, 15,388 is under transit and 14,004 is pending dispatch. The centralised repository of availability of medical oxygen was set up on directions of the empowered group of supply and logistics headed by road and transport secretary Aramane Giridhar. Nearly 74 oxygen plants and other smaller units have been boarded onto the system to facilitate end-to-end tracking of the delivery of medical oxygen.The dashboard, which can be accessed by the states, allows states to track the delivery of supplies, and even divert the delivery to a different destination based on requirements and active caseload, the official mentioned above said.“The system has been installed to bring transparency to the delivery process,” the official said. It uses GPS and SIM-based tracking to generate the data, which is also integrated with the road and transport ministry’s SAARTHI service.On May 17, 9,800 MT of liquid oxygen was allocated to different states. Over 300 special oxygen trains have already managed to supply 12,000 MT, the official added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/oxygen-demand-rises-in-southern-states-odisha-and-assam-101621556557264.html

Oxford is a perfect location to stage pivotal meetings on how the world readies itself to combat future health threats,” said UK Health Secretary Matt Hancock.“Collectively we can build back better from this virus and, as I gather with my Ministerial counterparts from the major democratic nations, we have an opportunity to learn from this pandemic and take measures that will develop global health security,” he said.The summit forms part of the UK’s 2021 presidency of the Group of Seven – which includes the UK, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the US and the European Union – and will bring together health ministers from these nations in a physical setting.However, the UK government said that the two-day talks will also engage virtually with the G7 Presidency’s guest countries – India, South Korea, Australia and South Africa.“Oxford University is honoured to host the G7 Health Ministers. This past year has demonstrated just how much can be accomplished when universities, business and government work together to advance global health,” said Professor Louise Richardson, Vice-Chancellor of the University of Oxford.“We hope that in the course of this meeting insights and information will be shared, ideas generated, and lasting partnerships forged. In particular, we hope that as a result of this meeting plans will be developed to ensure that we are never again caught unprepared for a pandemic,” she said.There will be a working ministerial dinner on the evening of June 3 attended by senior representatives from the life sciences industry, who are planning to convene concurrently in Oxford to discuss the themes under the UK Prime Minister’s Pandemic Preparedness Partnership between public and private sectors and key issues on the health agenda for the summit.“As a county with a world-class reputation for cutting-edge research and innovation in life sciences and healthcare, we look forward to welcoming our guests and hope that their time here contributes to strengthening partnerships and boosting collaboration in managing current and future global health threats,” said Councillor Liz Leffman, Oxfordshire County Council Leader.Oxford City Council Leader, Councillor Susan Brown, added: “Our city has rightly become synonymous with excellence in life science research and manufacturing. We are proud that Oxford’s name is carried by the vaccine used most widely across the world.“There is a real opportunity for those gathered to step up international support for the vaccination programmes still only in their early stages in many developing countries, particularly in Africa.”G7 countries account for two thirds of the world’s pharmaceutical markets and the three vaccines licensed for use in the UK were all developed in G7 nations – the UK, US and Germany.As host of this year’s G7 Presidency, the UK says it is determined to work with its partners to "build back better" from coronavirus and strengthen global preparedness for potential future pandemics.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-invited-to-join-g7-health-ministers-summit-virtually-uk-govt-101621556217734.html

21-05-2021||India||Highest motorable village gives Covid vaccine doses to all 45+||At 4,587 metre above sea level, it’s the world’s highest village connected by a motorable road. But Komic, in Himachal Pradesh’s remote Spiti Valley, is now famous for another reason: all residents aged 45 years and above have been vaccinated for Covid-19.Komic, another village Hikkim, and Langza, the largest of the three, together comprise Langza panchayat, with a population of 330. Of that, 101 (over the age of 60) and 150 (over 45) have been vaccinated, according to officials.The panchayat in itself is one of 13 that are part of the larger Kaza block, and where 89% of health care workers, and 79% of those over the age of 60 have been fully vaccinated; and 95% of the population in the 45-plus age group has received one dose. The total population of the block is around 3,500.In Komic, with a population of 60 people, the proportion is 100% for everyone aged over 45 (20).“We are happy that the villagers have taken their second dose, too,” says Kaza block medical officer Tenzin Norbu.Despite cases of the viral illness in the region being rare, villagers say they rarely leave their houses and adhere strictly to Covid-19 guidelines to protect themselves against the disease.“If we walk out of our houses, it’s only for farming. The older generation stays home with the children,” says 37-year-old Komic resident Palzor, who goes only by one name.A health department team -- comprising health care worker Prem Singh (who administers the vaccine), verifier Kulwant Singh (who maintains record of the people being given the shots) and Accredited Social Health Activist Padma -- has been visiting the high-altitude villages in the Langza panchayat to vaccinate all residents since January this year.Climbing over connectivity challengeDespite enthusiasm among the residents, it hasn’t been easy for authorities.“After seniors, now young people are enthusiastic about getting vaccinated. The challenge in this area is limited internet connectivity, so it becomes difficult for them to log on to the Co-Win portal to get registered,” says Padma, the ASHA worker who has been visiting the area.At the core of India’s mammoth vaccination drive, which began on January 16, is the Co-Win digital platform where users have to register to get vaccination slots. The norms allow people in the 45-plus age group and other high-risk groups to turn up at vaccination centres without prior registrations. However, walk-in inoculations are not allowed for the younger age groups so far.Kaza additional district magistrate Gian Sagar Negi says the state government was requested this month to permit offline registration for vaccinations, and it was subsequently allowed.“Now 80% of the registration for vaccination is being done offline. Booking is done by calling up the health department and the slot is allotted based on lottery; 20% of the registration are still being done online but everyone has to first register for vaccination,” Lahaul and Spiti deputy commissioner Pankaj Rai says. Till Thursday evening, 12,387 doses of the vaccine had been given in the district with a population of 31,564.Kaza leading the wayDespite its tough, rocky terrain that receives heavy snowfall at regular intervals through the year, the Kaza block, has taken the lead on vaccination in the district. “People have no hesitancy in getting inoculated as they know that the health infrastructure in the region is limited. Everyone here wants to be protected from the virus,” says Padma.“In the tribal regions and those inaccessible by road we would depute more staff and the registrations are now being made offline,” says Dr Nipun Jindal, director of National Rural Health Mission in the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/highest-motorable-village-gives-covid-vaccine-doses-to-all-45-101621554245258.html
21-05-2021||India||PM Modi stresses on need to keep up Covid guard||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday asked officials to record the spread of coronavirus among young people and children, cautioning that the fight against the pandemic will continue so long as the disease remains even in a small area of the country.Speaking to district magistrates, local officials and chief ministers of some states, Modi said India’s battle against Covid-19 required continuous change and upgradation of plans and innovation. He said vaccine supplies would be strengthened, emphasised the need to save the villages and sought ideas and practices to tackle the pandemic. “This virus is famous for changing itself through mutations. It is like a bahurupia (shape-shifter) and clever as well. So, our strategies and plans should also be dynamic,” he said.Modi said there was a need to prevent vaccine wastage and added that every dose wasted was denying someone protection shield against the disease.He commended the Union health ministry’s plan of providing states with vaccine stocks that will last 15 days and called for a need for a vaccination calendar.Also Read| Mylab launches home testing kits for Covid-19 priced at ₹250 per pieceHe added that more transparency in the supply of vaccines will make the inoculation campaign easier.“With clarity about vaccination supply and timeline being available, vaccination management will become easier for you,” he saidIn his earlier meeting with district administrators on Tuesday, Modi called them the “field commanders” in the fight against the pandemic and spoke about their determination when they cleared the civil services exams.The meeting came at a time the second wave of infections is receding in many parts of India, with daily infections and positivity rates falling from their peaks. But experts have warned that the virus has ravaged the hinterlands and advised a more robust vaccination plan.Modi’s meeting was also attended by chief ministers of four states.In the meeting, Modi said sensitivity and patience were essential in this battle and called earning people’s trust the key to success.He urged the district administrators to reach out to the people and convince them to follow Covid-appropriate behaviour to curb the spread. “Your presence, your speeches can remove fear among people.”Modi urged the magistrates to find unique solutions to their local problems and to do a separate analysis of the spread of the virus in tier two and three cities. He expressed confidence that a solution to check the virus from spreading in the rural areas can be found.Also Read| Covid-19: What you need to know today“My experience says that if you convey the right things at the right time, people will follow religiously.”The officials who interacted with Modi via video-conferencing were from Chhattisgarh, Haryana, Kerala, Maharashtra, Odisha, Puducherry, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal and Andhra Pradesh.The Prime Minister has been holding a series of meeting with CMs, governors and other state officials amid the second wave to assess the ground situation and take stock of the states’ demands.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-stresses-on-need-to-keep-up-covid-guard-101621551981316.html
21-05-2021||India||How different regions are faring in Covid-19 vaccination||Until May 19, India had administered at least 186 million doses of Covid-19 vaccines in all, according to the CoWIN dashboard. At least 145 million of these were first doses and 41 million were second doses. Put otherwise, India has fully vaccinated 41 million people, and has given at least one dose to 145 million more.According to population projections made for March 2021 by the National Commission on Population, this translates to a total of around 14 doses per 100 population, with 10.7% of the population having received at least the first dose and 3% having received both doses. These headline numbers, however, hide a wide variation across different regions.1. 70% of districts have received less than 20 doses per 100 populationOfficial estimates of district-level population are not available. However, even the 2011 census data can offer insights into the variation in vaccination coverage across districts. This shows that 70% or 448 of 639 districts in the census have received only up to 20 doses per 100 population. Almost 2/3rd of the 187 districts where the coverage is only up to 10 doses per 100 population are in Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, and Tamil Nadu, and not just because of the large number of districts in these states. Over 80% of districts in these three states have administered only up to 10 doses per 100 population.Also Read| Bharat Biotech to ramp up Covaxin production by additional 200 million dosesTo be sure, there are also 12 districts where the coverage is over 40 doses per 100 population. Three of them (the Central and New Delhi census districts of Delhi and Gurgaon) are, however, in the National Capital Region, where people travelling from neighbouring areas to get a jab might have inflated the coverage data.2. Universal coverage doesn’t always translate into vulnerable population coverage2021 population projections at the state level confirm the findings of the district level data. Himachal Pradesh, Kerala, Uttarakhand and Delhi have administered the highest doses per capita; and Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, and Tamil Nadu have administered the least. But a break-up by age suggests not all states with the highest universal coverage have covered the highest share of their older population.For example, the top 10 states (north eastern states except Assam merged as one) by share of population covered by at least one dose (a split by age is available from the Co-WIN dashboard for this) among the 22 states for which we have population projections are Himachal Pradesh, Kerala, Delhi, Uttarakhand, Chhattisgarh, Gujarat, Rajasthan, the seven north-eastern states, and Haryana. Himachal, which is about 7 percentage points ahead of Kerala, has done well in covering its 45-plus population too.Also Read| Covishield versus Covaxin: What government says about comparing two Covid jabsOver 3/4th of this age group has been covered by at least one dose although the share of 45+ population in the state (30.6%) is the third highest among the 22 states. The remaining nine states have covered roughly similar shares of their total population (14% to 19%) with at least one dose. However, the difference in the coverage of their respective 45+ populations is much bigger. Kerala, for instance, has covered only 46% of its 45+ population and Chhattisgarh, 66%. This is because Chhattisgarh has a smaller 45+ population (23.6% of total population) and Kerala the highest (36%). Rajasthan and Uttarakhand are similarly ahead in inoculating a higher share of their older population among states with similar levels of universal coverage because of a younger population.But Delhi, Uttarakhand, the north-eastern states, and Haryana are not. They are, however, ahead of their peers in vaccinating their younger population, despite having the highest, 4th highest, 2nd highest, and 6th highest share of 18-44 population, respectively among the 22 states.3. Supply may have halted progress in vaccinating evenTo be sure, vaccine supply might have played a role in these age-specific trends in inoculation. It was only on April 1 that vaccination was opened completely for the 45-60 age group and India’s vaccination speed reduced two weeks after that. This could have prevented states from vaccinating the freshly eligible older population. 74% of the 45+ age group vaccinated until May 19 had been vaccinated by April 15. Even in the 18-44 age group, 45% of those vaccinated so far had been vaccinated by April 15 (younger healthcare and frontline workers were among the first to get vaccinated), although general vaccination for this age group was opened up only on May 1.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/how-different-regions-are-faring-in-covid-19-vaccination-101621551060334.html
21-05-2021||India||India faces black fungus epidemic as cases climb||At least 7,250 people are confirmed to have mucormycosis in India but the actual spread may be much wider, and authorities in several states have now sounded the alarm on the rare life-threatening disease that is rapidly popping up across the country as a Covid-19 complication.At least 219 deaths have been recorded due to mucormycosis, as per figures shared by officials in 13 states and Union territories with HT. The Union government said on Thursday that states should declare the disease notifiable under the Epidemic Diseases Act, 1897, making it mandatory for all medical facilities to report infections to a central disease surveillance network. The Delhi government separately decided to set up special treatment facilities in three of its hospitals.“We have asked states to add mucormycosis as a notifiable disease under the epidemic diseases act as in a communication to states yesterday (Wednesday). Doing so makes it mandatory for all hospitals to report cases so that we can consolidate data about it, and also ensures the screening, diagnosis and treatment is followed as per protocols of the Union government and Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR),” said Lav Agarwal, joint secretary, Union health ministry, during a routine press briefing.The Centre told the Delhi high court on Thursday that as of May 19, there were 7,251 people with mucormycosis in India, of which 200 were in Delhi.Mucormycosis is a fungal infection with a fatality rate of at least 50%. Typically a rare disease, experts and doctors say thousands have now contracted it because of an overuse of steroids or due to suppression of their immune system, which is often a fallout of attempts to stop the life-threatening immune overreaction due to Covid-19.ICMR director-general Balram Bhargava said these infections are of fungal spores that typically exist in abundance in the environment. “If a person’s immunity is suppressed, it will infect them. If the spores have access to high sugar, it will grow. We have seen this happen with Covid-19 patients with diabetes and uncontrolled sugar, or who are immuno-compromised or have been given immune-suppressants,” he added.Also Read| ‘Get black fungus medicine from wherever in world’: Delhi HC to CentreSeveral states are scrambling to place orders for the life-saving drugs required for it, and a Union minister announced manufacturing was being stepped up. According to the Union government’s lawyers at the Delhi high court, which asked the Centre to submit a report on steps taken to import drugs for it, the supplies of Amphotericin B, the only last line drug that can treat it, are being distributed on the basis of caseloads. The court was hearing a clutch of petitions for better Covid-19 management, and one of the petitioners mentioned the shortage of, and clamour for, Amphotericin B.The Centre’s counsels Kirtiman Singh and Amit Mahajan told the court that as per the case load, 3,150 vials have been released to the Capital in three tranches between May 11 and May 20. To this, the Delhi government’s lawyer, senior advocate Rahul Mehra, said that the projected weekly demand was 15,000 vials.“We are not questioning your allocation…you are doing good work… You need to import this to bridge the gap between your plan to enhance the capacity and completing manufacture before we lose more precious lives. So act fast on this…Float a global tender and ask internationally….Make a global enquiry,” a bench of justices Vipin Sanghi and Jasmeet Singh told the Centre’s lawyers.Meanwhile, on Thursday, Mansukh Mandaviya, who is the Union minister of state for chemicals and fertilisers, said in a tweet: “Black Fungus (Mucormycosis) curing drug #AmphotericinB’s shortage will be resolved soon! Within three days, 5 more Pharma companies have got New Drug Approval for producing it in India, in addition to the existing 6 pharma companies”.The shortage has been triggered by an unprecedented surge in cases, which often requires one patient to be treated with multiple vials of the antifungal drug. Experts at Delhi’s All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) said on Wednesday they would normally see 10-15 cases a year, but have now received over 100 cases this month itself.Also Read| After black fungus, reports of white fungus infections surface. What we know“Cannot talk about disease incidence as such but in our clinical life we would see maximum five to seven such patients in the intensive care units. It was rare,” said Dr Anjan Trikha, professor, department of anesthesia, critical care and pain medicine, AIIMS, Delhi on Thursday.Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Thursday said he has directed three government-run hospitals in Delhi to set up dedicated centres for mucormycosis cases, while promising to ensure adequate supply of medicines needed to treat the disease.The facilities will be at Lok Nayak Hospital, Guru Teg Bahadur Hospital, and Rajiv Gandhi Super Speciality Hospital.Delhi has in place a four-member technical committee to “streamline and systemise” the distribution of Amphotericin-B. Hospitals need to raise requests for supply with this committee. After an approval, the Directorate General of Health Services issues the drug to the representative of the facility.Even though it has not been yet established whether the virus that causes Covid-19 is directly responsible for growing cases, clinicians say several factors found in Covid-19 patients could lead to the secondary infection.“Mucormycosis needs a fertile soil to grow, and high blood glucose levels, lack of oxygen, acidosis and suppressed immunity all contributes towards the growth. In Covid-19 patients there is a high probability of having all these factors that perhaps is leading to increase in cases,” said Dr Ambrish Mithal, chairman, department of endocrinology and diabetes, Max Healthcare.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-faces-black-fungus-epidemic-as-cases-climb-101621550432802.html
21-05-2021||India||Andhra defends sedition case against YSRCP MP||The Andhra Pradesh government has denied torturing rebel YSR Congress Party Member of Parliament KR Krishnam Raju who is currently in police custody for sedition charge. Raju had approached the Supreme Court for bail early this week and sought urgent medical examination claiming that the Crime Investigation Department (CID) had tortured him in custody following his arrest on May 14.Raju, who belongs to the ruling party in the state had claimed witch-hunt by Chief Minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy after he openly criticized the Government’s handling of the COVID-19 crisis and even demanded cancellation of bail granted to the Chief Minister in a corruption case. Raju claimed that he was a victim of political vengeance and had no faith in the state government-constituted Medical Board set up by the Andhra Pradesh High Court to examine him.Filing a response to Raju’s plea, the state government through advocate Mahfooz A Nazki said, “The allegations about police torture are completely false and have been made pursuant to a design and are aimed solely to create euphoria around the arrest. Had there been an iota of truth in such allegations, the State would not have consented to examination of the petitioner (Raju).”The statement of the state government assumes significance as it comes ahead of a crucial hearing in Supreme Court on Raju’s bail plea. On May 17, the Supreme Court had directed the Army Hospital, Secunderabad to form a medical board and examine the MP, video-graph the entire proceedings and submit its report to the Registrar General of the Telangana High Court in a sealed cover. This report will be opened by the Supreme Court on Friday based on which the Court will ascertain whether there was any truth in Raju’s allegation.Referring to the various speeches and statements given by Raju on public forums, the state justified its action of registering FIR against the Member of Parliament. It said, “It is not a one-time slip or an error of judgment but the statements (by Raju) have been made in furtherance of a deliberate design and a conspiracy hatched by several individuals including the petitioner herein to create unrest in the State by dividing people on the basis of caste and religion.”In doing so, Raju abused his authority and reach as a public person to create enmity between various class of citizens and excite disaffection towards the government, the state maintained. The affidavit further stated that being a MP does not offer any immunity to the petitioner. “On the contrary, being an elected representative to the Lok Sabha, the Petitioner owes a higher level of responsibility,” state submitted.Raju in his petition filed through advocate Tatini Basu had claimed that his right to criticize the government was part of his fundamental right to free speech. But the state put a rider that such a right cannot extend to “creating a situation where public order is disturbed”. It produced speeches made by Raju over the past one year encouraging people of one religious community to beat and kill members of another religious group.“The arrest was not a knee jerk reaction,” the state claimed. The words and actions of the petitioner MP were manifesting in actual violence across the state. It was then the state decided to register FIR. “It is a settled position of law that the police can register an offence suo moto….The petitioner cannot be heard to say that the state ought to have waited with folded hands till an actual complaint was filed,” the state government added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/andhra-defends-sedition-case-against-ysrcp-mp-101621538024870.html
21-05-2021||India||Covid-19: What you need to know today||India has reported 287,160 deaths from the coronavirus disease till May 19. Of these, 75,305, or a little over 26%, were recorded in the first 19 days of May. By the end of May, India would have reported at least 100,000 deaths for the month. No country, not the US, not Brazil, has reported more deaths in a month. And anecdotally, the divergence between reported and actual deaths is likely to have been the most in the month.In a previous column, I sought to put an estimate to the extent of underreporting (Dispatch, May 3), arriving at a range of 1.03 to 3.10 times the reported number of deaths for the actual death toll. I surmised at the time that the midpoint of this range was the most likely extent of underreporting (my view hasn’t changed, despite far more sophisticated estimations that have since emerged).The number of deaths isn’t surprising because India has seen 6,608,317 cases, or a little under 26% of the 25,771,260 cases it has reported to date, in the first 19 days of May. Since deaths lag cases by around two weeks, it is likely that the gap between these two, the proportion of cases reported in May to the overall number of cases, and the proportion of deaths reported in May to the overall deaths, widens, with the latter inching up and the former down.Also Read| MHA asks states to help vulnerable sections, kids orphaned due to Covid-19The 75,305 deaths translate into 56 per million in the first 19 days of May, and if the month sees 100,000 deaths (it will exceed that), it would translate into 74 deaths per million. In comparison, the US saw almost 300 deaths per million in its worst month, January. Based on data for the first 19 days of the month (see table), only Goa and Delhi exceed the US number, but as I have written previously in this column, a death is a death and only statisticians and apologists look for per-million comparisons as if this were a measure of the degree of suffering. And in May, India has suffered. That and the high number of deaths in the month so far are the likely reasons why coverage of India’s handling of the second wave of the pandemic has been sharply critical in both domestic and foreign media. And it’s the reason photographs of hundreds of funeral pyres and bodies buried in shallow graves on the banks of rivers (with a piece of coloured cloth to mark each) have gone viral. In many ways, May has been the cruelest month – for everyone.May’s death toll can be attributed to three factors, which, in turn, point to three lapses: one, the emergence of variants (and the inadequate surveillance of variants); two, the non-adherence to Covid safety protocols such as social distancing (and the carelessness, complacency, and easing of restrictions that allowed these); and three, the low level of vaccination (and a flawed vaccine drive). Compounding these were other factors, such as inadequate health care infrastructure, the lack of a plan to deal with a rush of cases (few states adopted triaging), and unavailability of crucial medical inputs such as oxygen and medicines when and where they were needed the most. There are learnings all around – provided we are willing to accept that mistakes were made, and that people lost their lives as a result.Also Read| PM Narendra Modi asks for constant upgradation of ideas to defeat Covid-19PS: There has been a spate of reports comparing deaths this year to deaths in the corresponding month last year, but this approach runs the risk of being inaccurate simply because last year’s 68-day hard lockdown saw few people stepping out of homes, even to obtain death certificates in April and May. A better approach would be to use the long-term average of deaths – as long as this data is available.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid19-what-you-need-to-know-today-101621537568986.html
21-05-2021||India||BBMP differs on proposed health directorate taking over Covid duties in city||Bengaluru: Even as Bengaluru continues to fight the surging second wave of Covid-19 pandemic, the state government is working on the creation of Bengaluru Health Directorate, to be constituted under the department of health and family welfare, which will take over the Covid-19 duties from the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP). While the government thinks Bengaluru requires a better healthcare system, officials of the BBMP feel that changing the healthcare duties during a pandemic could be counterproductive. Deputy chief minister CN Ashwath Narayan, who also heads the state’s Covid-19 task force, said the committee is looking at the technicalities of the change in roles and it will submit a report during the next meeting of the task force. “Healthcare in the city has been found wanting during the pandemic. We propose to build a 100-bed, hi-tech hospital in every assembly segment and a super-speciality hospital for every four assembly segments. There are many agencies carrying out public health functions in the city. The new directorate will bring them all under one umbrella,” said Narayan. While many in the government said it was much needed, BBMP officials are opposed to it. Bengaluru has 144 primary health care centres (PHCs), six referral hospitals, 26 maternity hospitals, eight tertiary hospitals. While the PHCs come under BBMP, others are already run by the health department and department of medical education, argued a senior health department official, on the condition of anonymity. “There is a feeling that BBMP is unable to provide the healthcare the city requires. There was an earlier to plan to bring all hospitals under BBMP. Now the proposal is to make a separate directorate, under the department of health, which will exclusively look at Bengaluru’s healthcare need. Of course, the final decision on the matter is yet to taken by the government,” the official said. The BBMP, however, opposes the decision claiming under the 74th amendment of the Constitution, healthcare should be with the urban local body and not a government department. “The 74th constitutional amendment talks about the devolution of powers to urban local bodies. It mandates that the urban local body have a decisive role in planning, provision and delivery of services, which includes health. In Bengaluru’s case, it is BBMP. So, it will not be constitutional to take these powers away from BBMP,” said a senior BBMP official, who didn’t wish to be named. Another BBMP official added that changing the system while the city is dealing with a pandemic is not a wise move. “It was only recently that the state government announced its intention to decentralise the fight against the pandemic and empower wards, on the lines of Kerala and Mumbai models. After announcing such a decision, taking powers away from the local body doesn’t make sense,” he said. Meanwhile, a senior bureaucrat clarified that the new proposal will not be in violation of 74th amendment since a new directorate specific to Bengaluru will be created. “To give an example the electricity in the city is provided by Bangalore Electricity Supply Company Limited (BESCOM). It is independent of the BBMP. So the new directorate will be similar,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bbmp-differs-on-proposed-health-directorate-taking-over-covid-duties-in-city-101621537904837.html

According to them, CM Yediyurappa announcing a financial relief package of ₹1,250 crore for certain sections of people affected economically by the Covid-19 pandemic has been done keeping the extension in mind. The financial package involves a one-time payment of ₹10,000 to about 20,000 flower growers and 69,000 farmers who produce fruit and vegetables costing the exchequer a total of around ₹81.73 crore. Relief ranging from ₹2,000 to 3,000 will be provided to around 210,000 lakh licensed autorickshaw, taxi, and maxi cab drivers, and around 304,000 people working as barbers, dhobis, porters, ragpickers, potters, goldsmiths, mechanics, and domestic workers. “The cases in the city are coming down, but discontinuing the lockdown is not a practical decision since all the progress made during the last few days could be undone by reopening. Even experts believe that the lockdown should be extended,” said a senior bureaucrat, who didn’t want to be named. A minister, who is part of the state Covid task force, said that a decision will be announced a day before the lockdown ends. “The details of the extension are yet to be decided. There is a difference of opinion on whether it should be for a week or two. A decision will be taken soon,” he said. Meanwhile, one-third of the cases and fatalities since the Covid-19 outbreak in Karnataka, took place in the last two-and-a-half months when the second wave hit the state, reveals official data. According to the data, 706,449 people got infected, of which 7,980 people lost their lives between March 1 and May 15. However, since the outbreak of the pandemic last year, 21,71,931 contracted Covid, out of which 21,434 lost their lives. The data shows that 20,206 children up to the age of nine were infected in the second wave, which killed 17 of them, whereas 51,673 teenagers contracted the disease, of which 19 lost their lives. People in their twenties accounted for 153,174 infections of which 151 lost their lives. According to the data, as many as 467 people in their thirties, 1,037 in their forties, and 1,717 in their fifties died of Covid in the second wave. People above 60 years of age were the worst hit in the second wave. Out of 93,483 infected, 2,198 sexagenarians lost their lives while 1,584 people among the 28,658 infected persons in their seventies succumbed to the virus. The mortality rate among people in their 80s and 90s was very high compared to any other age group. Out of 8,165 infected octogenarians, 674 died of Covid, taking the Case Fatality Rate (CFR) to 8.3 per cent. Among those in the 90s, the CFR is 11.9 per cent with 970 infections and 115 deaths.

21-05-2021||India||Jagan govt adopts resolution against privatisation of Vizag steel plant||The Andhra Pradesh legislative assembly on Thursday unanimously passed a resolution opposing the central government’s proposal to privatise the Rashtriya Ispat Nigam Limited, also known as Visakhapatnam Steel Plant. The resolution was introduced by state minister for industries Mekapati Gautam Reddy during the one-day budget session in the assembly on Thursday. The resolution said it was opposing the decision of Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA) for 100% strategic disinvestment of the Government of India’s shareholding in the RINL, Visakhapatnam, along with management control by way of privatisation. “The state cabinet deliberated on the issue at its meeting on February 23 and discussed the unrest among the trade unions and the general public of Visakhapatnam and decided to adopt a resolution in the assembly,” Reddy said. The resolution was adopted unanimously with a voice vote in the assembly, before it was adjourned sine die. It also resolved to seek the support of Centre to make RINL profitable calling it the pride of “Telugu People” and the state of Andhra Pradesh. The minister said the state government was supporting the cause of protecting the RINL from disinvestment, considering the sensitivity of the issue and widespread agitation by the trade unions and common public against the said proposal. He reminded that chief minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy had written a detailed letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi on February 6, requesting to reconsider the proposal of disinvestment. “He (the CM) also suggested alternative solutions that might be helpful to address the issue of huge losses incurred by the RINL,” the minister added. Explaining the history of RINL, the minister reminded that people of the state had rallied for the Visakhapatnam Steel Plant cause, in which 32 lives were lost. The plant was commissioned and started production in 1989-90. Around 16,000 were employed as permanent and around 15,000 were employed as contact workers, thus creating huge employment for the people of Andhra Pradesh. Also, another 70,000 people were employed indirectly in various ancillary units. He said the company incurred losses of ₹4,982 crore up to 2001-02. Capital restructuring was done by the Centre in 1993 and 1998 converting its loans of ₹1,384 crore into equity and ₹2,937 crore as preference share capital. Since then, it earned continuous profits for 13 years up to 2014-15 aggregating to ₹12,958 crore, the minister said. He said RINL had achieved highest ever capacity utilisation of 6.3 million tonnes per annum against the installed capacity of 7.3 MTPA from December 2020 and started making a monthly profit of close to ₹200 crore. Continuing this performance for a further period of two years will help the financial situation immensely, the minister said. Reddy said the state government had requested the Centre to allot captive iron ore mines in Odisha to the RINL to reduce input costs and restructure its finances by converting its high interest debt of ₹22,000 crore into equity. “The Vizag steel plant stands as a testimony to the will of Telugu people and lives as an icon of Telugu achievement in our collective psyche. The government of the Andhra Pradesh is strongly against the privatisation of RINL and is ready to support the government of India, and ministry of steel to protect the jewel of the state,” Reddy added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jagan-govt-adopts-resolution-against-privatisation-of-vizag-steel-plant-101621537786010.html
21-05-2021||India||‘Financial package announced by Yediyurappa unlikely to give any relief’||BengaluruThe financial package announced by Karnataka chief minister BS Yediyurappa as a measure of relief for those hardest hit due to the Covid-19 induced lockdown is unlikely to benefit those in dire need of it, said the members of unions for domestic workers, taxi and cab drivers, and activists among other sections.Yediyurappa announced a ₹1,250-crore package on Wednesday, largely aimed at unorganised section of workers, but lack of registration facilities for various occupations, excessive documentation requirements, rental and multiple drivers for each vehicle and technical errors on Aadhaar-linked accounts among other problems weigh in on the actual payout as against the announced relief, they added.The package comes at a time when Karnataka continues to remain in the tightening grip of the Covid-19 pandemic, forcing the government to go back on its decision to not announce a lockdown on account of unpreparedness for the impact of the imminent second wave of infections despite warnings from the state’s technical advisory committee (TAC) in November last year.“Most of our members are yet to receive relief payments from last year itself,” Tanveer Pasha, president of the Ola Uber Drivers and Owners Association said.In May last year, Yediyurappa announced a similar package of ₹1,610 crore that, among others, was aimed at providing ₹5,000 each to about 60,000 washermen, 230,000 barbers, 775,000 auto and taxi drivers.However, this time around there has been a sharp decline in the number of beneficiaries too, according to the statement by the chief minister’s office.In the case of auto, taxi, and maxi cab drivers, a one-time relief of ₹3,000 has been announced for 210,000 beneficiaries from an estimated 775,000 beneficiaries last time around.“Last time we took the full numbers and then couldn’t trace them. So this time, we stuck to those who registered,” according to a senior government official, requesting not to be named.The official, directly involved in the decision-making of the relief payout, said even the quantum of relief is lower than last year as the lockdown has been ‘brief’ compared to 2020.M Manjunath, the president of the Adarsha Auto and Taxi Drivers Union, said the total payout was made to just 210,000 people last year. This included both auto and taxi drivers.There are over 200,000 auto rickshaws in Bengaluru and another 100,000 across the state, according to estimates by unions. “We cannot understand how they estimated the total number of drivers,” Manjunath said. There are no exact statistics on the unorganised workforce in most urban centres in the country mostly due to the lack of any unions, recognition from the government, or issue of identification cards, activists and union members said.Among the most vulnerable are domestic workers, who have been forced to remain at home without pay. “Most domestic workers have no work. Now, they are giving ₹2,000. We don’t know how to even go there and take it,” Chitra, a domestic help said.There is no official data on the total number of domestic workers in Bengaluru, activists said, which adds to the confusion as to how one can avail the relief, although it is grossly insufficient. The government has announced to bear the burden of interest for three months only for farmers. However, no relief has been given to other sections that also have debt piling on account of loss of income.“We do not get loans from cooperative or nationalised banks. It is mostly NBFCs or private banks. We were hoping that they (NBFCs and private banks) would be called and warned not to harass us for payments,” Manjunath added.Nor any relief on home rentals, which is one of the biggest -- if not the biggest -- expenditure of most working households.“The relief announced by the state government shows its callous attitude. It’s mere lip-service,” Vinay Sreenivasa, advocate and member of Federation of Street Vendor Union of Bengaluru, told Hindustan Times.He adds that the government is out of touch with reality which is paying ₹2,000 as ‘relief’.“Even in terms of disbursement, there is confusion. No one knows how to get it. Government should speak to unions and workers first and understand the reality of the crisis and respond comprehensively,” Sreenivasa added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/financial-package-announced-by-yediyurappa-unlikely-to-give-any-relief-101621537784835.html
21-05-2021||India||1/3rd of all K’taka Covid deaths reported in May this year: Data||Bengaluru Even as Karnataka continues to witness a decline in new Covid-19 cases, however, the rising daily death count indicates the severity of the second wave. According to the daily health bulletin data, the first 20 days of May accounted for over one-third or 34% of all the Covid deaths in the state since March last year. While the BS Yediyurappa government is relying on the declining Covid numbers to suggest a recovery of sorts, the rising fatality rates in the state and in Bengaluru present a grim picture. Karnataka on Thursday recorded 28,869 new cases and 548 deaths with Bengaluru accounting for 9,409 cases and 289 deaths, according to the health bulletin. Data shows that Karnataka recorded at least 8,336 Covid-19 deaths since May 1 out of the total 23,854 registered in the state since March last year.According to experts, this is due to the “lag period” or the time when a patient is under the intensive care units (ICU) before succumbing to the virus.“Deaths come 14 days after the infections are reported. So the deaths you are seeing now are patients from early May when we were at the peak. When infections come down, deaths will be high,” Dr V Ravi, neurovirologist and member of state’s technical advisory committee (TAC) said.As per the data, the case fatality rate (CFR) in the state rose from 0.66% on May 1 to 1.35% on May 19, it shows. In Bengaluru, which accounts for the bulk of the state’s new infections and fatalities, CFR has increased from 0.41% between March 26 and April 1 to 1.77% between May 14 and May 20, according to data from the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP).The government has been using the decline in positivity rate, which rose from 3.95% in the last week of March to 38.27% in the second week of May, to justify that the pandemic was finally subsiding. The positivity rate has come down from 38.27% between May 6-12 to 28.86% between May 13-19, data shows.Though, there has been a lower number of daily infections, experts said that there is likely to be an increase in deaths. “As the infections come down, deaths will go up,” Dr Ravi added.The state government has enforced a lockdown till at least May 24 which is likely to get extended in a bid to control another spurt in infections , multiple people aware of the developments said.Experts said the pattern in Karnataka follows that of Maharashtra and Delhi, where infections have seen a decline while other states that experienced the second wave a little later will now witness a surge.“Even though the number of cases is expected to drop over the period of one to two weeks, at least in Bengaluru, the number of deaths will remain the same or may be a little more,” Dr CN Manjunath, senior cardiologist and Director of Sri Jayadeva Institute of Cardiovascular Sciences and Research in Bengaluru said.“Lot of sick patients are undergoing treatment in the ICU. Some of them will survive and some of them will succumb. Both (decline in infections and fatalities) will not synchronise,” Manjunath, who is also a member of TAC, said.While Bengaluru has seen its daily caseload decline over the last one week, there has been a significant drop in testing numbers. Senior government officials told HT that the state is doing more ‘targeted testing’.Data shows that the state conducted 177,982 tests (both RT-PCR) and RAT) on May 1 which declined to 124,110 on May 10, 118,345 on May 15. However, testing has marginally picked up since then and on Wednesday, Karnataka conducted 129,538 tests.“There is no point in hiding the statistics. We are conducting more than 1,25,000 tests every day. We are working to further increase the number and get the report within 24 hours,” K Sudhakar, Karnataka’s minister for health, family welfare and medical education said in a statement on Thursday.Data also shows that while there is dip in fresh cases in Bengaluru, other districts of the state are witnessing a surge, raising concerns of a collapse of the already inadequate healthcare system, just as it happened in the state capital.“We have to do more tests. And despite doing more tests, if cases do come down then that is the real beginning of the decline,” Dr Manjunath said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/13rd-of-all-k-taka-covid-deaths-reported-in-may-this-year-data-101621537724777.html
21-05-2021||India||Andhra tables budget of ₹2.29 lakh crore for 2021-22||The Andhra Pradesh government on Thursday presented the state’s annual budget for 2021-22 with an outlay of ₹2,29,779 crore and focus on welfare, health, agriculture and education. Andhra Pradesh finance minister Buggana Rajendranath Reddy estimated a revenue expenditure of ₹1,82,196.54 crore and capital expenditure, including loan repayments and other capital disbursements, estimated at around ₹47,582.73 crore. The minister presented the budget in the state legislative assembly after Governor Biswabhusan Harichandan’s customary address to a joint sitting of the two Houses during the one-day session. The one-day session was called by the YSR Congress Party government as a “statutory obligation”, as is mandatory for Assembly to meet every six months. The budget projected the revenue deficit at around ₹5,000.05 crore, which is 0.47% of the Gross State Domestic Product (GSDP) and the fiscal deficit at around ₹37,029.79 crore, 3.49% of the GSDP. The budget, which is generally presented in March, was delayed by two months, as the Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy led state government deferred the budget session on account of elections to urban local bodies and bypoll to Tirupati parliamentary constituency. Earlier in the wake of delayed budget session, the state government had taken the ordinance route on March 31 to adopt the vote-on-account budget for ₹70,994.98 crore for the first three months of the financial year 2021-22, beginning on April 1. Stating that building effective social infrastructure was imperative for registering consistent progress in strategic development goals, Reddy said, “Nava Ratnalu (nine jewels) programme taken up by the chief minister was devised to prioritise welfare of all sections of people, particularly the Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes, BCs, EBCs and minorities.” He said an amount of ₹28,237 crore has been allocated for the weaker sections. The economically backward sections were allocated ₹5,478 crore, an increase of 8% over the previous year. Kapus (an agrarian ommunity in the state) were allocated ₹3,306 crore, Brahmins ₹359 crore, SC sub-plan ₹17,403 crore, ST sub-plan ₹6,131 crore, minorities ₹3,840 crore, child welfare ₹16,748 crore and women development ₹47,283 crore, the minister said in the budget. The finance minister also made a substantial allocation of ₹13,830 crore for the health sector, including ₹2,258 crore under Dr YSR Aarogyasri scheme to provide free-of-cost treatment to the poor and needy patients in government and private network hospitals and ₹1,538.55 crore under Nadu-Nedu scheme to improve health infrastructure. While agriculture sector was allocated ₹11,210 crore and education got the maximum of ₹24,624 crore, an amount of ₹5,661 crore was allocated for housing and infrastructure development and ₹1,000 crore for industrial incentives. Reddy also announced enhancement of funds for the Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) scheme in various sectors. Some of the major allocations made under the DBT schemes include ₹17,000 crore to YSR Pension Kanuka, ₹3,845 crore to YSR Rythu Bharosa, ₹2,500 crore to Jagananna Vidya Deevena, ₹1,802 crore to YSR Fasal Bima Yojana, ₹1,112 crore to Zero Interest loans for DWCRA groups and ₹500 crore to farmers etc. While industrial and infrastructure development was allocated ₹3,673 crore, roads and buildings got ₹7,394 crore, energy sector ₹6,637 crore, municipalities and urban development ₹8,727 crore and irrigation ₹13,237 crore. “Andhra Pradesh currently ranks 3rd at the national level across 17 strategic development goals. It shall be our endeavour to be at the forefront of achievement of SDGs at the national level. To invest in the future of our citizens and empower them to realise their true potential shall continue to be the constant endeavour of our government,” the finance minister said. The principal opposition Telugu Desam Party (TDP) boycotted the one-day budget session in protest against the “misrule” of the state government. The TDP said it will hold a ‘mock’ Assembly session on Thursday evening and Friday morning to discuss state government ‘failures’. The budget was subsequently passed without any discussion. D Tirupati Raju, chairman of Confederation of Indian Industry (CII), Andhra Pradesh unit, said despite Covid-19 pandemic, the state government has taken required steps for sustainable growth. “The allocations made in the budget for welfare schemes would create demand for various goods and services in the economy and industry move. In fact, the budget introduced gender-specific and children-specific allocations with a greater focus on measurable outcome on the money spent for children and women are the vision of the education importance to society,” Raju said. On industrial front, he said, the government should further focus to showcase the strengths of the state to attract greater investments.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/andhra-tables-budget-of-2-29-lakh-crore-for-202122-101621537725303.html
21-05-2021||India||TN cuts RT-PCR rate, rolls out jabs for 18-44 age group||Tamil Nadu chief minister MK Stalin on Thursday launched the vaccination drive for 18-44 age group in the state. The state government also slashed prices of RT-PCR tests from ₹1,200 to ₹900 in private labs across the state and declared mucormycosis as a notified disease. For those who are covered under the Tamil Nadu Chief Minister’s Comprehensive Health Insurance Scheme (CMCHIS), the RT-PCR test price has been reduced from ₹800 to ₹550. The prices of pooled samples are reduced from ₹600 to ₹400. Additionally, ₹300 can be levied for testing at home. State health secretary J Radhakrishnan issued a notice on Thursday on this regard. After last year, this is the second time that prices are being capped. Tamil Nadu only conducts RT-PCR tests and not rapid antigen tests. Meanwhile, Stalin launched the vaccination drive for the 18-44 age group from Tiruppur district. The state received 960,000 doses of vaccine from the Centre for this age group while another 420,000 doses are soon to be delivered to the state, officials in know of the development said. Tamil Nadu was among several states that could not roll out vaccines for this age group on May 1 due to shortage. However, several private hospitals that had procured vaccines were already vaccinating the age group. The state plans to procure 15 million doses through the Centre and 35 million doses through a global tender. On Thursday, Governor Banwarilal Purohit declared mucormycosis or black fungus as a notified disease under the provisions of the Tamil Nadu Public Health Act, 1939. It effectively means that from now on all hospitals treating the fungal infection will have to notify the public health department. Nine people have been identified with mucormycosis in Tamil Nadu. “Of the nine, seven patients are diabetic,” Radhakrishnan said at a press briefing. “Treatment has been started for all them. There is no death reported till now,” the state health secretary added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tn-cuts-rt-pcr-rate-rolls-out-jabs-for-18-44-age-group-101621537544838.html
21-05-2021||India||Singapore orders Facebook, Twitter to issue correction on Covid-19 variant||Singapore on Thursday ordered Facebook and Twitter to carry a correction notice to users in the country on statements claiming a new variant of Sars-Cov-2 originated in the city-state, a day after the remark by Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal to the effect led to a diplomatic row and a verbal tussle between the Centre and Aam Aadmi Party.Singapore’s health ministry said a statement circulating online on media outlets and social media platforms implied a new, previously unknown variant originated in Singapore and risked spreading to India from the city-state.“There is no new “Singapore” variant of Covid- 19. Neither is there evidence of any Covid-19 variant that is ‘extremely dangerous for kids’,” said the ministry in a statement.The correction order was issued under Singapore’s fake news law or the Protection from Online Falsehoods and Manipulation Act (POFMA). Facebook and Twitter confirmed receipt of the order.The controversy first began on Tuesday when Kejriwal said a Singapore variant of the virus could affect India in the third wave and appealed to the Centre to cancel air services with the city-state.Hours later, Singapore’s health ministry dismissed his assertions, and said the variant prevalent in many Covid-19 cases in recent weeks was the “B.1.617.2 variant, which originated in India”.On Wednesday, external affairs minister S Jaishankar said the chief minister “does not speak for India”, and external affairs ministry spokesperson Arindam Bagchi said the Indian high commissioner P Kumaran clarified the matter with his Singapore counterparts.In response , Delhi’s deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia contended that the Centre and Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) were only concerned about their image globally, and not about the well-being of the country’s children.It is rare for the external affairs ministry to acknowledge that an Indian envoy has been called in by a foreign government to lodge a protest, and to publicly criticise an elected Indian representative.Singapore’s high commissioner Simon Wong later told a virtual news conference that his country was satisfied with the Indian government’s clarification, but reserved the right to invoke the domestic fake news law to prevent the spreading of misinformation.People familiar with developments said on condition of anonymity that Singapore’s strong reaction to the incident was because of both public outrage and strong concerns that online comments could be passed off as facts.After Kejriwal posted his tweet on Tuesday, several related issues dominated Twitter trends in Singapore, reflecting concerns among the public. The people cited above said there were concerns that, without a strong rebuttal, the local and international media could begin reporting about a new coronavirus strain and any number of clarifications at a later stage would be of little use.These concerns were also conveyed to the Indian side, resulting in the public comment on the chief minister’s comments by Jaishankar.Facebook and Twitter said they complied as per the local law.A prompt on users’ Facebook news feeds linked to a government website that said there was no new “Singapore” variant of Covid-19. Twitter sent notifications to its account holders based in Singapore, which included a tweet from the government’s official account @POFMA_Notice.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/singapore-orders-fb-twitter-to-issue-correction-on-variant-101621537065809.html
21-05-2021||India||219 black fungus deaths reported from 13 states||There have been at least 219 deaths due to mucormycosis, according to officials in 13 states on Thursday, as the alarm around a typically rare disease grew this week, prompting the Union government to urge states to make it mandatory for all hospitals to report if they detect these cases.The Union government told the Delhi high court there were 7,251 cases of mucormycosis, also known as black fungus, across the country.Of these, Maharashtra, which also has had the highest Covid-19 case burden, reported the most infections at 1,500 cases and 90 fatalities with Gujarat detecting the next-highest numbers of 1,163 cases.The issue was raised by Maharashtra health minister Rajesh Tope at a meeting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday.After the meeting, he said, the state government needs more supply of Amphotericin B, the medicine used in its treatment, from the Centre.“Maharashtra faces a shortage of Amphotericin B, a key medicine required to treat mucormycosis patients, and the state needs 1.50 lakh to two lakh vials of that medicine, but has received only 16,000 from the Centre,” he said, terming the disease as the prime concern for the state now with Covid cases witnessing a sharp decline.The infection, which some doctors have blamed on the high use of steroids to combat Covid-19, kills more than 50 percent of sufferers within days. In some cases, eyes and upper jaws are removed by surgeons to save lives.Also Read| India faces black fungus epidemic as cases climbGujarat, Tamil Nadu and Telangana became the latest to declare black fungus as notifiable disease under the epidemic diseases act, a day after Rajasthan, and following a letter from the Union health ministry suggesting so. Once a disease is categories as notifiable disease under the Epidemic Disease Act, hospitals must report it to the integrated disease surveillance programme.Tope’s statement came on a day when the Delhi high court asked the Centre to take steps to source Amphotericin B from wherever it is available in the world.In Gujarat, where officials told HT there were close to 1,200 cases and 61 deaths, special wards have been set up in major cities to deal with the rising cases. More than half of these cases have come in the past fortnight, said a state government official.“A separate mucormycosis ward with 250 beds has been established in Rajkot,” said Dr RS Trivedi, Medical Superintendent of Surat Medical College.In Madhya Pradesh, where officials said there were 575 cases and 31 deaths, lack of the anti-fungal drug was making treatment tough, doctors said.“We are performing surgeries of eyes and jaws daily to save the life of patients but how will we control the spread without drug?” said a doctor treating a black fungus patient in Bhopal.A patient from Jabalpur, Arpit Rai, said: “I was admitted in the hospital 26 days ago for Covid 19 treatment but now I am suffering from mucormycosis. My one eye has been infected badly and I need the injection of amphotericin B but it unavailable in Jabalpur.”Also Read| ‘Get black fungus medicine from wherever in world’: Delhi HC to CentreMP Health department minister Prabhuram Chaudhary said: “We are trying to get anti-fungal medicine from pharma companies in Gujarat.

Among the deceased was a local doctor, who died at the Ruban Memorial Hospital, a private facility in Patna, on May 17.On May 12, a 58-year-old man from Kaimur, died at Patna’s All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), which has a dedicated facility for black fungus cases.Dr Anjani Kumar, additional director, health services, Bihar, said Bihar has diverted around 14,000 vials of liposomal Amphotericin-B injection, available under the kala-azar elimination programme, for treatment.Uttarakhand has reported 48 cases of black fungus so far, of which three infected patients have died.Also Read| ‘Free treatment for black fungus across all districts’: Rajasthan CMRajasthan reported over 80 cases of black fungs and many of them have been admitted in special ward in Jaipur’s Sawai Madho Singh (SMS) hospital.

A joint team of local District Reserve Guard (DRG), Special Task Force and Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) had traveled to the area after receiving information that a group of Maoist cadres had gathered near Tiriya with an intention to perpetrate a big incident on July 28 which is observed as Shaheed Diwas.During the encounter, six Maoists, including three women cadres and a civilian, were killed and several arms and ammunition, including seven rifles, were recovered.The central government has claimed that there has been a 70% decline in Maoists violence in the country – from an all time high of 2,258 incidents in 2009 to 665 in 2020.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nia-takes-over-probe-into-2019-maoist-encounter-in-chhattisgarh-101621536344767.html
21-05-2021||India||Pinarayi Vijayan takes oath as Kerala CM, 20 ministers inducted in cabinet||Kerala Governor Arif Mohammad Khan on Thursday administered oath of office and secrecy to Pinarayi Vijayan and 20 of his cabinet members at a function at central stadium in the state capital.In the recently-concluded assembly elections, the ruling Left Democratic Front (LDF) stormed back to power after winning a brute majority of 99 seats in the 140-member house. The lead Communist Party of India (Marxist), however, decided to drop all members of the outgoing ministry other than the chief minister to induct fresh faces. Junior partner Communist Party of India (CPI) followed suit by inducting four new faces.Among new ministers inducted into the cabinet was journalist-turned- politician Veena George (44) who was given the health portfolio, replacing the high-profile K K Shailaja. P A Mohammad Riyas, the chief minister’s son-in-law, was given two key portfolios, tourism and public works department. Former member of Rajya Sabha K N Balagopal was announced as the new finance minister, succeeding Dr Thomas Isaac, an economist. Another former Rajya Sabha member P Rajeev was declared the new industry minister. Prof R Bindhu, wife of acting secretary A Vijayaraghavan, will be the higher education minister.Amid a triple lockdown in Thiruvananthapuram, invitees were limited to less than 400 after several leaders and organisations pleaded the government to hold the ceremony online in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic. The government, however, went ahead with the programme amid strict restrictions in place. CPI)M) general secretary Sitaram Yechury was among those who attended the function.With his party’s victory, chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan changed the state’s political script of alternating power between two coalitions for more than four decades. After the second successive win, he has turned into an unquestionable leader within the party and Left movement in the country.Vijayan managed to hold the party and LDF together while the Left forces surrendered meekly in erstwhile forts, West Bengal and Tripura. With his inimitable style, he made use of natural disasters (two consecutive floods in 2018 and 2019) and pandemic to his credit. His daily press briefing at 6 pm almost turned into a staple for the common man as a close look at the election results showed that people from all castes, regions and economic classes had extended their support to his government.A look at profile of key ministersVeena George: Health minister Journalist-turned-politician Veena George (44) will replace high-profile health minister K K Shailaja in Pinarayi Vijayan 2.0. Elected from Aranmula (Pathanamthitta) constituency for the second time, she was handed over the crucial portfolio at a time when the state is struggling to contain the pandemic. Widespread protests had erupted after Shailaja, the face of the fight against pandemic in the state, was denied a second term. The new minister will be under tremendous pressure to keep up the image of her predecessor.A post-graduate in physics, George was associated with several news channels as an anchor and producer before entering politics. Though she was active in the Left movement during her student days, her entry into electoral politics was quite accidental. In her maiden battle from heritage constituency Aranmula in 2016, she defeated senior Congress leader K Sivadasan Nair and she repeated the same feat in 2021. A classical dancer and orator, she won several honours during her student days. Married to Dr George Joseph, a higher secondary school teacher and an active worker of the Orthodox Syrian Church, the couple have two children.P A Mohammed Riyas: Tourism and PWD Minister Several eyebrows were raised when the chief minister’s son-in-law P A Mohammed Riyas (45) walked away with two plum portfolios, tourism and public works department. It is for the first time that a father and son-in-law have together secured berths in a ministry in Kerala.National president of the Democratic Youth Federation of India (DYFI), party youth wing, Riyaz was elected to the assembly from Beypore constituency in Kozhikode. He began his political career with the Students Federation of India (SFI) during his high school days. He later became an active member of DFYI and went on to become its national president.In 2009, he contested from Kozhikode Lok Sabha constituency but failed to make it. A good organiser, he married the chief minister’s daughter Veena Vijayan last year.K N Balagopal: Finance minister K N Balagopal (57), former member of Rajya Sabha, will be the new finance minister, succeeding Thomas Isaac. Rising from the ranks, he started his career with the Students Federation of India, the party youth wing. He served as political secretary to chief minister V S Achuthanandan in 2006 and in 2010, he was elected to the upper house. A post-graduate in law, Balagopal is known for his analytical mind and oratory skills.With the state economy in tatters amid the pandemic, it will be a tight-rope walk for the new finance minister hailing from Kollam.P Rajeev: Industry minister Another former Rajya Sabha member P Rajeev (54) also began his political career in his student days.

21-05-2021||India||Mylab launches home testing kits for Covid-19 priced at ₹250 per piece||The country’s first home-based coronavirus (Covid-19) testing kit, CoviSelf, was launched on Thursday, a day after the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) gave its approval for use.The product, created by Pune-based Mylab Discovery solutions, will cost ₹250 per kit and will be available in all chemist shops from next week.Mylab had developed the first indigenous reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test kit last year.Currently, the company is producing seven million tests per week, and is aiming to scale it up to about 10 million tests per week in the next 14 days, it said in a statement.ICMR, on the other hand, is working towards scaling up its daily Covid-19 testing capacity to 4.5 million per day by June-end, from the existing two million tests per day, its director general Dr Balram Bhargava announced on Thursday.“On May 18 and 19, we conducted more than two million tests in a day, which is the highest in the world. Around mid February and early March, we were conducting about 8-10 lakh tests a day and that was increased to 20 lakh tests a day, which is about two-and-a-half times increase, yet our positivity percentage has fallen from 23% to 13%. So, testing has to be increased; you have to get it down to 5% or below positivity rate. Therefore, from 20 lakh tests, our target is to do 25 lakh tests by the end of this month, and 45 lakh by end of June,” Dr Bhargava told a media briefing.India’s current weekly positivity rate — from May 13 to 19 — is 15%.“Things are slightly improving but we are in the midst of a pandemic, and we have to maintain a strict vigil. All those districts that have a positivity rate of 10% or more will have to have serious containment measures in place to break the transmission chain. Testing is one of the pillars that will help contain this massive upsurge of cases,” he saidIndia’s current per day testing capacity using RT-PCR is 1.2-1.3 million tests, and about 1.7 million rapid antigen tests, with all approved laboratories working 24x7 to meet the increased testing demand in the wake of the surge.“Even though all labs are trying their best to work round the clock despite infection among laboratory staff, it is advised to make aggressive use of rapid antigen tests wherever positivity is very high so that infected individuals are identified early and are rapidly isolated,” he said.During the second wave, the Centre rationalized the RT-PCR test to meet the high demand, and increased RAT testing for early detection, isolation and home care.ICMR has validated some 105 RAT kits, of which 41 are approved as on date. Out of all the approved testing kits, 31 have been manufactured in India.There are 2,553 laboratories approved by ICMR for Covid-19 testing in the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/indias-first-covid-home-test-kit-to-cost-250-101621535925246.html

An AK-47 rifle, three pistols and a cache of ammunition and explosives were recovered from the vehicle in which they were travelling. The NIA took over the case on January 17 and filed a filed a charge sheet against Singh, who is currently in jail.“Whereas, the Lieutenant Governor is satisfied after considering the facts and circumstances of the case and on the basis of information available that the activities of Mr Davinder Singh, deputy Superintendent of Police (under suspension)… are such as warrant his dismissal from service. Accordingly, the Lieutenant Governor hereby dismisses Mr Davinder Singh from service with immediate effect,” said the an official order issued by the UT’s General Administration Department on behalf of J&K Lt governor Manoj Sinha.After his arrest, the J&K administration stripped Singh of the Sher-e-Kashmir Police Medal for Gallantry. The NIA charge sheet accused Singh and others of waging “war against India” with the help of Pakistan-based terrorists and also alleged that the former police officer was providing shelter to terrorists.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jk-dsp-arrested-in-terror-case-dismissed-from-service-101621535444626.html
21-05-2021||India||Gujarat facility to make 200 million additional doses of Covaxin||Vaccine maker Bharat Biotech on Thursday announced that it was further ramping up production capacity to manufacture additional 200 million Covaxin doses per year, taking the total number of vaccine doses produced annually to close to 1 billion.These additional doses of the Covid-19 vaccine will be manufactured at Chiron Behring Vaccines, a wholly owned subsidiary of Bharat Biotech at Ankleshwar in Gujarat. “The company plans to produce 200 million doses of Covaxin per annum in the GMP facilities that are already operational to produce vaccines based on Inactivated Vero Cell Platform Technology, under stringent levels of GMP and biosafety,” a statement by the Hyderabad-based company read. It added that the additional doses will be available in the fourth quarter of this year.The company said it has already deployed multiple production lines for Covaxin at its Hyderabad and Bengaluru campuses. The addition of the Chiron Behring facility will effectively boost volumes up to 1 billion doses per annum, “with its own established campuses specialised for manufacturing inactivated viral vaccines under the highest levels of biosafety,” the company said in its statement.Covaxin is sold to state governments and private hospitals for ₹400 and ₹1,200, respectively.Earlier on April 20, the biotechnology major had announced that it was scaling up its manufacturing capacity to produce 700 million doses of the vaccine annually. At present, the company is producing about 120 million doses annually.Before that on April 16, the central government had also announced that it would help double the production capacity of India’s first ‘make in India’ Covid-19 vaccine by May-June, from the existing 10 million doses per month, and with a target of helping to produce nearly 100 million doses per month by September.Bharat Biotech has co-developed Covaxin along with Indian Council of Medical Research. It is one of the two vaccines being used in India’s Covid-19 immunisation programme, the other one being Covishield, which is the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine produced locally by Serum Institute of India.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/gujarat-facility-to-make-200-million-additional-doses-of-covaxin-101621535324655.html

She suggested the use of central Navodaya Vidyalayas across the country for the purpose.In a letter to Modi, Gandhi said the nation owes it to such children to give them “hope for a robust future”. Gandhi’s letter comes days after Congress leader G S Bali from Himachal Pradesh announced the party will adopt all children orphaned by the pandemic in the state’s Kangra district.In her letter, Gandhi recalled how the creation of Navodaya Vidyalayas across the country was her husband and late former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi’s most significant legacy.

21-05-2021||India||Rare infection is now an epidemic: Experts||It’s official: mucormycosis or black fungus is now an epidemic, within the larger pandemic. It’s usually a rare disease , caused by fungi -- in this case, molds called mucormycetes -- but has now affected thousands of Covid-19 patients across India. As of Thursday, according to the Union government’s submission to the Delhi HC, the number of people affected at present is 7,251.Worse, according to the US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention, “a review of published mucormycosis cases” put the fatality rate at 54%, with that for those with pulmonary infections (Covid-19 is one) coming in higher at 76%. Worse, the drug used for treating it , Amphotericin b is nephrotoxic , and could lead to kidney damage.Till Thursday, Maharashtra, one of the states worst affected by mucormycosis has reported 90 deaths , Gujarat, 61, and Madhya Pradesh, 31.The condition may be reaching epidemic proportions currently because of Covid-19 but mucormycosis was not unheard of in India earlier. Due to the lack of population-level data, its exact burden is unknown but it a rare condition, according to research papers on the disease and critical care experts.Also Read| India faces black fungus epidemic as cases climb“I cannot talk about disease incidence as such, but in our clinical life, we may have seen a maximum of five to seven such patients in the intensive care units. It was rare,” said Dr Anjan Trikha, professor, department of anaesthesia, critical care and pain medicine, All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), Delhi.The incidence of mucormycosis has over the years increased in India, according to a research paper titled “Epidemiology of mucormycosis in India” published in March in the medical journal Microorganisms.The paper was authored by Hariprasath Prakash, department of public health, International Higher School of Medicine, Kyrgyzstan, and Arunaloke Chakrabarti, head of the department of medical microbiology, Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research, Chandigarh.“... [there has been] an increasing trend of mucormycosis from a single centre at successive periods, with an annual incidence of 12.9 cases per year during 1990–1999, 35.6 cases per year during 2000–2004, and 50 cases per year during 2006–2007. The overall numbers increased from 25 cases per year (1990–2007) to 89 cases per year (2013–2015),” says the paper. “…A multicentre study across India reported 465 cases from 12 centres over 21 months; the study reported an annual incidence of 22 cases per year and an average of 38.8 cases for each participating centre…”The paper said without population-based estimates, it is difficult to determine the exact incidence and prevalence of mucormycosis in the Indian population. “The computational-model-based method estimated a prevalence of 14 cases per 100,000 individuals in India.”The incidence seems to have grown amid the Covid-19 pandemic.“The black fungus infections went up 2.5 times last year between September and December across 16 centres in the country,” Chakrabarti told HT on May 12. He is a part of the Fungal Infection Study Forum and is one of the members, who drafted the government advisory on mucormycosis management.Also Read| After black fungus, reports of white fungus infections surface. What we know so far“We did a study across 16 centres between September and December last year which showed that the infection had increased 2.5 times then. It is likely to go up further this time; we are planning to conduct another study.”In its advisory this week, the Union ministry said mucormycosis mainly affects people on medication for other health problems that reduce their ability to fight environmental pathogens. Clinicians also say several factors found in Covid-19 patients could lead to the secondary infection.“Mucormycosis needs fertile soil to grow, and high blood glucose levels, lack of oxygen, acidosis and suppressed immunity contribute towards the growth. There is a high probability of all these factors in Covid-19 patients which is, perhaps, leading to an increase in [black fungus] cases,” said Dr Ambrish Mithal, chairman, department of endocrinology and diabetes, Max Healthcare. The use of poor quality water in humdification for patients on low-flow oxygen -- many being treated for Covid-19 are on this -- is believed to be one reason for the spurt in cases, as is the use on unclean oxygen cylinders. The fungi are found in soil, and dung, although small spores of it are also in the air. The spores are harmles to most people, but could affect those with weak immune systems -- and some experts believe the overuse of steroids on early-stage Covid-19 patients may also be contributing to this.Reaching hospitals late in most cases could be leading to deaths. “There are not too many drugs available to treat the condition, and in India, one of the major problems is patients reporting late to the hospital which tends to alter the treatment outcome. But the reason for fungus becoming pathological and growing in various parts of the body is compromised immunity [people on high dose steroids for a prolonged period] and uncontrolled diabetes,” said Trikha.Also Read | Covid self-testing kit to be available in market by next week, says manufacturer||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mucormycosis-a-rare-infection-being-found-commonly-in-covid-patients-101621502803142.html

21-05-2021||India||Centre began looking for virus variants only after rapid surge: Dr T Jacob John||Dr T Jacob John, who was former director at ICMR’s Centre of Advanced Research in Virology, in an interview with says that the government surveillance did not catch wind as the virus was mutating and new variants were emerging until rapid rise of the pandemic curve. He says it is unethical that despite being the ‘pharmacy of the world’ we don’t have enough vaccines to save lives and our policy isn’t informed by adequate scientific evidence. He projects that the second wave would reach its end stage by the end of June.Edited excerpts:What factors do you think led to the magnitude of the second wave?Broadly two: One, letting our guard down too soon; trivialising masks and physical distancing for the sake of allowing Kumbh Mela from April 1 to April 22. Pilgrims from all states carried variant viruses and seeded epidemics; therefore, election or no election, all states had fire. Elections and rallies added to this. Two, we let our guard down on “spying on the enemy (SARS-CoV-2)” -- variants were getting together for an onslaught but our intelligence failed to get a wind. It was mutating and new variants were emerging, but the Indian government apparently did not know anything about “enemy tactics” until after the second wave was spreading fast due to the variants. Only after the rapid rise of the epidemic curve the assigned virologists began looking for variants and they were all over. These variants (about 5 different ones) have far higher transmission efficiency than the “founder’’ variant of Wu.Hu.1 and the variant that caused India’s first wave, D614G. Another factor -- the sin of omission or of lack of planning due to lack of vision or of understanding the value of vaccines. Very tardy vaccinations.As compared to the first wave, we have more people dying unable to either find oxygen or ventilator support. Doctors are saying that more people are coming in a critical condition. Is it the nature of the variant that is more severe?The first wave started early March 2020 and peaked by September 16, 2020 (total reported cases just over 5 million) and fell to endemicity by Dec 28, 2020 (second half also with just over 5 million), totalling more than 10 million in 10 months. The second wave started about March 9 and peaked on May 6, with 10 million cases in 8 weeks, a little over a million a week. The sheer speed and huge volume overwhelmed the healthcare infrastructure, crematoria, and so on. This speed and volume resulted in more sick people and more deaths, but the rates were not much changed. So disease severity was not the problem -- many died without even oxygen -- what a country! For normal healthcare we need 300 hospital beds per 100,000 population. But we have only 50 beds per 100,000 population. Therefore even during normal times we were stretching our bed capacity, so no surprise at failure to cope with the surge. No evidence of more “virus virulence”.You have for long been demanding data collection and for policy and responses to be driven by data. We still do not have reliable data with under-reporting of cases as well as deaths. How different would our response have been to Covid-19 if we had verified data on, for instance, TB?That is because I am an Indian who believes in science. Others do not want data or at least reliable data. Our governments are happy to make policies on the advice of people who may know very little about their field of responsibility. I have watched health secretaries who advise the government without basic understanding or commitment to “health and science of health and disease.”Look at prediction of vaccine demand in 2020 third quarter, in 2021 first quarter and making sure we get the projected volumes. No projection was made because no one knew on what basis to make projections. Respect for numbers will change the attitudes of administrators.We guess our TB burden to be 200 cases/100,000 people while Western countries brought it down (they also had at one time the same burden) through public health interventions to 5/100,000. We don’t even have a method of counting every case of TB to get reliable numbers. Reliable numbers are needed only if you want to control TB. Since we do not have even a policy to control TB, valid numbers are not needed. We have a slogan for TB elimination by 2025, but we do not have a policy to control TB. We are good at saying A and mean B because they are so close to each other.Do you think our policy interventions, particularly early this year as well as last year, were adequately based on scientific evidence?Brief answer: No. But then policy interventions of a pandemic require “projection” without “evidence” but “extrapolation”. That skill is fundamental to public health. Since we have no public health, we have no experts in 3 areas of public health -- (1) Epidemiology of Communicable Disease; (2) Economics of Health -- of disease prevention versus non-prevention, loss due to uncontrolled communicable diseases including TB; we are losing money by not spending enough; (3) Ethics of health interventions. For example is it not unethical for the “Pharmacy of the World” not having enough vaccines to save citizens’ lives? There are ethical issues in not doing something you ought to have done -- not merely in things you do.What is your view on the genome sequencing done in India so far. Tamil Nadu is one of the lowest for sending samples.Are only the media interested in gene sequencing? India probably saved some few crores of rupees avoiding 5% positive samples used for full genome sequencing. Does anyone realise that those few crores would have saved countless lives in April-May? In general our culture does not value the “cause-and-effect” tenet of science and so hardly any one will attribute our discomfiture to past errors.Where do we stand in terms of herd immunity? Is that still a goal?Do those who talk about herd immunity understand it at all? Who is in charge of monitoring it? Who has predicted what herd immunity level must be achieved with vaccines? Herd immunity as a goal applies exclusively for vaccination. If experts had understood that they would have calculated the vaccine requirement last April-May (2020).Vaccines are the only tool we have to control the spread but we have a shortage. At current rates, India is projected to take till at least the end of 2022 to be able to vaccinate a proportion of population that will help to reduce the severity of waves. What other steps must India take till availability and delivery improves?India is the pioneer leader of “social vaccine” -- that is what should have been used as soon as the second wave was detected but then, that demanded seriousness of purpose to curtail the spread. Did you ever see any “desire” to reduce the onslaught of the second wave except for blaming each other?What is your concern about vaccine effectiveness against the different variants?As of now, not much worry. Let us get the maximum out of vaccines first. My hunch is that “hyper-immunisation” with inactivated virus vaccine (Covaxin) by a third dose will heighten immunity that will also broaden the cover. This needs testing.What is the course of the pandemic in India now?India has 718 districts and there is 718 variations on epidemic profiles. Or 30 states with 30 epidemics. National total data is an artifact of statistics but that gives us the pulse. Nationally, the second wave peaked on May 6 (414,433 cases) and is fast declining. May 7th --401,326; 8th -- 409,300; and 9th to 16th every day less than 370,000. Lockdown on downslope is useless and harmful.When would it reach the stage of an endemic?If the second wave took 8 weeks to reach peak it will fall to an endemic state in a bit less than 8 weeks -- probably 6-7 weeks. Seven weeks from May 6 to June 24. By end June, I expect numbers to stabilise at 20,000 per day. That should last longer than 10 weeks and further waves can be prevented by vaccination.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-began-looking-for-virus-variants-only-after-rapid-surge-101621453655966.html
21-05-2021||Today's||India’s worst offshore disaster was avoidable||Cyclone Tauktae has taken a heavy toll on lives and property along India’s west coast, and while every life lost is to be grieved, the sinking of accommodation barge P-305 on May 17 about 35 miles off Mumbai in the Arabian Sea was a deeply unfortunate, and avoidable, tragedy.A total of 261 workers, who were on an assignment with Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC), were reported to have been on board the barge (also referred to as Papa-305), and 49 victims are feared killed. While 186 of those on the ill-fated barge have been rescued by the Navy in very adverse weather conditions (torrential rain, 25 foot waves and 40 mph gales), many workers are yet to be accounted for and a massive rescue operation is underway. Other barges and a tugboat have also been damaged, and the numbers of those drowned/lost could increase.The loss of precious lives could have been avoided if all the involved agencies had followed standard safety regulations and protocols, both before and during the build-up of the cyclone. When the final death toll is confirmed, P-305 will rank as the worst offshore disaster for India.Also Read | Cyclone Tauktae: Barge toll now 49, hope fades for 37 still missingOne hopes that the appropriate policy lapses will be objectively reviewed by the political apex and institutional accountability sought. To put it bluntly — heads must roll, and the lives of contract workers who have little or no voice as a collective must not be taken for granted.The ministry of petroleum and natural gas has announced that a high-level inquiry would be constituted to identify the “lapses and gaps” in the system. While this is welcome, past experience has demonstrated that when it comes to matters of safety at sea and the efficient regulation of the maritime domain, the existing institutional status quo — inadequate, inefficient and low on integrity — is the preferred default mode. This is despite Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s personal advocacy of security and growth for all in the region (Sagar), in relation to the Indian Ocean, which he had outlined in 2015.Accommodation work barges (AWB) are the equivalent of rudimentary dormitories at sea for contract workers and their living conditions are spartan. Given the high operational costs in maintaining a work force on an oil rig or platform at sea, cost-cutting and penny-pinching is endemic to the off-shore hydrocarbon sector and Bombay High is no exception. In the pecking order, the contract worker is at the lower end of the ladder and it appears that very few safety norms and regulations have been put in place. ONGC and its major contractors are more than aware of the grim, ground reality.Barges are large, flat-bottom floating structures with cramped built-up accommodation, and when they have no self-propulsion, they are deemed to be “dumb”. P-305 belonged to this category, and, with 261 people on board, it would have been very vulnerable to the cyclone.Safety of human lives at sea is a complex responsibility, one that is difficult to regulate and enforce given the nature of the maritime domain and the vast number of seafarers. From the traditional fisherman to the more skilled seaman on a merchant vessel or oil-rig worker — the number of individuals who are out at sea is vast.In the Indian context, there is no single nodal national maritime authority and many verticals exist by way of ministries or departments with watertight silos that are zealously guarded. Turf sensitivities and personality clashes are intense. In the current tragedy, the ministries of petroleum, shipping and defence are involved, and both the ONGC and the Director General (DG), Shipping have direct operational responsibilities. Concurrently, the DG, Coast Guard, who is also the Chairman of the National Search and Rescue Board (NSRB), has a direct locus in such cases.Also Read | Firm that ran cyclone-hit barges says people on board had life jackets, raftsAn objective review of the Tauktae debris should identify the institutional lapses, from the most glaring (unserviceable life rafts on P-305 is criminal negligence) to the most obvious — why was a dumb barge, with 261 people on board, allowed to remain at sea even though the cyclone warning was received a week prior to its sinking? Between DG Shipping, ONGC and the Coast Guard, did the obvious danger to the human lives on the barges not lead to the flashing of amber lights?India has an anomalous maritime sector management pattern, wherein domain competence is ignored and generalist civil servants are preferred for the top job. Consequently, DG Shipping is a position often tenanted by a civil servant with little or no maritime experience or knowledge. Learning on the job is the norm and regrettably, the global standard of safety (of human lives and ships) is often compromised.If PM Modi’s vision of Sagar is to be meaningfully realised, the safety of every seafarer must be valued and the contract workers on P-305 should not be forgotten as the current focus on cyclone Tauktae dissipates. Institutional distortions and procedural dissonances must be set right and placing the entire onus on a “dumb” scapegoat avoided. An independent panel of domain experts must investigate this avoidable tragedy.C Uday Bhaskar is the director of Society for Policy Studies The views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/indias-worst-offshore-disaster-was-avoidable-101621592629141.html
21-05-2021||Today's||The adoption process is distinct. Frame leave policies accordingly||Karnataka recently notified an order, allowing mothers who have adopted a child to take 180 days of maternity leave, while granting 15 days of paternity leave for fathers. However, the leave is only applicable while adopting children below one year of age. Earlier, the Centre, too, pushed the Maternity Benefit (Amendment) Bill, 2016, which provided for maternity leave of 12 weeks to mothers adopting a child below three months of age.The sporadic, isolated and ill-advised legislations around adoption confirm once again that our lawmakers neither understand adoption nor the needs of families in adoption. Here is why.Adoptions in India are governed by two laws — the Hindu Adoption and Maintenance Act, 1956 (HAMA), and the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act 2015 (JJ Act). As per the JJ Act, no child can be given for adoption for two months after being placed in an institution as this period is provided under the law to search for the family of the child; add to this, the referral cycle, foster care formalities and the time to get an adoption order from the court. So even if a newborn child were admitted into a child care institution, it is virtually impossible for any parent to avail of adoption leave for a child below three months of age and very few parents would meet the criterion even for a one-year-old child. Several parents who adopt under HAMA do so to escape scrutiny and regulations. When they don’t even report adoptions at their workplace, how can they avail such benefits?Further, it is fundamentally erroneous to tag the leave to the age of the child being adopted. An older child will need more bonding effort and time. Incidentally, 90% of children legally available for adoption in Central Adoption Resource Authority (CARA) pool are above two years of age and such provisions virtually turn a blind eye to their needs in adoption.Also Read | On Covid, why the Centre needs a communication strategyJuxtaposing adoption leave with maternity itself is an aberration. Adoption and maternity are entirely different life events.Most births today take place in a hospital and each stage is closely monitored. A father’s involvement is limited to providing emotional care, over and above the plethora of resources available for supporting pregnancy and childbirth. Many of these resources are easily available such as doctors, books and guidance from experienced family members.In contrast, the adoption journey starts for a majority of parents at the end of a journey marked with failed pregnancies, miscarriages or painful IVF cycles. The first time when an aspiring parent needs time off in adoption is when deciding to adopt. Once registered for adoption, parents need to visit the adoption agency a couple of times between receiving the referral of a child and the final court order. This period is often filled with nervousness, anxiety and even heartbreak if the process fails. They are not parenting at this time. Hence, it is unfair to expect them to take a casual leave or earned leave to attend to adoption matters. It is also not a usual court hearing either. A biological parent does not plead their case before they can take home their babies from hospital. They do not travel along with their infant child across cities, to make it happen. Parents need guidance. A part of adoption leave is required at this stage.Then, parents need time to bond with the child. However, the entire leave may not be required at the time of adoption. Most families have reported extremely challenging times when adopted children are in their teens. Adopted children need help with their cognitive skills, root search, resolving their identities. All this is over and above the usual adolescence challenges. Parents need time with their children and counsellors to empower them at this stage.Also Read | How high courts intervened in Covid management in IndiaDoling out two weeks of paternity leave in adoption is cruel. Fathers not only birth the child in their heart, like mothers, but also need to hold the front within their family. Several fathers quietly resent or face their own parents and relatives while engaging them in their decision to adopt. It is not easy. It is not supported. It is not expected.Compared to pregnancy, curating resources in adoption is hard. It takes time and effort to locate adoption counsellors, books, legal aide and seek assistance if the process goes wary. Fathers share equal responsibility, and sometimes more, in gathering paperwork, internet search, adoption counselling, court proceedings and bonding with the child. If at all there is an argument that calls for a standalone adoption leave for any parent, it is this. Father need it as much as mothers.Adoption leave is therefore not maternity leave that is required to be extended to adoption. Instead, it is a leave required by any parent, single or married, male or female, adopting a child of any age, to (in many cases) resolve the trauma of infertility, understand adoption, seek counselling, follow safe legal process, bond with the child, engage the family members to ensure that none of the family members falls through the cracks.Let’s stop patronising adoption leave. Rather, let us be gracious in offering an adoption leave of around a minimum six months of leave credit, irrespective of the age of the child, to be availed whenever the parent needs to attend to the beautiful experience called adoption.Avinash Kumar is a parent in adoption, former CARA Steering Committee member, founder of Families of Joy FoundationPayal S Kapoor is a parent in adoption, associate professor, FORE School of Management, New DelhiThe views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/the-adoption-process-is-distinct-frame-leave-policies-accordingly-101621592028985.html
21-05-2021||Today's||Rajiv Gandhi’s simplicity was his strength — and his failing||Rajiv Gandhi was born three years before India attained Independence. If alive, he would have been 77 today and arguably, much better equipped with the age and experience that he lacked when providence foisted on him the highest political executive office of the land, where he was an uneasy occupant.As the country’s sixth Prime Minister at the age of 40, he was a product and a prisoner of destiny. His gruesome assassination on May 21, 1991 — exactly 30 years ago — cut short the story of his life.On display at a memorial to his mother Indira Gandhi in Delhi, the bloodstained tatters of the clothes Rajiv Gandhi had worn could wrench the hearts of those who saw him in flesh and blood — tall, fair and handsome, with a dimpled smile that set hearts aflutter. He exuded warmth sans the guile akin to politics.The simplicity that set him apart proved fatal. The hit squad that took him out was sent by a guerrilla leader, Vellupillai Prabhakaran, who Gandhi had gifted his own bullet proof vest at a secret meeting to broker a path to peace in Sri Lanka.A story of a tragedy, elevation, and riots The communal violence that engulfed Delhi after her security guards gunned Indira Gandhi down on October 31, 1984, was a scary spectacle of the State dissipating. Rajiv Gandhi arrived with Amitabh Bachchan at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences where his mother lay with loads of iron in her lifeless belly. Union minister Buta Singh collapsed. Outside, the cavalcade of President Giani Zail Singh, who swore Gandhi as PM the same day, was stoned by mobs on the rampage.The chaos and the carnage that ruled Delhi during that week in 1984 is part of well-documented history. As home minister, Narasimha Rao was supposed to be in control but wasn’t. Policemen either went missing or turned a blind eye, barring honourable exceptions, to violent mobs attacking Sikhs. In fact, Inder Kumar Gujral, who served as PM after the 1996 polls, found Rao impassive rather than proactive to his counsel that the army be deployed to stop the carnage. The complicity or the incompetence of the government in those initial days of Rajiv Gandhi’s premiership would remains a dark chapter in the party’s history.Also Read | Cyber attacks on critical infrastructure: Is India ready?Mani Shankar Aiyar, the diplomat-turned-politician who worked closely with Rajiv Gandhi in his prime minister’s office (PMO) and then as a party colleague, is currently working on his autobiography, nearly 200 pages of which are on the former PM. He has a different perspective on Gandhi and the riots. The Opposition and the media, Aiyar insisted, tore out of context Gandhi’s much-criticised statement at a public rally held 19 days after his mother’s assassination: “When a big tree falls, the earth shakes”. “I say that because he made the remark after lengthy exhortations of peace, very much in the manner he pleaded for an end to violence in the preceding days,” argues Aiyar.True or not, the Opposition’s reading of the remark, and the violence in the national capital, haunted Gandhi through his tenure in office and the party until much later.The Shah Bano controversy Arif Mohammad Khan was in Rajiv Gandhi’s council of minister till they parted ways on the Shah Bano issue. The case concerning the Muslim women’s right to alimony was upheld by the Supreme Court and came to involve the broader question of Muslim personal law.Now the Governor of Kerala, Arif Khan backed the verdict in a speech rated among the finest in Parliament. He felt let down when Gandhi gave in to the Muslim clergy—his government negating the judgement with the passage of the Muslim Women (Protection on Divorce Act), 1986. The decision gave a lease of life to Hindutva forces, which accused the government of “appeasement”. It led to a downward spiral of identity politics when Rajiv Gandhi got the Ram temple locks opened to win over the Hindu vote. The move instead helped the religious right rather than widening the secular middle of the Congress’s choice. The triple talaq legislation brought by the Narendra Modi government is a sequel, in fact, to the Shah Bano case.Also Read | A broken polity, a ghost StateLooking back, Khan attributed Gandhi’s volte-face to the advice he received from senior cabinet colleagues, especially PV Narasimha Rao, ND Tiwari, Arjun Singh and SB Chavan. Rao, who became Congress president and Prime Minister after Gandhi’s murder, met Khan to dissuade him from pressing the issue. He asked him not to be a samaj sudharak (social reformer) against political expediency.“Rajiv had his heart in the right place. Left to himself, he wouldn’t have had the SC verdict reversed...he wasn’t interested in politics and had a thin understanding of it,” said Khan. His recollections of Gandhi were of a man courteous to the core. After he resigned on the Shah Bano issue, Gandhi sent him funds for a car as he had had to return the official vehicle he used as a minister. Khan didn’t accept the money but the gesture touched him deeply.The party and government On the organisational side and in the government, Gandhi was receptive to contrarian views, often letting others have their way. What proved to be problematic was his reliance on a set of advisors who themselves needed advice but tended to blindside experienced party seniors.As a junior industry minister, Khan got him to scrap, with planning commission vice chairperson Manmohan Singh’s oblique support, a proposal to let foreign brands into India. On an earlier occasion, he bypassed Rajiv Gandhi, then a party general secretary, to directly approach his mother, Indira Gandhi, who was the party chief and prime minister. Khan wanted a non-Muslim as the president of the district congress committee of Kanpur, the constituency he represented in parliament. Besides Khan, a minister at the Centre, Kanpur had a Muslim minister in the state government. Indira Gandhi recognised the incongruity of people from the same community occupying all three key positions. Instead of taking umbrage, Rajiv Gandhi laughed it off on learning that Khan went over his head to get the job done.Also Read | How high courts intervened in Covid management in IndiaBut his willingness to trust people at times saw him pay huge political costs. Even in renegade mode, VP Singh often said that rather than leave the party, he’d sit under a tree holding the Congress flag. The former finance and defence minister walked out after being painted a fifth columnist, a latter day Jai Chand, by apparatchiks perceived to have the PM’s attention. The hiatus widened and led to a break up amid words of caution by the likes of veterans such as Kamalapati Tripathi, who himself took to writing open letters to the PM on matters concerning government policy and the party.When out of power, Gandhi admitted to being misled into distrusting certain senior colleagues, specially Pranab Mukherjee, who left the party when excluded from the ministry formed after the 1984 polls. In his 2016 biography, Mukherjee wrote: “He made mistakes and so did I. He let others influence him and listened to their calumnies against me. I let my frustration overtake my patience...”If the West Bengal veteran blamed Gandhi’s distant cousin Arun Nehru for his predicament, at an election rally in Rae Bareli, Priyanka Gandhi Vadra openly accused her uncle of backstabbing her father.The rift with the President A close aide of Zail Singh when he was president, former Rajya Sabha member Tarlochan Singh has mixed recollections of Gandhi. He remembered him fondly as the ‘de facto” chairman of the 1982 Asian Games organising committee headed by sports minister Buta Singh. “To Rajiv Gandhi goes the credit for the praise India received for the successful conduct of games,” he said.Singh was director of information and publicity for the Asian games. He saw from the Rashtrapati Bhawan later the active role Gandhi played, in tandem with foreign service officers Natwar Singh (later the external affairs minister) and Hamid Ansari (who rose to be vice president), in India hosting the Non-Aligned Summit.Also Read | On Covid, why the Centre needs a communication strategyThe good part ended and politics began when Gandhi — whom Zail Singh administered oath before his election as the leader of the Congress parliamentary party in place of Indira Gandhi — dissolved the house for fresh elections without a formal call to inform the President. “He merely sent across the cabinet resolution for the dissolution,” recalled Tarlochan Singh. He too saw Arun Nehru’s hand in the deterioration of ties between the two.The trust levels between the President and the PM touched the nadir during the Bofors scandal. Amid the rising Opposition chorus for accountability, there was a near-total breakdown of communication between the head of state and the head of government. Matters got uglier by the day with the government stalling Zail Singh’s foreign tours; the cabinet deciding against sending him the gun-purchase file he summoned.The President countered the affronts by raising uncomfortable questions on a range of subjects. He withheld consent to the postal bill that gave the government powers to censor personal mail. The widened gulf stoked speculation of the presidency contemplating withdrawal of its pleasure to the government’s continuation — a denouement that remained in the realm of conjecture.The decline in the working ties of the top constitutional functionaries was hard to decipher. Zail Singh was a staunch Indira Gandhi loyalist who, on being made President, had famously offered to wield a broom to sweep the floor if she so desired. On being sworn in as PM, Gandhi’s attention was divided between arrangements for his mother’s funeral and restoring calm in the city. That apparently did not go down well with the Sikh President, who a section in the government held responsible for the Punjab crisis in his earlier role as Home Minister.The flip side of it was provided by Mani Shankar Aiyar who believes that their relations nosedived when Gandhi found the President encouraging elements opposed to the 1985 Punjab accord he signed with Akali leaders HS Longowal, SS Barnala and Balwant Singh. The pact was among the three major ententes Gandhi oversaw for domestic peace. The other two related to Assam and Mizoram. Gandhi’s response to Zail Singh was human, maybe not politically adroit if the measure of it is to overlook ethics, reasoned Aiyar.Forward looking policiesOnce mocked by the Opposition as a young man at a hi-tech store with no money in his pocket, Gandhi was committed to moving technology from the laboratories to the field to make it beneficial for the people in the hinterlands. In that pursuit he laid three decades ago the kernel of computerisation and the telecom revolution, notably rural telephony, that’s booming now with the spread of mobile phones and internet.Thinking ahead of his times, he lobbied with the United States for a super computer for rainfall predictions in different agro-climatic zones towards “drought proofing” and securing potable water for the village folks.On the foreign policy front, he left a noteworthy legacy on nuclear disarmament and repairing ties with neighbours. His 1988 ice-breaking visit to China was the first in 34 years by any Indian Premier. It breached the great wall of hostility, laying the foundations on which his successors built for peace and tranquillity on the line of actual control. The recent setback in India-China relations is a different story being told in a different era.His engagement with Benazir Bhutto did not quieten Kashmir but helped pull Punjab — over which Pakistan had no historical territorial claim — out of the separatist quagmire. The incremental success in the border state was on account of the Punjab accord followed by assembly elections, together with robust diplomacy and strong internal security measures.In Sri Lanka, Gandhi was betrayed by Prabhakaran, the Liberation Tiger of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) chief whom he secretly met before committing the Indian Peace Keeping Force to the Island nation to effect peace between the Tigers and the Sri Lanka troops. The IPKF’s eventual goal was to disarm the LTTE.That was in 1987. He was slain in 1991 by the very guerrilla outfit he had ventured to help. Another betrayal, another instance it was of trusting without verifying.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/rajiv-gandhi-s-simplicity-was-his-strength-and-his-failing-101621590708891.html
