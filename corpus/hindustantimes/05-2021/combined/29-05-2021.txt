29-05-2021||News||After poll rout, Haasan faces an uncertain political future||In Tamil cinema, Kamal Haasan is considered an intellectual. Haasan, a writer, singer, choreographer, consistently broke new ground with his acting, stories and technology. He could play a hero, a drunk, a woman, a dwarf and even a former United States president. So, it was only expected that when Haasan made a political foray, he would base it on offering something new. In his words, “a change” and “an alternative”.Haasan launched Makkal Needhi Maiam (MNM) in 2018. The party contested in the 2019 Lok Sabha polls with a 3.7% vote share that it garnered predominantly from urban areas, but in the 2021 assembly elections, the fledgling party’s performance diminished, with just 2.5%. In the results declared on May 2, all the party’s candidates — 135 from MNM and the others contested by allies — lost in the 234-seat assembly. Haasan, the chief ministerial candidate, who tested his hustlings in Coimbatore South constituency, lost to BJP’s Vanathi Srinivasan in a contest that went down to the wire.But he is facing a bigger battle after the electoral debacle, with prominent faces and the party’s senior leaders who were associated with him since the party’s formation quitting the party.It started with the resignation of party vice-president R Mahendran who was also the party’s best performing candidate in Coimbatore South in 2019. In a 12-page letter to Haasan, he blamed him for listening to an election consultant company, Sankhya Solutions, instead of party functionaries. “I am sad to say that there is a decline in your tenacity of purpose, which lies buried under a style of operation that reeks of a non-democratic manner of running a political party. I will leave you to decipher who your true loyalists are,” Mahendran’s letter read.Following Mahendran, there was an exodus with general secretary and former IAS officer Santhosh Babu, CK Kumaravel, M Muruganandam, and environment wing secretary Padma Priya quitting. Those who were vocal after their exit criticised Haasan as being an autocratic leader and relying on wrong advice.Haasan shot back in a four-minute video message released on May 24. He said those who quit failed to take responsibility for the party’s defeat. “I will be in politics till the time I am alive. Makkal Needhi Maiam will continue as a party as long as politics exist,” he said.Two party leaders, who did not wish to be named, said that Haasan blamed everyone else except himself for the party’s defeat. “After Mahendran’s resignation, everyone’s morale was down. We had a review meeting the next day and he told everyone, ‘It’s your fault’,” said a party member who had attended the meeting. Those holding senior positions, including late President Abdul Kalam’s former secretary V Ponraj, stepped down from their posts to rejig the party.Those who left also criticised Haasan for not choosing a Chennai constituency and going for Coimbatore South instead. Mahendran had come third in Coimbatore in the 2019 parliamentary elections. He registered a 16% vote share in the Coimbatore South segment. “Kamal basically stole his lieutenant’s seat,” said a political commentator who didn’t wish to be identified.In February, the MNM passed 25 resolutions, which included coronating Haasan as their “Permanent Leader”. This was akin to a personality driven culture in Tamil Nadu politics that Haasan was promising to change — yet it did not spark the dissent that is not being witnessed after the poll defeat. After J Jayalalithaa’s death in December 2016 and the ouster for her post VK Sasikala, the All India Anna Dravida Kazhagam (AIADMK) declared that Jayalalithaa would be the permanent general secretary of the party. It is the top most position in the AIADMK previously held by its founder M G Ramachandran (MGR). Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) patriarch M Karunanidhi too was party president even though he was ailing and until his death in August 2018. Haasan was following in their footsteps, with the party and the leader being synonymous.Haasan articulated his admiration for several political role models. Like several leaders in Tamil Nadu politics, he claimed MGR’s legacy, espoused Gandhian values and aspired to be an alternative like Delhi chief minister and Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) chief Arvind Kejrival. “But the party is becoming more like Congress where the high command refuses to accept its mistakes and blames the cadre,” said the MNM member quoted above.In Tamil Nadu’s politics dominated by the two Dravidian parties, there have always been smaller parties who either wanted to emerge as an alternative force or form a third front. Voters who are dissatisfied with the DMK and AIADMK form the pool that shift to these other parties. Some of these parties are caste-based and in 2021 they allied with the two majors formations. Tamil nationalist S Seeman’s Naam Tamizhar Katchi (NTK) is presently the third largest party in the state with 6.7% vote share.Haasan’s MNM fought the election on an anti-corruption poll plank promising clean governance. The party was filled with former bureaucrats and social activists, with no seasoned politicians, demonstrating that MNM wanted to grow outside a traditional political system.For instance, Santosh Babu, voluntarily retired from service in August 2020 after helming the Tamil Nadu Fibrenet Corporation (TANFINET) between 2018-19 in his capacity as principal secretary, Information Technology department. On the day he had joined, he spoke of the pressures he faced during his stint as the top IT official to sign on a tender. Babu had said that he had received an offer from the Prime Minister’s office to become the CEO of the MyGov platform but he had to turn it down to focus on his work in the state. He didn’t wish to speak on why he quit but said that he would continue to be in politics. “I believe Tamil Nadu’s potential is sky high and there is only so much I can do as a bureaucrat. As a politician, as an honest politician, we can change the state into a world-class economy,” said Babu.Haasan’s support base also came from his fan base and his utopian speeches on the need to clean a corrupt system by placing politicians with integrity captured the imagination of urban youngsters.“But eventually, there was no transparency even here,” said a second party member. In the days leading up to the polls, MNM inducted Pazha Karuppiah who had previously been with both Dravidian parties. MNM also teamed up with actor Sarath Kumar’s Samathuva Makkal Katchi (SMK) and Indhiya Jananayaga Katchi (IJK) who had walked out from the AIADMK and DMK alliance respectively and curiously gave them 37 and 40 seats to contest within the alliance.Haasan’s ideology has also been somewhat vague. While he was opposed to Dravidian parties, he drew on ideals of Periyar E V Ramasamy, considered the father of the Dravidian movement. His critics call him a ‘B-team’ of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), pointing to his Brahmin caste — which is a baggage in Dravidian politics, although Jayalalithaa, also a Brahmin, was able to steer clear from it despite her open practice of Hinduism.Critics also questioned Haasan’s support for Anna University vice-chancellor M K Surappa, a BJP appointee, who the previous AIADMK regime had put under investigation. Haasan, however, has critiqued the BJP and Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s policies. He envisions a caste-free society but his stance towards that end has been criticised as ill-informed.“Kamal Haasan has promised to be different, but he is not clear on how he will be different,” says political commentator Maalan Narayanan. “Structurally there is a problem. He is the only leader and there is no second line leadership. They relied entirely on his campaign and thought people would get carried away but that didn’t yield results.”To rely on Haasan’s star power is expected in a state where former chief ministers are matinee idols such as MGR, Jayalalithaa and scriptwriter Karunanidhi. Haasan is also the host of Big Boss in Tamil in his attempt to directly connect with the audience and subsequently his electorate. But the paths taken by his predecessors are vastly different which his contemporary Rajinikanth also couldn’t match up despite having a cult following across the world. Rajinikanth quit politics two weeks after announcing his entry in December 2020.MGR, Karunanidhi and subsequently Jayalalithaa were entrenched in Dravidian politics and used films to propagate the political ideology and didn’t have a smooth rise to the top until they consolidated their positions. MGR’s contemporary Sivaji Ganesan was a poor show in politics. Haasan is often compared to Ganesan in his acting prowess as well as his political fortunes.Experts, however, don’t write off MNM but say it requires more patience and an overhaul in its style of functioning. “Though Kamal Haasan says Kejriwal is his idol, he didn’t follow his ground-level work. Kejriwal contested against Sheila Dixit but Haasan didn’t pick a strong opponent,” says Narayanan. “He has to start at the grassroots, from the bottom and not from the top. He has to talk to the common man to understand his problems and not address what he perceives to be a problem. If corruption was the biggest problem for people of Tamil Nadu both DMK and AIADMK wouldn’t exist.”MNM’s general secretary AG Maurya and Sankya Solutions’ Suresh Iyer did not respond to HT’s calls and messages. On May 7, the company released a statement denying the allegations. “The news against us is complete fabrication of lies by Dr Mahendran with ulterior motives against the party and the president. We have been used as a scape goat and collateral damage, since we are bound by confidentiality, we choose not to issue a point-by-point rebuttal.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/after-the-poll-rout-kamal-haasan-faces-rebellion-an-uncertain-political-future-101622188451324.html

After mourning the deaths of our people, we must move forward and offer our services to those whose families have been devastated in the pandemic,” he said.He said that it has been decided to send a circular to all priests and nuns in the Meerut Diocese to look for children who had been orphaned in the pandemic, and extend help to them in every possible way.“It is not possible to keep such children with us because of the tedious and lengthy procedure of adoption under juvenile laws. Therefore, priests and nuns have been asked to evolve some way to help these children,” Fr Amirtham said.He said that Catholic priests had run an orphanage near Daurala town in the district for 38 years, but for some unavoidable reasons it was closed two years ago. “Our dedicated and committed priests and nuns have a long experience of doing selfless service to society, hence, they know how to find a way to help these children even without opening an orphanage for them,” said Fr Amirtham.He said that four priests and 10 sisters of the diocese have died after contracting the Coronavirus during the second wave. These religious were in Ghaziabad, Meerut, Moradabad, Dehradun and Mussoorie.The Meerut Diocese has 155 priests and 800 sisters with a total population of 32,000 Catholic believers in 14 districts which span from Ghaziabad to Rampur and Mussoorie in Uttarakhand.He said that 170 fathers and 150 sisters (data is still being compiled) have died across the country.Sharing the message of Bishop Kalist, he said that the whole Catholic community is praying for the departed souls and eradication of the virus so that peace could return.What is a diocese?A diocese is the territorial jurisdiction of a bishop where many churches exist. India has 174 dioceses and the Meerut Diocese comprises 14 districts of Western UP and Uttarakhand. The head of the Meerut Diocese is Bishop Francis Kalist.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/covid19-meerut-diocese-to-find-help-orphans-of-second-wave-101622312432681.html

The budget approved for the current fiscal is ₹1,68,015 crore.The Punjab State Electricity Regulatory Commission (PSERC) has worked out a subsidy of ₹10,668 crore payable to different consumer categories. It comprises ₹6,735 crore for agriculture pump set consumers, ₹1,627 crore for scheduled caste, backward class and below poverty line domestic consumers and ₹2,266 crore for industrial consumers. The large supply consumers are to get ₹1,928 crore, medium power ones will get ₹197 crore and ₹142 crore in subsidies has been allocated to small power consumers.Free power to farmers for agriculture besides weaker sections was a poll promise made by the Congress. So was the subsidy to provide power at ₹5 per unit to the industry. Chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh has already clarified that these subsidies will continue. ₹7,117 crore arrears There are also ₹7,117 crore arrears from the last fiscal, as the state government has been failing to pay the full subsidy for the past seven years.The total subsidy payable for the financial year 2021-22 is ₹17,796, which will be payable in 12 instalments this year. The first two instalments are ₹1,386 crore each, while the balance ₹15,024 crore will be paid in 10 equal instalments between June 2021 and February 2022, reads the PSERC order.The Punjab government has written to the commission on May 25 that it will continue to provide subsidy to industry, agriculture and domestic consumers amounting to ₹10,621 crore, and it has been provided for in the state budget. This comprises ₹7,180 crore for agriculture, ₹1,928 crore for industry and ₹1,513 crore for domestic consumers.Punjab is the only state in the country where industrial consumers, who are cross-subsidising another category of consumers, also receive subsidies. While the Punjab industry is cross-subsidising other consumers to the tune of ₹1,175 crore, it is getting a subsidy of ₹2,200 crore. At the same time, it is paying ₹2,000 crore as excise duty and other taxes.Punjab is levying 20% electricity duty across the board on payable bills of all consumers. It has reduced the power tariff for consumers having load up to 7 kW.“Punjab should reduce electricity duty to 5% on domestic loads up to 2 kW, 10% for up to 7 kW and 15% for up to 15 kW. This will further reduce the burden,” said VK Gupta, spokesman of All India Power Engineers Federation. He said the government should now introspect over its poll promises as these are bleeding Punjab’s finances. “There is a need to rationalise the subsidies,” he said, adding that poll promises are important, but these should be limited to the needy sections.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/power-subsidy-bill-arrears-cross-10-of-punjab-s-total-budget-101622309733292.html

29-05-2021||Mumbai||FIR against TV actor Munmun Dutta for casteist remark||Amboli police on Saturday booked actor Munmun Dutta for allegedly using casteist slur against a community in a video she had posted online on May 10. The actor, who plays the character of Babita in the television series Taarak Mehta Ka Ooltah Chashmah, has been booked under relevant sections of the Atrocities Act and the Indian Penal Code. This is the third FIR against the actor. In the past, Haryana and Madhya Pradesh police had registered FIRs against the actor for the same objectionable video. The actor had later uploaded an apology after her comment sparked controversy on social media.The FIR was registered by Amboli police after a complaint was filed by Naresh Bohit, Maharashtra president of Walmiki Vikas Sangh. Bohit stated in his complaint that while announcing her entry on YouTube the actor expressed a casteist slur for the Walmiki community.“Her comments have hurt sentiments of the Walmiki community people. It insults the community and it also maligns the community’s image in society and shows us in a bad light,” Bohit stated.After Dutta’s video courted controversy she uploaded a one-page apology on Twitter and stated, “A video that I posted yesterday wherein one word used by me has been misinterpreted. It was never said with the intent of insult, intimidate, humiliate or hurt anyone’s feelings. Because of my language barrier, I was genuinely misinformed about the meaning of the word. Once I was made aware of its meaning, immediately took the part down. I have utmost respect for every single person from every caste, creed or gender and acknowledge their immense contribution to our Society or nation. I sincerely would like to apologize to every single person who have been unintentionally hurt by the usage of the word and I sincerely regret for the same.”Bohit said, “It has become a trend for the celebrities to first make a derogatory comment and then after damaging reputation of the community apologise for the comment. We need legal action on the actor.”Mumbai police spokesperson deputy commissioner of police Chaitanya Siriprolu said that a first information report (FIR) has been registered at Amboli police station under sections 295A (deliberate and malicious acts, intended to outrage religious feelings of any class by insulting its religion or religious beliefs) of IPC and 3 of Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe (Prevention of Atrocities) Act on May 26.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/fir-against-tv-actor-munmun-dutta-for-casteist-remark-101622309192323.html

We will put in all our efforts,” chief minister BS Yediyurappa was quoted as saying by news agency PTI.“Lockdown will continue till June 7. Depending on the situation, we will take further decisions. For now, till June 7 we shall observe. All the strict measures that need to be taken will be followed till then,” Yediyurappa further added.Earlier in the day, state home minister Basavaraj Bommai said that following the directions given by Centre to continue lockdown-like measures till June 30, the state may extend the lockdown. The Centre on Thursday directed governments in all state and Union Territories to continue implementation of the lockdown-like measures till June 30.“The positivity rate has not decreased drastically, it needs to fall below 10%, and in rural areas there are about 22,000-23,000 cases, it to fall below 10,000 cases, even the number of deaths will have to decrease, only then we will be able to manage the health infrastructure in the state,” Bommai said. The positivity rate in Karnataka is currently 16.42% and the case fatality rate is 1.75%.Yediyurappa met with MPs, legislators and public representatives from Mysuru, Hassan, Belagavi, Kalaburagi and Vijayapura districts.

Sena leader Sanjay Raut asked why that there is no ban on cow slaughter in Goa and Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-ruled states in the North East, like the one proposed by the Lakshadweep administrator Praful K Patel.Patel, a former Gujarat BJP leader and the state’s former home minister, is facing criticism on the slew of regulations he has brought in Lakshadweep where he was made the administrator by the Centre. The new regulations have drawn the ire of the locals as well as political parties including Sena’s allies in Maharashtra—Congress and Nationalist Congress Party (NCP).Sena’s Rajya Sabha MP added that the decision that are made in the Union Territories and the islands must be taken after taking the locals into confidence. “If there is unrest then the whole country has to pay the price for it. And if somebody is trying to create communal tension in such Union Territory then it is wrong,” Raut said. Sena mouthpiece Saamana also published an editorial on Saturday and said that Patel’s “arbitrariness” is now seen in the island after Dadra and Nagar Haveli. Patel was named in the suicide note of Dadra Nagar Haveli MP Mohan Delkar who committed suicide earlier this year in Mumbai.His regulations include a new development plan, proposed cow slaughter ban, the Prevention of Anti-Social Activities Act, which allows the police to detain a person without any public disclosure for a period of one year, and the draft panchayat notification, where a person with more than two children is disqualified from being a panchayat member. Raut said that three is no opposition to development in Lakshadweep but added, “But the law and rules have to be uniform for everybody. There is a new regulation of beef in Lakshadweep, which is fine but Goa doesn’t have a ban, neither does Kerala or North-Eastern states. If such a law comes only in Lakshadweep, then many questions crop up in the minds of the people. Therefore, whether the administrator is a political appointee or a civil servant, if we do not take step cautiously then we will face unrest in the coming days.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/take-locals-into-confidence-or-there-will-be-unrest-shiv-sena-over-lakshadweep-row-101622309072309.html
29-05-2021||Mumbai||Include pregnant women in vax ambit, Sena MP writes to Union health min||Shiv Sena Member of Parliament (MP) Priyanka Chaturvedi on Saturday wrote to Union health minister Dr Harsh Vardhan seeking inclusion of pregnant women in vaccination ambit. The Rajya Sabha MP sought inclusion citing increase risk to pregnant women in the second wave of Covid-19.In her letter, Chaturvedi said that in the second wave, pregnant women have been found at an increased risk of severe illness from Covid-19 when compared to others. She further quoted that a recent report found that pregnant women with Covid-19 are more likely to require intensive care unit (ICU) beds, invasive ventilation and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. She said that the risk of death is 70% higher in pregnant women than in non-pregnant women, they are also at an increased risk of a blood clot.“About 67,000 babies are born every day in India, approximate 2.7 crore pregnancies in a year are recorded in our country, keeping this segment out of the vaccine process will not only endanger their lives but could also lead to their babies having to suffer the consequences,” she wrote. She further said, “I do understand the position, due to lack of clinical trials data on the effect of the Covid-19 vaccine on pregnant mothers. I also acknowledge that India administers a different set of vaccines other than the mRNA vaccines for which data exists,” the letter stated.Recently, the Shiv Sena-controlled Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) had initiated consultations with gynaecologists and health task force after which had given its in-principle nod and drawn up a detailed plan to priorities bringing expectant and lactating mothers in the vaccine ambit. However, they are unable to roll it out since they await a final nod from the Centre, she added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/include-pregnant-women-in-vax-ambit-sena-mp-writes-to-union-health-min-101622308952313.html

From 52,000 active cases in the city as of May 8, the number of active cases has come down to 28,000, as of Friday.On Saturday, the city recorded 1,038 cases and 25 deaths. The case tally now stands at 703,560, while the death toll is 14,775. The city’s recovery rate is 93% with 658,056 recoveries. There are 28,606 active cases in the city and the fatality rate is 2.09%.Along with the city’s active cases, the daily positivity rate has also come down to around 3% from being around 27% in the first week of April, known to be the peak of the second wave.According to the state health department data, from being over 90,000 active cases in the first 15 days of April, the number came down to 82,616 on April 22. Further, the number went down from 63,325 active cases on May 1 to around 52,000 active cases on May 8.As of May 28, there are around 28,000 active cases in the city.

The civic body said it had to handle around 1,500 symptomatic cases, per day, during the second wave; it is now preparing to handle around 2,500 symptomatic cases.Two days ago, municipal commissioner Iqbal Singh Chahal also said that experts are of the opinion that the third wave might hit the city between July to August.Meanwhile, Dharavi, the city’s former hot spot, recorded four cases on Saturday, taking the tally to 6,810 followed by 6,422 discharges.Dr Siddarth Paliwal, a city-based physician said, “The number of cases is bound to drop after a spike. We are seeing a similar trend in the city. But we have to be very mindful during the unlocking, considering we do not know how the virus will behave post the downfall.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbais-active-cases-go-down-by-45-in-20-days-101622308892406.html
29-05-2021||Mumbai||OBC communities may lose political reservation in local bodies in Maharashtra||This may turn into a major political crisis for the Uddhav Thackeray-led Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) as the Other Backward Classes (OBC) is on the verge of losing political reservations in the local bodies of Maharashtra comprising municipal corporations, municipal councils, zilla parishads, gram panchayats etc. This is because the Supreme Court has rejected the state government’s review petition concerning reservation to the OBCs. It has ruled that the reservation in favour of the OBC in local bodies should not result in exceeding the 50% cap in reservation quota determined by it.Moreover, the Apex court directed the state government to appoint a commission to determine the backwardness and population of the OBC communities, based on which, the reservation quota should be fixed for them. However, it won’t be allowed to breach the 50% cap on reservation quota. This simply means no seat is going to be reserved for the OBC community in the upcoming local bodies at least for this year or until the state government completes the entire process.This has upset the community who have threatened that the state government will have to face its consequences.The community leaders are preparing to meet in the next two days to deliberate and decide the next course of action. They will also be seeking the appointment of chief minister Uddhav Thackeray.The review petition of the state government was quashed by the Supreme Court on Friday. The Apex court gave its verdict on March 4 following which the state had approached it for a review.This is the second setback to the MVA government this month as on May 5, the Apex court had quashed 12% and 13% reservation in government jobs and admissions to the Maratha community through the Socially and Educationally Backward Classes (SEBC) Act. The state government, which is yet to decide its next course of action against the verdict, is now facing another blow over reservation to the OBC communities.While reading down section 12(2)(c) of the Maharashtra Zilla Parishads and Panchayat Samitis Act, 1961, the court on March 4 also quashed notifications issued by the State Election Commission (SEC) in 2018 and 2020 to the extent of providing seat reservation in local bodies concerned for OBCs.Section 12(2)(c) of the Maharashtra Zilla Parishads and Panchayat Samitis Act, 1961, provides a 27% quota for persons belonging to backward classes, which was challenged in the court of law.The legislation for the local bodies in Maharashtra provides reservation to the Scheduled Caste (SC) and Schedule Tribe (ST) communities based on their population in those particular bodies, whereas in the case of OBC this data is not available as their last census was conducted in 1931.Referring to a constitutional bench verdict passed in K Krishna Murthy versus Union of India in 2010, the Apex court has said, “It was imperative for the state to set up a dedicated commission to conduct contemporaneous rigorous empirical inquiry into the nature and implications of backwardness and on the basis of recommendations of that commission take follow up steps including to amend the existing dispensation such as to amend section 12(2)(c) of the Maharashtra Zilla Parishads and Panchayat Samitis Act, 1961.”While doing so it further ordered that in any case, such reservation shall not exceed an aggregate of 50 per cent of the total reserved quota favouring SC, ST and OBC communities.State election commissioner UPS Madan said that the Supreme Court verdict is going to be applicable for all the local bodies including urban and rural. “The only thing is they will become applicable only when fresh elections are to be conducted. It means the verdict would be applicable for the upcoming elections of local bodies. It also means no seat can be reserved for OBC communities until the state government completes the entire process of setting up a commission, who will go into details of OBC communities and then come up with recommendations on which local bodies should have how much OBC reservation,” the election commissioner said.He further clarified even after that the combined reservation of SC, ST and OBC communities will not be allowed to exceed the 50% limit.Five major municipal corporations are going to polls in 2021 and ten other corporations and 27 district councils are going to poll this year.The Apex court in its March 4 order also observed that the reservation given to the OBC communities is not mandated by the Constitution unlike SC and ST and thus it should be reduced wherever the total reservation quota exceeds 50% limit. “This is the reason the OBC community will be at the receiving end as they were getting 27% reservation as per state legislation. Thus even after the entire process is completed the communities will not be able to get 27% reservation in all those local bodies where SC and ST have more population,” said an official from the state election commission.“We are going to pay a big price for the mistakes of this government. If the state government had taken immediate measures soon after the March 4 verdict then this situation may not have arisen. We have requested them to get the case deferred unless the entire process of setting up the commission and its study is completed. However, they chose to ignore it and the political future of the community has been pushed into the darkness,” said Chandrakant Bavkar, president, OBC Sangharsh Samanvay Samiti.“The state government will have to face the consequences as it is giving step-motherly treatment to the OBCs and preferential treatment to the Maratha community. All this is going to be discussed in a meeting to decide the next move in the next two days,” he alleged.State Nationalist Congress Party minister and a prominent OBC leader Chhagan Bhujbal said that they have to look into details of the verdict. “I have yet to read the order. The issue was related to the areas having a tribal population in the majority. We will look into the details and take necessary steps,” Bhujbal said.He further said they have been demanding a census of the OBC community by the census commissioner to understand what is the population of their community and what are they getting in terms of reservation.Meanwhile, leader of Opposition Devendra Fadnavis wrote a letter to the chief minister for appointing a commission to study backwardness of the OBC communities. He also said that the OBC communities have lost their political reservation owing to the incompetency of this government. “The state government showed no seriousness for OBC reservation. It sought to postpone the hearing eight times in the last 15 months. In one of the hearings, SC has clearly said about setting up a commission to justify the 27% OBC reservation but they did nothing except filing a review petition. With this decision in place, OBC communities will not get a single seat reserved in all the local bodies across the state,” Fadnavis said in his letter.He pointed out raising the issue in a meeting with the chief minister on March 5 and later sending a reminder but the government took no action on the matter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/obc-communities-may-lose-political-reservation-in-local-bodies-in-maharashtra-101622308832330.html

Additional chief secretary (basic education) Renuka Kumar on May 19 directed the director general (school education) Vijay Kiran Anand regarding speedy disbursement of salary.The relief was given keeping in mind the ongoing Covid-19 crisis in the state because of which administrative work in several universities was hampered, making it impossible to carry out verification of degrees.The order said that the department should take written undertaking stating that all marksheets and proof of educational qualifications submitted by the newly appointed teachers at the time of their recruitment are true.The order further warned the newly appointed teachers of legal consequences if the proof of their educational qualifications was found fake during verification later.

29-05-2021||Noida||Ghaziabad: Max Hospital asked to vaccinate 5k beneficiaries per day||In order to vaccinate more people falling in the 18-45 years age bracket, the district administration has asked the officials of Max Hospital in Vaishali to take up vaccination of about 5,000 beneficiaries per day, said officials aware of the matter. The target is quite high given that for the past five days, the 45 government centres and the vaccination sites at two private hospitals have been collectively able to vaccinate about 13,000 beneficiaries per day on an average. District magistrate of Ghaziabad Ajay Shankar Pandey said he held meeting with officials of Max Hospital, Vaishali, and asked them to vaccinate about 5,000 beneficiaries per day, primarily to inoculate people of the 18-45 age group. “The target is high but is the need of the hour. We need to scale up vaccination before another wave of the pandemic arrives. We held a meeting with officials of Max Hospital and suggested them that apart from in-house vaccination taken up at the hospital, they can conduct the inoculation drive at centralised locations like a school, mall or community halls,” said Pandey. “We have also directed that from now onwards, the vaccine stocks will only be given to the government vaccination centres while the private hospitals will have to arrange vaccines on their own,” he added. According to health department officials, Max Hospital is one of the two private hospitals which are taking up vaccination for the 18-45 and 45+ age groups, by charging a fee for the vaccine dose administered. Officials of Max Hospital said they will put in all efforts to meet the target set by the district administration. “To benefit the residents and safeguard them against Covid-19, we met the district magistrate and discussed ways to scale up the overall vaccination drive. We are currently conducting almost 1,000 vaccination per day, and these are all pre-booked through the CoWIN app. We have requested the district magistrate for approval to organise vaccination drive in RWAs as many Ghaziabad residents are not able to get slots through the app,” Dr Gaurav Aggarwal, senior vice-president (operations) of the hospital, said in a statement. “We are also looking to explore additional sites like community halls, schools for mass vaccination where residents can walk in and get vaccine shots,” read the statement. Starting June 1, the vaccination drive for people in the 18-45 age group will be extended to all districts as per directions from the UP government. At present, the vaccination drive for the said group is being undertaken in 23 districts, including Ghaziabad and Gautam Budh Nagar. According to the latest government order of May 26, the UP government has also issued directions for vaccination at the workplace for judicial officers, media persons, officials of the information department and other government workplace. A maximum of 50 beneficiaries falling in the 18-45 age group can be inoculated per day at the workplaces by facilitating on-the-spot registration. The government has also directed that 50 slots for inoculation also be reserved for people in the 45+ age group at workplaces. The UP government has also directed that vaccine centres be opened for parents having one or more children above the age of 12 years. “Currently, we have 45 government centres conducting 85 sessions per day. Last week, we vaccinated around 10,000 beneficiaries on average. This week, we scaled it up to an average of about 15000-16000 per day as vaccine stock was available,” said an officer from district health department, who wished not to be identified. “Now, we have to start eight workplace centres for government teachers, postal staff and two other centres for parents of children below 12 years of age. One of the two centres will be at a private school at Meerut Road while the other one will be at Kailash Mansarowar Bhawan at Indirapuram,” said the officer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/ghaziabad-max-hospital-asked-to-vaccinate-5k-beneficiaries-per-day-101622307392210.html
29-05-2021||Noida||Noida: Rains likely in next two days, to bring mercury down||Noida: The combined effect of cyclone Yaas and western disturbances may bring light rains in Noida and adjoining areas over the next two days, weather experts at the India Meteorological Department (IMD) said on Saturday.According to IMD, while easterly winds already brought the mercury down by two notches in the past 24 hours, there are high chances of rains between May 31 and June 2 that would drop the mercury by three to four degrees Celsius (°C).“As a combined effect of cyclone Yaas and back-to-back western disturbances, the region (NCR) may see rain, light to moderate, between May 31 and June 2. The temperature will be around 36°C. There had been no incidents of heat wave in Delhi-NCR, including Noida, so far and June 15 onwards marks the beginning of pre-monsoon rainfall. So there are no chances of heat waves so far. As an effect of Yaas, strong easterly winds will keep bringing the strong moist winds in the region that will also keep the air quality under check,” said Kuldeep Srivastava, head of regional weather forecasting centre, IMD.The average wind speed in the region for the past three days has been 25 kmph, IMD said. According to IMD, Noida saw maximum and minimum temperatures of 37.4°C and 27.4°C on Saturday against 39.6 and 26.1°C a day earlier. At Safdarjung, considered average for NCR, the maximum and minimum temperatures were recorded at 37.5°C and 26.6°C, respectively.Meanwhile, the air quality index (AQI) of Noida on Saturday was 92 or ‘satisfactory’ against 118 (‘moderate’) a day earlier, according to the Central Pollution Control Board. While AQI of Greater Noida was 78 against 87 on Friday, Ghaziabad recorded an AQI at 103 against 128 (both under ‘moderate’ category) a day earlier.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/noidarains-likely-in-next-two-days-to-bring-mercury-down-101622307332216.html
29-05-2021||Pune||Shivajinagar reports 24mm rain, Lohegaon records 36.6mm : IMD||Shivajinagar on Saturday reported 24 millimetre rainfall and Lohegaon reported 36.6 mm rainfall. It was the second highest rainfall in 24 hours since 2010, the highest was in 2015 at 102.8 mm rainfall as per IMD.on Saturday.The maximum day temperature of 35.3 degrees Celsius and 24.2 degrees Celsius at night. Meteorologists now believe that Maharashtra may witness the onset of monsoon by mid-June. Pune until May 31 will experience light rainfall and cloudy skies towards the afternoon, said IMD officials. They added that since this is a pre-monsoon shower, rainfall will be accompanied with thunderstorm and lightning. As the monsoon onset is likely in Kerala on May 31, the wait for monsoon over Maharashtra is likely to continue till mid-June, said a meteorologist from the India Meteorological Department (IMD). As per the IMD, first stage Long Range Forecast (LRF), the onset of Southwest Monsoon is likely on May 31. Conditions for further advancement of Monsoon are favourable. OP Sreejith, scientist and head, Climate Monitoring and Prediction Group (CMPG) at IMD Pune said as of now the monsoon progress is as per predictions made by the IMD. “In the first week of June, there are chances of cyclogenesis which will help the southwest monsoon advance. Previous cyclones did not affect the monsoon flow. Now the circulation will be stronger. In the next few days, there will be a cyclonic circulation over the southern hemisphere. So the monsoon may not be active these days. After this monsoon will regain strength,” said Sreejith. He said that the side over Bay of Bengal will strengthen in the first week of June, helping the monsoon advance. “Models are showing another cyclone circulation is likely over Bay of Bengal which will help the monsoon advance. At present, the IMD has forecasted the onset of monsoon until May 31 over Kerala. For Maharashtra, the onset is likely till Mid-June. The second LRF will be issued soon by IMD giving details about the rainfall scenario in June,” said Sreejith. He added that at present the depth of westerly has increased. So conditions are favourable for the monsoon advancement. Anupam Kashyapi, head of weather forecasting department at IMD Pune said that Arabian Sea side of the monsoon is likely to get active. “The Arabian Sea in the next few days will be favourable for the onset of monsoon over Kerala,” said Kashyapi. Rainfall for the next few days Kashyapi said that there is no strong active system seen over the state. “But due to moderately strong westerly winds all four subdivisions of Maharashtra will experience isolated rainfall. Many parts of the state will be partly cloudy and chances of light to very light rain are likely,” said Kashyapi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/shivajinagar-reports-24mm-rain-lohegaon-records-36-6mm-imd-101622307272263.html

From Monday onwards, even juveniles will start getting bail and will be released from the observation homes. During the first wave of the pandemic last year, the Supreme Court had ordered that all prisons and observation homes release the inmates in order to avoid the spread of infection in close quarters. During the second wave, the apex court issued a similar order for prisons. The release of inmates from Luksar jail started on May 5 and till Saturday afternoon, 496 prisoners have been released on interim bail. Of these, 469 are undertrials and 27 convicted.“Any new prisoner is first tested and placed in the temporary jail adjacent to the main block for 14 days. Another test is conducted before they are put in the main prison,” said jail superintendent Bhim Sen Mukund.Currently, there are 2,520 prisoners lodged in Luksar jail, of which 104 inmates are putting up in the temporary jail. “We have medical staff round the clock to monitor the health of the prisoners.

An L-1 facility is also operating here to take care of infected inmates. In fact, all the inmates who are 45 and above have been vaccinated while the rest are in the process of getting the jab,” said Mukund. Ever since the pandemic began, the inmates have made 60,374 masks in the prison, of which 3,780 masks have been manufactured this year. While most of these were distributed among prisoners and staff, some were also given to institutions outside.Similar release orders are awaited for the observation homes as well.“We have now received the necessary orders and the juveniles will be released on interim bail from Monday onwards.

For the last two years, the Maharashtra Metrorailway Corporation Company Limited (MahaMetro) was pursuing the issue with the authorities to clear the encroached area reserved for the Mandai metro station. Madhav Jagtap, head of anti-encroachment department of the PMC said, “It was a pending issue due to relocation of commercial establishments. The civic body completed the relocation process, and the PMC gave an alternative land to people to rehabilitate them. We started action in the morning at 7.00 and completed in the evening at 6.00. We cleared the structure spread over almost 5,000 square feet of area. The underground stretch between Agriculture College and Swargate is part of the 16-kilometre Pimpri-Chinchwad to Swargate corridor. There are five underground stations and Mandai is one of them. Mandai underground station was pending for want of land which was occupied by commercial establishments such as shops of different food items. The MahaMetro plans to sink vertical shafts to extract the tunnel boring machines that are excavating the underground tunnels for the Metro rail. Atul Gadgil, MahaMetro said, “We were waiting to want this piece of land for Mandai underground station. Finally, we got the land. Now, we will clear the debris and start work as early as possible. We have already been together for two years. The Mandai is the only underground station site where work has not started yet due to relocation issues of the commercial establishment.” He further said, “The land is important as it is the entry point of the station. We will construct two shifts which will be used for entry and exit points of the station. The PMC has done good work.” Till date, the Mahametro has completed pre-tunnelling work such as shifting utilities and drainage lines in this area. The MahaMetro has already begun the work at the Shivajinagar, Civil court, Kasba peth and Swargate underground stations and it has achieved 30 per cent completion so far.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/mandai-metro-station-work-to-begin-after-pmc-clears-encroachments-101622307092234.html

Speaking after reviewing the Passing out Parade (POP) at National Defence Academy at Khadakwasla, admiral Singh urged the passing out cadets to carry forward the spirit of jointmanship which is the need of the hour as the nature of warfare continues to evolve in the land, air, sea, space and cyber domains. “The nature of war is changing and it is important to engage the adversary in all domains - land, sea and air, space and cyber and this is for this reason, the jointness among three services is far more important now than in the past.

No one was hurt in the incident, officials said. Speaker Mahendra Prasad said he has written to the building construction department in this regard. “The issue of quality of construction is for the concerned construction agencies of the state government to look into. I have brought the recent incident into their notice. They need to look into the causes and do repair work. I have also asked them to look into other possibly damaged locations and fix them,” said Prasad. The capital city received record rainfall due to the recently passed cyclone Yaas, and the false ceiling at the assembly building collapsed on Friday. The incident has once again brought the issue of construction quality of the iconic building, with the latest incident being a second such event within a year. In August last year, false ceiling collapsed in the library of the Assembly building. Standing on 39 acres in HEC area, the new Assembly building inaugurated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in the run up to the 2019 Jharkhand assembly elections was constructed at a cost of ₹465 crore. It was constructed over a span of four years.The building has been courting controversy from the beginning, as the JMM, the opposition party at the time, boycotted the inauguration ceremony and one-day special session called in 2019 by the then Raghubar Das government, alleging that it was getting an incomplete building inaugurated in haste.At the time of inauguration, only the central hall of the Assembly was ready, while the west and east wings of the three-storey building were completed later.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ranchi-news/false-ceiling-caves-in-at-state-assembly-building-no-one-hurt-101622299771507.html
29-05-2021||Ranchi||Covid spread in rural areas restricted to few districts; positivity rate low: Survey||In what would come as a relief for the state, an analysis of initial data collected during ongoing door-to-door rural public health survey shows that spread of coronavirus infection is restricted in few districts, besides low positivity rate being registered in villages across the state. The 10-day intensive public health survey (IPHS), that targets to reach each and every household across panchayats in the state, began on May 25. Till Friday, as many as 1,633,417 households comprising 8,207,751 persons were covered under it. “Out of the total surveyed persons so far, Rapid Antigen Test (RAT) was recommended for 53,793 suspect cases. The test has been done for 51,605 cases. Out of it, 762 cases turned out Covid-19 positive, including 21 children in the age group 0-18,” said Sidhartha Tripathi, officer on special duty of IEC wing in health department. With the numbers being on lower side, the positivity rate stood at 1.47%, indicating a restricted spread of the pandemic in rural areas. However, those who showed symptoms but tested negative in RAT, were recommended for RT-PCR or TruNat tests for confirmation, officials said. Besides, as per initial data analysis, the spread of pandemic in rural areas was mostly concentrated in nine of the 24 districts. “As per initial data, it seems about 80% per cent of our villages are safe. Some of the districts where the most cases have been detected are Ranchi, Sahibganj, Bokaro and Giridih,” said Tripathi. However, the health survey showed a disturbing trend of several people showing signs of critical diseases such as diabetes, tuberculosis (TB) and abnormal blood pressure. While 5,990 persons showed TB symptoms in the first four days of the survey, 43,766 persons showed symptoms of diabetes and 46,400 showed signs of abnormal blood pressure, officials said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ranchi-news/covid-spread-in-rural-areas-restricted-to-few-districts-positivity-rate-low-survey-101622299711519.html

Reason: the electoral college to elect the new MLCs would cease to exist after June 15 when term of panchayat bodies comes to an end. Sources said the state election department has already sent a report to the Election Commission of India (ECI), which will take a final decision on the matter. “At least two weeks’ time is required for preparations before the polls are announced. But chances are dim because 97% of the voters to elect MLCs from ‘local authorities’ constituencies will be non-existent from June 15. One cannot have election without voters. Hence, the election will have to be deferred,” said a senior official in the state election department. MLCs from “local authorities” constituencies are elected by ward members of all the three panchayati raj institutions, the gram panchayat, district boards and urban local bodies. The elected members of panchayati raj institutions ( PRIs) constitute 97% of the electoral college to elect MLCs from 24 “local authorities” constituencies. Given the scenario, all MLCs from this constituency would cease to be legislators from July 18 onwards, after the expiry of their six-year term. At preset, there are 19 MLCs now in the Council from “local authorities” constituency. Five seats fell vacant when two MLCs died while three were elected MLAs in the 2020 Assembly polls. The current strength of the Legislative Council is 69, with five vacancies from “local authorities” constituency and one from the Legislative Assembly quota. Once 19 more seats fall vacant on July 18, the strength would come down to 50. On panchayat polls, which were to begin in the state in mid-March, the state poll panel is yet to take a decision. There is speculation that the government would be taking over the charge of PRIs and run it through administrators after the expiry of the term of current panchayat bodies on June 15. Bihar’s chief electoral officer (CEO) H R Srinivasa said they had sent a detailed report about the term of sitting MLCs from local authorities constituency and other aspects of holding the election to ECI.The contagion effectFate uncertain for 24 seatsBihar’s Legislative Council has a total of 75 seats, of which 24 are from ‘local authorities’ constituencies. The six-year term for these 24 MLCs ends on July 17.Electoral college Elected members of panchayati raj institutions (PRIs) — the gram panchayat, district boards and urban local bodies — constitute 97% of the electoral college for these 24 seats.Problem at handTerm of current gram panchayat, district boards and urban local bodies ends on June 15 and so there won’t be any voters for the 24 seats in question, unless their term is extended.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/panchayat-polls-on-hold-a-council-crisis-in-sight-101622299591480.html

The other channel -- 'Paras Gamers' with 3.94 lakh subscribers is used to live stream PUBG on YouTube," the police officer said.Both the accounts are monetised by YouTube and he earns ₹20,000-25,000 a month."The YouTuber also disclosed that the controversial video, against which a case has now been registered, was made by him to gain widespread attention and views, so that his monetary income could be maximised," the SP said.The SIT has seized a laptop, a tablet and three mobile phones from the YouTuber's possession for further investigation, the officer added.The Arunachal Pradesh government on Monday filed a case against Singh for making racial remarks against Ering and inciting ill will and hatred towards the people of the state.Paras made the comments while reacting to a letter addressed to Prime Minister Narendra Modi by Ering wherein the MLA had asked the PM to ban the re-launch of PUBG Mobile India's new avatar -- Battlegrounds Mobile India.Ering had reasoned that the game was aimed at deceiving the government and citizens and should be banned in the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/arunachal-court-remands-punjab-youtuber-to-six-days-in-jail-in-racial-slur-case-101622298586835.html

According to official sources, the SIT detained Sukhjinder Singh, alias Sunny, of Kotkapura and Baljit Singh of Sikhanwala village on Friday and took them to the Bajakhana police station. The SIT, led by inspector general of police, border range, Surinder Pal Singh Parmar, had on May 17 arrested the duo along with Nishan Singh, Ranjit Singh, Pardeep Kumar and Shakti Singh in a case registered in connection with a sacrilege incident wherein torn pages of “bir” (copy of Guru Granth Sahib) were found scattered at Bargari village in Faridkot district in 2015. The court had sent them to police custody till May 21. However, Sukhjinder, Baljit and Nishan tested positive for Covid-19 on May 19, after which they were admitted to the Faridkot hospital. A complaint was filed in the court of chief judicial magistrate Sanjeev Kundi on Saturday alleging that the SIT has violated the court orders, dated May 21, by wrongfully confining Sukhjinder and Baljit. Defence counsel Vinod Monga alleged that inspectors Dalbir Singh and Iqbal Hussain of the SIT had wrongfully taken the two from the Covid ward on Friday. “So, the necessary intimation is being given with request for the release of the accused from the wrongful police confinement and to get them in judicial custody,” the petition stated. The defence also requested for a report along with CCTV footage of the Bajakhana police station on the relevant dates and hospital records of the duo. The court has directed the SIT to file a reply by May 31. However, the SIT sought production warrants of Sukhjinder and Baljit, which the court issued for May 31.Faridkot judicial magistrate Tarjini in the order dated May 21 had said that since the accused are admitted at the Covid ward, they cannot be sent to further police remand and “are hereby remanded to judicial custody till June 1”. She had also directed the investigation officer to get their Covid tests conducted and produce the results on the fixed date.Meanwhile, a Faridkot court on Saturday sent their two co-accused, Shakti Singh and Ranjit Singh, to judicial custody till June 10.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/bargari-sacrilege-sit-picks-up-two-dera-followers-from-covid-ward-101622297373825.html

He also asked Capt Amarinder Singh to place direct orders with companies that are supplying vaccines in the country instead of waiting for the Centre’s “meagre” supply.“The Punjab government should follow the example of the Mumbai municipal corporation, which used ₹600 crore to purchase vaccines,” said Sukhbir, while demanding that vaccines worth ₹1,000 crore be purchased immediately. He also sought GST waiver on purchase of vaccines and life-saving medicines.Bibi Jagir Kaur said that while earlier the sangat, including NRIs, had donated oxygen concentrators, the SGPC hoped to receive 100 ventilators from abroad soon. She said since the people were not getting vaccines and the Punjab government had also failed to purchase them directly from companies, the Centre should allow the SGPC to import them.Meanwhile, the SGPC also launched its tenth Covid Care Centre at Gurdwara Janam Asthan Baba Buddha at Kathunangal village in Amritsar with a capacity of 25 beds.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/both-pm-cm-failed-to-fulfil-their-duty-sukhbir-on-vax-shortage-in-punjab-101622297313367.html

She did not attend the review meeting with the Prime Minister at Kalaikunda as she did not want to elaborate on this unrealistic demand," Ghosh said.The CM had on Friday said that she, in separate proposals submitted to Prime Minister Modi, sought ₹10,000 crore each for rebuilding the seaside tourist town of Digha and the ravaged parts of the Sunderbans region.Banerjee, however, skipped a review meeting on cyclone devastation with Modi, seeking to know why opposition BJP leaders were present at the session.Ghosh further contended that the presence of Suvendu Adhikari, the leader of opposition in the Assembly, was another reason that prompted Banerjee to skip the meeting."Adhikari will be attending assembly sessions, too. Will Banerjee stop going to the House? Instead of politicising the calamity, she should work with everyone for the welfare of people," Ghosh said, in a dig at the TMC supremo.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/mamatas-20k-crore-demand-for-cyclone-relief-unrealistic-dilip-ghosh-101622293995506.html

I read in the newspapers that they are a bit upset. I want to tell them that it was with great difficulty that we were able to control the situation by imposing a lockdown."I can understand their difficulty but they should be patient and should not rush. We also want their markets and shops to open up and as and when the situation comes under control, we will open up everything," he said.The group of traders held a virtual meeting where they suggested reopening of shops and markets "in a phased manner while segregating the working time for different verticals of Delhi trade"."The business of Delhi has been completely derailed, how will that business be restored when there is acute financial crunch," Khandelwal said.He suggested that business activities can be restored in a manner which "may certainly curb any more spreading of coronavirus"."Working hours can be reduced, Delhi can be divided into different zones, night curfew can be imposed, weekend lockdowns and several other options can be considered but the fundamental is to have a will to open the shops and markets," he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/covid19-delhi-traders-demand-opening-of-markets-in-phased-manner-101622291005167.html

The kit could pave way for quicker and cheaper testing to detect Covid positive patients in the country and even prove to be a replacement for the widely being used RT-PCR tests which cost more and also require a costly lab set-up, say IIIT-A experts.“The rapid diagnostic kit for novel coronavirus is being developed as part of a Government of India’s department of biotechnology (DBT) funded one year project ‘Development of rapid detection kit for novel Coronavirus’. We have already developed a prototype of the kit and its trial for proper validation is now under way at King George’s Medical University (KGMU), Lucknow,” said Amaresh Kumar Sahoo, assistant professor at department of applied sciences, IIIT-A, who is leading the efforts as the project’s principal investigator.Other IIIT-A scientists actively involved in the project include prof Pritish Varadwaj, prof Krishna Misra and Sintu K Samanta. Tayyaba Afshan is working on this mission as a junior research fellow. “Prof Amita Jain, head, microbiology department, KGMU, Lucknow is collaborating with us on this project,” he said. Sahoo said the kit being developed by them involves use of luminescent gold nanoparticle-based diagnosis of Covid that is performed within 15 minutes. “The viral RNA sample is detected by luminescent nanoparticles under UV-light illumination,” he said. Sahoo said it will be a low-cost diagnosis kit as compared to available RT-PCR-based and antibody-based tests. “Each test using our kit would cost one-fifth of the cost of a RT-PCR test. It a RT-PCR test costs around ₹1000, a test by our kit would cost mere ₹200 or so. While a RT-PCR test takes around 4 hours or more for the result, using our kit the result would come within 15 minutes. Moreover, against a set-up needing machines costing ₹25-30 lakh for RT-PCR tests, our kit requires a set-up that costs just around ₹5 lakh,” he added.Sahoo said the economical, effective and faster kit developed by the team had shown great results in the lab. “Now we are waiting for the validation results of the trial that should come in the next two months,” he said.Director, IIIT-A, prof P Nagabhushan said the validation of the test kit developed by IIIT-A team being carried out at KGMU-Lucknow was under an MoU existing between the two institutions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/iiita-scientists-develop-faster-cheaper-covid-test-kit-101622288370408.html

Following an in-principle decision, a proposal in this regard has already been finalised and will soon be put before the appropriate sanctioning bodies of the university, university officials said.The move comes close on the heels of some prominent schools and colleges of Prayagraj also deciding to help students who have lost the main earning members of their family or both parents to Covid-19 pandemic. UPRTOU officials said that the university’s move will benefit any student who has lost their parents or for that matter any woman who has lost her husband to the Coronavirus, and who wishes to pursue any course from the university. They will be able to do so free of cost.“We have decided that the university will impart free education to anyone who has lost the earning member of the family because of Coronavirus. Likewise, any woman who has lost her husband or a student who has become an orphan because of the pandemic, will also be able to pursue any course of his/ her choice without any fee,” said UPRTOU vice-chancellor Seema Singh.She further said that the university is equally sensitive towards the students presently enrolled and will also come up with a decision if the student has faced similar unfortunate circumstances. “The student could be facing a problem of how to manage the fee for next semester or year. We will help such students too,” said Singh. The V-C further said that soon a proposal in this regard will be put before the academic council and then the executive council of the Open University and then be implemented. “Once this is approved by the two decision-making bodies of the university, anyone who falls in the category and wants to pursue any academic course from the university, will be able to take admission free of cost,” said the V-C.The university runs 105 courses with the help of 1,200 study centres and 12 regional centres spread across the state. The V-C also informed that teachers and employees of the university will also be encouraged to voluntarily give a day’s salary to the Chief Minister’s Relief Fund to help fight Coronavirus. It has also been decided that a health centre will soon be opened on the UPRTOU campus at Phaphamau for the benefit of the university’s teachers, staff and students.

We returned home and I ventured out to attend to some work. Later in the evening, I found that my wife (Kiran) looked worried and had a slight fever. It was only in the evening that she revealed about being vaccinated with two doses in quick succession,” Ram Charan Sharma, the woman’s wife said, adding that he immediately contacted the vaccination centre.Sharma went to a primary health centre near Nangal for a vaccination with his family, including his wife Kiran, on Friday where the medical staff allegedly vaccinated her wife twice.“The staff at the centre denied that she was administrated two doses and said it was not possible as per the rules. I then consulted another doctor who prescribed some paracetamol medicine and advised her to get rest,” he said, adding that his wife also complained of pain in the arm where she got the shots.Chief medical health officer (CMHO) Dausa, Dr Manish Chodhary, repudiated claims of simultaneous double doses.“The first attempt to vaccinate her was withdrawn when some blood began to pop put. It is called a prick. The nursing staff then located another spot on her arm and vaccinated her with the first dose. She (Kiran) presumed that she was vaccinated twice, which is not true at all,” Chodhary said, adding that proper vaccination protocol was followed.Dr Chodhary said that a team of doctors was also sent to Kiran’s house in Khairwal village to check on her health. “The doctors found her medical condition to be absolutely normal. No side-effect was reported either,” he said.When asked about the matter, district collector Peeyush Samariya concurred with the CMHO and said the woman was only given the first dose of the vaccine.Dr Raman Sharma, a senior professor at the SMS medical college and the hospital said that usually there is no major side effect even if both doses were to be given in a single day.“During the phase two of the vaccination trials, this possibility is also tested. And there is normally no side effect,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/jaipur-news/rajasthan-woman-claims-receiving-two-jabs-of-vaccine-on-same-day-doctors-deny-101622287050939.html

The orders regarding the same shall be issued by respective District Collectors,” the Chief Minister said via a tweet. The announcement, while on expected lines - owing to Goa’s high positivity rate, which stands at over 20% despite having fallen from over 50% a few weeks ago - comes amid growing resentment among traders, especially those miffed at having to keep their businesses shut for what was intended to be a two-week curfew but will now last a total of four weeks. Under Goa’s ‘curfew’ rules only essentials and alcohol will be sold between 7 am and 1 pm while vehicle repair shops, hardware stores, etc, are allowed to remain open. Restaurants are allowed to open only for takeaways. Goa is recording more than 1,000 Covid-19 cases each day which is way off the gnarly 4,000 cases it was recording toward the peak in mid-May.

Now essential shops will remain open from 7 am-11 am for all seven days,” he said.“The situation in Pune is satisfactory. There is a declining curve in Pune and cases are decreasing. Compared to last week the cases have reduced this week. But the positivity of Pune is still above the state average,” Tope said.“The situation is not the same in all the state. At least 18 districts have higher average positivity than the state. Considering all the factors a decision will be taken by the chief minister and the guidelines will be issued. As the cases are dropping it is understandable for traders to make demands, but the situation is not the same throughout the state,” said Ajit Pawar, deputy chief minister and Pune district guardian minister.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/weekend-restrictions-on-essential-services-eased-in-pune-101622286091329.html
29-05-2021||Pune||SSC exams: Mixed reactions to evaluation criteria by state||The state government’s decision to declare Secondary School Certificate (SSC) results based on evaluation criteria saw mixed reactions from various stakeholders.On Friday, the state government announced the evaluation criteria for the state board students of Class 10, the examinations of which have been cancelled this year due to the pandemic.Varsha Gaikwad, state school education minister, said, all students who were to appear for Class 10 exams will be promoted, and marks will be given on the basis of the internal assessment of their performance this year and that of Class 9.Shruti Mehta, a Class 10 student, said, “The decision to cancel the exams is not right, as we had put in a lot of hard work and prepared for the examination and were hoping to get good marks.”“I had got fewer marks in Class 9 exams and if I get assessed on those numbers then obviously I would get fewer marks in Class 10. This will impact on my further Class 11 admissions, so exams should be conducted,” she said.Another student Devaj Padhye said, “More than conducting the exams safety of students is more important during such health crisis. It is good that the state government has cancelled the exams, the only concern is that our assessment of marks should be done properly.”Last month the state government declared to cancel the Class 10 exams due to the increase in the number of Covid cases. After which a petition was filed at the Bombay High Court by professor Dhananjay Kulkarni challenging the Maharashtra government’s decision to cancel the board exams.“The decision declared today by the state education minister to cancel the Class 10 exams and through internal assessment method results will be declared doesn’t have exact clarification. It has again created confusion among the students. There are several unanswered questions and it will impact the career of students,” said Kulkarni.“On one hand state government is planning to carry out result process through internal marks assessment, then will conduct Common Entrance Test (CET) for Class 11 admissions and if any student is not satisfied with his/her results then a separate examination will be conducted for those students once Covid cases are in control. This entire process is all uncertain and this case is in HC now,” said Kulkarni.Bandopant Bhuyar, state president of Coaching Classes Teachers Federation and Social Forum of Maharashtra State, said, “The state government has backed off from their responsibility and simply cancelled the Class 10 exams. The evaluation criteria are baseless, and we strongly oppose this decision.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/ssc-exams-mixed-reactions-to-evaluation-criteria-by-state-101622285910904.html
29-05-2021||Pune||All private hospital Covid bills will be audited, says Rajesh Tope||The bills of Covid-19 treatment at all private hospitals will be audited said state health minister Rajesh Tope. He was speaking at Council Hall after conducting the weekly Covid-19 review meeting for the Pune district.He said that instructions have been given to the concerned officials to appoint auditors for every hospital and bills will be audited irrespective of the amount.“Until now, an audit was done of the bills which were above Rs1.5 lakh. Now, every bill of Covid-19 treatment will be audited. Many hospitals break up the bills into multiple parts with small amounts. This should not be done. For every hospital a separate auditor should be assigned by the administration,” he said.Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) has been conducting pre-audits and the post-audits of bills worth ₹1.5 lakh or more at private hospitals. The civic body has also appointed official persons in the private hospitals to check the bills in this range. Whereas, Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC) had appointed a team of auditors to check the excessive bill amounts.Tope added that efforts are being taken by the charity commissioner and district administration to add more private hospitals such as Ruby Hall, Jehangir Hospital under Mahatma Jyotiba Phule Jan Arogya Yojana for the treatment of mucormycosis or black fungus.“We have instructed the administration to bring more private hospitals under the scheme which are treating mucormycosis patients. There is a cover of 1.5 lakh, but there should not be any upper limit for the treatment. Medicines will be given free and the rest of the treatment cost will be paid by the government,” he said.Tope announced that the corporates will be asked to vaccinate their staff by tying up with private hospitals. “Industries should vaccinate their staff and the workers at their expense by tying up with a private hospital. They should take this responsibility of vaccinating the staff,” he said.On the complaints of different rates charged by private hospitals for vaccination Tope clarified that the state government does not have direct control over it.“Many MLAs said that the vaccine prices should be capped. The Government of India has allotted 25 per cent to private hospitals. They are procuring on their own and vaccinating people. But I would like to ask these private hospitals to keep affordable rates for vaccines,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/all-private-hospital-covid-bills-will-be-audited-says-rajesh-tope-101622285490807.html

29-05-2021||Pune||Industries, private hospitals in Pimpri-Chinchwad await vaccine supply||The Covid-19 vaccination drive is yet to pick up the pace at corporate offices and private hospitals in Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC) due to the non-availability of doses. Industries are waiting to get doses from the civic administration, while private hospitals have placed their demands but are awaiting a response from the Serum Institute of India (SII).On April 11, the government allowed to hold vaccination camps at corporate campuses, and all private stakeholders in Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC), Pimpri Chinchwad and rural Pune had shown keen interest in conducting the drive. However, with the shortage of doses, many people between the 18-45 age group are waiting to get the jabs.Prashant Girbane, director-general, Mahratta Chamber of Commerce, Industries and Agriculture (MCCIA), said, “Most companies are ready to conduct the vaccination camps, but things did not pick up as we were expecting. The civic bodies have provided us full-fledged support, but due to the unavailability of doses, the drive has slowed down. All the companies are ready to invest in vaccination drives as they want their employees to be safe.”In Pimpri Chinchwad, so far, 7,0597, people in the 18-45 age group have got the jabs. With the shortage of doses, the civic body is only providing doses of Covaxin and Covishield to those in the 45+ age group.As Covishield doses were available on Friday, PCMC conducted vaccination drive at 65 centres.Abhay Bhor, president of Forum of Small Scale Industries Association, said, “Our association will be conducting ‘vaccination on wheels’ at 8,000 companies. Our team of doctors and management staff are on standby and we have put our demands of doses before PCMC. Due to shortage, they are not able to provide doses.”“As 70 per cent of the population working in the industries fall in the 18 -45 age group all the industries have registered their employees’ names with us. Once the supply of doses starts, we will start the drive in the industrial area,” added Bhor.A few PMC residents who travel to the industrial town have already taken jabs after the vaccination drive started at the private hospitals.Sumant Jha, a resident of Kothrud who works in MIDC Bhosari, said, “I got myself vaccinated at a private hospital on Dhole Patil road. We were told that a drive will be conducted in the industry campus, but it is on halt due to non-availability of doses.”Meanwhile, private hospitals in PMC limits are getting a good response to vaccination drive for the 18-45 age group, and so many private hospitals from PCMC have also approached SII to supply doses.“We have placed the order of 3,000 doses with SII, we are yet to receive them. We also had a plan to conduct vaccination camps in the various housing societies, but we have put it on halt after the direction from the civic administration,” said Dr Sapana Sagare, Lifepoint Multispeciality Hospital, Wakad.“Our hospital has asked for 10,000 doses from SII, once we receive some number of doses then drive will start on priority,” said Dr Parag Hatnaikar, Orion Hospital, Wakad.Tejaswini Sawai, chairperson, Pimpri-Chinchwad Cooperative Housing Societies Federation, said, “Vaccination at private hospitals will help increase the outreach.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/industries-private-hospitals-in-pimpri-chinchwad-await-vaccine-supply-101622285071157.html
29-05-2021||Kolkata||Four charred bodies recovered from gutted West Bengal factory||Four charred bodies were recovered from a factory gutted in West Bengal’s North 24 Parganas near Kolkata on Saturday after the flames, which raging since early Thursday, were finally doused.At least four people, all security guards at the factory, remained untraceable after the fire broke out. Their mobiles were found to be switched off and their bicycles were also found to be damaged by the fire. Police said the bodies recovered probably belong to the guards. On Saturday morning, when police and fire brigade personnel finally managed to enter the factory, they recovered the bodies from a staircase that led to the terrace. The door of the terrace was locked. The four are believed to have tried to reach the terrace to escape when the fire broke out. But as the door was locked, they got trapped. “We had an apprehension that the four persons, who were missing, might have been trapped. The family members would identify the bodies and then the state government would... help them in every possible way,” said Sujit Bose, a state minister. A complaint against the owner of the factory has been lodged by a family member of one of the four. A forensic team and structural engineers would visit the building on Sunday. “Four charred bodies have been recovered. The family members of the persons who were reported missing have been called for identification,” said a police officer, who did not want to be named. The fire broke out in a garment factory at Bilkanda, an industrial estate in New Barrackpore, in the early hours of Thursday. At least 17 fire tenders were pressed into action. The efforts to douse it continued for over two days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/four-charred-bodies-recovered-from-gutted-west-bengal-factory-101622284470550.html

29-05-2021||Kolkata||‘Is it because we have won by a landslide?’: Mamata asks after row over skipping meeting with PM||West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee on Saturday said she has been hurt by the continuous insults hurled at her by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) following her meeting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi to review the damage caused by Cyclone Yaas in her state. Mamata also said that Bengal chief secretary Alapan Bandhopadhyay was recalled by the Centre as the BJP could not digest the landslide victory secured by the Trinamool Congress (TMC) in the recently-concluded assembly elections. She also charged Prime Minister Narendra Modi of creating “confusion and confrontation” every time he visited Bengal.Mamata’s comments came a day after a political controversy erupted as several Union ministers and BJP leaders slammed the Bengal chief minister for making PM Modi wait during a meeting and then leaving minutes after giving him a report on the impact of the damage caused by Cyclone Yaas, which hit the state and neighbouring Odisha on Wednesday. On her part, Mamata said he took the Prime Minister’s permission before leaving.Mamata harshly criticised the BJP and said that a one-sided story has been peddled regarding her absence from the review meet. "The meeting was supposed to be held between the Prime Minister and the chief ministers of the states affected. I had to wait for a very long time and despite that, I met the Prime Minister and I did take his permission before leaving," she said."The plans were changed and the meeting now had the leader of the opposition, MLAs from the BJP. I want to ask the PM that when he visited Gujarat last week did he call the leader of opposition in that state for the meeting. Every time the PM visits Bengal why is there such confrontation and confusion. Why should I sit in the meeting when there are political parties who are not entitled to be a part of that meeting present there?" Banerjee asked during a press conference at Nabanna, the state secretariat.Mamata Banerjee said that the Centre was humiliating her and she is ready to beg at the Prime Minister's feet but demanded that this political vendetta should stop. Defending Alapan Bandopadhyay, Mamata Banerjee said that the chief secretary has no fault and it was improper to treat him in this manner despite his service to the nation as well as Bengal."Do you have any courtesy? (You have recalled him on) on his last day?" Mamata Banerjee asked. She also said that the BJP is unable to accept its defeat in Bengal. "You are not only disturbing me, but you are also disturbing my secretariat. Why are you behaving like this? We have won by a landslide. Is that your worry?" Banerjee slammed the Centre.Alapan Bandopadhyay, a 1987-batch IAS officer of West Bengal cadre, due to retire on May 31 got an extension due to his experience in handling the Covid-19 pandemic in Bengal. His transfer order on late Saturday evening led to a war of words between the BJP and the TMC.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/is-it-because-we-have-won-by-a-landslide-mamata-asks-bjp-101622282283013.html

29-05-2021||Other||Hyderabad couple raises ₹16 cr for son battling rare disease||In a record of sorts, a Hyderabad-based couple mobilised ₹16 crore in three-and-a-half months from 65,000 donors through crowd-funding to buy medicine, supposed to be the world’s costliest, for treating their three-year-old son suffering from a rare disease called Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA), HT has learnt.Yogesh Gupta from Chhattisgarh, who has been working in a private firm in Hyderabad for the last 10 years, and his wife Rupal Gupta, were clueless when the doctors at Rainbow Children’s Hospital in the city told them that the only way to save their son Ayaansh was to procure Zolgensma - the only medicine that can cure SMA.“When we made enquiries, we came to know that Zolgensma, manufactured by Novartis, costs around ₹16 crore and has to be imported from the USA or the European countries. Added to this, one has to pay import duty and GST on the medicine,” Gupta told HT.The couple tried a few options to mobilise money for the medicine but realised that they won’t be able to do it because it was too huge a sum. “But my wife was confident that we could definitely raise the money. She was reading about fund-raising or crowd-funding campaigns that regularly take place in countries like the USA and the UK. So, she suggested we too could start such a campaign,” Gupta said.On February 4, the couple posted a request on social media platforms and began the campaign. “Our friends, about 150 of them, also pitched in and made the campaign viral. The response was overwhelming. Though the flow of funds slowed down a bit later, we did not give up hope. Our friends intensified the campaign and finally, by May 23, we could mobilise all the money we required for our son’s treatment. We closed the campaign on the same day,” Gupta said.He said nearly 65,000 donors responded to the fund-raising campaign and donated money in small or big amounts. The donors included celebrities like Indian cricket captain Virat Kohli actors Anushka Sharma, Emraan Hashmi, Dia Miza, Javeed Jaafri, Rajkumar Rao, Arjun Kapoor, Sara Ali Khan, among others.“We have completed all the required documentation and placed the order with the US firm for the purchase of the medicine. We are expecting it to be delivered by June 10. We are thankful to everyone, the donors and our friends who made relentless efforts to mobilise money to save my son,” Gupta said.Their son, Ayaansh, who turned three on Thursday, showed the signs of the rare disease when he was just six months old. “He had very limited movement of his muscles. He couldn’t even cough and when there was congestion in his chest, we had to use a suction pump to remove phlegm from his lungs,” Gupta said.The couple took the child to various doctors, including paediatricians and neuro-physicians. “Though they diagnosed it as Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA), they had no idea about the treatment. They told me it is a progressive disease and my son might not survive beyond four years,” he said.Luckily, Ayaansh can speak and that was the only solace for the couple. “Finally, the doctors at Rainbow Hospital in Hyderabad recommended this drug and said it was available abroad. That raised our hopes,” Gupta said.The couple is now trying for exemption of the import duty and GST on Zolgensma.On March 17, Ayaansh’s issue was raised in the Rajya Sabha by a Congress member from Madhya Pradesh Vivek K Tankha.Replying to his query, finance minister Nirmala Sitaraman said imported life-saving drugs, including those for SMA for personal use, are exempted from basic customs duty but they attract five per cent GST. She, however, assured that ad hoc exemption from GST on imported life-saving drugs could be given on a case-to-case basis during exceptional nature.“We have made the request for exemption of the GST as well and are hopeful of getting the approval by next week,” Gupta added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/hyderabad-couple-mobilises-rs-16-cr-for-son-battling-rare-disease-101622279790167.html

29-05-2021||Mumbai||‘High prevalence of antibodies among Dharavi residents prevented surge in Covid-19 cases’: Study||There has been no surge in Covid-19 cases in Mumbai’s densely populated Dharavi, a slum of at least 850,000 people with a population density of 354,167 per square km, during the second wave of the pandemic because of the high prevalence of antibodies from natural infections among residents, said a research paper published in European Journal of Medical and Health Sciences on Saturday.Only seven cases were being reported per million population in Dharavi in April. It was the time when Maharashtra was reporting 507 cases per million and India 257 cases per million as the second wave overwhelmed hospitals and triggered a shortage of medical supplies and hospital beds.Last May, Dharavi was a hotspot of infections reporting 48 cases per million on average. Up to 80 cases per million were reported on some days last year when India was reporting only 1 to 3 cases per million.Researchers said there is high seropositivity in Dharavi. The first round of serosurvey in the area in July 2020 found seropositivity of 57% there. This reduced to 45% in the October round of the survey, which the researchers have attributed to diminishing levels of antibodies. “The serosurvey conducted in October 2020 for Cuffe Parade slums showed the antibodies presence in 75% population.

29-05-2021||Delhi||Delhi police opposes businessman Navneet Kalra's bail plea in Court||A Delhi Court on Saturday heard the bail plea of businessman Navneet Kalra, in connection with a case relating to the alleged hoarding of oxygen concentrators in which Additional Public Prosecutor Atul Shrivastava submitted that Kalra and other co-accused have tampered with the evidence.The Delhi police have opposed the bail plea of Kalra in the Court.Mentioning the AIIMS report, Shrivastava said, "Oxygen concentrator was neither premium nor of Germany. The concentrator may not be suitable for use of Covid-19 patients. Oxygen concentrators are useless."Denying the fact that Kalra was doing charity, Prosecutor Shrivastava submitted that charity is not done for money and Kalra was not doing charity."Had he sold it at a cost price, it would have been charity. But they sold it at a much higher price," he pointed out.The Delhi Court noted that Oxygen Concentrator has no margins fixed on cost.To this, Shrivastava said that the government has liberalised the policy for 'needy persons' and not for 'greedy persons'.The Prosecutor stated, "Their intention was to cheat and make a profit and this is a white-collar crime. They have also tampered with evidence and other co accused are not yet to be arrested and police have served them notice."The Prosecutor urged the court to reject Kalra's bail plea.Earlier, the court had dismissed the Delhi Police's plea seeking five days police custody of Navneet Kalra in connection with a case relating to the alleged hoarding of oxygen concentrators in some restaurant in South Delhi.Kalra was arrested after Delhi Police has registered a case under various offenses dealing with cheating, disobedience to order promulgated by a public servant, criminal conspiracy, and violating provisions of Essential Commodities Act, 1955 followed by seizing of oxygen concentrators from restaurants in South Delhi.The police have busted an alleged oxygen concentrators black-marketing racket during a raid and recovered 105 concentrators from two upscale restaurants in the Khan Market area.

The decision was taken at a meeting of representatives of various tea bodies, including Assam Chah Mazdoor Sangha, with chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma in Guwahati. As per the move, workers in the Brahmaputra Valley region of the state who were getting ₹167 daily as wages would now get ₹205. The daily wage of workers in Barak Valley would be hiked from ₹145 to ₹183. In February this year, ahead of the assembly polls in the state, the previous BJP government had hiked daily wages of tea-garden workers by ₹50 taking it to ₹217 in Brahmaputra Valley and ₹195 in Barak Valley. The move was stayed by the Gauhati High Court in March following a petition by the Indian Tea Association, the biggest organization of tea producers in India, and 17 others. The new government committed that it would increase the wages by another ₹12, taking it to ₹217 in Brahmaputra Valley and ₹195 in Barak Valley, as done vide the earlier order, after consulting all stakeholders. The promise of the hike in the daily wages of tea-garden workers was an important poll issue in Assam this time. While the BJP proposed an additional ₹101 for daily ration taking it to ₹318 in Brahmaputra Valley, the Congress had promised to hike the daily wages to ₹365 if they came to power.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/assam-govt-decides-to-increase-daily-wage-of-tea-garden-workers-by-rs-38-101622274869698.html

Titled Show for Cause, this event, scheduled for May 30, will have performances by students of across DU and even some artistes from Delhi-NCR. The two hour event, which is set to start at 6pm, will have around a dozen young performers who are keen to do their bit to support Covid relief work. The entry fee to the event is ₹100, but people can donate in excess, as per their choice. Post donation, an online link to the fundraiser will be shared with those attending the show. “Youngsters from DU and a few other performers will present songs, poetry and dance at the event. The proceeds from this will go to distribution of ration kits to children and street vendors in North Campus who have lost their livelihoods, which we will personally undertake. Those attending can also donate to AeSha for Friendships Foundation, which is catering to the needs of single mothers and women waste pickers in north east Delhi, New Seemapuri and Bhati Mines,” says Paripoorna Baxi, a student of Kirori Mal College, who heads the Girl Up – It’s Time, the Delhi chapter of the UN Foundation initiative Girl Up, which is organising this e-meet.Kashish Soni, a student of Lady Shri Ram College, who is looking forward to performing her original compositions on her ukulele and guitar, says, “In these rather difficult Covid-19 circumstances, being able to use my music to support fundraisers and help people in need has brought me close to my music, and has allowed me to contribute my tiny bit, alongside other artists from so many different backgrounds. It is a humbling experience.” “As a professional classical dancer, I have always believed that art spreads happiness and peace, but more than anything, brings one out of their ignorance,” says Annaika Ahuja, another performer at the event, adding, “Being a dancer is synonymous to who I am, my true identity. And I’m pleased to be a part of this initiative by GirlUp, raising not just funds but spreading joy and the magic of art in such dark times. I am grateful that I can showcase a piece of our culture through my performance, and I hope India will recover and stand tall, once again!” Baxi adds: “The major brunt of the pandemic has been taken by the poor, who have lost their livelihoods and have no way of providing for themselves or their families.

29-05-2021||Delhi||Navneet Kalra committed white-collar crime: Delhi Police to court in oxygen concentrator black marketing case||Businessman Navneet Kalra, accused in a oxygen concentrator black marketing case, committed a white-collar crime and earned profits by selling medical devices at exorbitant prices to those on death beds, the Delhi Police told a court on Saturday.During a recent raid, 524 oxygen concentrators, which are crucial medical equipment used for Covid-19 patients, were recovered from Khan Chacha, Town Hall, and Nege & Ju restaurants owned by Kalra. The restaurateur is in judicial custody till June 3.Chief Metropolitan Magistrate Arun Kumar Garg heard the bail application filed by the businessman who was arrested on May 17 for allegedly hoarding oxygen concentrators and selling them at inflated prices."His intention was to cheat people and make profit. This is a white-collar crime. He sold oxygen concentrators to needy people lying on death beds," additional public prosecutor Atul Shrivastava, representing the Delhi Police, told the court and sought rejection of Kalra's bail plea.The remarks by the Delhi Police come a day after Kalra, through senior advocate Vikas Pahwa, told the court that he had no criminal intent to cheat people and cannot be kept in pre-trial detention.During the course of the proceedings on Saturday, the prosecutor showed Kalra's oxygen concentrator brochures to the court, and said they were not premium or from Germany as claimed by the accused."Its flow was also below 35 per cent, and he sold it for more than ₹70,000 as against the MRP of ₹27,999," he added.On Kalra's contentions that he was merely helping those in need, the prosecutor said, "He was not doing any charity. If he had sold them at the cost price, it would have been a charity but he took a margin."The police further relied on a report by the Sriram Institute for Industrial Research on the oxygen concentrators' efficacy and submissions of doctors from the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS).Shrivastava said the doctors opined that the oxygen concentrators were not suitable for treatment of Covid-19 patients due to their low efficacy."It is useless and as good as a box. Using them for even mild and moderate patients would cause harm. It will accelerate death," the additional public prosecutor said.He further apprised the court about the gravity of the offence and sought rejection of bail on the grounds that the businessman tampered with evidence, deleted material from the device and gave a bad name to the society.The police have claimed that the concentrators were imported from China and were being sold at an exorbitant price of ₹50,000 to 70,000 a piece against its cost of ₹16,000 to ₹22,000.On May 5, a case was registered against Kalra under sections 420 (cheating), 188 (disobedience to order promulgated by public servant), 120-B (criminal conspiracy) and 34 (common intention) of the Indian Penal Code, the Essential Commodities Act and the Epidemic Diseases Act.The Enforcement Directorate (ED) has also registered a money laundering case against him.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/navneet-kalra-committed-white-collar-crime-delhi-police-to-court-in-o2-concentrator-black-marketing-case-101622272964827.html
29-05-2021||Mumbai||Petrol price in Mumbai crosses ₹100 per litre, fuel rates rise for 15th time||Petrol price crossed ₹100 per litre-mark in Mumbai on Saturday as state-run retailers raised fuel rates for the fifteenth time in 26 days, raising petrol rates by 26 paise per litre and diesel by 28 paise.The latest hike made petrol ₹3.54 a litre costlier and diesel ₹4.16 since May 4, a day after the results of the five assembly polls was declared.While prices of auto fuels are at record levels across the country, diesel is currently sold at ₹92.17 a litre in the financial capital, the highest among metro cities. Pump prices of petrol and diesel in Delhi on Saturday also made a new record of ₹93.94 per litre and ₹84.89 a litre, respectively.While fuel rates in Delhi are the benchmark for the entire country, retail prices of the two fuels differ from place to place because of variations in state taxes and local levies.Consumers in several cities, particularly in states like Rajasthan, Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh, are paying more than ₹100 for one litre of petrol. Some of the cities selling fuel over ₹100 per litre are Ratnagiri, Parbhani, Aurangabad, Indore, Bhopal, Gwalior, Jaisalmer, Ganganagar and Banswara.Surging international oil rates and exorbitant domestic tax structure are two key reasons for high rates of petrol and diesel in pumps. Benchmark Brent crude rose marginally by 0.24% to $69.63 a barrel on Friday. Indian fuel retailers align pump prices of petrol and diesel with their international benchmark rates of the previous day. Even as international oil prices saw both upward and downward movements this month, pump rates of fuels in India moved only in the upward direction.Pump prices of fuels are also high because of taxes. In Delhi, central levies account for 35.5% of petrol’s price and state taxes, 23%, according to official data of May 16. On diesel, central taxes are over 38.2% while state taxes are about 14.6%. Through 2020, as global crude prices fell, the central government raised excise duty on the fuel to shore up its finances. States too followed suit -- with revenues hit on account of the pandemic.According to executives working in state-run oil marketing companies, pump prices are also high because companies were recovering their past revenue losses like the one suffered for 66 days since February 27 when rates were not raised because of assembly elections in four states and one Union territory.During the 66-day pause on the rate hike, state-run retailers had also reduced petrol and diesel rates by 77 paise and 74 paise a litre, respectively in four small steps. But, the entire gains to the consumers were quickly reversed in the first four consecutive rounds of rate hikes starting from May 4.The government deregulated the pricing of petrol on June 26, 2010, and diesel on October 19, 2014. Accordingly, state-run retailers are free to change pump prices every day. Public sector retailers — IOC, Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd (BPCL) and Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Ltd (HPCL)— control almost 90% of the domestic fuel retail market.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/petrol-price-in-mumbai-crosses-rs-100-per-litre-fuel-rates-rise-for-15th-time-101622272859047.html

The highest number of cubs was spotted in Bandhavgarh Tiger Reserve (41) followed by Kanha Tiger Reserve (20) and Pench Tiger Reserve (13). Principal chief conservator of forest (PCCF), wildlife, Alok Kumar said, “It is good news that the population of cubs has been increased in the past 11 months. The counting of cubs was done by field officers posted at different tiger reserves.” He added the Bandhavgarh Tiger Reserve is still the best habitat for tigers in Madhya Pradesh. “As many as 124 tigers are already residing in Bandhavgarh Tiger Reserve (BTR) in Umaria. After BTR, Kanha is one of the finest tiger reserves in India.”Kumar said their teams are closely monitoring the movement of cubs and their health. According to the details of a census released in 2018, Madhya Pradesh had the highest tiger population in India--526--followed by Karnataka (524). Wildlife activist Ajay Dubey said the state government was not doing much for space management in the reserves. “The human-animal conflict at Kanha and BTR has increased in the past few years which resulted in many tigers dying of electrocution after they came in contact with live electric wire laid by villagers. Many reports of the forest department suggested that BTR and Kanha Tiger Reserves do not have enough space for tigers. The tigers are moving out in a search of their territory and dying.”...||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bhopal-news/125-tiger-cubs-spotted-in-madhya-pradesh-over-last-11-months-101622270789503.html

29-05-2021||Ranchi||Jharkhand sends letter to Centre seeking rectification of vaccine wastage data||At loggerheads with the Centre over vaccine wastage data, the Jharkhand government has shot off a letter to the union government seeking rectification of wastage figures, saying CoWIN portal till May 27 erroneously showed state's wastage data at "38.45 per cent",a top official said on Friday. The state sent the letter on Thursday night to set the record right close on the heels of Chief Minister Hemant Soren trashing the centre's vaccine wastage data for Jharkhand. "If wastage figures are rectified on the basis of data attached with the letter sent by us to the centre, the wastage figure will come below 4.63 per cent," A Dodde, state's nodal office for vaccination told PTI, Union Health Ministry in a statement on May 25 had said despite urging states repeatedly to keep vaccine wastage below 1 per cent, many states such as Jharkhand (37.3 pc) were reporting much higher wastage than the national average (6.3 pc). In return, Jharkhand had contested, saying it is wrong to project vaccine wastage proportion is as high as 37.3 per cent in the state whereas the fact remained that it is much below the national average and currently stands at 4.63 per cent. Chief minister Soren had lashed out at the centre, saying how can one imagine that Jharkhand will allow its "suraksha kavach" (protective gear) to go waste? CoWIN portal developed by the central government for the vaccination programme displays the vaccine wastage data for Jharkhand at 38.45 per cent till May 27. "Jharkhand's total wastage of doses is projected as 38.45 per cent on CoWIN portal till May 27...A list of session sites with actual data is attached with the letter so that after rectification of CoWIN portal correct status could be projected," Project Director, National Health Mission wrote to the Health and Family Welfare Ministry on May 27 night. A review at state level assessed that human errors and typo by certain vaccinators in the course of data entry on CoWIN portal combined with certain glitches during wastage calculation on CoWIN software resulted in portrayal of higher wastage than actual, the letter mentioned. "Whereas states have been urged repeatedly to keep vaccine wastage below 1 per cent, many states such as Jharkhand (37.3 pc), Chhattisgarh (30.2 pc), Tamil Nadu (15.5 pc), Jammu and Kashmir (10.8 pc), Madhya Pradesh (10.7 pc) are reporting much higher wastage than the national average (6.3 pc)," the union health ministry had said on Tuesday. Meanwhile, retweeting his party Jharkhand Mukti Morcha's (JMM) tweet, Soren said only 48 lakh vaccine jabs have been made available to the state against 3.25 crore eligible population while Gujarat could get 1.62 crore jabs so far for 6.2 crore population. Chattissgarh too has rejected the centre's claim about high vaccine wastage claiming wastage of COVID-19 shots below one per cent in the state. The union government created CoWIN portal and said all immunisations will be part of the National Vaccination Programme and it will be captured on CoWIN platform along with stocks and price per vaccination applicable in all inoculation centres. The platform sees immunization management and reporting. Contining with his tirade against the union government on vaccination issue, Soren has slammed the centre for "launching vaccination drive without preparedness". Soren Thursday said the state is facing an acute shortage of vaccines with jabs for 18-44 age group almost over and hardly two to three days vaccines left for the people above the age of 45 years. Accusing the centre of "no transparency in vaccine allocation", he said under the circumstance he was left with no other option than to appeal to the companies operating in the state to come forward for vaccination of communities in their areas. "We are facing acute shortages of vaccines. The vaccine stock for the 18-44 age group is almost over and there is hardly two to three days stock for people above 45 years."We have raised the demand for vaccines but there is no clarity...There is no transparency in vaccine allocation," Soren had said. Earlier,opposition BJP had attacked the JMM-Congress-RJD coalition government and sought to know as who is responsible for such a high wastage of vaccine in the state. Asserting how can a state allow about 18 lakh of doses go waste, Soren had said it was explained to the centre that poor connectivity in forest areas and lack of network issues are behind slow updation of data. "However, the centre seems hell-bent to project things in a poor light which is causing problem to poor states like Jharkhand. This is why the state had gone to the Supreme Court for allowing its platform for vaccination," Soren had said. Officials had said total vaccines supplied to all districts was 48.63 lakh while total vaccines utilised was 40.12 lakh and the wastage percentage comes to 4.63 per cent. The state had said it had 6.56 lakh doses of vaccines available with it. Fearing exclusion of a large chunk of the tribal people in the ongoing vaccination drive against Covid-19 due to non- availability of smartphones among many of them and access to internet in remote areas, the Jharkhand government had earlier filed a plea with the Supreme Court for directions to use its own "more user-friendly" JHAR-WIN app for registration.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ranchi-news/jharkhand-sends-letter-to-centre-seeking-rectification-of-vaccine-wastage-data-101622269064724.html

The technical bid will open at 11.30 am and the price bid by 5 pm on that day.The bids have been invited from the world’s leading vaccine manufacturers and they have been offered advance payment of 30 per cent of the value of each purchase order. The OSMCL expects 75 lakh doses in 30 days of the purchase order, 2.25 crore doses within 60 days, 3.75 crore doses by 90 days and 3.8 crore doses by 120 days.To facilitate the participation of vaccine manufacturers, the state government recently revised storage conditions up to minus 20 degree Celsius, subject to the condition that the vaccines will remain stable and maintain their potency at 2 degree Celsius to 8 degree Celsius for at least 12 hours.Though it was previously stipulated that 50 per cent of the total tender quantity would be allocated to the lowest bidder and the balance 50 per cent to be split among the second, third and fourth lowest bidders and so on at negotiated rates, the revised terms and conditions allows a potential bidder to apply for any quantity.The OSMCL has offered advance payment of 30 per cent of the value of each purchase order. It expects 75 lakh doses in 30 days of the purchase order, 2.25 crore doses within 60 days, 3.75 crore doses by 90 days and 3.8 crore doses by 120 days.Odisha’s additional chief secretary of health PK Mohapatra said it would be difficult to tell how many companies have bid for Odisha’s global tender so far as the NIC portal does not allow that.Odisha’s global tender comes in the wake of the failure of Maharashtra in getting any response from original vaccine manufacturers for its similar offers. While Maharashtra received responses from eight companies, none of them are vaccine manufacturers.Doubts are being expressed over Odisha getting any offer from vaccine manufacturers as existing ones like the Serum Institute of India and Bharat Biotech are struggling to supply vaccines to the Centre. Meanwhile, Dr Reddy’s Laboratories, which would distribute Sputnik V vaccines in India, said it has not authorised any third party to supply the Sputnik V Covid-19 vaccine on its behalf in India.“Dr Reddy’s Laboratories is the brand custodian of the Sputnik V vaccine in India and has the sole distribution rights of the first 250 million doses (first and second dose components included) of the vaccine in India,” the pharma major and Russian Direct Investment Fund(RDIF) said in a joint statement.Till May 28, Odisha managed to vaccinate 74,99,728 people, around 20 per cent of its total number of people who are eligible for vaccination. Odisha has now 9.66 lakh doses of vaccines left.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/odisha-extends-deadline-for-its-global-tender-for-covid-19-vaccines-101622266168936.html
29-05-2021||Delhi||Capital adds 1,141 Covid cases, positivity rate stays below 2%||The Capital on Friday recorded 1,141 new infections of Covid-19 and 139 more deaths, with the positivity rate remaining low at 1.6%, as city’s numbers continued its downward trend.This is the third consecutive day when the cases have remained below the 1,500 mark. With this, the seven-day average of new cases in the Capital, a statistic that denotes a region’s Covid curve, dropped to 1,533 cases a day the lowest in nearly two months, or since March 30 – highlighting Delhi’s remarkable turnaround from the massive fourth wave of infections.At its peak a little over a month ago, the seven-day average of new cases soared to a peak of 25,294 a day.As per the Delhi government’s health bulletin on Friday, there were 1,141 fresh cases detected in the past 24 hours from the 71,853 samples tested in the city, taking the total number of confirmed infections to 1,423,690. A total of 139 new deaths pushed the death toll from the deadly virus in the city to 23,951.On Thursday, 1,072 cases and 117 deaths were recorded, while the positivity rate had dipped to 1.5%. On Friday, the positivity rate stood at 1.6%. The test positivity rate had soared to 36% in the last week of April, coming down to around 1.5% now.Positivity rate is a crucial metric as experts say it shows how widespread the virus is in the community, and when a dropping positivity rate is coupled with decreasing new cases, it indicates that the spread of the virus is reducing within the community. Tracking a region’s positivity rate serves as a good barometer for whether cases are going to increase or decrease in the coming days.The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that the positivity rate from a region that has a comprehensive testing programme be at or below 5% for at least two weeks before it can be considered that the outbreak is under control. In Delhi, this number has been below the threshold for eight days now.With a view on dropping cases, Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Friday said it was time to start the unlock process, but warned that if the coronavirus cases start rising again, “we will have to stop the unlock exercise”, and appealed to people not to step out unless it is absolutely necessary.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/capital-adds-1-141-covid-cases-positivity-rate-stays-below-2-101622249958570.html
29-05-2021||Lucknow||Hooch tragedy: At least 12 dead in Aligarh, four held||At least 12 people died and 14 took ill in three villages in Uttar Pradesh’s Aligarh district after allegedly having spurious liquor bought from two government-authorised alcohol shops on Friday, a senior official said. Four people, including a vendor, manager, salesman and helper, were arrested in Karsua village while three officials of the excise department were suspended for laxity leading to such a tragedy. Aligarh district magistrate Chandra Bhushan Singh said a police team has been constituted to nab those involved in supplying the liquor. He said two liquor shops of the same licensee in Kursua and Andla villages were sealed as those who died purchased alcohol from there. “All the accused have been booked under Gangster Act and National Security Act (NSA) will be invoked against them,” Aligarh superintendent of police Kalanidhi Nathani said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/hooch-tragedy-at-least-12-dead-in-aligarh-four-held-101622249183182.html

The monoclonal antibodies attach with the spike protein of the Sars-CoV-2 virus that causes Covid-19 and prevent the entry of the virus into the human cell.The therapy is administered to those at high risk of developing severe disease before the disease progresses on from mild or moderate category with no need for oxygen support. “The treatment is administered so that those at a high risk of developing severe disease and of mortality do not progress to that stage,” said Dr Rajesh Chawala of Indraprastha Apollo hospital.The therapy should not be administered to those who have a history of allergies or those who are dependent on oxygen because of other lung diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/covid19-65-yr-old-is-first-to-get-antibody-cocktail-therapy-101622246709333.html
29-05-2021||Delhi||IIT-D study on oxygen submitted to Delhi HC||The Delhi high court on Friday asked the state government to implement the recommendations of a study by IIT-Delhi to streamline the oxygen supply chain in the capital. The study was commissioned by the Delhi government on the suggestions of the court on May 5, to prepare for a possible third wave of Covid-19. Delhi government standing counsel (civil) Satyakam submitted the report to the high court on Friday.The report, curated by IIT-Delhi’s Professor Sanjay Dhir, is based on information provided by the Delhi government on various aspects of the issue. It illustrates nine challenges that the Delhi government has to overcome in order to improve the oxygen infrastructure in the Capital -- oxygen storage capacity, supply of oxygen from outside Delhi, GNCTD IT portal for oxygen management & ICCC (Delhi) dashboard, compatibility of nozzles, re-fillers’ capacity evaluation, pressure swing adsorption (PSA) plants, planning to set up of manufacturing units for oxygen production, shortage of cryogenic oxygen tankers, and scenario-building to plan infrastructure requirements for Covid-19 third wave.Delhi government’s standing counsel Rahul Mehra said a 13-member task force is already working on preparations for the third wave. “On instructions, broadly, we are all on the same page. We will surely implement to the extent possible,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/iitd-study-on-oxygen-submitted-to-delhi-hc-101622244916669.html
29-05-2021||Delhi||Jabs shortage ‘artificial’, says AAP over supply running low||Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) spokespersons Raghav Chadha and Atishi on Friday accused the central government of creating an “artificial scarcity” of vaccines in India by favouring supplies to private sector facilities over state governments, including Delhi.Alleging that the state was choking state governments of vaccine supplies and diverting stocks to private facilities — which charge for doses, unlike public centres, forcing people to pay for vaccines.Delhi BJP spokesperson Praveen Shankar Kapoor called these allegations “unfounded.”“The Delhi government has run out of vaccines, forcing centres for the 18-45 age group to be suspended. These centres offered vaccines for free. But the private centres, which charge between ₹1,000 and ₹1,500 for a dose, have adequate stocks. How are they getting the supplies? It’s because the central government is favouring the private sector over the state governments when it comes to ensuring supply of vaccines. It also looks like doses meant for the state governments are being diverted to the private sector,” said AAP spokesperson and Rajendra Nagar MLA Raghav Chadha.Union health ministry spokespersons did not respond to requests for comment.India’s Covid-19 vaccination drive follows two tracks: the Centre offers free doses meant for those 45 and above; then there is the acquisition by state governments and private health care institutions to give doses for any group they choose to cater to.The Union government has made it mandatory for vaccine makers in India to keep 50% of their doses for the central supply, while the remaining will be evenly split between private procurers and state governments.The BJP hit back at the AAP’s allegations.“The Centre has not caused any scarcity of vaccines,” said BJP spokesperson Kapoor.“AAP leaders should know that creating scarcity and putting people at discomfort is the chief minister’s speciality,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/jabs-shortage-artificial-says-aap-over-supply-running-low-101622242927851.html
29-05-2021||Delhi||Delhiwale: A Miranda House poet||This Delhi University (DU) student hasn’t been to her college yet. “I belong to the cursed 2020 batch,” says Rangoli Sharma on phone, blaming the pandemic that has forced her campus life to be substituted by online classes. In fact, she is far from Delhi, at her home in Churu, Rajasthan.Also read: High daily testing allowed isolation of Covid patientsIn her early 20s, Ms Sharma is a post-grad student in Miranda House, a college for women. Having spent all her life in places other than Delhi, she was looking forward to the experience of being a DU student. Especially because she always viewed its women colleges as “cradles of feminism” where “women can choose to be more of themselves than they can be at any other place; they become kind, opinionated and confident, and I always wished to be one.” With the unpredictability of the ongoing pandemic, there is a possibility of Ms Sharma ending up as a Miranda House alumnus without any personal memories of its canteen and corridors.She wrote a poem last month, “after seeing requests for oxygens, injections, ventilators and life on social media.”This is not a love poemWorld is always sufferingand people are always dyingbut it is only in the times of warthat we are more scared and kinderfor ‘people’ can be usmore than ever this timeas children in 6th gradewe used to discuss world warsand guessed what the third one would be formany of us would say “water”little did we knowit could be on the air we breatheand dying in the arms of a loved onecould be a fearful act in itselfI can never understandhow does one attempt to write love poemsor one dreams of world peaceor one thinks of building houseswhen there is a war going ona war no one deserveda war everyone has to be a part ofso, this, is everything but a love poemfor all those who are a part of this warthis, is a poem of rage and helplessnessof suffering and tearsof shattered dreams and smilesof undone last rituals and unsaid goodbyesand no, it should not end on a note of hopefor it would have lost its similes and personificationtill the time it comes to an endso, this poem, doesn’t completely rhymeit rather chooses to be blurry and uncertainlike the times it has been written inlike the person it has been written bylike the world it has been written forand the only comfort it can offer youis in the fact that you are not alone.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhiwale-a-miranda-house-poet-101622242446360.html
29-05-2021||Delhi||High daily testing allowed isolation of Covid patients||With vaccines in short supply, testing and isolating people quickly is the best way to keep infections under control. Experts say more testing helps trace and isolate Covid patients, set up containment zones, and track the size and spread of an outbreak.Delhi is the runaway leader in testing among the country’s 20 most populous regions, shows an HT analysis, highlighting another important factor that helped the city get control over its deadliest Covid wave. The Capital tested 955,849 samples per million people till Wednesday, nearly four times the national average of 252,809. Jammu & Kashmir, in second, tested 633,133 per million.Click here for complete coverage of Covid-19Delhi has tested twice the proportion of its population compared to other states with good testing strategies, such as Kerala, Karnataka, and Telangana.In all, the city has conducted over 19 million tests till Friday.What turned out to be crucial was that even at the height of the fourth wave, when every third person was testing positive and labs were overwhelmed, the city administration did not let the number of daily tests drop below 60,000. Moreover, the city kept conducting a high number of the more accurate RT-PCR (reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction) test.At least 65% of the over 257,000 tests in April and 76% of the 193,000 in May were RT PCR, considered the gold standard in testing, even as nationally the proportion of the less accurate rapid antigen tests (RAT) increased as governments ramped up testing during the second wave of infection. At the peak of the infection, when the positivity rate was 36% and about 25,000 new cases were emerging every day, it also meant that the 25,000 people were being isolated from the rest of the population every day to break the chain of transmission.“Delhi has been a model state nationally in terms of testing since the first Covid wave. Against the national average of 1,500 tests per million population per day, Delhi has consistently been doing 4,000 tests for several months now, which is the highest nationally and among the highest globally.”Experts said this played a role in Delhi controlling the wave.“The rapid antigen tests are known to miss one out of every two positive cases. Once a person gets a negative report, albeit using an RAT, they are likely to go out in the society and infect others if they are asymptomatic carriers of the infection. Ideally, all tests should be conducted using RT-PCR but it is not possible to do so in such a populous country,” said Dr Harsh Mahajan, president of healthcare association NatHealth and founder of Mahajan Imaging that does RT-PCR tests in Delhi.“What is good though is that Delhi maintained the 70:30 ratio for RT-PCR tests. Had that not been the case, more people with the infection would have been out and about and infected others,” he added.RT-PCR and other molecular tests amplify the genetic material of the virus extracted from the swab sample to detect an infection. They are, therefore, more accurate than the rapid antigen tests that detect the presence of viral proteins without any amplification.When Delhi first imposed a weekend lockdown on April 17, the seven-day average of daily samples had touched a peak of 99,776 – the most recorded in the city. The number of samples tested crossed the 100,000-mark on five occasions in the first two weeks of April.However, the imposition of the lockdown brought down the number of tests, which Delhi health minister Satyendar Jain attributed to a stop in testing at transit points like railway stations and interstate bus terminals. Still, the city on average tested over 70,000 samples daily, including in the city’s rural areas.“During this wave, we have seen a high number of cases being reported from the rural areas of Delhi as well. This was not the case during the last wave. To ensure all cases get detected quickly, a high number of tests – nearly 10,000 to 12,000 a day – is being conducted in districts with rural pockets such as Southwest,” Jain said last week.Another challenge the city faced as cases rose in April was lab technicians getting infected, leading to long delays in sample collection and results, resulting a crucial lag period in which people could unknowingly infect others. The government, on April 22, reiterated its May 2020 order asking labs to release reports within 48 hours of collection to check the delay in infected patients getting isolated.Also read: GST Council forms GoM for tax slabs of Covid essentials“Testing has to be done aggressively even when the number of cases is low. And, this is not just from the government’s point of view, people should also be willing to come out and get tested. If that happens, then the government will know in which locations the number of cases are on the rise and localised lockdowns can be implemented to stop the spread of the infection to the rest of the city,” said Dr Amit Singh, associate professor, Centre for Infectious Disease Research, Indian Institute of Science, Bengaluru.In addition to tests, experts have suggested the government boost genomic sequencing in view of the looming threat of new variants. So far, Delhi has sequenced the third highest number of samples after Kerala and Maharashtra, both states with a much higher population. Of the 19,000 samples sequenced by Indian Sars-CoV-2 Genomic Consortia (INSACOG), 1,605 are from Delhi.With only 10 institutes across India sequencing genomes, the numbers, however, are low as compared to the recommended 5% of total positive samples. In April alone, Delhi reported 487,000 positive cases; 5% of this would have translated to over 24,000 samples sequenced.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/high-daily-testing-allowed-isolation-of-covid-patients-101622242065377.html
29-05-2021||Chandigarh||Move to merge 489 rural dispensaries with health dept in Punjab raises eyebrows||The Punjab government’s move to merge 489 of the 1,183 dispensaries run by the state rural development and panchayati raj department with the health department has not gone down well with a section of doctors and other healthcare workers who are raising questions about the decision at a time when the pandemic threat is looming large in non-urban areas. The decision was implemented earlier this month. According to an order, these subsidiary facilities will now be run by the health department as health and wellness centres and won’t have MBBS doctors. Every centre will now be headed by a community health officer (CHO), a newly created post. A nurse, who has been given special training for the purpose, or a holder of bachelor of ayurvedic medicine and surgery (BAMS) degree will be posted as CHO, officials said. The government’s rationale behind the merger is that these centres, meant to serve far-flung and backward rural areas, were not having MBBS doctors (rural medical officers) and other staff for the past few years. Punjab Rural Medical Services Association president Dr Aslum Parvez said red tape has taken a toll on the rural healthcare system which has been systematically eroded amid the pandemic. “These dispensaries were without doctors for the past 9 years. When there was a need to fill the vacancies, the government decided to abolish the posts. We urge that chief minister to take back the decision and fill the vacancies of doctors in permanent rural health cadre under the rural development department,” he said. Now, these dispensaries will be run by nurses working as community health officers, Dr Parvez added. On Thursday, protests were held against the move in Patiala and Gurdaspur districts. “Our dispensary used to cater to a population of over 12,000,” said Jatinder Singh Mattu, convener of the Independent Labour Union, who led the protests in Ghagga village of Patiala. These centres were without permanent doctors as the last recruitment in the rural department was done in 2016. Doctors serving in the rural areas say a CHO won’t be authorised to prescribe any drugs. Principal secretary (health) Hussan Lal said the posting of doctors in these centres is under consideration of the government. Health minister Balbir Sidhu and his rural development and panchayati raj counterpart Tript Rajinder Bajwa were not available for comments.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/move-to-merge-489-rural-dispensaries-with-health-dept-in-punjab-raises-eyebrows-101622233105448.html
29-05-2021||Chandigarh||Illegal sale of assets: Pearls Group owner Bhangu’s son-in-law held||The Punjab Police’s special investigation team (SIT) on Friday arrested Har Satinder Singh Hayer, prime accused in the case involving alleged illegal sale of properties of PACL India Limited, also known as Pearls Group, worth hundreds of crores despite a Supreme Court ban. Officials said Hayer, son-in-law of Pearls Group owner Nirmal Singh Bhangu who is in jail in connection with a ponzi scam involving over ₹48,000 crore, was arrested from Mohali with some property-related documents. A SIT member said he will be produced in a court in Ferozepur district’s Zira town on Saturday. The SIT, constituted by Ferozepur range deputy inspector general (DIG) Hardial Singh Mann, comprises Tarn Taran superintendent of police (headquarters) and deputy superintendents of police (DSPs) of Zira and Jalalabad in Fazilka. In April this year, the SIT filed a chargesheet against multiple accused in a Ferozepur court, saying despite the SC’s 2016 ban order, the PACL and its associated companies started disposing of land worth hundreds of crores in and outside India. As many as 57 people, including company officials and family members of Bhangu, were booked on charges of cheating, criminal conspiracy and other sections of the Indian Penal Code at the Zira police station in July last year. Several arrests were made by the police on the complaint of one Pardeep Singh of Bhadson in Patiala district. In December 2015, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) had ordered attachment of all assets of PACL and its nine promoters and directors for their failure to refund money to investors. A panel headed by Justice RM Lodha (retired) had initiated the process of refund to the investors. The SIT chargesheet The SIT in its chargesheet claimed that Hayer and his wife Barinder Kaur had given multiple powers of attorney to Australia-based Sarabjit Singh, alias Sebby Sanghera, a trusted aide of Hayer, to sell the company properties in Australia that were purchased through the money invested by the public. One of the powers of attorney was for a property worth 6-crore Australian dollars. These papers were prepared in Zira. Financial transactions were also detected between Hayer and Sanghera. Hayer along with other family members also sold illegally many PACL properties outside Punjab by giving power of attorney, it was found. It is also alleged that Hayer allegedly sold a prime company property in Banur town of Mohali district. According to the chargesheet, financial transactions were also made between Manoj Kumar, one the 57 accused in the property sale case who was arrested in April this year, and Barinder Kaur and others. Also, Dhillon Empire, an associate company of PACL, kept operating its accounts, it is alleged. “Another accused Munish Jakhar got registered land deeds of 112 flats of Nirmal Chhaya project despite the court ban and gave power of attorney of many commercial properties,” reads the chargesheet.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/illegal-sale-of-assets-pearls-group-owner-bhangu-s-son-in-law-held-101622232985295.html
29-05-2021||Chandigarh||Cash-strapped Punjabi University increases ‘transcript fee’ 40 times||The fund-starved Punjabi University, Patiala, has increased the ‘transcript fee’ for students residing in India by 40 times from ₹500 to ₹20,000. The decision will be effective from June 1.Required at the time of applying for work permit or permanent residence (PR) abroad, an academic transcript is a set of documents pertaining to an applicant’s educational records, including details of course, degree, subjects studied and marks obtained. It is issued by the parent university from where an applicant pursued their course. Besides ₹20,000, the applicant will have to pay 18% Goods and Services Tax (GST). Moreover, if a student requires additional transcripts, they will have to pay additional ₹5,000 per set.For applicants residing outside India, the varsity is charging $294 ( ₹21,700).Panjab University, Chandigarh, charges ₹525 as transcript fee each from those residing in India and $304 ( ₹22,000) from those based out of the country. The Guru Nanak Dev University (GNDU), Amritsar, charges between ₹800 and ₹1,200, excluding 18% GST, per document. “It is open loot by the Punjabi University administration which is trying to fleece students to fill its empty coffers. For instance, a student requiring transcripts for immigration purposes for two-year MBA degree earlier paid nearly ₹3,000 but now the varsity will charge ₹20,000 besides GST for the same,” said Rashpinder Singh, an activist of the Punjab Students Radical Union. “The union will protest against such fleecing of students and will raise the issue with varsity high-ups next week,” he added. Vice-chancellor Prof Arvind said the decision was taken to bring uniformity in issuing and sending transcripts for students residing in and outside India. “As per the present system, many of those applying for transcripts from outside India used fraudulent means to get their transcripts at cheaper rates. The decision will end corruption in sending transcripts and streamlining the whole process,” Prof Arvind said. A senior faculty member said the varsity is receiving nearly 150 applications for transcripts for immigration purpose on a daily basis and, therefore, has fond it process more lucrative to charge excessive fee from students. “The university completely failed to take note of the fact that most of the applicants residing outside the country are earning in hard currencies, while those in India are either dependent on their families or are working for meagre salaries,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/cashstrapped-punjabi-university-increases-transcript-fee-40-times-101622232325513.html
29-05-2021||Chandigarh||Punjab Cong rumblings: 3-member panel set up by Sonia to meet today||Chandigarh A three-member committee set up by Congress president Sonia Gandhi under senior party leader and Rajya Sabha member Mallikarjun Kharge to resolve the infighting in the Punjab Congress will have its first meeting in New Delhi on Saturday. The committee, which has former Delhi Congress president Jai Prakash Agarwal and All India Congress Committee (AICC) general secretary in-charge of Punjab affairs Harish Rawat as members, plans to find a solution to the open sparring between chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh and the dissenting group, including former minister Navjot Singh Sidhu, cabinet ministers Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa and Charanjit Singh Channi, through dialogue. Kharge, who became the leader of opposition in the Rajya Sabha in February this year, is among the Gandhi family loyalists. The panel has also been asked to look at the party’s strengths and shortcomings and draw the strategy for strengthening the party for the state assembly polls due early next year after listening to the chief minister’s camp and the dissenters, according to sources. Rawat, who had tried hard for a rapprochement between Amarinder and Sidhu after becoming in-charge of Punjab eight months ago, spoke to the chief minister on Friday and sought his opinion on the modalities to be followed. “We will also talk to (Punjab Congress president) Sunil Jakhar, ministers, MPs and MLAs among others and seek their views for early resolution of these issues and draw the strategy for the Congress victory,” said Rawat, a former chief minister of Uttarakhand. The committee does not have any immediate plans to visit the state due to the coronavirus pandemic and is likely to meet the party leaders in the national capital. The committee has been constituted by the Congress leadership due to the internecine infighting among senior party leaders, particularly Amarinder and Sidhu, who are hitting out at each other over delay in giving justice in sacrilege cases ever since the Punjab and Haryana high court quashed the special investigation report (SIT) report in the 2015 Kotkapura police firing case. The politically sensitive issue has seen attempts by 9-10 ministers, MPs and MLAs to band together and take on the chief minister. Sidhu blamed Amarinder for the legal setback and failure to deliver on some key poll promises whereas the CM accused him of fuelling dissent, suggesting that he (former minister) may jump the ship. Also, seven ministers have demanded the cricketer-turned-politician’s suspension from the party. While Sidhu is said to be counting on former Congress president Rahul Gandhi and general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, the two-time CM, who has led the party to a string of electoral successes in the state since the 2017 election win, seems confident that the Congress high command will listen to him on this issue.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/punjab-cong-rumblings-3-member-panel-set-up-by-sonia-to-meet-today-101622232145352.html

The farmers sat in straight lines ensuring social distancing, wore face masks, carried sanitisers and water bottles.BKU general secretary Sukhdev Singh Kokrikalan said the main agenda of the protest was to list out failures of both central and state governments in tackling the Covid situation in Punjab.“People are dying of lack of beds and oxygen. The authorities have completely failed to provide the required medical facilities to people, who are left to make arrangements of their own,” said Singh.He added that the union has demand the state government to take control of the private hospitals during the pandemic in order to provide treatment at capped rates.“Instead of instilling fear among people with challans, police force and curfew-like restrictions, the government should initiate awareness drives in rural areas to sensitise people about the virus. Moreover, rather than labelling farmers as superspreaders, the government should arrange vaccines to be administered to the rural population on priority,” he said.BKU members demanded that the government make required arrangements for beds, ventilators and oxygen cylinders in order to tackle the situation in a streamlined manner in the near future besides carrying out a recruitment drive in the health department.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/farmers-launch-3-day-stir-at-patiala-say-govt-failed-in-tackling-covid-crisis-101622231305837.html

29-05-2021||Mumbai||Maha sees 20,740 cases, lowest in 73 days; lockdown to be extended||Maharashtra is set to extend the current lockdown for a fortnight from June 1, even as it reported 20,740 fresh Covid-19 cases on Friday— the lowest in 73 days. The curbs, however, would be relaxed in places where the Covid-19 case growth rate or positivity rate has reduced. The state government, according to health minister Rajesh Tope, will finalise the parameters and issue guidelines soon. Senior government officials said the timings for shops selling non-essential commodities could be relaxed in areas where the cases have reduced. Currently, under the existing restrictions till 7am of June 1, citizens of the state are disallowed to step out unless they need medical attention, or are working in an essential sector, or want to buy essential commodities. That too within restricted timings — between 7am and 11am. Tope, who held a review meeting on the Covid-19 situation in Pune on Friday, said the government will decide criteria for unlocking. “It can be positivity rate or growth rate,” he said. “We have decided to extend the lockdown for 15 days, but the guidelines will be issued soon. Wherever the positivity rate is high, there is a challenge of bed availability. In such places, the lockdown will not be relaxed. However, for places where the situation is not bad, guidelines will be issued by June 1… With regards to unlocking of non-essential shops, we are preparing guidelines for them. We will discuss with chief minister and finalise it,” Tope added. State officials said they are working on relaxing the curbs, including for shops selling non-essential commodities. They added that certain restrictions including travel on suburban trains, inter-district travel, etc will continue to be regulated. Currently, only work force engaged in essential services and those with medical urgency are allowed to use local trains in Mumbai. Mumbai, meanwhile, recorded under-1,000 fresh cases on Friday. It added 924 new cases, taking its tally to 702,522. Mumbai also added 30 fatalities, pushing death toll to 14,750. Maharashtra on Friday added 424 fatalities, taking the death toll over 93,000, to 93,198. The overall positivity rate in the rate stood at 16.57%, while the daily positivity rate was 7.85%. Mumbai’s daily positivity rate was 3.14% on Friday. Officials said parameters including weekly growth rate and weekly positivity rate will be considered while giving relaxation in certain areas. “The general idea is to go slow with the unlocking as many districts have high positivity rate. The chief minister does not want to open activities in one go as it would waste the effort to control the spread of coronavirus in the state. As unlocking will be gradual, he wants more people to get at least one shot of the Covid vaccine. Many options are being looked into. Travel of people will continue to be regulated and work from home will continue to be encouraged,” said the official who did not wish to be named. Dr Rahul Pandit, state Covid task force member and Director-Critical Care, Fortis Hospitals, Mumbai, said, “The overall situation in the state has improved, however, there are some districts that continue to show red flags. So, the unlocking will have to be done accordingly.” He added that the task force cannot recommend unlocking guidelines, but it has conveyed the assessment of the situation by “pointing out the red flags and green zones”. Meanwhile, Tope said the state government is looking to augment Covid care centres in rural areas after the state’s decision to disallow home quarantine to Covid-positive patients where the dwellings are small. He also said all district collectors and municipal commissioners have been told to carry out tracing and testing in a “scientific manner” as opposed to random testing. He said the latter would ensure low positivity rate on paper, but reality would be different. “Across Maharashtra, the tracking and testing has to be done in a scientific manner. We have conveyed it to district collectors and commissioners. We do not want to test randomly and get a low positivity rate. Therefore, tests of only high-risk and low-risk contacts will be done… Tope said the department has given “targets” to districts to bring down the home isolation tally to around 30%. He however clarified that it is not 100% mandated, but only in places where isolation is not possible due to small houses. “We have taken decisions on home isolation which has brought down its numbers from 80% to 56%. We are working toward bringing it down to 25%-30%. We want to reduce home isolation and give preference to institutional quarantine. It should especially increase in rural areas because there have been cases of late admissions which have resulted in deaths. People [in CCC] will be treated as per protocol, which will ensure they recover as well as reduce spread in rural areas,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maha-sees-20-740-cases-lowest-in-73-days-lockdown-to-be-extended-101622231247231.html

Nency was unavailable for comment. According to the statement given by Nency’s wife Rahat, 67, the accused had been harassing her since last April for the power of attorney of her 30% share at Royal Palms estate, spread over 240 acres of land in Goregaon East. Rahat in her statement to the police alleged that Nency had also assaulted her over a period of three months. The couple got married in 1971 and stay at a bungalow inside Royal Palms. Rahat said that Nency has 25% shares at the estate and a hotel owned by the family, while their two sons and grandson own the remaining shares. According to the police, in April 2020 Nency asked Rahat for the power of attorney. When she refused, he sacked their domestic help. Rahat said that Nency wanted to harass her as she suffers from high blood pressure and the staffers used to take care of her. Two months later, Nency again asked Rahat to transfer the power of attorney. But when she refused, he gave her Triple Talaq. Over the next two months, when Rahat did not budge, Nency abused her and again gave her Triple Talaq and declared that she was no longer his wife. Disturbed by the abuse, Rahat later signed the power of attorney and asked him to leave the house. On May 9, Nency arrived at the house with two women. When Rahat objected, Nency pushed her. She then told her sons about the incident and approached the police on Wednesday to file a case against Nency for harassment and torture. “We have registered the case based on Rahat’s statement. We are now investigating the case and are in the process of recording the statements of the family members,” said senior inspector Jitendra Gole of Aarey Milk Colony police station.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/mumbai-police-book-royal-palms-owner-for-giving-triple-talaq-to-67-year-old-wife-101622230764438.html

The report “Coal Ash in India – Vol II: An environmental, social and legal compendium of coal ash mismanagement in India, 2020-21” documents 17 major incidents related to fly ash pollution which occurred in Madhya Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Odisha, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, West Bengal and Maharashtra. “Ash pond collapse, air pollution from ash ponds and discharge of coal fly ash into rivers, streams and other water bodies were the most prevalent incidents, indicating the dismal state of coal fly ash management in the country. Most of these locations are regions where coal fly ash disposal is a perennial problem and leaks, and accidents are routine,” the authors stated. The newly published report builds on a similar research published last year, which documented 76 coal fly ash-related incidents that occurred in the country between 2010 and 2020. LIFE and HEI have also scrutinised media reporting around such incidents, noting the presence of detailed reportage, which took into account the impacts of such incidents on the environment and communities that live around fly ash ponds. “Media coverage of research studies and reports published by leading universities and think tanks present a multidisciplinary approach in understanding the impacts of coal fly ash. Similarly, coverage of the people’s struggles around coal-based industries, seeking remediation of contaminated sites, clean up, reduction of pollution and compensation for loss of quality of life and livelihood were also prevalent,” the authors said. More importantly, the authors pointed out that coal fly ash-based pollution remained prevalent through the Covid-induced lockdown in localities away from big cities, which celebrated “clean air and blue skies”. Regions such as Chhattisgarh’s Korba, and north Chennai’s Seppakkam and Ennore, witnessed multiple accidents related to fly ash mismanagement. For instance, the report points out that wanton dumping of fly ash took place along arterial roads and near habited villages. The authors also noted how residents from coal hotspots were reporting that many power companies used the Covid-19 lockdown to dump waste indiscriminately in water bodies. “Korba has witnessed unprecedented coal fly ash pollution in the past one year. We have been living here for decades, but have never seen a sight like this before. Power companies have used Covid-19 restrictions to dump coal fly ash wherever they could. Piles of fly ash can be found everywhere – along the entire highway and ring roads and in villages. With summer winds, we are seeing the entire city covered in fly ash and we are breathing it. Despite several complaints no action has been taken on the errant companies”, said Shri Laxmi Chauhan, an activist from Korba.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/17-major-coal-fly-ash-incidents-in-india-last-year-report-101622230704477.html
29-05-2021||Other||NGT raps Maharashtra EIA authority over violations during infra works||The National Green Tribunal (NGT) has expressed concerns over the functioning of the Maharashtra State Environment Impact Assessment Authority (SEIAA), calling into question the manner in which the latter has allowed “continuous violation of environment norms in construction projects”. NGT has raised contention over multiple construction projects in Maharashtra that have been executed without prior environmental clearance (EC), which is granted by SEIAA. Though ECs were granted initially, multiple projects have expanded the scope of construction work in variance with the original terms of clearance, and subsequently applied for ex-post facto EC. In at least two cases, SEIAA has proceeded to grant fresh EC without levying any monetary compensation for environmental damage caused by the project proponent, the NGT’s order, dated May 24, reveal. A four-judge bench of the green court, headed by chairperson Adarsh Kumar Goel, made the observation while hearing two matters filed by an appellant, Tanaji Gambhire, concerning the ex-post facto environmental clearances granted by SEIAA last March to two projects in Pune. Though NGT’s orders do not specify the total number of such violations that have come to its notice in Maharashtra, the court observed, “We are coming across the grievance of continuous violation of environment norms in construction projects being completed without prior EC and SEIAA Maharashtra is neither requiring demolition nor payment of assessed compensation.” As such, “it will be appropriate to require SEIAA, Maharashtra, to review its working in the light of violations frequently being alleged, including the present case,” NGT noted. The court also “directed the constitution of a joint committee comprising the Union environment ministry, Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), SEIAA and state pollution control body to review their functioning... and also to suggest remedial action, including the quantum of compensation in the individual case.” The court also directed that “a proper standard operating procedure be laid down for grant of EC in such cases so as to address the gaps in binding law and practice being currently followed. Experts were reluctant to back NGT’s move. “It may seem like the tribunal has taken the right step, but really it is shrugging off its own responsibility. If there is a violation, the court can easily decide on either demolition or levying environmental compensation. It can also serve a notice to SEIAA for dereliction of duty. Instead, it has instated a committee, which includes members of SEIAA, to review the authority’s functioning. This is against the principle of natural justice,” said Mumbai-based independent environmental lawyer Zaman Ali. Vijay Shantilal Nahata, chairperson of Maharashtra SEIAA, did not respond to HT. However, a senior official in the environment department, currently serving as an SEIAA member, said, “We are aware of the NGT order and SOPs that will be framed by the committee established by the NGT will be observed and complied with fully.” “Post-facto clearances make a mockery of the law. It seems that statutory bodies meant to protect the environment are more interested in facilitating ease of doing business for developers, and violators are in fact encouraged to go ahead without environment clearances in such a scenario. This farce of processing applications without application of mind has been brought to light by NGT,” said Stalin D, director of non-governmental organisation Vanashakti.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/ngt-raps-maharashtra-eia-authority-over-violations-during-infra-works-101622230645620.html

The Central Railway (CR) will be introducing a Vistadome coach on the outstation train Deccan Express that operates between the two cities daily.The Vistadome coach is a 40 seater 360-degree view coach that is glass-roofed. The glass roof lets passengers enjoy the outside view. The coaches have wide window panes, and seats that rotate to 360 degrees to provide passengers with a better sightseeing experience.The coaches also have 12 LCD television screens for entertainment, a mini-fridge, automatic sliding compartment doors, an oven, juicer grinder and toilets fitted with ceramic tiles. The fare structure of the coach in the Deccan Express has not yet been decided but will be higher than the fare of a regular ticket.Initially, the coach was introduced on the Mumbai-Goa route in 2017 for passengers to get the view of the Western Ghat in the Jan Shatabdi Express.“The rake of Dadar-Madgaon express will be shifted to Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus (CSMT) and will be integrated with the rake of Deccan Express that operates between CSMT and Pune. The Vistadome coach will enable passengers to enjoy the view of the ghats section,” said Shivaji Sutar, chief public relation officer, Central Railway.However, the Deccan Express is not operational currently as the train has been cancelled due to low occupancy, owing to the travel restrictions in Maharashtra to curb the spread of coronavirus.Passengers associations have welcomed the move and have said the Vistadome coach will become popular on the railway route.“There are people who travel daily between Mumbai and Pune for work and post the opening up of train services the coach will become extremely popular among them. The Lonavala and Khandala section of the railway line is scenic and this would also attract many tourists who come to Maharashtra and travel by outstation trains. The railways should further introduce the Vistadome coach in other trains including the iconic Deccan Queen. The coaches will become a good source of income for the Central Railway.” said Subhash Gupta, president, Rail Yatri Parishad.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbaipune-journey-to-get-more-scenic-with-vistadome-coach-101622230524449.html

Community leaders have demanded a review petition in the top court followed by a curative petition, if the former fails, as well as a petition before the President for the inclusion of the community in the Centre’s list of ‘backward castes’. Sambhajiraje Chhatrapati, a descendent of Maratha warrior king Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj, in a press conference on Friday, said, “We are putting forward three demands that should immediately be met. The state government should immediately move a review petition before the five-judge bench which had struck down the reservation earlier this month. A curative petition should also be filed, if the review petition fails. Thirdly, a proposal should be sent to the President under Article 341 (A) of the Constitution for the inclusion of the community in the Central list of backward classes. These demands should be fulfilled by June 6 – the day the coronation ceremony of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj had taken place. Failing this, we will launch protests.” Before announcing the community stand, Sambhajiraje Chhatrapati had visited many parts of the state and met various political leaders across party lines, including Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar, chief minister and Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray, leader of Opposition and Bharatiya Janata Party Devendra Fadnavis, Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) chief Raj Thackeray.Various Maratha outfits have backed Sambhajiraje’s stand and have decided to fight under his leadership. “We have decided to take up this battle under his guidance. We will show our strength at Fort Raigad [that was once Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj’s capital] on June 6 and an aggressive protest will begin from there if the demands are not met,” said Virendra Pawar of Maratha Kranti Morcha.Sambhaji Chhatrapati also demanded the immediate appointment of 6,000 Maratha community youth whose recruitments had been stalled following the Supreme Court’s decision to scrap the Maratha quota on May 5. He has demanded for the budgetary allocation for Annasaheb Patil Financial Development Corporation, which finances the entrepreneurial ventures of the community members; strengthening of SARTHI (Chhatrapati Shahu Maharaj Research Training and Human Development Institute), meant to help community youth for the preparations in civil services, by giving it ₹1,000 crore; construction of hostels in all districts, among other demands.Deputy chief minister and state finance minister Ajit Pawar said that the government will consider the demands positively. “We still have time of eight to 10 days to act on the demands and a way out will be found out,” he said.According to leaders of the ruling parties, the demands raised by the parliamentarian are reasonable. “We have been working on the same lines as demanded by him for the legal battle. The report of the committee under retired high court judge Dilip Bhosale is expected by May 31, and the decision over the petitioning the top court will be taken accordingly. The implementation of the other administrative demands has already started,” said a Congress leader.Contrary to the position of his party BJP, Sambhajiraje Chhatrapati has taken a stand favourable to the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government by appealing to the community members against resorting to agitations. BJP had called for protests for reservation to Marathas.“If the Maratha community fails to get on the streets and stage agitations for reservation now, it will be too late [to safeguard their rights]. Life has not stopped because of Covid-19. The state has got time till June 4 to file a review petition against the SC verdict. This deadline will not be extended due to the pandemic,” state BJP president Chandrakant Patil had said in Kolhapur on Thursday. According to insiders, the Sambhajiraje Chhatrapati is inclining towards the ruling Congress. Ruling party leaders feel that his stand will help them to pacify the Maratha community.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/maratha-quota-outfits-led-by-chhatrapati-shivaji-maharaj-s-descendant-present-3-demands-101622230404475.html

The state’s decision to scrap the 33% reservation given to Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes (ST) and other reserved categories for promotions in its administration has irked the employees from these communities, with politicians threatening to agitate over the issue. This has also led to a tussle between the ruling Congress and Nationalist Congress Party, as the latter appears to be in favour of scrapping the 33% reservation to woo the Marathas.In accordance with a Bombay high court (HC) order issued in 2017, the state has stopped the promotions of about 40,000 employees in its administration. The community is also apprehensive about losing the promotions given to them since 2004, when the decision to introduce such a reservation had been taken. The Congress has taken an aggressive stand on the issue. As far as the Maratha community is concerned, the government will have to take a call deciding the future of 6,000 candidates who were to be recruited under the quota for the community, but were not given appointment letters due to the pending court cases. Their future is now uncertain owing to the SC verdict. Maratha outfits are demanding an immediate decision on the issue.The promotion riddle On May 7, the general administration department (GAD) issued a government resolution (GR) announcing to scrap the reservation in promotion in government service for the communities which together get 33% quota in government jobs. The decision to provide quota in promotion to employees in reserved categories had been taken by the Congress-NCP government in 2004. On April 20, GAD had issued a GR allowing promotions of open category employees by keeping the 33% reserved posts vacant. While the government said the decision to scrap the quota was taken as per a 2017 HC order, unions and leaders representing SC, ST employees alleged that it had been taken as a knee-jerk reaction to appease the Maratha community after their reservations was scrapped by SC. The unions also said that the quota in promotion was safeguarded by subsequent SC orders. The May 7 order has now become a headache for the Uddhav Thackeray government as the unions and Dalit leaders are demanding its reversal. The issue has also led to friction between the Congress and NCP. Last week, deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar from NCP, and energy minister Nitin Raut from the Congress, had an argument during a meeting of the cabinet sub-committee on the issue. The sub-committee is headed by Pawar, while Raut and other ministers from Scheduled Caste and ST communities are its members. Raut posed many questions in the meeting and asked how can a GR be issued without the knowledge of the committee, why was it issued when the minutes of the last meeting was not prepared and how can the decision to scrap the reservation in promotion come immediately after the Maratha quota was scrapped.“We are not against the Maratha reservation. In fact, we had supported it. But there should not be any suppression of the rights of people from other communities. The scrapping of the quota in reservation will affect the right of promotion of around 75,000 people,” said Raut, a Dalit leader, who also heads the Congress’s SC cell. A section of the council of ministers are hell-bent on the implementation of the 33% quota saying that at least 20,000 employees from these communities retired without a promotion in the past four years. A section of the Congress leaders also feel that it will have to face the consequences as backward communities form the party’s traditional voter base. “The sub-committee constituted to deliberate upon the reservation in promotions is dominated by Maratha ministers and the decision to scrap the 33% quota was taken without taking it into confidence,” said a senior Congress leader. He added that the state Congress has decided to take the issue to its logical end and may not hesitate to issue an ultimatum to its partners. Raut is requesting party president Sonia Gandhi’s intervention, said the leader. The state Congress organised a virtual meeting of over 500 people representing employees’ organisations of the affected categories on Tuesday and announced to compel the government to revoke the May 7 order.Meanwhile, minority affairs minister and NCP spokesperson Nawab Malik said that there was no infighting within MVA and the CM will find a way out. “Instead of making statements on public forums, Raut should approach CM who controls GAD. Raut has been pursuing the issue for the past one year and has been insisting to begin the process of promotions which was halted for four years. The decision was taken as per his demand, but now he is blaming others for the decision taken according to the court orders. He should resolve it amicably instead of talking publicly against the government decision. This issue, albeit, is not going to affect MVA government,” he said.However, to make matters worse for MVA, Maratha outfits have taken a strong stand against the reservation in promotions and have also threatened to boycott the Congress in the forthcoming elections. “The Congress has taken a casteist approach by supporting only some communities over reservations. Like Raut, other Congress ministers such as Vijay Wadettiwar, Varsha Gaikwad, too, had taken an anti-Maratha approach over the reservation issue. If this continues, we will have to take a firm stand to show the party its place,” said Maratha Kranti Morcha outfit in a statement.Recruiting Marathas under scrapped quota At least 6,000 youth from the Maratha community have been facing uncertainty over their recruitment in government jobs after the SC verdict. The court has safeguarded recruitments before September 9 under the Maratha quota. But none of them were given an appointment letter then.Virendra Pawar of the Maratha Kranti Morcha said, “Only a few Maratha youth were appointed under the quota before SC scrapped it. It was just because of the inefficiency of the government that the recruitment process was not completed within time. Now it’s the responsibility of the government to see that they are given the appointments on posts they would have got under the quota.” “There are 11 problems before us in recruiting these Maratha candidates and we are finding ways to ensure that they do not lose the quota benefits,” said an official from GAD.The state government has appointed a high-level committee under retired HC judge Dilip Bhosale to study the order and recommend a way forward for Maratha reservations.Political analyst Hemant Desai said that the issue of reservation in promotions may become crucial and add to the challenges for the government. “For the first time since the government formation, the Congress has taken an aggressive stand on the issue of reservation in promotions and it may lead to a serious face-off between the ruling parties. The tussle is because NCP wants to woo the Marathas, while Congress does not want to lose its traditional vote bank. Also, it is a task before the government to recruit Maratha candidates who have been selected in government jobs and then to make it stand legally. These issues will haunt the MVA government, especially when the BJP is determined to corner them,” he said.Subhash Gangurde, general secretary, Maharashtra government employees unions’ federation, said, “We do not believe in the caste system within the administration, but the reservation in promotions should be given as per Constitutional provisions. It is the responsibility of the government to protect it. It is beyond comprehension as to why the state failed to submit quantifiable data in the court in the past four years,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/maharashtra-govt-s-share-of-woes-over-court-rulings-on-quotas-101622230164504.html
29-05-2021||Chandigarh||Grain gain: Punjab beats MP, regains top wheat producing state tag||Madhya Pradesh will lose the tag of top wheat procurer state in India to Punjab due to lesser procurement this year as compared to 2020, said an official of food and civil supplies department.Punjab has emerged as the biggest wheat producer state after a year, and it came amid farmers protesting against three central laws at borders of Delhi since November last year.Madhya Pradesh procured only 125.6 lakh tonnes wheat sown on 49 lakh hectare in 2021 while in 2020, it had procured 129.4 lakh tonnes of the grain sown on 45 lakh hectares, the food and civil supplies department data shows.MP had pushed Punjab to the second spot for the first time in 2020 with northern state producing 128.5 lakh tonnes of wheat. This year, the MP government set a higher target of wheat procurement after 27% increase in the registration of farmers for selling the rabi crop to the government.After an increase in registration of farmers, the food and civil supplies department arranged for extra space, gunny bags and transportation to procure over 135 lakh tonnes wheat. But, MP failed to achieve the target, whereas the Punjab government procured over 132 lakh tonnes of against the target of 130 lakh tonnes, officials said. “Over 16 lakh farmers sold their crop at MSP of ₹1,925 per quintal. This year, the yielding of crop has been decreased by 10-15% due to extreme weather condition. The average maximum temperature of winter was higher than last year and untimely rainfall led to low yielding of wheat. We were expecting procurement of wheat lesser than 100 lakh tonne but 125 lakh tonne is quite satisfactory for us,” said an official of the MP food and civil supplies department, who is not wished to be named. MP food and civil supplies corporation principal secretary Faiz Ahmed Kidwai said: “This target of procurement is just to support farmers, if they don’t get any seller in the market.” The farmers’ associations also admitted to the fact that it happened due to less yield of crop, but with weather, they also blamed the poor quality of seeds and fertilizers for that. Bhartiya Kisan Union MP president Anil Yadav said: “This year, farmers suffered a loss of 10-15% per hectare due to extreme weather condition and poor quality of seeds and fertilisers. With the decrease in production, procurement of wheat has also dipped. The state government needs to come up with better seeds and fertilizers to compete with Punjab.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/grain-gain-punjab-beats-mp-regains-top-wheat-producing-state-tag-101622230045277.html

Meerut division comprises Noida, Ghaziabad, Meerut, Bulandshahr, Hapur and Baghpat districts and so far 312 patients of black fungus have been admitted in Meerut, Noida and Ghaziabad districts. Saharanpur division (Saharanpur, Muzaffarnagar and Shamli) has also been pooled with Meerut division for treatment of black fungus. Therefore patients from these three districts are also referred to LLRM Medical College in Meerut where a special ward has been set up. So far, 103 patients have been discharged after treatment while 22 died in the division. As many as 191 patients are undergoing treatment in hospitals of Noida, Meerut and Ghaziabad. Out of these 312 cases, 166 were diagnosed and treated in LLRM Medical College and 13 in other private hospitals of Meerut. Of these, 52 patients were discharged while 14 succumbed during treatment and 100 patients are still under treatment out of which 76 are in Medical College and remaining 24 in other private hospitals. Experts say that black fungus is a rare disease and it can be most effectively treated with Amphotericin-B injection. This injection is also not easily available and so there was an acute shortage after cases of black fungus exponentially increased. The state government formulated a mechanism and made additional director of health nodal officer at divisional level for ensuring distribution of available injections as per demand from hospitals. But insufficient supply of these injections has turned the situation worrisome. Dr Rajkumar, additional director, health, Meerut division, shared that his office received 280 vials of life saving Amphotericin- B injections. He made no bones in admitting shortage of injections and said“We are trying to handle the situation with available vials”. Amid shortage of the injections, hospitals need to send their requirement for injections to AD ( health) office, which distributes them Amphotericin- B injection as per availability. Many patients of black fungus were treated in Anand Hospital here and a few are still under treatment. Director of the hospital Dr Subhash Yadav shared,“We are facing acute shortage of the injection and now alternate medicines are being used to treat the patients”. Dr Pradeep Kumar of Meerut kidney hospital has treated many patients of black fungus and three are still undergoing treatment. He reiterated that injection Amphotericin-B injection was the most effective, so it was prescribed for treatment of black fungus but was scarce now. He said that some patients even required 4 to 5 doses of the injection everyday, depending upon their condition. Dr Kumar said that medicine Posacinazole was being used as an alternative but it was also in short supply. He said that the hospital requested the attendants of a patient on Wednesday to shift him to some other hospital where the medicines were available. “ We sometime feel helpless,” he said and added that attendants of patients were also passing through a difficult time. A farmer of Baghat area, Karanpal, is undergoing treatment for black fungus since May 14. His son Shailesh Kumar said that he received only two injections from the office of AD ( health) and were trying hard for more injections even from the open market but without luck. Shailesh, whose father has undergone surgery, explained, “ Surgery cures 40 per cent and medicines are required for cure of the remaining 60 per cent disease”. He said presently his father was being treated through alternate medicine, which they luckily purchased in good number in the middle of the month. Now these medicines are also not available in the market. Shailesh said that attendants of almost every patient were facing difficulties in arranging injections and medicines to keep their family members alive.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/black-fungus-on-the-rise-in-meerut-division-drugs-scarce-101622228666427.html
29-05-2021||Chandigarh||Mohali’s Mayo Hospital booked for black-marketing remdesivir||Following subdivisional magistrate’s report finding Mayo Hospital (now Mount Star Hospital) in Mohali’s Sector 69 guilty of black-marketing 83 remdesivir injections and fleecing at least 100 Covid-19 patients, police have registered a case against its management, including the chief executive officer and eight directors.The case has been registered under Sections 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant), 269 (negligent act likely to spread infection of disease danger­ous to life) and 270 (malignant act likely to spread infection of disease danger­ous to life) of the Indian Penal Code besides under the Disaster Management Act and Epidemic Diseases Acts at the Phase-8 police station. Hindustan Times had first reported irregularities at the hospital on May 22.It is the second hospital in the district that has been booked for malpractices in the past couple of weeks. Earlier, on May 18, a case was registered against the management of New Lifeline Hospital of Zirakpur for overcharging and medical negligence. The four-member committee, comprising subdivisional magistrate Jadgeep Sehgal, deputy superintendent of Police Deep Kamal, senior medical officer Dr Vijay Bhagat, and drug inspector Jai Jai Singh, found that the Mayo Hospital had sold 83 remdesivir injections, which are used for treating Covid-19 patients, for ₹40,000 each in the black market after procuring them from the state government for ₹1,800 each.The committee found that bills for the injection were issued in the name of a prominent cement manufacturing firm besides the chief financial officer and a few doctors of the hospital. One bill was also issued in the name of a woman on March 17 even as she was admitted on March 18.Later, during the investigation, the district administration detected around 100 instances of overcharging of Covid-19 patients at the hospital. Mohali deputy commissioner Girish Dayalan said it had come to the fore that the hospital had been charging around ₹20,000 a day from Covid patients. According to rates approved by the Punjab government, a private hospital can charge ₹16,500 a day from a patient requiring ventilator support while for a bed without ventilator, the charges are capped at ₹14,500 a day. These include all expenses, such as room rent, visiting charges and PPE kits. “Mayo Hospital was found to be offering a package of ₹40,000 for the entire span of hospitalisation, but was adding ₹6,000 a day as visiting charges, which is illegal,” said Dayalan. The deputy commissioner said directions have also been issued to other private hospitals not to indulge in unethical practices. “Otherwise, strict action will be taken, which may even lead to the closure of the hospital,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/mohalis-mayo-hospital-booked-for-black-marketing-remdesivir-101622228665926.html
29-05-2021||Chandigarh||HC again stays Chandigarh admn’s power privatisation move||The Punjab and Haryana high court on Friday once again stayed the Chandigarh administration’s move to privatise the power department. Multiple lawyers associated with the case confirmed the development. However, the detailed order from the HC bench of justice Jitendra Chauhan and justice Vivek Puri is awaited.The order was passed on a fresh plea from the UT Powermen Union, which had approached court stating that opening and finalisation of the tender bids be stopped. It was argued that the administration is not justified in hurrying through the process amid the pandemic. “State being a ‘welfare state’ is expected to concentrate on the ways and means of saving citizens from the havoc being played by the Covid-19 pandemic,” the plea said, further underlining that the department has been revenue surplus for many years and is supplying 24x7 electricity to the satisfaction of the consumers.Earlier, on December 1, too, the HC had applied brakes on the privatisation process. However, the UT had approached the Supreme Court, which stayed the HC order and remanded back the case to it. When asked whether the administration would approach the SC again, UT adviser Manoj Parida said: “Yes we will. We have enough ground.”The decision to privatise the department was taken on May 12, 2020, after directions from the Centre. The administration has assured the Centre to complete the process by the end of 2020. As many as 17 firms has expressed interest after the administration invited the bids in November.

More than 100 samples from various localities of the city have been tested recently and all of them have been found safe. To note, recently there were reports of a study confirming presence of Covid contamination in sewer water near Khadra. Municipal commissioner Ajay Dwivedi said, “The LMC came to know about Covid contamination in sewage through several reports. There is no official confirmation on the matter, but as a protective measure we’ve tested samples of drinking water from more 100 places. All samples have been found safe and no bacterial or virus contamination has been detected till now .Testing will continue in the days to come. The effort is to ensure safe water supply to the residents of the city.” Acting GM Jal Sansthan Ram Kailash said, “The teams of LMC and Jal Sansthan are going to target Alambagh, Aliganj , Indira Nagar and Gomti Nagar for testing of water samples. These areas have reported maximum Covid cases in the past. Till now, over 100 samples of potable water have been found safe for drinking.” “Keeping the safety of residents in mind, we are conducting tests of water at three levels. At the first level, our junior engineer tests the water supply along with the supervisor. Next comes testing with the team of CMO in the presence of our executive engineers. At the third level the samples are sent to the state lab in Aliganj,” he said. The Jal Sansthan has also identified more than 150 spots where leakages are reported, as there is a possibility of water getting contaminated if the leakages are not repaired. Corporator Girish Mishra said, “There has been talk of ashes of Covid positive bodies being immersed in Gomti and virus traces have reportedly been found in a sewer near Khadra. So testing of water samples is very important. The repairs of leakages, especially near sewer lines, must be carried out on war footing.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/civic-bodies-testing-potable-water-in-lko-all-samples-found-safe-till-now-101622228424253.html
29-05-2021||Chandigarh||Chandigarh private schools to make balance sheets public||The Punjab and Haryana high court on Friday upheld the Chandigarh administration’s law mandating private unaided schools to upload balance sheets on their websites. Independent Schools’ Association Chandigarh, a body of 78 private schools, and Kabir Education Society, Chandigarh, had moved the high court last year, challenging various provisions of Punjab Regulation of Fee of Unaided Educational Institutions Act, 2016, as extended to the Union Territory of Chandigarh. The law was adopted by the UT in 2018. The plea was filed after the UT administration issued show-cause notices to schools, asking as to why penalties should not be imposed against them for not uploading balance sheets for the last financial year. The schools had also challenged the constitution of Fee Regulatory Authority. Schools had argued that asking schools for uploading balance sheets violated their rights. “The right to privacy is primarily for the individuals. Though the right to privacy is also available to artificial entities, but since the field of education is a charitable occupation, we do not find any reason to hold that uploading of the financial statements on the websites of the private educational institutions in any manner will breach the right to privacy,” the bench of justice Jaswant Singh and justice Sant Parkash said in its 107-page judgment on Friday. ‘Will help in achieving transparency’The court also wondered as to why schools are afraid of uploading the financial statements on their websites. “The intention of the institutions to not/resist upload(ing) the financial statements create(s) more suspicion. If the private institutes upload their financial statements on the websites, it will help in achieving the goal of transparency and accountability, which are essential features of a reasonable fee structure and it will also generate confidence in the parents,” the bench said, adding that the fee structure has to be disclosed in advance, at the beginning of the session, as it would help parents make appropriate arrangements or to look for alternative institutions. The court further observed that provisions of the law in no manner infringe upon the autonomy or day-to-day functioning of the institution and same can’t be termed as “restrictive” or unreasonable. “...occupation of education is not a business, but profession involving charitable activities. Therefore, it is well permissible to promulgate regulatory measures aimed for protecting the student community as the whole, and as well as to ensure maintenance of required standards of education, which are non-exploitative,” the bench observed, adding that educational institutions are vested with right to establish and administer an institution. However, the right is not absolute and such regulations are permissible. ‘Penal provisions not remediless’As of schools’ reservations on penal provisions, the HC said that the same is attracted only in case of violation and not otherwise and also is not remediless. “... if no penal clause is incorporated in enactment, the purpose to be achieved by such enactment will be lost. The enactment would be nothing but a toothless tiger. It is only with the sword of penalty that the mechanism provided under the Act for regulating fee of unaided educational institutions can be implemented,” the bench asserted. The court also said that no prejudice has been caused by not inducting members from schools in the regulatory body. Reacting to the judgment, Independent School Association (ISA) president HS Mamik said: “We will go through the detailed judgment and decide on the next course of action.” He maintained that uploading balance sheets will affect the governance of schools and compromise their privacy.Nitin Goyal, president, Chandigarh Parents Association, said: “The education department should give schools a week or two to upload their balance sheets online, and take strict action against those who don’t comply.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarh-private-schools-to-make-balance-sheets-public-101622228364832.html

The eight-member committee, which comprised additional deputy commissioner Mohd Imran Raza among others, submitted its report after examining five complaints submitted by Covid-19 patients against Paras Hospital and Alchemist Hospital. The committee, which was set up by the deputy commissioner on May 25, found that the hospitals had not raise the bills according to rates fixed by the state government. In the case of Panchkula resident Man Singh, who got a bill of ₹4.99 lakh after being admitted to Paras Hospital on April 21 and being discharged on April 25, the committee said: “The hospital failed to comply with the instructions of Haryana government. The hospital charged 50% excess as compared to the market rate...” In another case of Chandigarh resident Vijay Kumar Goel, the committee held the patient was charged 199.6% in excess “of the legitimate bill amount”. The committee also pointed out “marked difference in charges of lab tests” while the oxygen supply had been charged extra in the case of Panchkula’s Suresh Kumar Sud. Meanwhile, Alchemist Hospital was found guilty of overcharging two patients. Milan Singh of Panchkula was admitted to the hospital on April 27 and had expired on May 12. The hospital had raised a bill of ₹3,62,864. The committee pointed out that the billing was not strictly as per government instructions and was 34% higher that the legitimate amount.

29-05-2021||Chandigarh||95% of black fungus patients in PGIMER have severe diabetes||Doctors treating cases of black fungus at Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research Chandigarh on Friday have observed that around 95% of the patients being treated here also have severe diabetes.The tertiary care hospital is witnessing a spike in the number of mucormycosis cases (black fungus) with 116 being reported in May alone, official data shows. Explaining the reasons, Dr Naresh Panda, head of otolaryngology department said that patients with compromised immunity are at high risk of developing these fungal infections due to a number of reasons and the recent one being excessive use of steroids among the Covid-19 patients. “We have observed that around 95% of patients having fungal infection also have uncontrolled diabetes and a few have a history of being administered steroids excessively. Covid-19 also impacts the immunity of a person which makes them susceptible for this infection as well,” said Dr Panda.Seeing the uptick in cases, PGIMER is also running a dedicated OT bed for black fungus cases where at least eight such patients undergo a surgery in a day. The treatment requires removal of the part infected with fungus. The dead tissues need to be removed so that antifungal drugs work better on such patients.“In around 50% of the patients, the infection reaches a level where it impacts the eyes after nose. If it reaches the brain through the eyes, then the chances of survival are less.

29-05-2021||Delhi||Sushil Kumar murder case: HC junks plea seeking restraint on ‘media trial’||The Delhi High Court on Friday declined to entertain a plea to restrain the alleged media trial of wrestler and Olympic medallist Sushil Kumar for his involvement in the death of a 23-year old man. The plea has also sought issuance of rules for reporting criminal cases.A bench of Chief Justice D N Patel and justice Jyoti Singh said a PIL cannot be filed for an individual, who is a “vigilant person”. It said the petition has been filed on behalf of a “vigilant person” (Kumar), claiming that media has defamed him by its reportage of the murder case in which he is an accused.“You cannot file a PIL for an individual. We see no reason to entertain litigation on behalf of a vigilant person,” the court said and disposed of the plea filed by a law student, Shrikant Prasad.Prasad had alleged that Kumar’s career and reputation have been damaged by the media’s reporting of the case registered against him in connection with the Chhatrasal Stadium brawl that led to the death of 23-year-old wrestler Sagar Dhankar.On May 23, a Delhi court sent Kumar to six-days’ police custody for interrogation in connection with the killing of a fellow wrestler, saying the allegations against him are serious in nature and that no one is above the law.Kumar and his associates allegedly assaulted Dhankar and two of his friends, Sonu and Amit Kumar, at the Chhatrasal stadium on the intervening night of May 4 and 5. Later, Sagar succumbed to the injuries. Kumar was arrested along with co-accused Ajay from outer Delhi’s Mundka on May 23. The two-time Olympic medallist was on the run for nearly three weeks.Delhi Police has lodged an FIR in the case under Sections 302 (murder), 308 (culpable homicide), 365 (kidnapping), 325 (causing grievous hurt), 323 (voluntarily causing hurt), 341 (wrongful restraint) and 506 (criminal intimidation) of the IPC.The FIR was also registered under sections 188 (disobedience to order by public servant), 269 (negligent act likely to spread infection of disease), 120B (criminal conspiracy) and 34 (common intention) of the IPC and various sections of the Arms Act.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/sushil-kumar-case-hc-rejects-plea-seeking-restraint-on-media-coverage-101622225965126.html
29-05-2021||Delhi||‘Everyone is living this hell’: Delhi high court on antifungal shortage||“We are living this hell. Everyone is living this hell. It’s a situation where we want to help but we are helpless,” the Delhi high court said on Friday while showing its helplessness in not being able to help anyone approaching the court for supply of Amphotericin-B, a medicine used for treatment of mucormycosis, commonly referred to as the black fungus infection.“This is a problem we all are facing. We are living this hell. All of us are living this hell where, despite our wanting to help everyone, we are not able to help,” a bench of justices Vipin Sanghi and Jasmeet Singh remarked while hearing a plea by a man who had moved to the court seeking adequate supply of Amphotericin-B.The bench, while asking the Centre to give the status of import of the medicine, said it cannot give preferential treatment to anyone while denying it to others.“The Union of India shall place a report giving the detailed current status of the said imports. It will be considered on Monday. It has to indicate how the figure of 2.3 lakh vials was arrived at, and whether there is a greater availability of the drug which could be imported,” the bench ordered after the Centre told the court that steps are being taken to procure 230,000 vials of Liposomal Amphotericin-B from six countries.The court asked the Centre to return on May 31 with a “definite statement” on the status of these 230,000 vials. It also said that the order should have reached the country from Australia, Russia, Germany, Argentina, Belgium and China, after a submission by the Centre’s counsel that the requisition was placed on May 24.“We are running against time. If you placed the order on May 24, today it should have been here… We are only expressing our anxiety because... every hour, it is assuming a new proportion,” the bench said, adding that “the effort here is to save lives and every hour matters”.Also read: Jabs shortage ‘artificial’, says AAP over supply running lowThe court was hearing two petitions seeking medicine vials for two patients admitted in Delhi hospitals. On Friday, advocate Rizwan, appearing for one of the petitioners, told the court his client’s eye had to be removed due to the shortage of the drug.The issue of shortage was first raised by lawyer-petitioner Rakesh Malhotra in a batch of petitions seeking better facilities on Covid-19 for the residents of the city.The Centre, during the proceedings, informed the court that there are 14,872 patients under treatment for black fungus in the country. It said that Delhi had 423 patients, even as the city government has put the figure above 600.“Out of the sources that have been presently identified abroad, the ministry of health and family welfare (MoHFW) on May 24 has called upon ministry of external affairs (MEA) to take steps to procure 230,000 vials of Liposomal Amphotericin-B from Australia, Russia, Germany, Argentina, Belgium and China.“MEA has also been called upon to procure 50,000 tablets of Isavuconazole. Steps in this regard are being taken by the MEA,” the Centre told the court.It said that the domestic production of Amphotericin-B has gone up from 62,000 vials per month in April to 140,000 vials in May. It is expected to reach 325,114 vials in June, the Centre said. It said the main impediment in granting more licences for manufacture of Amphotericin-B injection is the worldwide shortage of the raw materials.The Centre submitted that 400 vials were allocated to Delhi government on May 24, 300 vials on May 26, and 1,920 vials on May 27.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/living-hell-hc-remarks-on-shortage-of-black-fungus-medicine-101622225844631.html

The distribution will be done at 280 government schools, said Delhi’s food and civil supplies minister Imran Hussain on Friday.“Needy people who don’t possess ration cards, including unorganised workers, migrant workers, building and construction workers, domestic helps are eligible to receive food grains under this relief initiative. Ration will be provided to a maximum of ₹2 lakh beneficiaries in the initial phase. Later, as per demand and need assessment from the field, the initiative can be extended up to 20 lakh beneficiaries,” said Hussain in a press statement.He further said, “The non- PDS (public distribution system) ration shall be distributed from designated schools from 10am to 4pm, with weekly off on Sunday. Each school identified for distribution of non-PDS ration will be provided a login ID and password for entering the stock received.” He added that the details entered will help in keeping a proper record for the purpose of registration and distribution.Government documents seen by HT showed that the 280 schools will be identified to ensure four distribution points in each of the 70 assembly constituencies in the city.The government has also started looking for transporters for carrying the ration from the three designated godowns in Narela, Mayapuri and Gheora to the schools.Senior government officials, however, said they are yet to decide the exact date of starting the ration distribution system under the scheme.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/2-million-who-don-t-have-ration-card-to-get-free-food-grains-in-delhi-101622225724613.html

We will take decision on the basis of their reports.”Besides, the state agriculture department was also carrying out a separate crop damage assessment in order to provide compensation to farmers who faced loss due to heavy rains, agriculture department director Nisha Oraon Singhmar said .State disaster management minister Banna Gupta said, “All districts have been asked to begin assessment of damage caused by heavy rains at the earliest and send report to the department. We will take decision on the basis of their reports.”Incessant rains triggered by cyclone Yaas for past two days caused heavy damage in the state. Hundreds of people were displaced after their houses were damaged, while and thousands of acres of vegetable crops were also destroyed. However, weather improved in Jharkhand on Friday with the depression moving out of the state.Meanwhile, chief minister Hemant Soren on Friday ordered a probe into collapse of a bridge in Ranchi’s Tamar block due to heavy rains on Thursday. He said in a tweet, “Corruption and loot of public money will not be tolerated during my tenure.”A three-member probe team was set up in this regard, rural department officials said.The bridge was constructed at a cost of ₹8 crore on Kanchi river, known as Haradih-Buradih bridge, that connects Ranchi’s Tamar block to Bundu and Sonahatu. The foundation of the bridge was laid in 2011. The 500m-long bridge with 25 pillars was operational for past five years without any official inauguration, officials said.However, village residents said sand mining from the bridge area was the reason behind its collapse.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ranchi-news/cyclone-yaas-state-begins-damage-assessment-cm-orders-probe-in-bridge-collapse-101622217383131.html
29-05-2021||Other||Alumni of Fergusson College’s psychology department offer free counselling||PUNE A group of alumni from Fergusson College’s psychology department has banded together for a cause. The collective goal is to offer free counselling to those in need. Helmed by arts-based therapist Gauri Kaulgud, and actor Parna Pethe, both former Fergusson College students, and post graduates in clinical psychology, this stint involves the participation of 20-odd highly qualified, practising and experienced counsellors. Speaking about what prompted her to spearhead this activity, Pethe explains, “The second wave of the pandemic hit the city, and wreaked tremendous havoc. There has been constant news about a lot of people being hospitalised, some losing their loved ones, quite a few going through unemployment, and the others trying to come to terms with the anxiety and uncertainty around. I felt in these harsh times, there is an immense need for people to find a place to express, grieve, vent, and seek help, without worrying about money.”To put her ideas into action, and to launch a free emotional support intervention, Pethe joined hands with Kaulgud, a counsellor at the city-based Avasara academy, a school. Kaulgud’s work spans a range of demographics, and includes young adults, children with special needs, primary caregivers, and children from lower socio-economic and vulnerable backgrounds. Speaking about how the initiative works, Kaulgud said that they have been circulating flyers on social media, so the ones who need to connect with them, are able to find them. Throwing light on the modus operandi, she said, “When we get a call, either Parna or I take it; we are the first points of contact. Then, based on the nature of the caller’s concerns, we direct them to the most relevant counsellor from our group. That counsellor takes it forward from there.”Pethe added that all counsellors who are a part of this initiative have dedicated a fixed set of time slots for taking calls. This helps keep the process organised. “We also arrange follow-up sessions, if need be. And after a counselling session, we take feedback from the callers about their experiences,” said Pethe.So far, their group has counselled at least 100 people. These people can broadly be put into two categories; first, those in a quandary either because they’re Covid positive, or someone from their families has succumbed to the infection. The second category is people who are unsettled due to prevailing circumstances. Their issues are typically about feeling fretful due to constantly being confined at home with family members, or they’re anxious about getting infected, and losing jobs, among other concerns. Pethe said, “The concerns surrounding the pandemic are not just about physical or mental health; they’re also largely social, political, and administrative. Unemployment is a pressing concern. Another big segment of disturbed callers is students, who think that if the situation doesn’t improve, their future is bleak.”For this group of counsellors, the way forward is still taking shape. “This group came to life rather spontaneously, but we’re functioning in a very organised manner. The response has been overwhelming, and only reaffirms the need for such an intervention in the long run. We are planning to conduct group sessions for frontline workers. We are also open to collaborations, or any new ideas that will help us better doing our bit,” concluded the duo.Counselling service hotlinePlease call: 7414948259; timing: 10am to 5pm||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/alumni-of-fergusson-college-s-psychology-department-offer-free-counselling-101622215702894.html
29-05-2021||Other||Welfare schemes, tussle with rivals mark 2 years of Jagan tenure||It was a year of consolidation of power and controversies for Yuvajana Sramika Rythu Congress Party (YSRCP) president and Andhra Pradesh chief minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy, who will complete two years in office on Sunday.The Navaratnalu (nine jewels) welfare schemes and a slew of other populist schemes that began during the first year of the YSRCP coming to power picked up pace during the second year of Reddy’s rule, the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic notwithstanding, consolidating his vote bank and fetching him tremendous mileage in the local body elections.Apart from direct benefit transfer (DBT) schemes like Amma Vodi (cash incentive to women who send their children to schools), enhanced pensions, fee reimbursement scheme, YSR Zero Interest Scheme, etc .that were introduced in the first year, Reddy came up with a calendar of various other welfare schemes for farmers, weavers, lawyers, autorickshaw drivers, hawkers, fishermen etc., covering every section of the population, to increase the YSRCP’s votebank.The distribution of 2,500,000 housing sites for economically weaker sections of the population on December 25 last year brought Reddy massive goodwill.“It was a sort of social engineering by Reddy, who ensured that not a single section of people is left out in the implementation of welfare schemes. He even covered upper castes like Brahmins, Kapus and Reddys, besides minorities,” said political analyst Sangem Ramakrishna.The establishment of village and ward secretariats to bring the administration to the villages and towns firmly entrenched the YSRCP at the grassroots level. Over 300,000 village and ward volunteers, who were appointed to deliver the benefits of various government schemes, be it pensions or ration, directly to the beneficiaries at their doorsteps, proved a masterstroke for him.But in his eagerness to implement his welfare agenda, Reddy has not focussed much on industrial and infrastructure development. Though his government came up with an industrial policy seeking to provide a lot of incentives to the sector, no major industries have been grounded in the state. No new infrastructure projects have come up in the last two years.“We had several grandiose plans for the development of Vizag-Chennai industrial corridor and Kakinada special economic zone. But the pandemic has virtually stalled everything,” a YSRCP leader, who asked not to be named, said.The indiscriminate borrowing by the Reddy government to implement its welfare schemes has also left the state exchequer virtually bankrupt. “The state is totally dependent on loans. As of today [Friday], the total outstanding debt of the state stands at ₹4.47 lakh crore and in the last two years, the Reddy government borrowed ₹1.60 lakh crore,” former finance minister and TDP lawmaker Yanamala Ramakrishnudu said.State finance minister Buggana Rajendranath Reddy, however, said during the recent budget presentation that the state had to borrow enormous amounts of money because of the crippling of state finances because of the Covid-19 pandemic.What marred the otherwise welfare-oriented rule of Reddy were his acts of vengeance against his political rivals and confrontation with constitutional institutions, including judiciary. Many of his decisions taken in a hurry – such as creating three capitals for the state in place of existing capital Amaravati, introducing English medium in all government schools, removing the state election commissioner by promulgating an ordinance, acquiring land for house site schemes and painting of government buildings with YSRCP colours have come under the scanner of the judiciary.This led to Reddy launching a tirade against the judiciary, going to the extent of lodging a complaint with former Chief Justice of India (CJI) SA Bobde, accusing second-most senior Supreme Court NV Ramana of colluding with TDP president N Chandrababu Naidu and a few judges of the state high court to dislodge his government. He even attributed the land scam in Amaravati to justice Ramana, but the CJI dismissed his petition after due inquiry.“It appears Reddy has crossed all limits in acting with vengeance against his political rivals, aimed at finishing them politically and financially. The closure of Amara Raja firms owned by TDP MP Galla Jayadev and seizure of Sangam Dairy from ex-MLA Dhulipalla Narendra are classic examples of his vengeance politics. This has never been heard of in any other state,” said senior journalist and political analyst Suresh Dharur. His prolonged legal battle over the sudden postponement of local body elections in March 2020 due to the outbreak of Covid-19 with previous state election commissioner Nimmagadda Ramesh Kumar, which Reddy lost, also showed his aggressive approach to whoever had opposed his decisions. Reddy was displeased with the announcement postponing the elections.In the last one year, many TDP leaders, including state unit president K Atchannaidu, Kollu Ravindra, Dhulipalla Narendra, Chintamaneni Prabhakar, JC Prabhakar Reddy, JC Asmith Reddy and BC Janardhan Reddy were arrested in various cases. Even TDP president N Chandrababu Naidu was booked by the CID for his alleged role in the acquisition of assigned lands in Amaravati.Reddy ordered several inquiries, alleging insider trading on part of rival political leaders during the land acquisition process for Amaravati, but the cases are still being heard in court. The filing of a sedition case against his own party MP from Narasapuram K Raghurama Krishnam Raju for questioning his government policies clearly displayed his intolerant attitude.Dharur said Reddy appeared to be of the view that he was above any criticism after receiving a huge mandate with 151 of his party MLAs in the 175-member assembly. “The way he fixed even two Telugu television channels [the TV channels regularly telecast Raju’s press conferences] in the sedition case along with Raju shows he cannot tolerate any negative talk about him,” he said. In the last one year, the chief minster made several attempts to shift the administrative capital from Amaravati to Visakhapatnam, but it did not work out due to court litigations and the pandemic.“The two-year rule of Reddy is marked by corruption, political victimisation and hatred for his rivals. There is no job creation and dreams of the youth are shattered. The economy in shambles,” TDP chief Naidu said.The Reddy government, however, claimed that it could fulfil over 90% promises he had made in the party manifesto.“It [the government] has implemented several revolutionary programmes which were never heard of in the past, covering all sections of people,” an official note from the government, listing its achievements in various sectors, said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/ap-cm-reddy-s-2-yr-rule-marked-by-welfare-schemes-fights-with-political-rivals-101622211803220.html
29-05-2021||Chandigarh||Eye on polls, Punjab cuts power tariff up to 20% for marginal consumers||Patiala Months ahead of the assembly elections in Punjab, the Punjab State Electricity Regulatory Commission (PSERC) on Friday reduced the power tariff for domestic consumers with monthly consumption of less than 300 units by up to 20%. According to the PSERC order, the per unit tariff for domestic consumers with load up to 2kW and consumption slabs of 0 to 100 units and 101 to 300 units has been reduced by ₹1 and 50 paise, respectively. For domestic consumers having a load between 2kW and 7kW and for consumption slabs of 0 to 100 units and 101 to 300 units, the rates have been reduced by 75 paise and 50 paise, respectively. Initially, the Punjab State Power Corporation Limited (PSPCL) had demanded a 9% tariff hike only to revise the petition, seeking a slash in the rate reportedly at government’s insistence. “This shall result in financial relief to the tune of ₹682 crore to these consumers. The new slabs will come into force from June 1,” reads the order issued by PSERC chairman Viswajeet Khanna. To provide respite to domestic consumers, the PSERC has passed on the burden on other segments of consumers. The non-domestic consumers will pay almost 24% of the subsidy. The tariff for above 7kW of load has been increased by almost 5%, which also includes a hike in fixed charges. Now, the average per unit power cost in Punjab is ₹6.41, the pooled purchase cost is ₹4.54. “The decision will bring relief to 69-lakh domestic consumers in the state,” chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh said in a press release.“Once again the political face of the PSERC is out. The commission has given relief to the lower sections and put the burden on other sections including residential and industry,” said Badish Jindal, president of Federation of Punjab Small Industries Associations. No change for small, medium industries Small and medium industrial consumers and non-residential supply (NRS) consumers have not been burdened with any increase. The tariff for agricultural power (AP) consumers has been increased marginally by 9 paise. With this, the agriculture cross-subsidy has been reduced from (-) 14.41% to (-) 12.05%. The commission has worked out a power subsidy of ₹10,668 crore for the current fiscal. There is a shortfall of ₹7,117.8 crore of subsidy amount paid by the Punjab government by March 31, 2021.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/in-poll-year-power-tariff-reduced-by-20-in-punjab-101622200692602.html
29-05-2021||Bangalore||Bengaluru rape case: 2 accused shot in leg ‘while trying to escape’, say police||Two of the four men arrested for allegedly raping and torturing a woman, suspected to have been trafficked from Bangladesh, were injured on Friday when they were fired at as they allegedly tried to flee after attacking a police party that took them to the crime scene in Bengaluru, officials said.Six people, including two women, were arrested from Bengaluru’s Ramamurthy Nagaron on Thursday after a video circulating online purportedly showed the men raping and torturing the woman, who is believed to be in her early 20s. Two other women, also named as accused, were purportedly seen in the video.A police officer, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the 3.5 minute-video appeared to be at least 10 days old. “They used bottles to assault her (the woman), and they were shooting the entire ordeal,” the officer said.The incident took place in Bengaluru last week.The rape survivor was traced to Kerala after the alleged incident and brought back to the city by the police on Friday. Her condition is stable and she is undergoing tests in Bengaluru.Bengaluru police said the two accused, aged 25 and 23, were shot in their legs by the security team in self-defence when the four men -- also believed to be Bangladeshi immigrants -- were taken to a house for recreation of the crime scene on Friday morning. The two who were injured -- Ridoy Babu and Sagar -- are admitted to a government-run hospital in Bengaluru and their condition is stable, police said.Also Read | ‘No template of apt behaviour after assault’: Experts on Tarun Tejpal verdictThe other two arrested men were identified as Mohammed Baba Sheikh and Hakeel. Police did not identify the two women arrested in the case as they are suspected to be victims of human trafficking as well.In a statement late on Thursday, Bengaluru Police said the six arrests were made based on the images of the suspects from the video shared by the Assam Police earlier this week.“On the basis of the contents of the video clip and facts as disclosed during preliminary interrogation of the secured persons, a case of rape, assault and under other relevant provisions of law has been registered against the accused...” the statement added.Bengaluru police commissioner Kamal Pant said on Thursday that all the accused and the survivor are believed to be from Bangladesh. “Due to financial differences, the culprits brutalised the victim, who is also said to be a Bangladeshi, brought to India for human trafficking.”The incident was flagged by Assam Police first on Thursday morning, and later redirected to the Bengaluru police after they received information about a possible suspect in the city.“So we formed our teams to follow these leads and were able to detain one of them and based on the information provided we arrested the rest of the accused,” Pant said.Another police officer said on the condition of anonymity that the Bangladesh Police helped identify one of the suspects -- Ridoy Babu, of Tejgaon in Dhaka -- based on his TikTok account and the video circulating online.“The cops tracked down his (Babu’s) family and made his uncle call him on WhatsApp. On the call, Ridoy admitted that he was one of those seen in the video. He (Babu) also identified the victim. This was what we have been told (by Bangladesh police),” the officer said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/two-accused-in-bengaluru-rape-shot-in-the-leg-while-trying-to-escape-police-101622188391644.html
29-05-2021||Kolkata||Narada sting: HC grants interim bail to senior Trinamool leaders||The Calcutta high court granted interim bail to four senior West Bengal politicians on Friday in connection with the 2016 Narada corruption case, ending their eight-day-long house arrest.A five-judge bench directed the four accused leaders to furnish bail bonds of ₹2 lakh with two sureties of similar amounts. The court directed that the accused - ministers Subrata Mukherjee and Firhad Hakim, Trinamool Congress (TMC) legislator Madan Mitra and former Kolkata mayor Sovan Chatterjee - will not give any press interview or make any public comment in connection with the cases pending in the high court or trial court.“The court has granted interim bail. They will have to abide by certain conditions imposed by the court,” said Manishankhar Chatterjee, Mukherjee’s lawyer.The leaders were sent in judicial custody on May 17 after the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) arrested them and the high court stayed the bail order by a lower court. On May 21, they were placed under house arrest.Also Read | SC denies stay on TMC leaders’ house arrest in Narada caseMitra’s lawyer, Niladri Bhattacharya, said the court directed the four to join the investigation by video conference and restrained them from speaking about the pending trial. “The interim bail will, however, be subject to final outcome of the case,” he said.Solicitor general Tushar Mehta, representing CBI, objected to interim bail and said the leaders could use their influence to tamper with evidence, make public statements regarding this case, or gather a mob whenever they are called for further investigation or the case is taken up for hearing.Mitra is under treatment at a state-run hospital, while the remaining three have returned home.The case against the four leaders pertains to news portal Narada News’s two-year-long sting operation.The videos of the operation were uploaded months ahead of the 2016 West Bengal assembly elections and purportedly showed some TMC leaders accepting money in exchange for alleged favours to a fictitious company.TMC has linked the arrests to Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)’s loss in the assembly polls. It has questioned why CBI did not arrest Suvendu Adhikari and Mukul Roy, who were also seen in the sting videos, but have since defected from TMC to BJP.On Tuesday, the Supreme Court had refused to interfere with the house arrest order, prompting the agency to withdraw its petition.CBI’s plea to transfer the Narada trial out of the state is also pending before the high court. It has named West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee, law minister Moloy Ghatak, and lawmaker Kalyan Banerjee as respondents in its plea to transfer the case. It has claimed TMC’s protests against the arrests hampered its probe and intimidated lower courts.Banerjee staged a six-hour sit-in at the CBI’s office in Kolkata after the four were arrested.Ghatak led nearly 3,000 workers and supporters to the court premises. Outside CBI’s office, hundreds of TMC supporters staged a protest and threw bricks, bottles, and shoes at central forces.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/narada-sting-calcutta-hc-grants-interim-bail-to-four-political-leaders-101622188211496.html

He dismissed the European Union’s reaction -- including a recommendation to airlines to stop flying over Belarus and plans for new sanctions on the country -- as “based on emotions.”Russia will look for ways to expand air service with Belarus to make up for some of the routes affected by the EU’s limits on Minsk’s state airline, Peskov said.The $500 million -- to be released in the near future -- is part of $1.5 billion in loans that was agreed last year and had been expected by the end of next month. Lukashenko didn’t ask for further assistance, Peskov said, but the two leaders did discuss closer tax and customs cooperation.In their second day of talks, they went sailing on the Black Sea, Peskov said.The U.S. administration announced it would re-impose sanctions against nine Belarusian state-owned enterprises late Friday, and is developing additional penalties to target government officials.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/putin-pushes-ahead-with-belarus-loan-as-tensions-grow-101622310813276.html
29-05-2021||World||Mehul Choksi row lights up a political firestorm in Antigua, PM Browne hits back||Antigua and Barbuda prime minister Gaston Browne on Saturday hit back at opposition party United Progressive Party (UPP) and accused it of supporting fugitive diamantaire Mehul Choksi in order to secure campaign funding.“After mischievously accusing my administration of harbouring Mehul Choksi, who has an Interpol Red Notice, they are now seeking to sanitize this fugitive to get campaign funding. My administration’s revocation of Choksi’s citizenship has been frustrated by a litigation brought against the state,” Gaston Browne said according to reports in Antiguan media.“We are determined to revoke Choksi’s citizenship and to concurrently pursue his extradition to India to face criminal charges there. There has been no violation of Choksi’s legal and constitutional protections, despite the decision of my administration to revoke his citizenship,” Browne further added. Browne last week said that if Choksi flees the country his citizenship will be revoked. Choksi was reported missing on May 25 after he went to the southern side of the island for dining at a restaurant.The UPP earlier in the day accused Browne of ‘corrupting the rule of law’ referring to Browne’s request to the Dominican authorities to send Choksi to India directly and not repatriate him to Antigua and Barbados. “It was the Gaston Browne administration that granted citizenship to Mr. Choksi. As inconvenient and embarrassing as it may be for the government, Mr. Choksi is a citizen of Antigua and Barbuda – not India,” the UPP said according to a report by news agency Antigua News Room.Choksi, who is currently in Dominica, claimed that he was abducted and taken to the island by force. The Eastern Caribbean Supreme Court said that it will hear a habeas corpus petition filed by Choksi’s lawyers Wayne Marsh and Vijay Aggarwal last week denting India’s hopes of extraditing Choksi, who is wanted in a ₹13,500 crore loan fraud case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/mehul-choksi-row-lights-up-a-political-firestorm-in-antigua-pm-browne-hits-back-101622310686498.html

But the attention was mostly on the concert-goers.The Paris public hospital authority helped organize the event to determine whether it’s safe to allow 5,000 masked people to dance together in the open pit of an indoor concert arena without social distancing.The attendees are seeing the show for free but were required to take three virus tests, two before and one after the concert. To further reduce risk, organizers only allowed people 18-45 years old without underlying health conditions to participate, according to the hospital authority.France has not allowed such music concerts since early 2020. Cultural venues were shut for most of the past 14 months as authorities tried to contain persistent surges of virus infections that filled hospitals and were linked to more than 109,000 deaths.France’s Covid-19 hospitalization rates and confirmed cases have steadily shrank in recent weeks as vaccinations increase.Similar test concerts have been held in other European countries recently, including Spain, the Netherlands and Britain.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/dancing-like-there-s-no-covid-19-paris-hosts-test-concert-101622309638281.html

The container yard of the port has been partly shut since last week after an outbreak of Covid-19 among port staff and in the broader community, state media reported.The disruptions will continue into the coming week, with shipping firm AP Moller-Maersk A/S reporting delays in its schedules due to the closure. Any delays will likely put further pressure on the already sky-high costs of shipping goods from China, which have soared on record export demand, a shortage of containers, and other factors.Those shipping costs are just one of the factors boosting the price of China’s exports, which is threatening to fuel global inflation.Yantian is one of the busiest ports in the world, with a cargo throughput of 13.34 million twenty-foot equivalent unit in 2020, a standard measurement used in freight industry, according to figures from the Shenzhen Transportation Bureau. It serves about 100 ships a week, according to a report on a Shenzhen government website.The local government said in a notice Friday it will conduct mass testing of the entire population of the Yantian district.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-outbreak-partly-closes-one-of-china-s-busiest-ports-101622304319906.html
29-05-2021||World||Americans will hit the road with highest fuel price since 2014||Americans will hit the road this holiday weekend with the highest gasoline prices in seven years and the White House promising to monitor fuel costs.The national average price at the pump hit $3.045 per gallon this month, the highest since 2014, and was just a 10th of a cent below that on Friday, according to data from auto club AAA.“The President knows that gas prices are a pain point for Americans,” White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said in a statement Friday. “President Biden is opposed to any proposals to raise the gas tax. And it’s why we will continue to monitor prices, and are glad that Americans can get on the road again.”Gasoline demand is roaring back close to levels seen before the pandemic as the world’s largest economy opens up and avid drivers take to the roads after a year of lockdowns and restrictions.Summer gasoline demand may average out to normal, with some weeks above record levels at 10 million barrels per day, said Patrick De Haan, head of petroleum analysis at GasBuddy. Any disruption to refinery supplies in the form of a hurricane or unexpected outage could send prices surging.“The worry is that any hiccup could be made worse by the truck driver shortage, leading to slow restorations and further price implications,” De Haan said in an email.The weekend before the Memorial Day holiday on Monday typically marks the start of the U.S. driving season.National demand for gasoline, as measured by the four-week average for supplied fuel, has jumped above 9 million barrels a day for the first time since March of last year, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.That’s at a time when the country’s gasoline supply is straining to recover from the week-long shutdown earlier this month of the Colonial pipeline. The nation’s largest fuel pipeline, which takes gasoline and diesel from the Gulf Coast to the East Coast, was temporarily hobbled by a cyberattack, touching off regional gasoline shortages.Restoring regional supplies hasn’t been as easy as restarting the flow of fuels, in part because of a severe shortage of trucks and drivers needed to ferry gas from hubs to retailers. And refineries are operating at some of the lowest seasonal rates in almost a decade, as a result of the drop in demand during the pandemic.In her statement, Psaki said that prices are in line with where they’ve been in recent years in real terms, or when discounted for inflation.“As Americans are hitting the road, they are paying less in real terms for gas than they have on average over the last 15 years,” she said. “They’re paying about the same as they did in May 2018 and May 2019.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/americans-will-hit-the-road-with-highest-fuel-price-since-2014-101622295235721.html
29-05-2021||World||Covid-19 has no ‘credible natural ancestor’, created in Wuhan lab, new study claims||The novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 has no ‘credible natural ancestor’ and was created by Chinese scientists while working on ‘gain-of-function' research in a Wuhan lab, according to a Daily Mail report citing a new study. The report claimed that the scientists took a natural coronavirus ‘backbone’ found in bats and added a new ‘spike’ which turned it into deadly and highly transmissible SARS-CoV-2.British Professor Angus Dalgleish and Norwegian scientist Dr Birger Sørensen authored the new 22-page paper which is set to be published in the Quarterly Review of Biophysics Discovery, as per Daily Mail. The study reportedly claimed that the Chinese scientists also tried to cover their tracks by reverse-engineering the viruses to make it look like they naturally arose from bats.Quoting the authors, Daily Mail said that the duo had “prima facie evidence of retro-engineering in China” for a year but was ignored by academics and major journals. The study also accuses Chinese labs of “deliberate destruction, concealment or contamination of data.”What is gain-of-function research?Gain-of-function research alters an organism or disease in a way that increases the transmissibility and/or virulence of pathogens. Scientists work on gain-of-function projects to study their potential effects on humans in order to stay ahead of the curve of potential new diseases. But it also carries a risk of an outbreak if not conducted safely.Also Read | Why is Chinese state media targeting Fauci amid Wuhan lab controversy?The US Senate on Tuesday passed an amendment to permanently ban the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and other federal agencies from funding gain-of-function research projects in China.“We don’t know whether the pandemic started in a lab in Wuhan or evolved naturally,” Republican senator Rand Paul, who sponsored the amendment, said in a statement.The NIH had released a statement last week, saying neither the research agency nor the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) ever approved any grant to support “gain-of-function” research on coronaviruses that would have increased their transmissibility or lethality for humans. The US agency also urged the World Health Organization (WHO) to begin the second phase of their investigation without delay.“While many still deny funding gain-of-function research in Wuhan … the passage of my amendment ensures that this never happens in the future,” said Paul.The scientific community is yet to find the origin of coronavirus disease (Covid-19) and renewed demand by the United States to reinvestigate the source has angered China. In a video message to the 74th World Health Assembly (WHA), US health secretary Xavier Becerra demanded independence for international experts to fully assess the source of the virus which has claimed more than 3.5 million lives so far.Also Read | Facebook says won't remove posts claiming Covid-19 is 'man-made'The speculation around the virus origin was fuelled by top US infectious disease expert Dr Anthony Fauci’s comment during a virtual event hosted by Poynter Institute. Fauci said that he was not convinced with the theory that the virus “developed naturally”, stressing that the world should continue to investigate “what went on in China.”US President Joe Biden on Wednesday ordered intelligence officials to “redouble” efforts to probe the origins of the pandemic, including the possibility of a Chinese laboratory link. Biden said in a statement that the majority of the intelligence community had “coalesced” around two scenarios but “do not believe there is sufficient information to assess one to be more likely than the other.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-has-no-credible-natural-ancestor-created-in-wuhan-lab-new-study-claims-101622300739493.html
29-05-2021||World||Egypt court adjourns Suez ship case for more compensation talks||An Egypt court on Saturday adjourned a case on the container ship that blocked the Suez Canal to allow for more time to negotiate for a compensation.The court in Ismailia town postponed the hearing to June 20 after requests from lawyers representing the Suez Canal Authority and the owner of the 400-meter-long Ever Given.The authority was claiming more than more than $916 million in damages linked to the waterway’s six-day closure in March, which roiled shipping markets. But it lowered the figure in out-of-court negotiations to $550 million, saying it has miscalculated the value of the cargoes aboard of the ship. The vessel’s insurers said the demand is still too high.“There are endeavors to reach a settlement and because they are good clients, we are asking the court to postpone to negotiate and study the offer submitted by the owners,” Nabil Zidan, the lawyer for the Suez Canal Authority, said in the court.“Negotiations are on and there’s flexibility from both sides,” said Ahmed Abu Shanab, the ship owner’s lawyer.Ahead of the hearing on Sunday, Zidan said the Suez Canal Authority will recalculate its claim, without elaborating on what that means for the lawsuit or what the new figure will be.The Ever Given’s owner has previously offered to pay $150 million, according to the authority, which says that doesn’t cover losses of transit fees, damage to the waterway and costs of equipment and labor.The Ever Given is owned by Shoei Kisen Kaisha Ltd. and was freed on March 29 after a salvage operation and sailed to the Great Bitter Lake, about halfway along the canal, where it has been kept ever since.About 50 ships a day pass through the Suez canal, which can cut a voyage between Europe and Asia by two weeks. More than 400 vessels were held up by the blockage, though most were able to pass through the channel soon after it was reopened. Egypt in May started dredging to widen the southern end of the canal where the Ever Given got stuck.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/egypt-court-adjourns-suez-ship-case-for-more-compensation-talks-101622293902797.html

The concentration of virus in the throat fluid increases rapidly and spreads very strongly to the surrounding environment."He did not specify the number of cases recorded with this new variant but said Vietnam will soon announce the discovery in the world's map of genetic strains.There were seven known coronavirus variants in Vietnam before Long's announcement, according to the Ministry of Health.The communist country has previously received widespread applause for its aggressive pandemic response, with mass quarantines and strict contact tracing helping keep infection rates relatively low.The new round of infections has made the public and government fearful and authorities quickly moved to place strict limits on movement and business activity.Cafes, restaurants, hair salons and massage parlours as well as tourism and religious spots have been ordered to close in various areas of the country.Vietnam -- a country of 97 million people -- has vaccinated a little over a million citizens.It is now ramping up its jab rollout and hopes to achieve herd immunity by the end of the year, according to the minister for health.Authorities have called on people and businesses to donate money to help procure vaccines, while embassies and international organisations have been contacted for assistance, state media reported.The country presently has close to two million doses of AstraZeneca's vaccine remaining, but said it is buying more than 30 million doses of the Pfizer shot.It is also in talks with Russia to produce Sputnik V, according to state media, and is working on a home-grown vaccine.In nearby Thailand, the government on Saturday took exception to media reports in Britain that labelled a new strain causing concern there as the Thai variant.The strain was first detected in Thailand in a 33-year-old Egyptian traveller, UK health authorities said, but 109 cases have since been found in Britain."Principally speaking, it should not be called the Thai variant because the infected person is from overseas," said Opas Kankawinpong, head of Thailand's disease control department.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/vietnam-discovers-new-hybrid-virus-variant-a-combination-of-strains-from-india-uk-report-101622291526911.html

Citing people familiar with the development, Saudi Press Agency said that the travel ban will be lifted from 11 countries starting 1am on Monday (local time). The travellers from these countries will, however, be required to go through institutional quarantine, SPA reported.Earlier this month, Saudi Arabia allowed vaccinated individuals to fly abroad as it eased a ban on international travel aimed at containing coronavirus and its new variants. But the ease in travel restrictions excluded 20 countries where the ban on flights continued as a part of Covid-19 preventive measures.The ban, which originally came into effect on February 3, applied to all non-citizens, diplomats, health practitioners and their families who have passed through any of the prohibited countries in the 14 days prior to their application to enter Saudi Arabia.Also Read | Saudi Arabia will start issuing tourist visas again soon, official saysNow the kingdom has decided to lift the ban from 11 of them based on the Public Health Authority's report regarding the epidemiological situation which “showed stability and effectiveness in controlling the pandemic” in those countries, reported SPA.Here’s the list of countries from which Saudi Arabia will lift the ban:The travel ban will continue to remain in effect for the remaining nine countries, including India and Pakistan.Here’s the list of countries where Saudi Arabia’s travel ban will remain in effect:(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/saudi-arabia-lifts-travel-ban-from-11-countries-india-and-pakistan-excluded-here-s-the-list-101622290809096.html
29-05-2021||World||Friends: The Reunion censored in China||A laudatory article by China’s official Xinhua news agency on Friends: The Reunion has talked about the sitcom’s “unique appeal” and “massive influence” but glossed over how censors here clipped several minutes before screening the special show in China.The article quoted Chinese citizens heaping praise on the American sitcom - which has a huge following in urban China - and how it influenced their lives from helping them to learn English and giving them a peek into American culture.But, the Xinhua article left out how Chinese streaming sites had carefully censored the appearances of Justin Bieber, Lady Gaga, the South Korean boy band, BTS and LGBTQ references from the version aired.It is still unclear whether Chinese government ordered the cuts or whether the streaming platforms, iQiyi, Youku and Tencent Video, themselves decided against airing what they knew would be sensitive to the government.The musicians and the censored band have fallen foul of Beijing over the years.Lady Gaga, for one, is a persona non grata in China following her meeting with the Dalai Lama in 2016.Beijing accuses the Tibetan leader and Nobel Peace Prize winner of being a “dangerous separatist”.And, Bieber first came under fire in China in 2014 for photographing himself visiting Tokyo’s controversial Yasukuni war shrine, a site that honours Japanese World War II war criminals alongside other casualties of war, the entertainment news website, Variety, reported.Not that the cuts went unnoticed in China.“Are we reverting to the isolationist Qing dynasty, closed off to the rest of the world?” a commenter on China’s Twitter-like Weibo platform was quoted as saying by Variety.Many supported the censorship as well.The Xinhua article acknowledged the sitcom’s enduring influence in China.“The highly anticipated reunion special of the American sitcom Friends has taken its massive Chinese fan base by storm with a nostalgic and tear-jerking tribute to the all-time hit series,” the article said.It went on to report how the reunion special made it to among the top 10 trending topics on China’s Twitter-like Sina Weibo on Thursday night, with netizens saying the reunion has allowed them to “relive their youth” or simply expressing their longtime affection for the series.In China, the series was “…much more than a TV comedy from the outset”.It first gained popularity in the late 1990s as a tool for learning the English language. Then, the country’s post-1980s and post-1990s generations discovered its unique appeal as a window to learn about the American culture, the Xinhua article said.Overall, the response in China to the episode has been overwhelmingly positive, with countless fans describing how the special brought tears to their eyes, the Variety article pointed out.“This whole show brings up so many memories - I’ve watched all ten seasons more than a dozen times. I don’t have many friends, but they are really like friends of mine,” a Weibo user wrote.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/friends-the-reunion-censored-in-china-101622288851172.html

This is the first in-country detection of the latter strain, the NIH said in a statement.As per protocols, contact tracing of all the cases is in progress by the Field Epidemiology & Disease Surveillance Division and District Health Office (DHO), Islamabad, the report said.The NIH said the continued detection of global strains highlighted the ongoing need for observation of guidelines, usage of masks and need for vaccination.After India’s outbreak of Covid-19 fuelled by the new strain earlier this year, Pakistan in April imposed a ban on travellers arriving from the neighbouring country via the air, sea and land routes, he report said.However, in May, the variant was detected in Thai travellers who had visited Pakistan, the report said.Health authorities in Thailand had confirmed the country’s first cases of the variant first identified in India in a Thai woman and her 4-year-old son who were reportedly put in state quarantine since arriving from Pakistan, it said.The World Health Organization (WHO) earlier said that the B.1.617 strain of coronavirus was found in dozens of countries all over the world.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/first-case-of-b-1-617-covid-19-variant-found-in-pakistan-101622284893922.html

Jeremy Corbell on Thursday posted a 46-second clip on Twitter, saying the event was captured in June 2019 by the Combat Information Centre of the USS Omaha, an Independence-class littoral combat ship, off the coast of San Diego.The clip shows a radar screen in which several objects can be seen moving around the ship. "Holy sh*t! They're moving fast...They're turning around," an unidentified man is heard saying. Corbell, the filmmaker behind the documentary 'Bob Lazar: Area 51 & Flying Saucers', said that the footage is “corroborative electro-optic data demonstrating a significant UFO event series.”2019 US Navy warships were swarmed by UFOs; here's the RADAR footage that shows that. Filmed in the Combat Information Center of the USS Omaha / July 15th 2019 / this is corroborative electro-optic data demonstrating a significant UFO event series in a warning area off San Diego. pic.twitter.com/bZS5wbLuLlEarlier this month, Obama, on James Corden’s 'The Late Late Show', was asked about the issues of UFOs, which has remained on the fringe for a long time. The former president acknowledged that there’s evidence on mysterious objects with inexplicable behaviour that "we can't explain." "They did not have an easily explainable pattern, and so, you know, I think that people still take seriously trying to investigate and figure out what that is," Obama said. "I have nothing to report to you today," he added.Also Read | ‘Hate to say this’: Pilot reported UFO sighting, FBI ‘aware’ of incidentThe theories around UFOs have become mainstream in recent times, especially after the US Navy released seven incident reports last year, revealing more details about the series of encounters between Navy pilots and ‘unidentified aerial phenomena’. In December 2020, a unique 180-day countdown for US intelligence started when President Donald Trump signed a massive $2.3 trillion Covid-19 relief and government spending bill into law.The Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2021 was a part of the spending bill under which the Senate intelligence committee directed the intelligence agencies to submit a report on “unidentified aerial phenomena” within 180 days. The committee has directed the federal agencies to identify potential national security threats posed by UFOs and to assess the possibility of an adversary nation behind such activities.The intelligence report on UFOs is expected in June as former federal officials have hinted that the unclassified report will include unexplainable events.“Ultimately when you have exhausted all those what-ifs and you're still left with the fact that this is in our airspace and it's real, that's when it becomes compelling, and that's when it becomes problematic," Luis Elizondo, former director of the defense department's Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program, told "60 Minutes".||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/documentary-filmmaker-releases-video-of-swarm-of-ufos-over-us-navy-ship-101622284366215.html

Three heavily armed militants had carried out the attack on the Chinese consulate located in Clifton on November 23, 2018.Four people, including security personnel and visa seekers, were killed in the attack. The attackers, later identified as Abdul Razzaq, Raees Baloch and Azal Baloch, were also killed in their fight with police. A large number of weapons, ammunition and explosives were found on them.The accused - Ahmed Hasnain, Muhammad Aslam, Nadir Khan, Ali Ahmed and Abdul Latif - were arrested by the Counter-Terrorism Department for allegedly facilitating the attack. According to the IO, Latif and Aslam had confessed to the crime before a judicial magistrate a week after their arrest.Besides the indicted suspects, the police had also booked BLA chief Hyrbyair Marri and other leaders Kareem Marri, Bashir Zaib, Aslam Baloch, Noor Bakhsh Mengal, Rehman Gul, Nisar, Gaindi, Sheikhu Sharif, Hamal, Agha Sher Dil and Munshi. All of them have been declared proclaimed offenders in the case.Issuing perpetual warrants of arrest for the absconders, the ATC earlier ordered police to approach Interpol for the arrest of Hyrbyair who is living in exile and who allegedly masterminded the attack from a foreign country.The charge sheet said the terrorists stormed the consulate building and started firing and throwing hand grenades, which killed assistant sub-inspector Ashraf Dawood and police constable Muhammad Amir who were performing security duty at the first checkpost. A visa seeker, Tahir Shah, and his father, Niaz Ahmed, were also killed by the attackers, it reported further.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-fails-to-prove-alleged-india-role-in-china-consulate-attack-101622278564795.html

Several videos posted on social media showed carpets of mice scurrying across barn floors, crowded around machinery, and entering thick grain silos made of steel as farmers struggled to control the rodents.The mice have also entered homes, inside containers and finding their way into water tanks, footage posted by local media channels showed. According to the local reports, they also bit farmers and patients in the hospital while they were asleep.WARNING: GRAPHIC CONTENT – Farmers are struggling as the biggest plague of mice in decades continues to sweep across Australia’s New South Wales https://t.co/LTDpEKnIoy pic.twitter.com/PFf2eqaLTPMeanwhile at Chuck E. Cheese...🐁🧀https://t.co/r0ZWlGubyyFarmers' nightmareThe crisis has prompted the New South Wales government to order 5000 litres of the banned poison Bromadiolone from India. "It’s actually the strongest mouse poison we can get anywhere on the face of the earth that actually will kill these things within 24 hours," said Adam Marshall, the state’s agriculture minister.The state government has also released $50 million ($39 million) in funding to tackle the infestation, which is gradually spreading to Queensland state. However, the order is yet to receive approval from the federal government over concerns that the potent pesticide may also kill other animals and family pets.According to an AP report, the infestation is contaminating sorghum exports with animal droppings, causing quality downgrades and leading to cancelled shipments of the grain. The mice woes come as farmers in Australia's most populous state have already been hit by fires, floods and pandemic disruptions in recent years.Despite, government's intensive baiting programmes, it had little to no success against the infestation. Locals are hoping for heavy rain to drown the mice in their burrows.Plagues seemingly appear from nowhere and often vanish just as fast. Disease and a shortage of food are thought to trigger a dramatic population crash as mice feed on themselves, devouring the sick, weak and their own offspring.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/mice-plague-hits-australia-farmers-pin-hope-on-banned-poison-from-india-101622278175412.html

Hong Kong Alliance can no longer organise the candlelight vigil this year in a lawful manner. We will stop promoting the vigil, said Richard Tsoi of the alliance to the press.“On that day, we won’t, as an organisation and members of Hong Kong Alliance, appear and join.”Tsoi said he believed Hong Kong people would still commemorate the June 4 crackdown on pro-democracy activists in a peaceful manner.Samuel Chu, who runs the Hong Kong Democracy Council in Washington, retweeted an image of Tsoi making his statement, writing, “We will light a candle for you and all of Hong Kong".Hong Kong's Security Bureau issued a statement warning people not to take part in illegal assemblies or violate the national security law imposed on the territory by Beijing.Liauw Ka-kei, senior superintendent of the Hong Kong Island Region, told a news conference that the police welcomed the appeal board decision, also urging the public not to participate in or publicise any unauthorised assembly.“Police have reasonable grounds to believe that the activities not only include the risk of infecting Covid-19 by participants and other people but also pose a serious threat to the life and health of all citizens, jeopardising public safety, and affecting the rights of others,” he said.Liauw said the police would adopt a zero-tolerance approach and take resolute action against anyone who violated the law.The security law combined with coronavirus restrictions have cleared the city's streets of protesters after anti-government demonstrations plunged the financial hub into turmoil in 2019.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hong-kong-organisers-lose-appeal-to-hold-tiananmen-vigil-101622274707111.html

May 29 thus became known as Mt Everest Day in Nepal to mark their achievement, a day celebrated with pomp and much celebration.Norgay and Hilary both were part of British army officer John Hunt’s expedition and reached the summit, the highest point on Earth, at 11:30am on May 29. They spent only 15 minutes atop Everest and Hilary clicked the most famous photo of Norgay, one where he is seen posing with his ice axe.Before setting off with the 1953 expedition team Norgay had attempted to reach the summit with a Swiss team and had successfully scaled 200 metres of Mt Everest. Experts say this made Norgay one of the most experienced climbers in Hunt’s team.The news of Norgay and Hilary’s achievement reached the United Kingdom on the morning of Queen Elizabeth II’s coronation, and three days after their actual climb. Hillary and John Hunt were both knighted and Norgay was awarded the George Medal, a civilian medal of bravery. Years after Norgay’s death his grandson Tashi Tenzing pointed out that his grandfather, like the other two gentlemen, should also have also been knighted. A point which brought into focus the unfair treatment of Nepali Sherpas who have assisted climbers in their endeavours.Sir Edmund Hilary hailed from New Zealand and his ascent formed a bond between Nepal and his homeland. During the Nepalese government’s attempts to measure the height of Mt Everest, following the 2015 Nepal earthquake, the New Zealand government came to Nepal’s Survey Department (Napi Bibhag) aid with a Global Navigation Satellite, and trained technicians. Hilary is fondly remembered by the mountainous Khumbu community, where a memorial has been erected in his honour above the village of Khumjung.The revised height of Mt Everest has been pegged at 29,031 ft, 8,848.86 metres above sea level, by authorities of China and Nepal.Both Norgay and Hilary inspired a generation of mountaineers who make countless attempts every year to climb Mt Everest, traffic to which has not been dampened by the onslaught of the coronavirus pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/on-this-day-in-1953-edmund-hilary-and-tenzing-norgay-scaled-mt-everest-for-the-first-time-101622270193034.html

The federal health body in a fresh set of guidelines said that kids who are fully vaccinated can skip wearing face masks or practice social distancing indoors or outside.However, kids who are not yet fully vaccinated against the viral infection that has killed over three million people around the world, were advised to follow the norms especially if they are indoors or in crowded outdoor settings. Social distancing, staying 3 to 6 feet from others, is recommended for the unvaccinated, but not for the vaccinated, it said in the advisory according to news agency AP.The revised guidelines come as summer camps start to open in parts of the country. Tom Rosenberg, president of the American Camp Association, said, the will open the door to a more conventional camp experience, AP reported.Earlier this month, CDC said that it has relaxed the face mask rules for people who have been fully vaccinated against Covid-19. "If you are fully vaccinated against Covid-19, you can resume activities without wearing a mask or staying 6 feet apart, except where required by federal, state, local, tribal or territorial laws, incl. local business and workplace guidance," it said while announcing the decision.US President Joe Biden also appeared without a mask and addressed reporters in the White House. "A great day,” in the fight against Covid-19, he said on May 13.On May 10, the US government authorised the Pfizer vaccine for 12- to 15-year-olds, offering a way to protect the nation's adolescents before they head back to school in the fall.Children are far less likely than adults to get seriously ill from Covid-19, yet they represent nearly 14% of the nation’s coronavirus cases. At least 296 have died from Covid-19 in the US alone, and more than 15,000 have been hospitalised, AP reported citing a tally by the American Academy of Pediatrics.According to a report by AP, about 2.5 million of the roughly 17 million US kids have gotten at least one shot. A second dose is required, three weeks after the first, and then it takes two more weeks before the vaccine fully takes effect.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/cdc-eases-face-mask-social-distancing-norms-for-kids-at-summer-camps-101622264174155.html

The group was given up for dead until it was resurrected in 2017.Jaishankar was India’s foreign secretary then. The first meeting of the renewed Quad, on the sidelines of the ASEAN summit, was scaled up to the level of ministers in 2019. Jaishankar attended that first ministerial, which took place on the sidelines of the UN general assembly meetings.“I say this to you as someone who has pretty much attended all the, you know, not all the Quad meetings, or various Quad meetings at various levels as the Quad developed,” Jaishankar said, speaking of the group in personal terms for the first time, as he also positioned it in a geostrategic context.“We see the Quad (as) an expression of the convergence of interests of many countries, it is in many ways a reflection of the contemporary nature of the world order, where you know, it’s not a, sort of, you know, at some stage, we have to put the Cold War behind us,” Jaishankar said, going on to dismiss sceptics and critics as those “who are stuck in the Cold War”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/quad-fill-important-gap-in-global-affairs-says-jaishankar-101622264188978.html

VnExpress quoted Long as saying Vietnam would announce the newly discovered variant to the world soon.Vietnam had previously reported seven virus variants: B.1.222, B.1.619, D614G, B.1.1.7 (the UK variant), B.1.351, A.23.1 and B.1.617.2 (the Indian variant).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/vietnam-detects-hybrid-of-b-1-617-and-uk-covid-19-variant-101622263231208.html

Shipments linked to the company have dropped over the past year to about USD 200,000, officials said.“We will not tolerate any amount derived from forced labor,” Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas told reporters as he announced the measure.CBP issued what is known as a withhold release order that halts shipments that have suspected links to forced labor, under a law that has been on the books for decades, ostensibly to protect US producers from unfair competition.The law has been used with increased frequency in recent years, given the growing awareness of the prevalence of what is essentially modern-day slavery in a range of industries, with workers forced to work long hours for low pay, or none at all, and subjected to violence.CBP found that Dalian's operations, across the fleet, met all 11 criteria for forced labor laid out by the International Labor Organization, including the holding back of wages, inhumane conditions and physical intimidation, said John Leonard, the acting executive assistant commissioner of the agency's Office of Trade.“This was a rather egregious example," Leonard said.Both the State Department and Labor Department have also documented abusive conditions in the Chinese fishing industry, where mostly foreign crews often work 18 to 22 hours per day under abysmal conditions.US authorities have used the Tariff Act of 1930 to halt imports from specific companies, individual fishing vessels and all cotton and tomato products from the Xinjiang region of China, where the Chinese government is waging a brutal assimilation campaign against Uyghurs and other predominantly Muslim ethnic groups.The announcement Friday marks the first time that the US has sought to block imports from a company's entire fishing fleet, a sign that the CBP's investigation found evidence of widespread abuse on Dalian vessels around the world.Indonesia's government in May 2020 accused the company of “inhuman” treatment of fishermen from that country, with dozens of men forced to work 18 hours a day for no pay or less than agreed upon. It said the conditions led to illnesses that killed at least three fishermen, whose bodies were cast overboard into the Pacific Ocean.Dalian did not immediately respond to a request for comment made through its website.The company has had recent financial troubles, but Leonard said it appears to be reorganizing and planning to resume operations. “We need to be vigilant,” he said.

29-05-2021||World||US agencies largely fended off latest Russian hack: White House||The White House says it believes US government agencies largely fended off the latest cyberespionage onslaught blamed on Russian intelligence operatives, saying the spear-phishing campaign should not further damage relations with Moscow ahead of next month’s planned presidential summit.Officials downplayed the cyber assault as "basic phishing" in which hackers used malware-laden emails to target the computer systems of US and foreign government agencies, think tanks and humanitarian groups. Microsoft, which disclosed the effort late Thursday, said it believed most of the emails were blocked by automated systems that marked them as spam.As of Friday afternoon, the company said it was "not seeing evidence of any significant number of compromised organizations at this time.”Even so, the revelation of a new spy campaign so close to the June 16 summit between President Joe Biden and Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin adds to the urgency of White House efforts to confront the Kremlin over aggressive cyber activity that criminal indictments and diplomatic sanctions have done little to deter.“I don’t think it'll create a new point of tension because the point of tension is already so big,” said James Lewis, a senior vice president at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. “This clearly has to be on the summit agenda. The president has to lay down some markers” to make clear “that the days when you people could do whatever you want are over.”The summit comes amid simmering tensions driven in part by election interference by Moscow and by a massive breach of US government agencies and private corporations by Russian elite cyber spies who infected the software supply chain with malicious code. The US responded with sanctions last month, prompting the Kremlin to warn of retribution.Asked Friday whether the latest hacking effort would affect the Biden-Putin summit, principal deputy press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said, "We’re going to move forward with that.”The US, which has previously called out Russia or criminal groups based there for hacking operations, did not blame anyone for the latest incident. Microsoft attributed it to the group behind the SolarWinds campaign, in which at least nine federal agencies and dozens of private sector companies were breached through a contaminated software update.In this case, hackers gained access to an email marketing account of the US Agency for International Development, and masquerading as the government body, targeted about 3,000 email accounts at more than 150 different organizations. At least a quarter of them involved in international development, humanitarian and human rights work, Microsoft Vice President Tom Burt said in a blog post late Thursday.The company did not say what portion of the attempts may have led to successful intrusions but said in a separate technical blog post that most were blocked by automated systems that marked them as spam. The White House said even if an email eluded those systems, a user would still have to click on the link to activate the malicious payload.Burt said the campaign appeared to be a continuation of multiple efforts by the Russian hackers to “target government agencies involved in foreign policy as part of intelligence gathering efforts.” He said the targets spanned at least 24 countries.Separately, the prominent cybersecurity firm FireEye said it has been tracking “multiple waves” of related spear-phishing by hackers from Russia's SVR foreign intelligence agency since March — preceding the USAID campaign — that used a variety of lures including diplomatic notes and invitations from embassies.The hackers gained access to USAID's account at Constant Contact, an email marketing service, Microsoft said. The authentic-looking phishing emails dated May 25 purport to contain new information on 2020 election fraud claims and include a link to malware that allows the hackers to “achieve persistent access to compromised machines.”Microsoft said the campaign is ongoing and built on escalating spear-phishing campaigns it first detected in January.USAID spokeswoman Pooja Jhunjhunwala said Friday that it was investigating with the help of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency. Constant Contact spokeswoman Kristen Andrews called it an “isolated incident.”While the SolarWinds campaign,was supremely stealthy and began as far back as 2019 before being detected in December by FireEye, this campaign is what cybersecurity researchers call noisy, meaning easy to detect.And though "the spear phishing emails were quickly identified, we expect that any post-compromise actions by these actors would be highly skilled and stealthy,” FireEye's VP of analysis, John Hultquist, said in a statement Friday. He said the incident “is a reminder that cyber espionage is here to stay.”Many cybersecurity experts did not consider the operation an escalation of online Russian aggression.“I think it's par for the course," said Jake Williams, president of Rendition Infosec and a former US government hacker. He said it’s naive to think that US cyber operators aren’t engaged in similar operations targeting adversaries.Bobby Chesney, a University of Texas at Austin law professor specializing in national security, said it is nowhere near as serious as the SolarWinds hack. Nor does it come anywhere near the damage done by the ransomware attack earlier this month — by Russian-speaking criminals tolerated by the Kremlin — that temporarily knocked the Colonial Pipeline offline.Chesney said he thought it was wrong to regard the USAID targeting as a Russian response to sanctions or a sign the sanctions were somehow feckless.“I don't think it proves anything, really,” Chesney said. “It's no surprise at all that the SVR is still engaged in espionage in the cyber domain. I don't think we tried to deter them out of doing this wholesale.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-agencies-largely-fended-off-latest-russian-hack-white-house-101622255419314.html

He will now have to serve a total of 20 months for his multiple protest convictions.Seven other leading activists, including 25-year-old youth campaigner Figo Chan, as well as former lawmakers Lee Cheuk-yan and Leung Kwok-hung, were also given new jail terms.The new sentences are the latest in a relentless and successful campaign by China to smother dissent and dismantle Hong Kong’s democracy movement.The clashes with police on China’s October 1 National Day were some of the worst of that period.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/jimmy-lai-seven-other-hong-kong-dissidents-jailed-for-rallies-against-china-101622255923855.html

In the House of Representatives, 35 of the chamber’s 211 Republicans joined Democrats in support of the commission that was to be modelled after the panel convened in the wake of the 9/11 attacks of 2001 and which had strong bipartisan support.US says goodbye to Open Skies accord with RussiaUS announced on Friday it has decided not to return to the Open Skies Treaty saying Russia has violated the accord.The post-Cold War treaty was meant to build trust by allowing the two powers and their allies to monitor one another’s airspace.

"While accidental and not visible to the public, this was completely unacceptable, and I apologize unreservedly."In April, the MP was caught standing naked between the flags of Canada and Quebec, his private parts hidden by his phone, while connected by video to a Question Time session in Parliament.Amos, a member of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's Liberal Party, also claimed that was an accident.In the most recent episode, he was caught urinating into a coffee cup, the Conservative opposition said in a statement."This is the second time Mr. Amos has been caught exposing himself to his colleagues in the House, and the House of Commons, virtual or otherwise, must be free of this type of unacceptable behaviour," said Conservative MP Karen Vecchio."This is a pattern of behavior from Mr. Amos and it's now clear that Trudeau's Liberals failed in their duty to ensure a safe work environment following the first incident," she hammered in a statement.Amos, 46, announced he was "temporarily" stepping down from some of his parliamentary duties while continuing to represent his constituency.

29-05-2021||World||UN Chief wants countries to stop investing in coal, seeks climate pledges||United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres is urging more countries to stop investing in coal, while pushing for developed countries to take concrete climate action.For net-zero pledges to be backed by credible targets and timelines, subsidies have to be shifted from fossil fuels to renewables, and “it also means stopping the financing of coal domestically and abroad and phasing out its use,” Guterres said in a video message at the International Finance Forum in Beijing on Saturday.Citing South Korea’s recent decision to halt state-backed financing of coal-fired power plants overseas, the UN chief said he’s counting on “G7 climate ministers and other leaders to make similar commitments.”Coal consumption is expected to rise this year among the top three users. US power plants are projected to consume 16% more coal, and China is seen burning a record amount of the fuel, although President Xi Jinping wants the country to start reducing coal use from 2026.Guterres also reiterated that developed countries must meet the $100 billion goal in aid and new climate commitments, including for the period of 2021-2025. At least 50% of climate finance should be for “adaptation and resilience,” he said. His speech comes ahead of the highly-anticipated COP26 meeting in November, where officials from 197 countries gather to solve climate issues. This year, signatory countries are expected to update their initial pledges to help achieve the Paris Agreement goals.Speaking on the virus pandemic, Guterres said that the global vaccine gap must be closed urgently.“We must unite to produce and distribute sufficient vaccines for all, especially to reach low-income countries that are falling behind,” he said. “Covax, the global vaccine equity mechanism, can help achieve this.”More must also be done to support developing countries on the brink of a debt crisis, Guterres said, adding he has called for a further extension to the G20’s Debt Service Suspension Initiative into 2022 for all countries in need, including middle-income nations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/un-chief-wants-countries-to-stop-investing-in-coal-seeks-climate-pledges-101622253353699.html
29-05-2021||World||'When volcano starts spitting': Nearly 400,000 flee DR Congo fearing eruption||The eastern DR Congo city of Goma was eerily deserted after nearly 400,000 of its inhabitants fled following warnings that nearby Mount Nyiragongo volcano may erupt again.The authorities geared up for a major humanitarian effort, centred on Sake, around 25 kilometres (15 miles) west of the city, where tens of thousands of people are gathered.Located on the shore of Lake Kivu in the shadow of Africa's most active volcano, the city has lived in fear since Nyiragongo roared back into life last weekend.The strato-volcano spewed rivers of lava that claimed nearly three dozen lives and destroyed the homes of some 20,000 people before the eruption stopped.Scientists have since recorded hundreds of aftershocks.They warn of a potentially catastrophic scenario -- a "limnic eruption" that could smother the area with suffocating carbon dioxide.A report on an emergency meeting early Friday said 80,000 households -- around 400,000 inhabitants -- had emptied on Thursday following a "preventative" evacuation order.Most people have headed for Sake or the Rwandan border in the northeast, while others have fled by boat across Lake Kivu.Late Friday, Rwandan President Paul Kagame said those fleeing needed "urgent, global support".Aid efforts are being organised to provide drinking water, food and other supplies, and workers are helping to reunite children who became separated from their families.Nearly 10,000 people are taking refuge in Bukavu on the southern bank of Lake Kivu, according to governor Theo Ngwabidje, many of them in host families.- Quieter night -Several days of aftershocks, some of them equivalent to small earthquakes, yielded to a quieter night Thursday, and tremors eased both in numbers and intensity, an AFP journalist said.But late Friday afternoon black smoke could be seen rising from the crater on the horizon, causing worry.General Constant Ndima, the military governor of North Kivu province, ordered the evacuation of districts that potentially applies to nearly 400,000 out of Goma's 600,000 residents, according to an estimate by the UN humanitarian agency OCHA.The wider Goma area has a population of around two million.The authorities arranged transport towards Sake, but the roads became choked with cars, trucks, buses and people seeking safety on foot.Many spent the night in the open or slept in schools or churches.Evacuee Eugene Kubugoo said the water was giving children diarrhoea, adding: "We don't have anything to eat or any place to sleep."Tens of thousands had fled Goma last Saturday night but many returned when the eruption ended the following day.- 'Limnic' risk -Friday's report, issued after experts carried out a risk assessment at the volcano's summit, said "seismicity and ground deformation continues to indicate the presence of magma under the Goma area, with an extension under Lake Kivu."People should remain vigilant and listen to news bulletins, as the situation "may change quickly", it warned.Volcanologists say the worst-case scenario is of an eruption under the lake.This could release hundreds of thousands of tonnes of carbon dioxide (CO2) that are currently dissolved in the water's depths.The gas would rise to the surface of the lake, forming an invisible cloud that would linger at ground level and displace oxygen, asphyxiating life.In 1986, one of these so-called limnic eruptions killed more than 1,700 people and thousands of cattle at Lake Nyos in western Cameroon.- Empty city -On Friday, almost all of the shops and banks in central Goma were closed, and just a handful of people and some motorcycle taxis were on the usually bustling streets.In the poorer districts in the north of the city, a handful of stores were open and there were more people, including children who gambolled near a water truck."I will stay in the city. I know that I'm in imminent danger but I don't have a choice," said Aline Uramahoro, who has a beer store."I will leave when the volcano starts spitting."Nearly 3,500 metres (11,500 feet) high, Nyiragongo straddles the East African Rift tectonic divide.Its last major eruption, in 2002, claimed around 100 lives and the deadliest eruption on record killed more than 600 people in 1977.Herman Paluku, who gave his age as 94, said he had seen them all -- and insisted he wouldn't budge this time."There is a small hill near here which means that the lava does not reach us. And that's what protects us a bit," he said in Swahili, his hands sweeping the air."I can never leave here, in this situation.

Pratasevich, 26, has been detained in Minsk alongside his girlfriend, Sofia Sapega, despite international calls for their release.European Union officials on Thursday detailed plans for their own sanctions against Belarus that would hit economic sectors close to Lukashenka, including the country’s potash industry. Those are likely to have a greater impact than the penalties announced by the White House; US trade with Belarus amounted to only about $112 million in 2020, according to the US Census Bureau.The announcement came after some lawmakers earlier this week called for the Federal Aviation Administration to fully prohibit US aircraft from entering Belarus air space after the episode. The US is suspending its discretionary application of the 2019 US-Belarus Air Services Agreement, the White House said.Russia has backed Lukashenko over the past quarter century, including during a brutal crackdown on the opposition last year, even as he resisted Moscow’s push for closer economic and political union. Even so, he has been adept in the past at playing off the EU and Russia against each other to retain his independence.Russian President Vladimir Putin warmly greeted Lukashenko in the Black Sea resort of Sochi on Friday.“I’m very happy to see you,” Putin said, agreeing as Lukashenko belittled Western criticism of the airliner incident as “a surge of emotions.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-announces-sanctions-on-belarus-over-journalist-s-detention-issues-do-not-travel-warning-to-citizens-101622251183369.html
29-05-2021||World||US, Hong Kong climbers set records on Everest||Climbers from the United States and Hong Kong have set new records as they scaled Mount Everest this week, hiking officials said on Friday.Arthur Muir, 75, became the oldest American to climb the world’s highest peak at 8,848.86-metres on Sunday, an official from the company that organised the expedition said.“Arthur Muir is the oldest American at 75 years old to summit Mount Everest,” Garrett Madison, expedition leader at the Madison Mountaineering company told Reuters from the base camp.Muir beat the record set by Bill Burke, who became the oldest American to climb the mountain at the age of 67 in 2009.Separately, Hong Kong mountaineer Tsang Yin-hung has recorded the world’s fastest ascent of Everest by a woman with a time of just under 26 hours. Tsang, 44, scaled the mountain in a record time of 25 hours and 50 minutes on Sunday, Everest base camp’s government liaison officer Gyanendra Shrestha said.“She left the base camp at 1.20pm on Saturday and reached (the top at) 3.10pm the next day,” Shrestha told AFP.But Tsang still needs to present her claim to officials from Guinness World Records to receive certification of her feat, he added. The Nepal government certifies that climbers have reached the summit but does not issue certifications for records.The fastest woman to conquer Everest had been Nepali Phunjo Jhangmu Lama when she completed the climb in 39 hours 6 minutes.In 2017, Tsang became the first Hong Kong woman to reach the top. It was her third attempt at scaling the Himalayan peak.Nepal has issued a record 408 Everest permits for this climbing season after last year’s season was cancelled due to the pandemic. Up to 350 people have summited the mountain so far this spring.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-hong-kong-climbers-set-records-on-everest-101622250964363.html
29-05-2021||World||Putin offers support to Belarus President||Russian President Vladimir Putin on Friday offered his Belarusian counterpart Alexander Lukashenko support in his standoff with the West over his handling of the grounding of a passenger jet and the arrest of a dissident blogger.The West has accused Belarus of piracy after Belarusian air traffic control on Sunday informed the Ryanair pilot of a hoax bomb threat and Minsk scrambled a MiG-29 fighter plane to escort the jetliner down, and then arrested Roman Protasevich, a blogger and critic of Lukashenko, along with his girlfriend.Both are now languishing in jail. Accused of orchestrating mass riots, Protasevich could be jailed for up to 15 years.But Putin, a close ally of Lukashenko, gave his support to Lukashenko, warmly welcoming him for talks in the southern Russian city of Sochi and agreeing with Lukashenko that the West's reaction to the incident was "an outburst of emotion"."At one time they forced the Bolivian president's plane to land and took him out of the plane and nothing, silence," said Putin, referring to a 2013 incident in which Evo Morales' plane was forced to land in Austria at a time when the United States was trying to intercept whistleblower Edward Snowden.The talks in the Black Sea city of Sochi were organised before the plane incident, but come after many European nations have imposed flight bans on Belarusian aviation and the EU is weighing further sanctions.Lukashenko told Putin he would show him some confidential documents about the Ryanair incident that would help the Russian leader understand what really happened."There is always someone who causes problems for us. You know about them, I'll inform you," Lukashenko told Putin."I brought some documents so that you understand what is happening."Looking relaxed and smiling, Putin had earlier suggested the two men take a sea dip, something Lukashenko agreed to.Russia, a close ally which sees the ex-Soviet republic of 9.5 million as a strategically important buffer to its west, had offered verbal support to Minsk before the Putin meeting, while dismissing speculation it was itself complicit in the incident.Moscow says Belarus has shown a readiness for transparency in the row and has described the West's reaction to the plane incident as "shocking," with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov accusing it of "demonising" the authorities in Minsk.Russia and Belarus, which are formally part of a "union state", have been in talks for years to further integrate their nations, a process that has long spurred fears among Belarus's beleaguered opposition that Lukashenko might trade off chunks of sovereignty in return for political backing from the Kremlin.Putin told Lukashenko the two men were continuing to build the union state, but were doing so steadily, without haste, and in a low key way.In power since 1994, Lukashenko with Russia's help faced down the biggest protests of his rule last summer over election rigging, allegations that he denied. The protests lost momentum amid a violent crackdown, but his critics plan to stage new ones.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/putin-offers-support-to-belarus-president-101622249615662.html
29-05-2021||World||'Just want him here': Family of US journalist detained in Myanmar hopes for his return||The mother of a journalist detained in Myanmar says she and the family “just want him here” in Michigan.“It was a total visceral reaction, gut, visceral, numbing, nauseating, tearful, helpless feeling," Rose Fenster said, describing how she felt when learning about the detention of her son, Danny Fenster.The 37-year-old managing editor of Frontier Myanmar was detained at Yangon International Airport on Monday as he was preparing to board a flight to Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, en route to the Detroit area to see his family.“It’s important we get this resolved as quickly as possible. We’re on Day 5, so time is crucial. We want him out of there,” Bryan Fenster, Danny’s older brother, said during an interview Friday at their parents’ home in Huntington Woods, Michigan.Earlier in the day, the US State Department said it was deeply concerned about the detention of Danny Fenster and another American citizen who also has been working as a journalist in Myanmar. The State Department is pressing that country’s military government for their immediate release.It said in a statement that it will keep seeking the release of Fenster and Nathan Maung “until they are allowed to return home safely to their families.”Frontier Myanmar is a news and business magazine that is published in English and Burmese and also online.Human rights organizations and groups promoting freedom of expression have been calling for the release of both men, as well as all other journalists being held by Myanmar’s military government.Michigan Rep. Andy Levin said he has been in close contact with the State Department and the Fenster family, whom he represents in Congress.“This is about freeing an American citizen who has been unjustly detained,” Levin said. “And we’re all rowing in the same direction here.”Bryan Fenster said his brother has been taken to Insein Prison in Yangon, which over decades has housed thousands of political prisoners, including many from the current movement protesting military rule.“We've been hearing terrible things about the conditions there,” Bryan Fenster said,Maung and Myanmar national Hanthar Nyein, co-founders of the Myanmar news website Kamayut Media, were arrested on March 9, according to the New York-based Committee to Protect Journalists, citing accounts in Myanmar media. The group said it had reports that Maung, the website's editor-in-chief, and Hanthar, a news producer, had been physically mistreated by guards in their first few weeks at Insein Prison.The State Department statement said consular officers from the U.S. Embassy in Yangon had paid a virtual visit to Maung on Monday but so far have not been granted access to Fenster. It said it urged the authorities “to grant consular access, as required by the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations, without delay, and to ensure proper treatment of both Nathan and Daniel while they remain detained.”Two other foreign journalists have been arrested by the military junta that took power in February after ousting the elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi. Freelancers Robert Bociaga of Poland and Yuki Kitazumi of Japan have since been deported.“The ongoing persecution, intimidation, harassment and violence faced by journalists in Myanmar constitutes a clear attempt by the military authorities to suppress peaceful dissent and obscure violations committed by security forces in the wake of the 1 February coup,” the human rights group Amnesty International said in a statement. “The nationwide crackdown has resulted in widespread denial of the rights to freedom of expression and access to information.”It said that according to Myanmar’s Assistance Association for Political Prisoners, 88 journalists have been arrested since the army’s takeover, with more than half still in detention, and 33 in hiding.According to the Assistance Association, which has kept a detailed tally of arrests and deaths since the military takeover, more than 4,300 people are in detention, including 104 who have already been sentenced.Reporters Without Borders and PEN International are among other groups calling for the release of the journalists.“As a mom, I just want him here," Rose Fenster said. “And just, I love him, love him, love him."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/just-want-him-here-family-of-us-journalist-detained-in-myanmar-hopes-for-his-return-101622246985349.html
29-05-2021||World||Joe Biden's tax plan forecast to bring in $3.6 trillion over the next decade||President Joe Biden’s proposed tax hikes are forecast to bring in $3.6 trillion over the next decade, the Treasury Department said Friday, a key funding source for the $4 trillion he hopes to spend remaking the American economy and social safety net.The figure, representing the sum of all tax increases if enacted by Congress, came as is part of the “Greenbook” report that accompanies the White House’s $6 trillion 2022 budget request, also released on Friday. It effectively serves as the revenue side of the ledger, against Biden’s spending priorities in the budget.After accounting for the $1.2 trillion in tax credits for clean energy, electric cars, low-income families and housing investment, the plan would net Biden about $2.4 trillion to invest in other economic priorities. The White House has said that the $4 trillion combination of its American Jobs Plan and American Families Plan would be fully paid for over 15 years.The Greenbook, which hasn’t been released since President Barack Obama’s final year in office in 2016, is the most comprehensive look at the tax and revenue proposals the administration endorses.The document spans the gamut of Biden proposals, including a global minimum corporate tax, an increase in the levy on capital gains at death and closing the carried interest tax break for fund managers, all of which Biden has already outlined in his funding proposals for his longer-term spending plans.The top income tax rate would increase to 39.6% from 37% starting in 2022, according to the proposal. Married couples earning $509,300, individuals earning $452,700 and heads of households earning $481,000 would be affected by the increases.The proposal was met with criticism from Republicans who said now is not the time to raise taxes. Senator Mike Crapo of Idaho, the top Republican on the Senate Finance Committee, said in a statement Biden’s plan would “strangle the economy with regulations and red tape.”The Greenbook proposal assumes the capital gains increase would take effect on the date it was announced, a Treasury official said on a call with reporters. That proposal was announced in late April.The reason for doing that is to prevent acceleration of gains during a temporarily low tax rate, another official said. But the Treasury will work with Congress to determine the appropriate effective date, the person said. The large majority of the other tax increases are slated to go into effect in 2022.The retroactive tax increase on capital gains will be difficult to get through Congress in its current form given Democrats’ thin majorities and lawmakers’ rare history for raising taxes without giving people a fair warning, said John Gimigliano, who leads federal tax legislative services at KPMG LLP.Tax CreditsThe Greenbook also includes key tax-credit proposals that Democratic lawmakers see as crucial to campaign on during the 2022 midterm elections. The administration is calling for an extension of an expanded child tax credit through 2025, as well as benefits for green energy and electric vehicles.While Congress is unlikely to enact Biden’s tax ideas wholesale, the Greenbook has political significance by detailing the proposals that have the support of the White House.“This gives Congress room to run. Congress is going to have to develop the policy and find the votes,” Gimigliano said. Congressional leadership “is going to have to figure this out themselves to a certain extent.”Democrats will likely have to scale back some of the ideas to be able to pass them through their razor-thin majorities in Congress. Some Senators, including Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Mark Warner of Virginia, have expressed concerns about Biden’s corporate tax rate and capital gains plans.The document will serve as a starting point for congressional Democrats to begin turning Biden’s agenda into legislation. House Ways and Means Chairman Richard Neal and Senate Finance Committee Chair Ron Wyden have already begun sifting through Biden’s broad outlines and preparing to move legislation later this year.Pressure from moderates to pare down the tax proposals, along with procedural rules in the Senate, could both prove to be stumbling blocks as Democrats negotiate.SALT DeductionOn the flip side, the Treasury outline omits a key priority for some House Democrats: an expansion of the state and local tax, or SALT, deduction. More than 20 lawmakers from high-tax states have said they would oppose Biden’s economic agenda unless it also included an expansion of that write-off, which is currently capped at $10,000.The Greenbook also details other previously announced proposals, including one to impose taxes at death on inherited property for large gains accrued during the previous owner’s lifetime. The proposal would also prevent private-equity and hedge fund managers from applying the long-term capital gains tax rate to their portion of the fund’s profits, known as carried interest, if their overall taxable income exceeds $400,000.Biden’s proposals also call for $2 trillion in additional business-tax revenue over the next 10 years from changes like boosting the corporate tax rate, raising the minimum taxes paid by US companies on their foreign income and revamping efforts to combat companies’ attempts to shift profits offshore.A Treasury official said the administration plans to work with Congress on proposals to create a new research-and-development tax incentive to replace one created under President Donald Trump, but declined to give details on what that could look like.Another idea omitted from the Greenbook was something Biden campaigned on: repealing a 20% small business deduction created in the 2017 Republican tax law for high earners. Some plans didn’t appear in the Greenbook because they require more policy development, a Treasury official said. Others will likely show up in future budgets, the official added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-s-tax-plan-forecast-to-bring-in-3-6-trillion-over-the-next-decade-101622246246402.html

One of its passengers, Roman Protasevich, the founder of a Telegram channel that Belarus has designated as extremist, was detained during the stopover at the airport.On Monday, the European Union suspended the flights of Belarussian airplanes and recommended European carriers to avoid flights over Belarus as well as urging new sanctions on the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-aviation-administration-tells-airlines-to-use-extreme-caution-when-flying-over-belarus-101622244741429.html

"If you are not fully vaccinated, we ask that you continue to wear a mask throughout the theater unless actively enjoying food or drinks."Similar updates to mask policy were made on Regal and Cinemark websites. All three chains said they would follow state and local mandates on mask wearing, which may be different from the CDC guidelines.The changes for movie theaters come two weeks after the CDC said that fully vaccinated people need not wear masks in any setting.Movie-going has begun ramping up in the United States after lengthy pandemic-related closures and a lack of new film releases.Movie studios and theater chains last week launched a "big screen is back" campaign, previewing a summer filled with blockbusters including the new "Fast & Furious" movie and the superhero film "Black Widow."Hollywood studios are closely watching box office receipts for two major films being released this weekend - "Cruella," a prequel story about the villain in "101 Dalmatians," and the thriller "A Quiet Place Part II."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-us-movie-theaters-remove-mask-mandate-for-vaccinated-people-101622240572412.html
29-05-2021||World||Senate confirms geneticist Lander as Biden's science adviser||The Senate has confirmed geneticist Eric Lander to be President Joe Biden's chief science adviser, one of the last unfilled Cabinet posts in the Biden administration.Lander, founding director of the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, was approved by a voice vote Saturday to serve as director of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy, a position Biden has elevated to Cabinet rank.Lander, who also is a mathematician and molecular biologist, was lead author of the first paper announcing the details of the human genome, the so-called “book of life.”His nomination was delayed for months as senators sought more information about meetings he had with the late Jeffrey Epstein, a disgraced financier who was charged with sex trafficking before his apparent suicide. Lander also was criticized for downplaying the contributions of two Nobel Prize-winning female scientists.At his confirmation hearing last month, Lander apologized for a 2016 article he wrote that downplayed the work of the female scientists. At the hearing, he also called Epstein “an abhorrent individual.''Lander said he "understated the importance of those key advances'' by biochemists Emmanuelle Charpentier and Jennifer Doudna. The two were later awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry.“I felt terrible about it, I made a mistake. And when I make a mistake, I own it and try to do better,'' Lander said.“I should have written those paragraphs differently to make my intention crystal clear. I have enormous respect for Doctors Doudna and Charpentier and the important work they've done throughout their careers.''He only met with Epstein twice, in 2012, Lander said, and never requested or received funds from Epstein or his foundation.Sen Maria Cantwell, a Washington Democrat who chairs the Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee, said at a May 20 committee meeting that she wished Biden had named a woman as science adviser, but that Lander had pledged to work to elevate women and minorities in science.Lander said in a statement Saturday that Biden's elevation of the science post “made clear that science and technology will be central to solving the nation's most urgent challenges,” including health, environmental quality "and justice for all Americans.''Lander's confirmation leaves Biden's Cabinet nearly complete. The only remaining unfilled Cabinet post is that of Office of Management and Budget director. Shalanda Young has been serving as acting OMB director after her confirmation as deputy director. Neera Tanden withdrew her nomination for OMB head after several senators said they would not vote for her.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/senate-confirms-geneticist-lander-as-biden-s-science-adviser-101622238264252.html
29-05-2021||World||Remains of 215 children found at former indigenous school site in Canada||The remains of 215 children, some as young as three years old, were found at the site of a former residential school for indigenous children, a discovery Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau described as heartbreaking on Friday.The children were students at the Kamloops Indian Residential School in British Columbia that closed in 1978, according to the Tk'emlúps te Secwépemc Nation, which said the remains were found with the help of a ground penetrating radar specialist."We had a knowing in our community that we were able to verify," Tk'emlúps te Secwépemc Chief Rosanne Casimir said in a statement. "At this time, we have more questions than answers."Canada's residential school system, which forcibly separated indigenous children from their families, constituted "cultural genocide," a six-year investigation into the now-defunct system found in 2015.The report documented horrific physical abuse, rape, malnutrition and other atrocities suffered by many of the 150,000 children who attended the schools, typically run by Christian churches on behalf of Ottawa from the 1840s to the 1990s.It found more than 4,100 children died while attending residential school. The deaths of the 215 children buried in the grounds of what was once Canada's largest residential school are believed to not have been included in that figure and appear to have been undocumented until the discovery.Trudeau wrote in a tweet that the news "breaks my heart - it is a painful reminder of that dark and shameful chapter of our country's history."In 2008, the Canadian government formally apologized for the system.The Tk'emlúps te Secwépemc Nation said it was engaging with the coroner and reaching out to the home communities whose children attended the school. They expect to have preliminary findings by mid-June.In a statement, British Columbia Assembly of First Nations Regional Chief Terry Teegee called finding such grave sites "urgent work" that "refreshes the grief and loss for all First Nations in British Columbia."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/remains-of-215-children-found-at-former-indigenous-school-site-in-canada-101622233018803.html
29-05-2021||World||Joe Biden unveils $6 trillion US budget in mega spending drive||President Joe Biden will unveil a $6 trillion budget proposal on Friday to make the United States more competitive by investing in education, climate change and transportation, in an ambitious plan that will mark the highest level of sustained federal government spending in America since World War II.Citing leaked budget documents, the New York Times reported that the spending plan for 2022 calls for investments in roads, water pipes, broadband internet, electric vehicle charging stations and research in order to make the economy more competitive, and provides for an expanded social safety net with affordable childcare, universal pre-kindergarten and a paid leave program. The proposals are likely to run into opposition from the Republicans.The two-part agenda, contained in the US president’s American Jobs Plan and American Families Plan, will push up deficit and keep it above $1 trillion for a decade. The president plans to pay for it with increased taxes on corporations and the wealthy (those earning less than $400,000 annually will be spared), administration officials have said, while adding that the additional revenue will take time to trickle in.“We must be number one in the world to lead the world in the 21st century,” Biden said in Cleveland, Ohio on Thursday after listing out investments being made by China, Japan and the European Union to shore up their economies.“Now is the time to build the foundation that we’ve laid -- to make bold investments in our families, in our communities, in our nation. We know from history that these kinds of investments raise both the floor and the ceiling of the economy for everybody.”President Biden’s plan seeks to take an economy emerging from recession and expand it through massive federal spending, taking advantage of interest rates being at a historic low, and make it competitive, especially against China. This will create “a new paradigm -- one that rewards work, the working people in this nation, not just those at the top”, as Biden said.The proposal fulfils some of Biden’s campaign promises, including more money for schools in high-poverty areas, free community colleges, cancer research and climate change. But leaves out a key element — public option, which will give Americans the choice to opt for government-run healthcare programme, Medicare, or private insurance. The White House expects lawmakers to introduce it into the legislation when it is being considered by congress.The budget is only the administration’s spending proposal. It must be passed by congress to become effective. But with Democrats in control of both -- the House of Representatives and the Senate -- Biden is positioned to get his ambitious plan through, most parts of it at least.Republicans will push back, as has been the pattern. No Republican voted for Biden’s Rescue Plan and have given a counteroffer of $928 billion to his $1.7 trillion infrastructure investment proposal (down from the $2.2 billion originally).“This is the latest example of President Biden abandoning his lofty promise that he can fund trillions of dollars in new spending simply by taxing the wealthy or corporations alone,” Republican member of the House Ways and Means Committee, which has oversight on budget, said in a statement.President Biden will also face some pushback from within his party. Senator Joe Manchin, a moderate Democrat, who has emerged as a key swing vote in the evenly divided senate, publicly said he does not support the president’s proposed tax rate on corporations of 28%, up from 21%.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-to-propose-6-trillion-budget-to-make-us-competitive-101622216063585.html

29-05-2021||India||Kerala extends Covid lockdown by 10 days, sets the benchmark to ease curbs||Thiruvananthapuram : Kerala chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan on Saturday extended the Covid-induced lockdown in the state by another 10 days, declaring that he would start rolling back the restrictions only after the test positivity rate (TPR, the proportion of people who test positive for the infection) drops below 15% for three days.Kerala has been under a lockdown for three weeks. Vijayan, like some other chief ministers, had been reluctant to order the lockdown and resisted implementing this recommendation due to concern that the poor would suffer the most. But he eventually ordered the lockdown from May 7 to control the surge in cases.On Saturday, he said the number of active cases dropped significantly during the past three weeks. “We need a lockdown to bring it down further,” he said.Kerala reported 23,513 new Covid cases, bringing the active caseload to 2,33,034. With 198 more deaths, the disease has killed 8,445 people in the state.Kerala has a TPR of 16.59% for the 1,41,795 samples tested in the state.“We will lift the lockdown only after TPR slips below 15 per cent for three consecutive days… The active caseload will have to come down drastically,” he said, pointing out that at least 60% ICU beds in the state are occupied by people being treated for the coronavirus disease.Pinarayi Vijayan said while the lockdown will continue till June 9, the government decided to extend some concessions. Jewellery shops, cloth marts and book stalls will be allowed to open for three days a week and industrial and small-scale units will be allowed to function with 50% capacity. Banks will also function for three days in a day.Several other states are expected to announce their decision to continue the lockdown or start easing the norms over the next few days as the daily new Covid cases reported nationwide on Saturday were less than 2,00,000.Around 80% of India has been under lockdown in May due to the second Covid wave.On Saturday, Karnataka Chief Minister B S Yediyurappa said no decision has been taken to extend the state-wide lockdown. He added that if people follow the regulations, there will be no need to extend the lockdown. All districts of Karnataka are currently under a lockdown till 6 am on June 7. “The lockdown will be in effect till June 7… strict restrictions will be in place till then…If people cooperate, the question of extending the lockdown may not arise but people have to cooperate, that is all,” he said.

29-05-2021||India||Explained: How to restore oxygen levels in Covid-19 patients||Amid the second wave of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), an increase in oxygen requirement has been reported in patients in several parts of the nation.In a press release by the Press Information Bureau (PIB), Chief Medical Officer of National Tuberculosis Institute, Bangalore, Dr Ravichandra has explained some important aspects involved in restoring oxygen levels in the body, for the benefit of the small proportion of patients who end up needing supplemental oxygen.“80% of Covid-19 cases reported are mild. Only 15% Covid patients may have moderate disease where one’s oxygen saturation level may go less than 94%. And the remaining 5% Covid infected people may end up having severe disease which shows respiratory rate higher than 30/minute and oxygen saturation level less than 90%," he added.Dr Ravichandra asked to be alert to the symptoms of low oxygen level and said the warning signs of low oxygen level include difficulty in breathing, confusion, difficulty in waking up and bluish lips or face. "Adults may develop chest pain that doesn’t go away. Children may experience flaring up of nostrils, grunting while breathing or inability to drink or eat," he added.Why should we be concerned?According to the World Health Organization (WHO), Hypoxemia (low oxygen levels in blood) may eventually result in loss of life. When oxygen levels become low because of a sickness such as Covid-19, the cells in the body don’t get enough oxygen to perform their normal functions. If the level remains low for long, maybe due to lack of treatment, organs start to malfunction; in severe cases, it may cause death.Know how to measure oxygen levelDr Ravichandra explains that there are two easy ways to measure the oxygen level.1. Pulse Oximeter: You can measure the oxygen level of a patient using a pulse oximeter which you can place on their finger, toe or earlobe. It’s a painless test, taking less than two minutes. Pulse oximeters measure the oxygen saturation or percentage of oxygen in the patient’s blood. According to a WHO training manual on pulse oximetry, if the oxygen saturation is 93% or lower, the patient needs to be treated quickly. A saturation of less than 90% is a clinical emergency.2. Respiratory Rate: Respiratory rate is the number of breaths a person takes per minute. Dr Somashekhara, Director, National Tuberculosis Institute, Bangalore explained a simple method to measure the respiratory rate without any device. Keep your palm on your chest, measure your respiratory rate for 1 minute. If the respiratory rate is less than 24 per minute, your oxygen level is safe. If a patient has more than 30 breaths per minute, the oxygen level is low.What to do when faced with a low oxygen level?Proning: Patients undergoing home care are advised to lie prone on their stomachs. This will improve breathing and increase oxygen saturation.According to the Clinical Management Protocol for Covid-19 (in Adults), released by the Union Health Ministry on May 24, 2021, awake proning should be encouraged in all patients who require supplemental oxygen therapy.The advisory by the Ministry of health and family welfare also underlines important considerations while proning in non-intubated patients• Any Covid-19 patient with respiratory embarrassment severe enough to be admitted to the hospital may be considered for rotation and early self proning.• Care must be taken to not disrupt the flow of oxygen during patient rotation• Typical protocols include 30–120 minutes in prone position, followed by 30–120 minutes in left lateral decubitus (lying on left side), right lateral decubitus (lying on right side), and upright sitting position.Using oxygen concentratorsExperts suggest that oxygen therapy may be given only in presence of a healthcare provider. However, one may use them in an emergency, while medical attention is being sought or while waiting for an ambulance.Professor and Head of Department, Anaesthesia, B. J. Medical College, Pune, Prof. Sanyogita Naik advises: “Oxygen concentrators can be used only in moderate cases of Covid-19, when the patient experiences a drop in oxygen levels, where the oxygen requirement is a maximum of 5 litres per minute.”The professor added that oxygen concentrators are also very useful for patients experiencing post-Covid complications which necessitate oxygen therapy.In both the above cases, the goal of oxygen therapy is to achieve a saturation level of 94%. Once the patient has 93% to 94% oxygen level, the oxygen therapy may be discontinued. Excess of oxygen may lead to increase in the level of carbon dioxide, leading to complications.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/explained-how-to-restore-oxygen-levels-in-covid-19-patients-101622301155539.html

29-05-2021||India||‘First step on long road’: Army chief’s assessment of 3-month-long LoC ceasefire||New Delhi: Army chief General Manoj Mukund Naravane has said that the restoration of ceasefire in February between Indian and Pakistani militaries along the Line of Control (LoC) in Jammu and Kashmir is holding, has led to a significant drop in infiltration by terrorists from Pakistan and contributed to the overall sense of peace and well-being in border areas. “This is the first step on the long road to normalisation of ties between the two countries. We would like the ceasefire to continue. It has definitely led to an improvement in the security situation and benefited civilians living in forward areas,” Naravane said. In a surprise development, Indian and Pakistani militaries announced on February 25 that they had begun observing a ceasefire along the LoC from midnight of February 24. India and Pakistan had agreed to a ceasefire on the LoC in November 2003, but it was frequently violated. The army chief said the ceasefire violations by the neighbouring army were aimed at providing cover to infiltrators. No ceasefire violations by the Pakistan army indicated that infiltration attempts were not being supported, Naravane said. “Counter-terrorism operations will continue. We have no reason to believe that terror infrastructure along the LoC has been dismantled by the Pakistan army,” Naravane said. Pakistan resorted to the highest ever ceasefire violations during the 12 months preceding the joint announcement of the ceasefire in February. According to government data accessed by Hindustan Times, the Pakistani army violated the ceasefire at least a dozen times on average daily between February 2020 and February 2021. Peace along the LoC is mutually beneficial, Naravane said. “The population living on either side suffers due to violence along the LoC. I am sure the Pakistan army is also concerned about the population and hopefully, the ceasefire will hold,” the army chief said. After February 24, there has been a solitary instance of cross-border firing along the international border in the Jammu sector between the Border Security Force and Pakistan Rangers. Naravane said violence levels in Jammu and Kashmir had dropped and there were indications that things were returning to normalcy. Of the 30 terrorists killed by security forces in Kashmir during the last three months, only one was a foreigner, said officials familiar with the developments. “It’s an indicator that infiltration by Pakistani terrorists has dropped notably. We will have to wait and watch how things unfold as three months is a short window to confirm a pattern,” said one of the officials. Pakistan resorted to 4,645 violations in 2020, official data shows. The number of violations was more than 5,100 if those along the international border are also counted. August and September 2020 accounted for the highest number of violations for any two consecutive months in 17 years. The escalation in ceasefire violations coincided with the first anniversary of the Centre’s move in August 2019 to strip Jammu and Kashmir of its semi-autonomous status that Islamabad reacted sharply to. The data shows 835 ceasefire violations were reported in August and September last year. There were 427 ceasefire violations on the LoC in August 2020, the highest number for any single month since November 2003. Ceasefire violations sharply increased over the last five years, recording a 10-fold jump since 2016 when India carried out surgical strikes against terror pads in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir in response to the Islamabad-backed suicide attack on an army camp in Uri. The year 2016 accounted for 449 violations, with the numbers only increasing in the following years - 881 (2017), 1,629 (2018), and 3,168 (2019). The last time guns were silent on LoC was after Indian and Pakistani directors general of military operations held a rare meeting at the Attari-Wagah border near Amritsar on December 24, 2013, to discuss ways to restore calm along the LoC. There were no ceasefire violations by Pakistan for almost seven months after those talks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/first-step-on-long-road-army-chief-s-assessment-on-3-month-long-loc-ceasefire-101622300552661.html

29-05-2021||India||Centre sets up 8-member panel to consider GST waiver for Covid essentials||The government on Saturday constituted an eight-member ministerial panel under the Meghalaya chief minister Conrad K Sangma to consider Goods and Services Tax (GST) exemptions on a range of Covid-19 essentials such as vaccines, drugs, testing kits and ventilators.The other members of the group of ministers (GoM) are Gujarat deputy chief minister Nitinbhai Patel, Maharashtra deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar, Goa transport minister Mauvin Godinho, Kerala finance minister KN Balagopal, Odisha finance minister Niranjan Pujari, Telangana finance minister T Harish Rao and UP finance minister Suresh Kumar Khanna.The GoM will submit its recommendations to the GST Council on or before June 8, the Union finance ministry said in a statement. After a protracted discussion on the issue of tax exemption at the GST Council meeting on Friday, the apex federal body decided to form a committee to examine the merit of tax waiver on individual items.According to its terms of reference, the GoM will examine the need for GST concession or exemption on Covid vaccines, drugs and medicines for Covid treatment, testing kits for Covid detection, medical grade oxygen, pulse oximeters, hand sanitisers, oxygen therapy instruments (concentrators, generators and ventilators), PPE kits, N95 masks, surgical masks, temperature checking thermometers and any other items required for Covid relief.While vaccines and cotton masks attract 5% GST, most of these items fall in the 12% tax slab. Testing kits, drugs, medical oxygen, oxygen concentrators and ventilators fall under the 12% tax bracket. Alcohol-based sanitizers, hand wash, disinfectants and thermometers attract 18% GST.The GoM was constituted after several states such as West Bengal and Punjab asked for exempting all Covid-essential materials from GST. West Bengal finance minister Amit Mitra on May 25 reiterated chief minister Mamata Banerjee’s demand for removing GST on medicines and equipment essential for the treatment of Covid-19 patients. Earlier on May 9, the West Bengal chief minister wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi to seek exemption of Covid-relief materials from GST.Reacting to the letter, finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman had then said that GST exemption on the end product alone would distort the input tax credit system across the value chain, and eventually cost more for the consumer.“If full exemption from GST were given, domestic producers of these items would be unable to offset taxes paid on their inputs and input services and would pass these on to the end consumers by increasing their price,” she said in a tweet on May 9.Ritesh Kanodia, partner at consultancy firm Dhruva Advisors LLP said: “The issue of whether or not vaccines should be included in the exemption list has also to be seen from the perspective of whether granting the exemption will result in the passing of any effective benefit to the end consumer.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/8member-ministerial-panel-to-recommend-gst-waiver-on-covidessentials-101622298511991.html

29-05-2021||India||'Goa sought preferential compensation at GST council, Tamil Nadu objected'||The Goa government sougfor ‘preference’ to smaller states for payment of the GST compensation but Tamil Nadu objected to the proposal, Goa minister Mauvin Godinho said. Transport minister Godinho, who represents the state at the GST Council, said Goa’s revenues had suffered a huge hit due to the stopping of mining and the sharp decline in tourism due to the Covid-induced restrictions.“As far as Goa is concerned, I’m making one demand again and again before the GST council. That as a small state, Goa should get preference like other small states as well for the compensation cess, the shortfall in revenue of the state, to be given for five years from July 2017. The compensation given to Goa as of now is ₹840 crore and what is due to us is almost the same amount. My simple request is that they should look at Goa differently, they should look at small states a little more than what they are paying and give us the money first. So that we will not have any financial crisis,” Godinho told reporters.Godinho, however, said that his demand was objected to by the newly appointed finance minister of Tamil Nadu, who said no undue importance should be given to small states.“He said: ‘Why should one listen to smaller states so much? Why should Goa get so much attention? I have a large constituency. Madurai is my own constituency and is bigger than the whole of Goa. My votes should have more value.’ I took strong offence to this,” Godinho said.“I want to remind the new finance minister of Tamil Nadu Mr Palanivel, refrain from conducting yourself in a manner as a big brother versus small brother or big state versus small state. We all have equal rights. His attitude should be condemned by one and all right-thinking people. He should not target Goa,” Godinho said.“The finance minister of Tamil Nadu should apologise. What is he trying to tell me? That he is against the Constitution of the country? Does he not believe in the Constitution of India? Does he not believe in equality before law? Does he not believe that whatever your status, whatever your standing in society, whether your constituency comprises lakhs of voters or a few thousand voters, everybody has got one vote,” Godinho said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/goa-sought-preferential-compensation-at-gst-council-tamil-nadu-objected-101622293852230.html
29-05-2021||India||Ramachandran says not interested in continuing as Kerala Congress chief||Owing responsibility for the Congress-led UDF's drubbing in the Kerala Assembly elections, Pradesh Congress Committee (KPCC) president Mullappally Ramachandran said on Saturday he was not interested in continuing in the post.Talking to reporters here, Ramachandran said after the UDF defeat in the polls, he has given a detailed report to Sonia Gandhi narrating all matters related to the elections."In that report, I have informed the Congress president that I am not interested in continuing in the post of KPCC president," he said.Ramachandran said he would continue in the post till an alternative arrangement is made.Asked about his absence in the first UDF meeting held after the assembly elections on Friday, the senior Congress leader said attending the meeting as KPCC chief was not morally correct since he has requested Sonia Gandhi to accept his resignation from the post.Ramachandran said as the PCC chief he had received full cooperation from Sonia Gandhi and party leader Rahul Gandhi."But I am saddened by the electoral defeat of the party. So I am taking the responsibility for the party's defeat," he said, adding that he has no intention to put the blame on anyone else. It was reported that the eight-time Parliamentarian has conveyed his willingness to quit but the party leadership in New Delhi asked him to continue till the selection of the new president.His move came days after the All India Congress Committee nominated senior leader V D Satheesan as the parliamentary party leader in the Assembly, replacing Ramesh Chennithala who had led the party for the last five years in the House.Speculation was rife that after the Leader of the Opposition, the KPCC chief would also be changed as the national leadership was eyeing a total revamp of the party's state unit from the grassroot level.After the Congress-led-UDF had to settle for just 41 seats of the total 140 in the April 6 Assembly polls, a group of leaders and workers, especially members of the Youth Congress, have been pressing for a complete makeover of the party's leadership structure in the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ramachandran-says-not-interested-in-continuing-as-kerala-congress-chief-101622291728498.html

It was breach of constitutional integrity and was shameful,” Suvendu Adhikari was quoted as saying by news agency ANI.“Today in a presser the CM said she didn't attend the meeting due to the presence of opposition leaders. She is resorting to lies to satisfy her ego as she thinks of herself as not just West Bengal CM but entire the country’s,” Suvendu Adhikari added.Suvendu, a former Trinamool Congress leader, also said that he invited to Friday’s review meeting as he is the leader of opposition in Bengal assembly and MLA of cyclone-hit Nandigram area.Also watch | CM Mamata versus PM Modi: Ego war and politics over Cyclone ReliefThe BJP legislator was referring to Mamata’s comments during her press conference in Kolkata as she talked about the criticism she faced from Union ministers and BJP leaders for skipping the review meeting with PM Modi on the devastation caused by Cyclone Yass. “It was supposed to be held between the PM and the CM. Why were BJP leaders called to the session?" she asked.She also claimed that opposition leaders were not invited to similar review meetings held in Gujarat and Odisha, the two states that also impacted by Cyclone Yaas over the past few days.The Bengal chief minister also accused the Centre of pursuing "vendetta politics" and appealed it to withdraw its order recalling Bengal chief secretary Alapan Bandopadhyay. "Because you (PM Modi and Union home minister Shah) cannot digest the BJP's defeat, you have started creating problems for us from Day One. What is the fault of the chief secretary?

"On previous occasions, Prime Minister Narendra Modi has reviewed floods, cyclone situations with different Chief Ministers who belonged to non-NDA parties.

Doctors in Maharashtra’s Mumbai and Ghaziabad in Uttar Pradesh have said they said found patients with aspergillosis.Aspergillosis is an infection caused by Aspergillus, a common mold that lives indoors and outdoors. People can get aspergillosis by breathing in microscopic Aspergillus spores from the environment. Most of us breathe in Apergillus spores every day without getting sick but those with weakened immune systems or lung diseases are at a higher risk of developing health issues.Also read | Now, Ghaziabad hospital reports 7 cases of ‘white fungus’ infectionThe types of health problems caused by Apergillus include allergic reactions, lung infections and infections in other organs, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Aspergillosis is not contagious and can’t spread between people or between people and animals from the lungs.What are the types of aspergillosis?1. Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA): ABPA occurs when Aspergillus causes inflammation in the lungs and allergy symptoms such as coughing and wheezing, but doesn’t cause an infection.2.

Invasive aspergillosis: It happens when Aspergillus causes a serious infection and usually affects people who have weakened immune systems, such as those who have had an organ transplant or a stem cell transplant. Invasive aspergillosis most commonly affects the lungs, but it can also spread to other parts of the body.7. Cutaneous or skin aspergillosis: This occurs when Aspergillus enters the body through a break in the skin—for example, after surgery or a burn wound—and causes infection, usually in people who have weakened immune systems. It can also occur if invasive aspergillosis spreads to the skin from somewhere else in the body, such as the lungs, according to CDC.Who can get aspergillosis?According to the US health body, different types of aspergillosis affect different groups of people.1.

When I say 'Bharat Mahan' and that we were proud to say it but now the situation has hit 'Bharat Mahan', they call me traitor; several bodies reached crematoria and their records are available. They should reveal it, what's the difficulty?" asked the former chief minister of Madhya Pradesh, according to news agency ANI. "When I ask for this, they say I'm doing politics," he also said, adding, "When I speak of vaccines and ask for information regarding who all were administered the doses, what is wrong in it?""They say I am doing politics over corpses. This isn't a criticism, it is the truth," he further said.President of Madhya Pradesh Congress Committee, Kamal Nath was booked on March 24 for allegedly creating panic and maligning the image of India internationally by referring to the B.1.617 variant of Covid-19 as the "Indian variant" and claiming that it was responsible for the second wave of the pandemic. The case was registered on the complaint of the medical education department minister, Vishwas Sarang, and other BJP leaders.On Friday as well, Kamal Nath stoked another controversy as he said that India is not a great but "infamous country" as he criticised the Centre over its handling of the Covid-19 pandemic.

Now, it's time for them to answer to the public," she said in a Facebook post.She asked as to why there was "no contingency plan" for the supply of oxygen."Why was the advice of the Empowered Group-VI summarily ignored? Why was no provision made for increasing the number of cryogenic tankers, when by all accounts a second wave was imminent?" she asked.Vadra said as the second wave of Covid raged across the country, almost every state began reporting a shortage of oxygen and many people died gasping for air. "Who is responsible for the lack of oxygen in hospitals across India?""Why were the recommendations of the Parliamentary Committee on Health ignored, she asked. "And no control exercised on the price of oxygen cylinders and their refilling."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govts-lack-of-planning-incompetence-responsible-for-oxygen-crisis-priyanka-gandhi-101622281471894.html

The overall Covid-19 situation of the country has stabilised in the past few days and on Saturday, the country recorded 1.73 lakh fresh Covid-19 infection, the lowest in the last 45 days.Union minister of state for chemicals and fertilisers Mansukh Mandaviya said Remdesivir production has been ramped up 10 times from 33,000 vials per day to 3.5 lakh vials per day between April 11 and May 29. Instead of 20 plants, now 60 plants are producing Remdesivir and all of this has contributed to the surplus production of the drug. While the availability of the drug across the country will continue to be monitored, the Centre will create a stock of 50 lakh vials of Remdesivir for an emergency.But I have also directed @nppa_india & @CDSCO_INDIA_INF to continuously monitor the availability of Remdesivir in the country. Government of India has also decided to procure 50 lakh vials of #Remdesivir to maintain it as a strategic stock for the emergency requirement. (3/3)During the peak of the second wave of the pandemic in April, there was an acute shortage of Remdesivir across the country. The drug, which is only to be used in severe cases were hoarded, black-marketed which too contributed to the shortage.To scale up the production and to meet the domestic requirement, the export of Remdesivir was also prohibited on April 11. From the third week of April, the Centre started allocating Remdesivir to states.What is Remdesivir?Remdesivir is a patented drug that was recommended as an investigational therapy drug given in acute and severe Covid-19. This drug is to be administered only to patients under oxygen support. Seven pharmaceutical companies, including Cipla, Dr Reddy’s Lab., Hetero, Jubilant Pharma, Mylan, Syngene and Zydus Cadila, manufacture Remdesivir in India under voluntary licences granted by Gilead Life Sciences USA, the company which holds the patent of Remdesivir.Is Remdesivir life-saving?As hoarding of Remdesivir led to its shortage to some extent, the Union health ministry reiterated that Remdesivir is not a magic bullet. Neither it has proved to be life-saving. "It is important to understand that Remdesivir is not a magic bullet and is not a drug that decreases mortality. We may use it due to lack of an antiviral drug and it is useless if given at an early state to asymptomatic individuals or to patients with mild symptoms. It is also ineffective if administered late,” AIIMS director Dr Randeep Guleria said earlier.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/remdesivir-supply-surpasses-demand-centre-to-discontinue-allocations-to-states-101622275887059.html

Kerala, Mumbai have new rules for fast Covid-19 vaccination||People who have international travels scheduled for work or studies will be given priorities in vaccination against Covid-19 in Mumbai and Kerala, according to the latest decisions taken by the authorities. No foreign country has made vaccination against Covid-19 must for entry and a negative RT-PCR report is an acceptable document for international travel. But as restrictions are easing across the world with the pandemic situation coming under control, countries may make complete vaccination a must for entry. Several countries put an embargo on Indian flights in the wake of the second wave of the pandemic in the country in April.Student vaccination in MumbaiThe Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation will conduct free walk-in vaccination centres for students who have received the confirmation of admission in universities abroad and require vaccines. The sessions will be held from May 31 to June 2 at three centres — Rajawadi, Cooper and Kasturba.For students who have received confirmation of admission in universities abroad & require vaccines for the same, the @mybmc has arranged free, walk in vaccination this coming Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday (31st May, 1st, 2nd June) at 3 centres- Rajawadi, Cooper & Kasturba (1/n)We have received multiple queries with regard to the gap between the two doses and the scheduled/ possible departure of students for overseas universities. Since it is a medical advice, @mybmc will discuss with the concerned authorities for the same to assist the students.Maharashtra minister Aaditya Thackeray said he will speak to other municipal corporations across the state to implement the same for such students. Though the number may not be huge, their career should not be put at stake, the minister tweeted.Documents requiredThe students need to carry I- 20 or DS- 160 form/ verified confirmation letter of admission to universities concerned, along with personal ID documents.Fast vaccination in KeralaThe Kerala government will issue Covid-19 vaccine certificated to students and professionals who need to travel abroad. The state government said many countries want passport number mentioned on the vaccination certificate and hence the government will issue such certificates to those who require.This will be in addition to the certificate available on Co-WIN. The government said district medical officers will be authorised as the competent authority to issue such certificates.Those who have got the first dose of Covishield and can't wait for 12 to 16 weeks for the second dose, as stipulated according to the lastest directive, will also be administered the second dose after four to six weeks, the government said.Documents requiredLive visa, admission document for students, any document of job confirmation or work permit, as reported by ANI.What is a vaccine passport?This is a concept that is being deliberated by countries. Under this, countries may allow the entry of people from other countries, only if they are vaccinated. Countries may also specify the names of the vaccines.However, the Union health ministry said that there has been no consensus on vaccine passport at the World Health Organization level. So speculations that people vaccinated with Covaxin will not be able to travel abroad as Covaxin has not yet received the nod from WHO are unfounded, it said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/heading-abroad-kerala-mumbai-have-new-rules-for-fast-covid-19-vaccination-101622268846737.html

29-05-2021||India||Centre allocates vaccines for June as many states complain about doses sanctioned||The Centre has allocated vaccine quotas to states for June to bring clarity on how many doses they will get, a Union health ministry communication to states said even as most of them reported slowing down of vaccinations in May compared to April. Until May 27, 220 million doses were supplied to states of which 201 million or 91.04% (including wastage) were utilised, according to the Co-WIN website. India needs 2.2 billion vaccines to cover the population above 18.The health ministry data on vaccination shows that on average two million doses are being administered daily. The maximum weekly vaccination took place between April 3 and 9 when 24 million doses were given. This came down to 11.6 million from May 22 to 28, according to the Co-WIN website.The vaccinations in May were about 40% less than that in April even though functionaries such as V K Paul, member (health), Niti Aayog, have said all adult Indians would be vaccinated by the year-end.According to the information the Centre has provided to states, big states such as Rajasthan, Maharashtra, Gujarat, Tamil Nadu, Madhya Pradesh, Bihar and West Bengal will get at least 40 million doses in June. Uttar Pradesh has refused to share the data on the doses it is getting. The vaccines allocated to each state include doses for the first 15 days of June for the above 45-year-old age group and the vaccines the states would buy from the two Indian manufacturers, Serum Institute and Bharat Biotech, for the month. The Centre is bearing the cost of vaccinating people above 45. The states have to arrange for doses for people in the 18-45 age group. The number of vaccines that private hospitals can buy directly from manufacturers in June was not immediately known.A Jharkhand government official said: “We have been told that this is [the] interim quota and we would receive more vaccines than the number shared by the Central government.” The official added that several states have objected to very few vaccines allocated. The vaccination for the 18-45 age group started on May 1. But states such as Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh and Karnataka delayed it as enough vaccines were not available. Others like Haryana, Maharashtra and Rajasthan had to suspended vaccination for this age group in between in absence of enough vaccines.Officials and ministers in several states said the number of vaccines allocated would mean the closure of several vaccination centres.“The Centre’s letter informing about the vaccines we would get in June clearly shows the vaccination mess we are in,” said Chhattisgarh health minister T S Singh Deo. “We may have to close some new vaccination centres for the 18-45 age group. We would not be able to meet the target of vaccinating at least 20% of the population in June,” he said. Until now, about 5% of the state’s people have got at least one dose of Covid vaccines. “At this pace, we would take at least 4.5 years to vaccinate all people,” said state health secretary Alok Shukla.Rajasthan health minister Raghu Sharma said the quota system for vaccines introduced for June shows the Centre has failed to ensure enough vaccines. “We have been asking for Centre to take over procurement and distribution of vaccines and allow other government PSUs [Public Sector Undertakings] to take over manufacturing to meet the shortfall,” he said.Odisha’s additional chief secretary (health) PK Mohapatra said the state government was unhappy with the doses allocated. “If we get a large number of vaccines from the international manufacturers, we would be able to cover a large number of people in the 18-45 age group,” said Mohapatra.Karnataka health minister K Sudhakar said vaccinating all would remain a challenge with the quota of vaccines. “We and people have to understand the manufacturing constraints. We are trying to get vaccines from all sources including importing from international manufacturers,” he said. Goa chief minister Pramod Sawat said they have asked the Centre to allow inoculation of 18-45 from the vaccines meant for 45 plus group if there is not enough demand. “This would be a loan of doses,” Sawant said, admitting of shortage of vaccines for the 18-45 age group.Madhya Pradesh’s immunisation officer Santosh Shukla said if they receive the entire quota of vaccines from the Centre, the state would be able to do more vaccinations than it did in May. In May, the state inoculated 2.1 million people as compared to 4.2 million in April. “We could vaccinate 3.5 million people in June if the vaccine promised are made available,” he said. The state has administered close to 7.5 million doses so far.A West Bengal health department official said the state has been allocated around one million doses for the first 15 days of June, which is not enough. Andhra Pradesh principal secretary (medical and health) Anil Kumar Singhal said the state will get 1.1 million vaccination doses till June 15 and it would buy another 1.5 million doses. Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand would get lesser doses than they have administered in May. Kuldeep Singh Martoliya, the nodal officer for Covid-19 vaccination in Uttarakhand, said, “In June, we will receive over 20,00,00 Covishield and over 62,000 Covaxin doses for 45 and above and in case of 18-44 age bracket, we will get 14,10,00 Covishield and 41,970 Covaxin doses.” Himachal’s mission director, National Health Mission, Nipun Jindal said the state will 2,52,770 doses of Covishield from the Centre for the first fortnight of June. He added the state will procure 1,19,760 doses directly from the Serum Institute of India. “We have asked the Centre to increase the allocation,” Jindal said.Uttar Pradesh’s health and family welfare minister Jai Pratap Singh said the state will get adequate vaccines in June without disclosing the allocation made to the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-allocates-vaccines-for-june-as-many-states-complain-about-doses-sanctioned-101622266170027.html
29-05-2021||India||'So much fuss?': Mahua Moitra's dig as ministers slam Mamata for 'making PM Modi wait'||The meeting between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee over cyclone Yaas snowballed into a bigger political controversy as all BJP ministers, party chief ministers slammed Mamata for making PM Modi wait and then leaving the meeting just giving him a report. Shortly after this, the Centre invoked the All India Services Rule and directed the state government to relieve chief secretary Alapan Bandopadhyay, asking him to report at the North Block office of the department of training and personnel in Delhi on May 31.Mamata said she took PM Modi's permission before leaving the meeting which was attended by Union ministers Dharmendra Pradhan and Debasree Chaudhuri, governor Jagdeep Dhankhar and leader of the opposition in West Bengal Suvendu Adhikari.So much fuss over an alleged 30 min wait?Indians waiting 7 years for ₹15 lakhsWaiting hours at ATM queuesWaiting months for vaccines due Thoda aap bhi wait kar lijiye kabhi kabhi...The PM should also wait sometimes, Trinamool MP Mahua Moitra said comparing this to the wait of people for vaccines and for ₹15 lakhs in bank accounts. "So much fuss over an alleged 30 min wait? Indians waiting 7 years for ₹15 lakhs. Waiting hours at ATM queues. Waiting months for vaccines due. Thoda aap bhi wait kar lijiye kabhi kabhi...," she wrote.Mamata Didi’s conduct today is an unfortunate low. Cyclone Yaas has affected several common citizens and the need of the hour is to assist those affected. Sadly, Didi has put arrogance above public welfare and today’s petty behaviour reflects that.आपदा काल में बंगाल की जनता को सहायता देने के भाव से आए हुए प्रधानमंत्री के साथ इस प्रकार का व्यवहार पीड़ादायक है।जन सेवा के संकल्प व संवैधानिक कर्तव्य से ऊपर राजनैतिक मतभेदों को रखने का यह एक दुर्भाग्यपूर्ण उदहारण है, जो भारतीय संघीय व्यवस्था की मूल भावना को भी आहत करने वाला है।The episode on Friday drew a volley of attacks as Union home minister Amit Shah said Mamata's conduct was an "unfortunate low". Defence minister Rajnath Singh said Mamata's conduct was shocking and painful. BJP chief JP Nadda said Mamata's action was dangerous for "cooperative federalism".Union minister Prakash Javadekar said it was a black day in India's rich democratic heritage. "As the Prime Minister of India is kept waiting for a meeting held to expedite assistance to the people of WB, the petulance shown by the CM of Bengal is shocking indeed. For once she could’ve put petty politics aside, the spirit of cooperative federalism is the need of the hour," Union minister Smriti Irani said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/so-much-fuss-mahua-moitra-s-dig-as-ministers-slam-mamata-for-making-pm-modi-wait-101622264579388.html

29-05-2021||India||'Nothing against Ramdev but': IMA chief on withdrawing complaint against yoga guru||Amid the ongoing tussle between yoga guru Ramdev and the Indian Medical Association, IMA national chief Dr JA Jayalal said on Friday that the association has nothing against Ramdev and it will take back police complaints once the yoga guru withdraws his remarks against modern medicine. "We have nothing against yoga guru Baba Ramdev. His statements are against vaccination for Covid-19. We think his statements could confuse people, may divert them. This is our big concern as he has many followers," Dr Jayalal said to news agency PTI.The exchange of barbs between the yoga guru and the medical association has been going on without any sign of de-escalation, though Ramdev withdraws the video from where it all started — where the yoga guru was seen commenting derogatorily on allopathy. It was claimed that he was reading WhatsApp messages and was not expressing his opinion.Also Read: Ramdev fired 25 questions at IMA on allopathy. He gets a responseBut the tussle did not end as in another video the yoga guru was seen saying that nobody's father can arrest him. He also lobbed 25 questions to IMA and asked why modern medicine has not found the permanent treatment of hypertension. If Ramdev comes forward to withdraw his remark in its entirety, then the IMA will consider taking back the complaint and the defamation notice, Dr Jayalal said.Meanwhile, the Uttarakhand chapter of the Indian Medical Association responded to Ramdev's 25 questions and challenged Patanjali Togpeeth for an open, televised debate on allopathy.The allopathy versus Ayurveda row took a new turn as Patanjali Ayurved Limited managing director and Ramdev aide Acharya Balkrishna accused the IMA of being part of a conspiracy to convert the entire country into Christianity. Responding to this, Dr Jayalal said, "How does the question of religion even come here? This is purely a diversionary tactic by vested interests and nothing more. All my life I have served people without differentiating them on any basis and I would continue to serve them."(With PTI inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nothing-against-ramdev-but-ima-chief-on-withdrawing-complaint-against-yoga-guru-101622259282537.html

29-05-2021||India||Will never forget India was there for US in Covid-19 crisis: Anthony Blinken||External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar on Friday held wide-ranging talks with his US counterpart Antony Blinken and thanked the Biden administration for its "strong support and solidarity" with India at a moment of "great difficulty" for the country in combating the deadly Covid-19 pandemic.Jaishankar, who is on an official trip to the US, is the first Indian Cabinet minister to visit the country since Joe Biden became US President on January 20.Welcoming Jaishankar to the State Department, Blinken said in the early days of Covid-19, India was there for the US, something which the country "will never forget"."Now we want to make sure that we are there for and with India," he said.Addressing reporters at the State Department in a joint media interaction before the two leaders headed for the meeting, Jaishankar said, "We've a lot of issues to discuss. I think our relations have grown stronger over the years and I'm very confident that it'll continue to do so."“I also want to take the opportunity to express to the Secretary, through him to the administration, (and) to the United States for the strong support and solidarity and at the moment of great difficulty (for us),” he said.Blinken said the US and India are working together on many important challenges of "our time"."We are united in confronting Covid-19 together...We are united in dealing with the challenge posed by climate change and we are partnered together directly through the QUAD and other institutions in the United Nations in dealing with many of the challenges that we face in the region,” he said.The Quad is a grouping of the US, India, Japan and Australia that aims at strengthening a rules-based order in the strategically-important Indo-Pacific amidst China's aggressive actions in the region."The partnership between the US and India is vital, strong, and I think it is increasingly productive," Blinken added.Jaishankar is also the only third foreign minister to have visited the Foggy Bottom headquarters of the State Department to meet his US counterpart Blinken.

29-05-2021||India||Vaccine production can't be ramped up overnight, Centre explains why||The Union health ministry on Friday said vaccine production takes time and even if the production is being ramped up, it will not be translated to an increase in the immediate supply as this is not an overnight process. A vaccine is a biological product of medical importance and it takes time for harvesting and quality testing, the Centre said. The increase in manufacturing too needs to be a guided process as the end product should be safe, the ministry said defending its vaccination strategy.The statement comes as Congress leader Rahul Gandhi questioned the pace of vaccination and said there is no strategy for vaccination. At the current rate, it will take another three years to vaccinate the entire population and India will witness several waves of the pandemic by that time. Union minister of information and broadcasting Prakash Javadekar countered this criticism and said the health ministry has its roadmap prepared to vaccinate the entire population of the country by December 2021 as the production capacity of the present vaccines will be ramped up and more vaccines will be given clearance in the coming days.Covid-19 vaccines are in high demand globally and manufacturers across countries have limited manufacturing capacity, the ministry said, adding that despite the constraints of availability, India has covered 200 million persons in only 130 days which is the third-largest coverage in the world.4 crore Covaxin shots unaccounted?Reacting to reports that claimed that about four crore Covaxin doses are unaccounted for, the health ministry said those reports are not correct. "The claims of Bharat Biotech having 6 Crore doses is an error of comprehension among some quarters reporting the said matter," it said.Giving details of Bharat Biotech's vaccine supply, the ministry said the Hyderabad-based pharma company has supplied 2,76,66,860 vaccine doses to the Centre till May 28. In April, its production was 1 crore doses per month, which will reach 7-7 crore vaccine doses per month in July-August. By September, the production will reach nearly 10 crore doses.Quoting from affidavits filed by the Centre and Bharat Biotech's earlier statements, several reports claimed that there is a gap between what Bharat Biotech claims to be producing and the supply of the vaccine.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/vaccine-production-can-t-be-ramped-up-overnight-centre-explains-amid-congress-attack-101622251929271.html

Denying police inaction, Singh said a detailed probe is on into the matter and two more police teams have been formed to nab the accused. On the woman’s complaint, an FIR was lodged earlier at the Highway police station in Mathura on May 7 against a law professor of a local college and his three accomplices for allegedly sexually assaulting her a day earlier, police said. But, alleging that she was neither sent for any medical examination nor any action was taken against the alleged culprits, she submitted an application to the SSP on May 13, and threatened to burn herself to death in front of the police station, they said. Denying police inaction in the case, officials said her statement under section 161 of the CrPC was taken on May 7 and under section 164 of the CrPc while her medical examination too conducted on May 15 as her Covid-19 test report was received late, police said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/woman-attempts-self-immolation-over-inaction-in-rape-case-101622251529400.html

Around 30 minutes later, the cabin crew spotted the bat and the captain reported the incident to Air Traffic Control (ATC), the people said.“AI-105 DEL-EWR returned back to base (Delhi) after departure due to this local standby emergency was declared. On arrival, it was learnt that a bat was seen inside the cabin by crew members. Wildlife staff were called to catch and remove the bat from cabin. The aircraft landed safely at around 3:55 am. Later flight was declared Aircraft on Grounded (AoG),” news agency ANI quoted Air India officials as saying.The passengers were shifted to another plane and Air India flight AI-105 landed in Newark at 11:35 am local time.Once everyone was out of the aircraft, the Boeing B777-300ER aircraft was fumigated and the bat died, following which its carcass was recovered from the eighth row of the business class, they said.“Air India B777-300ER aircraft VT-ALM operating Flight AI - 105 (Delhi- Newark) was involved in air-turn-back due to bat reported in the cabin by cabin crew after departure. Fuel was jettisoned and the aircraft landed safely at Delhi,” a senior DGCA official told ANI.The incident has been reported to the airline’s flight safety department for a detailed investigation, people familiar with the matter said, adding that the airline has asked its engineering team to submit a report. In its preliminary report, the airline’s engineering team has blamed third parties for the incident. “The probable reason/cause may be loading vehicles like those for catering because all the time rats/bats come from their vehicle only,” an Air India official told ANI.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/air-india-flight-returns-after-crew-spots-bat-in-cabin-101622248211828.html

It also directed the petition to be supplied to office of the Attorney General for India.The bench asked the petitioner why an advance copy was not served to the Centre or CBSE. On Friday, as the bench took up the matter for the first time, it found only CISCE being represented in court by senior advocate JK Das.Initially, one of the justices was of the view that the matter could be heard on Tuesday, coinciding with the Centre’s decision on holding the Class 12 examinations in the wake of the second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic. But the bench decided to keep the matter on Monday.The petitioner sought a notice to be issued on her petition as several high courts were also being approached on the same issue. The bench told Sharma, “Be optimistic. May be there is a resolution in your favour.”Sharma appealed to cancel the Class 12 board examinations, saying students should not be made to suffer amidst an unprecedented public health crisis arising out of the Covid-19 pandemic.On April 14, CBSE issued notification cancelling Class 10 examinations, and postponing public examination for Class 12.

AICC president Sonia Gandhi should sack him from the party,” the chief minister said.An FIR was recently registered against Nath for allegedly maligning the image of India internationally by referring to the B.1.617 variant of coronavirus as the “Indian variant” and claiming that it was responsible for the second wave of the pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-is-infamous-nath-stokes-new-row-with-remark-101622236031934.html

Hek, a Bharatiya Janata Party legislator, added that he had come up with the idea and received approval from chief minister Conrad K Sangma who wanted the prayer to be organised at the earliest.“We need God’s intervention and His blessings. Without Him, we are absolutely nobody. That is why we as one big family should on this day especially take out time and hold this special prayer besides our daily ones,” the minister said.Meghalaya, which had 49 active Covid-19 cases and a cumulative of 14,000 confirmed cases on 1 April, has 8,025 active cases and a cumulative total of 33,835 confirmed cases. The state, which is estimated to have a population of 33 lakh, has registered 544 deaths including the 20 who, news agency Press Trust of India said, died on Friday.MDA Govt. has called all our fellow citizens to join hands in special Prayer on this Sunday the 30th May,2021 at 12 noon sharp of all faiths & Individuals.🙏 pic.twitter.com/WXox160tZJOnly divine protection can deliver people “who are suffering in various forms from this pestilence at this dark moment not only in the state but all around the world,” the minister said.Alexander Laloo Hek said the special prayer will be held at noon on Sunday and asked leaders of all faiths to urge people to pray and intercede with God in their respective homes.“We request everybody in their respective houses to assemble together maintaining protocols at 12 noon on May 30 and pray to the Almighty for His protection.” the minister, known to be a staunch Catholic, said.East Khasi hills, the district where state capital Shillong is located and has reported the maximum cases and deaths, has been under a total lockdown for nearly four weeks. The state initially imposed restrictions in April to curb the number of cases but later decided to go for a complete lockdown in the district when the situation didn’t improve.On Friday, PTI said deputy chief minister Prestone Tynsong announced that the lockdown in East Khasi Hills district will continue till June 7.According to covidtracking.in the state witnessed a growth of 177 per cent in coronavirus cases in just 14 days, the highest rate in the country so far.

29-05-2021||India||Covid-19: Delhi’s gradual unlock to start from Monday||Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Friday announced that construction sector and factories can resume operations from Monday, when a phased unlocking of the Capital will begin after a devastating surge in Covid-19 forced the city into shutting down all but essential services on April 19.The announcement came as the city recorded 1,141 new cases from 71,853 tests – which translated to a test positivity rate of under 2% for the third consecutive day. This number has been falling since first reducing to under 5% on May 21. The World Health Organization (WHO) considers a positivity rate of under 5% for two weeks to consider an outbreak as having been brought under control.Kejriwal said that in one month, Delhi has controlled the latest Covid-19 wave to a large extent and that there is no shortage of hospitals, Intensive Care Unit beds and medical oxygen at present. “So, we have to start the un-lockdown process. We should ensure that we do not land in a position in which people survive Covid-19 but die of poverty,” the chief minister said.He said the current lockdown protocol will apply till 5 am Monday. “And then the un-lockdown process will start. The decision was taken today [Friday] at the meeting of the [Lieutenant governor Anil Baijal-led] Delhi Disaster Management Authority.”Kejriwal, who is the DDMA vice-chairperson, said their priority will be the weakest economic sections in the un-lockdown process. “..we will start with labourers, especially migrant labourers. Most of them are engaged either in the construction sector or in factories. So, we will open these two sectors from this Monday.”Kejriwal said that to make sure cases do not surge again, the relaxations have to happen in a phased way.Experts stressed on the need to unlock the city carefully, with particular planning of how activities prone to crowding and close contact can be opened up. These include the opening up of marketplaces and malls, restaurants, gymnasiums, the Metro rail services and any activity that could drive up the number of people relying on public transport.“The government should be very meticulous about the phased relaxations. Hundred percent mask compliance should be mandatory not just on paper but enforced efficiently. Open spaces are less risky. In the coming weeks the government may take a call on opening market areas. In that case, they should go for staggered timings or alternate day formula to ensure that crowd is under control,” said Dr Jacob John, former head of the clinical virology department at Christian Medical College in Vellore.“The government should keenly observe the Covid-19 trends and take a call on relaxations concerning closed spaces such as pubs, gyms, cinema halls, etc, only when things are safe enough. But effective implementation of 100% mask compliance is a must. So, it is not just about planning things it is more about their efficient implementation,” he added.Kejriwal said that in subsequent weeks, more relaxations will be made after taking into account case numbers, expert inputs and public feedback. He said that if cases start increasing, all economic activities will have to be stopped again. “So, I urge people to adhere to all regulations and strictly follow Covid-19 appropriate behaviour. We are not in favour of a lockdown. We are aware of its implications.”At present, only people, institutes, and enterprises engaged in the delivery of essential goods and services are allowed to function – these include grocery stores, offices of core government agencies, pharmacies and banks, among some others.The construction sector and factory workers’ unions welcomed Friday’s announcement.“The un-lockdown initiative will bring big relief to tens of thousands of workers engaged in Delhi’s factories. But a large number of people have already left, and they are not likely to come back any time soon. The disease has affected them and their families back in villages. Most of them have run out of money too. They are unlikely to return to Delhi without a guaranteed job,” said Rajesh Kumar, general secretary, Delhi, Indian Federation of Trade Unions.Thaneshwar Adigaur, the convener of Nirmal Majdoor Adhikar Abhiyan, a joint forum of 40 construction sector labour unions in Delhi, said there is fear of another potential wave of Covid-19. “Children of migrant labourers no longer have to attend physical classes in schools any time soon. So, those who have left for villages are likely to be there for a few more months. However, for the construction workers who stayed back and those who plan to return, the announced relaxation will be a big relief.”HT reported on May 22 that at least 800,000 migrant labourers are estimated to have left Delhi for their home states in buses from the three interstate bus terminals in the first four weeks of the lockdown.Neeraj Sehgal, a factory owner and general secretary of an industrial area welfare body in Delhi’s Mayapuri, said factory owners too are facing problems and, hence, are unlikely to expand their workforce beyond a point. “In the next three months, production capacity is likely to remain under 50% because of the financial losses caused by the pandemic. It would be great if the government considers relaxations for the industry sector too in terms of rent relaxation, tax relief and waiver on at least fixed charges on power and water.”The coming weeks will be crucial as it buys the city some time to ramp up the vaccination drive, experts said.“We have to scale up vaccination at this stage. Supply shortage cannot be an excuse. Governments will together have to work towards resolving that,” said Dr Jugal Kishore, head of the community medicines department in Delhi’s Safdarjung Hospital.Kishore said as cases and positivity rate declines significantly, tests are likely to decline. “But the government should have its testing infrastructure in place. Any inconvenience in this regard naturally leads to hesitance and the test-trace-isolate model eventually collapses,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhis-gradual-unlock-to-start-from-monday-101622229206228.html
29-05-2021||India||GST Council forms GoM for tax slabs of Covid essentials||In a series of decisions on Friday, the Goods and Service Tax (GST) Council formed a group of ministers (GoM) to decide on waiving off taxes on Covid-19 essentials such as vaccines, expanded the list of relief items imported without duties to also include drugs for mucormycosis, eased compliance burdens for small businesses, and decided to borrow ₹1.58 lakh crore to compensate states for their revenue shortfall in the 2021-22 financial year.After a nine-hour long meeting of the federal body, Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman said that a “protracted discussion” on the issue of tax exemption on individual items for Covid-19 led to the decision that a GoM should be set up, which will submit its report “within 10 days ... on or before 8th June, so that if there are any further reductions which need to be done, will be done”.She said the GoM will be constituted on Saturday.Several states have been demanding GST waivers for Covid essentials. While vaccines and cotton masks attract 5% GST, most of the other items, such as testing kits, drugs, medical oxygen, oxygen concentrators and ventilators, attract 12% GST. Alcohol-based sanitiser, hand wash, disinfectants and thermometers are under the 18% tax slab.The GST Council is chaired by Sitharaman and finance ministers of states are its members.Sitharaman said the council on Friday decided to exempt integrated GST (IGST) on import of Amphotericin-B, a medicine to treat mucormycosis, a fungal infection that has emerged as a Covid-19 complication.She said the scope of the IGST waiver on Covid-19 relief materials such as medical oxygen, oxygen concentrators, oxygen storage equipment, diagnostic kits and vaccines have also been extended to imports “on payment basis” for donating to the government or recognised relief agencies. These exemptions will be valid up to August 31.So far, IGST exemption was applicable only if these items were imported “free of cost” for free distribution. All these goods are already exempted from basic customs duty.“I think, one of the biggest decisions of today is on the reduction of compliance burden of small taxpayers and also some medium-size taxpayers. Late fee amnesty related matters have also been decided upon... for reducing the late fee payable in these cases,” she said adding that about 89% taxpayers will benefit.While late fees have been rationalised for the future to provide long-term relief to small taxpayers, return filing has also been simplified, she said.She said the issue of compensation cess was also discussed in the meeting and the same mechanism of FY-21 was adopted for 2021-22. “So the rough estimate is that the Centre will have to borrow about ₹1.58 lakh crore and pass it on to states on a back-to-back arrangement like we did last year,” she said. HT wrote about it on May 27.The GST law assures states get a 14% increase in their annual revenue for five years from July 1, 2017, and also guarantee them that their revenue shortfall, if any, would be made good through the compensation cess levied on luxury goods and sin products such as liquor, cigarettes, aerated water, automobiles, coal and tobacco products.In the previous financial year, due to the first wave, the GST revenue fell short by about ₹2.35 lakh crore. The Centre last year gave two borrowing options facilitated by a special window of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to states. First was to borrow the GST shortfall of ₹1.10 lakh crore and repay both principal and interest from the compensation cess. In the second option, only the principal amount would be paid from the compensation cess. After some resistance by 10 Opposition-ruled states, the first option was eventually accepted.On extension of compensation cess beyond June 2022, Sitharaman said the matter will be discussed at a special section of the council.MS Mani, senior director at consultancy firm Deloitte India said: “While the amnesty scheme would significantly benefit small businesses, there is a need to extend the same to other businesses who may not have fulfilled their obligations due to the pandemic.”“Exemption of any product is a complex exercise involving the entire value chain and it is essential that the interests of all stakeholders are taken into consideration.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/gst-council-forms-gom-for-tax-slabs-of-covid-essentials-101622229204402.html
29-05-2021||India||Hyderabad Police file charge sheet in ₹30,000-cr money lending racket||Hyderabad The Hyderabad Cybercrime police on Friday filed a charge sheet in connection with ₹30,000-crore online money lending racket, allegedly based out of China. Police also said that so far 28 persons have been arrested in the case, including the prime accused Zhu Wei, alias Lambo, and three other Chinese nationals. The kingpin of the racket, Zixia Zhang alias Jennifer, was still absconding, the charge sheet said. According to the Cybercrime police, the racket was busted in December 2020 and subsequently, the accused were arrested over a period of four months. In the charge sheet, the police said the modus operandi of the gang, operated from Shanghai in China, was to offer instant loans through mobile applications to individuals. Several instant loan applications including Loan Gram, Cash Train, Cash Bus, AAA Cash, Super Cash, Mint Cash, Happy Cash, Loan Card, Repay One, Money Box and Monkey Box were hosted on Google PlayStore, police said. Explaining the modus operandi, police said once customers installed the app, the company would get access to all contacts and other data from the mobile phone. They would then transfer loan amount to borrowers after deducting 25% to 30%, police said. The racket also set up four call centres in India and hired executives to collect exorbitant repayments from the borrowers after adding interest, processing charges, GST, and default charges, police said, adding that the racket would charge 1% penalty after expiry of the loan period. “These executives resorted to systematic abusing, harassing, and threatening defaulters through call centres run by them. They even blackmail the borrowers by sending fake legal notices to their relatives and family members,” the police said. The racket lured hundreds of borrowers in the Telugu states of Telangana and Andhra Pradesh, apart from Bengaluru, Chennai and Mumbai, by offering lakhs in loans on hefty interests. “In Telangana, seven people died by suicide after they were unable to bear the harassment of these online lending agencies,” police said. The Cybercrime police told the court that the total transactions indulged in by the accused ran into around ₹30,000 crore. “They made a profit of around ₹11,000 crore, which they diverted to benami accounts,” the Cybercrime police said in the charge sheet. The accused have been booked under sections 420 and 506 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC), Section 66 of the IT Act-2008, and sections 3, 10 and 13(1) of the Telangana Money Lenders Act.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hyderabad-police-file-charge-sheet-in-30-000-cr-money-lending-racket-101622229084293.html
29-05-2021||India||Kerala HC quashes 80:20 distribution of minority scholarships||Thiruvananthapuram: The Kerala high court on Friday quashed the state government orders providing merit-cum-means scholarships at 80% to the Muslim community and 20% to Latin Catholic and Converted Christian students. A division bench of Chief Justice Manikumar and Justice Shaji P Chaly directed the Kerala government to formulate a fresh plan that will benefit students of both communities equally. The court said the directorate of minority welfare board’s order was not legally sustainable. The court’s order came on a petition filed by one Justin P of Palakkad in which he said the fixation ratio was not based on actual population of these two communities and was highly biased and the state government was supporting one particular community. But the government argued that unemployment rate among Muslim community was 52%, Christians 31.9% and backward Hindus 40%. Besides, the government also pointed to the Sachar Committee report, which clearly emphasised the backwardness of Muslims in education field and need to improve their educational conditions. However, the court said the decision of the government was unconstitutional and unsupported by law. As part of the scheme, the Kerala government provides 5,000 scholarships to degree and post-graduate students, especially women students, every year. The scheme was later extended to students from Latin Catholic and converted Christians. In 2015, an order was formulated to give 80% scholarship to Muslims and 20% to Christians. The move was challenged in the court. Several church leaders have been complaining about the same for quite some time, prompting chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan to keep the minority welfare portfolio with him this time.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-hc-quashes-80-20-distribution-of-minority-scholarships-101622229025500.html
29-05-2021||India||Kerala HC refuses to stay Lakshadweep regulations||Thiruvananthapuram: The Kerala High Court on Friday refused to stay the implementation of the draft Lakshadweep Development Authority Regulation (LDAR) 2021and sought the response of the Centre and Lakshadweep administration in two weeks on a public interest litigation (PIL) against it. The PIL, filed by Congress leader K P Noushad Ali, said the new draft regulation ensures sweeping, arbitrary and unchecked powers to the island administration and would destroy the unique culture and tradition of the island. The rules would also affect the possession and retention of property by the island residents, it added. While the counsel for the petitioner insisted for an interim stay on regulations, a division bench of Justices K Vinod Chandran and M R Anitha observed that it was a policy matter and let all persons involved share their views with the court. The court also sent notices to the Union government and island administration and posted the hearing after two weeks. Lakshadweep administrator Praful Khoda Patel’s controversial reforms have attracted widespread resentment among the local populace with many believing the changes are aimed at “destroying the unique culture and tradition” of the islands. About a dozen MPs, including Mohammed Faizal, who represents the island, sent letters to the President seeking Patel’s immediate recall.The Congress, CPI(M) and Muslim League joined hands to oppose the decisions, saying Patel was trying to “saffronise the island” where almost 95% population is Muslim.Collector of the Union territory Askar Ali, however, defended the rules and alleged that people with vested interests were spreading misinformation over it to project the administration in poor light. He added that the administration was trying to develop the island as a major tour hub like Maldives and that local people were in favour of the effort. Ali said Maldives and Lakshadweep have the same features and climate but the former was way ahead in tourism. Fresh initiatives would help open new avenues for the latter to ensure development and prosperity, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-hc-refuses-to-stay-lakshadweep-regulations-101622229024170.html
29-05-2021||India||Congress launches scathing attack on K’taka govt’s vaccine drive||Bengaluru The Karnataka Congress on Friday launched a scathing attack against the BS Yediyurappa government over the vaccination drive in the state.“@BJP4Karnataka govt has increased the service charge from ₹100 to ₹200 to get vaccinated. Whose interests are the @BJP4Karnataka leaders trying to protect? People of Karnataka? Or The private hospitals?,” Siddaramaiah, former chief minister and leader of the opposition said in a post on Twitter.The Congress has attacked the BJP-led government of giving rise to a situation in which private hospitals had enough stock for paid vaccinations but government and other public facilities were running dry.“It is unfortunate that health minister @mla_sudhakar is promoting a private hospital instead of ensuring the availability of vaccines at govt hospitals. Is he a minister? Or a brand ambassador for private hospital?,” Siddaramaiah added.The former chief minister also targeted Bengaluru South MP, Tejasvi Surya who continues to partner with private hospitals to administer paid-vaccinations.“Karnataka’s vaccination drive is so slow that we haven’t even been able to vaccinate all health and frontline workers yet. What an absolute shame. Karnataka deserves better.#LetCongressVaccinate,” DK Shivakumar, the president of the Congress in Karnataka tweeted.Karnataka has so far administered a total of 13,016,720 doses of vaccine, according to the daily health bulletin of the state health department. Of this, 2,691,291 are second doses, according to government data.The total vaccination coverage is under 5% of the estimated 60.5 million population in the state.The poor vaccination coverage has left a significant number of people vulnerable to Covid-19. The health department on Friday said that the state recorded 22,823 new Covid-19 cases and 52,253 recoveries that brings down the total number of active cases to 372,373. The positivity rate dropped to 16.42%.Bengaluru recorded 5,736 new infections that brought down its active caseload to 180697. However, the death toll continued to rise with at least 401 more losing their lives in a single day, including 192 in Bengaluru.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/congress-launches-scathing-attack-on-k-taka-govt-s-vaccine-drive-101622228904251.html
29-05-2021||India||State govt’s financial package an ‘eyewash’: Congress||Bengaluru The Karnataka Congress on Friday termed the ₹1,250-crore relief package announced by the BS Yediyurappa-led government an “eyewash” while alleging the amount was not sufficient to address the growing distress in the state due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Attacking the state government, Congress leaders Krishna Byre Gowda and Priyank Kharge said the most effective way to revive the economy amid the pandemic was to give money directly to the poor. “If one rupee is spent, it rotates at least five times in our economy. For economic revival and to kickstart and stimulate it, giving money to the poor is 100% effective…,” Gowda said. “These (government) people do not have the heart to help the poor. They need to have common sense that to revive the economy, even if you cannot create new jobs but to protect existing ones, saving existing companies can be done by helping the poor,” he added. CM Yediyurappa on May 19 had announced a financial relief package for a section of the people who have been hit hard by the Covid-19 pandemic and the subsequent lockdowns that have affected their livelihood and income. “To provide relief to people who have lost income and livelihood due to the 2nd wave of Covid-19, ₹1,250 crore of economic support has been sanctioned to farmers, workers from the unorganised sector, auto and cab drivers, street vendors among others,” Yediyurappa said in a post on Twitter. Several sections of people including domestic help, auto and cab drivers among others were left out of the financial package and were unlikely to get any relief, HT reported. The state is under the lockdown till June 7. Last year, the state government had announced two packages, amounting to around ₹2,100 crore, but there were allegations that most of this did not reach the intended groups. Karnataka, like other states in the country, has seen thousands of livelihoods being affected due to the lockdown, with many people having to survive on help and relief supplied mostly by volunteer groups. “A package of ₹5,000 was announced for 775,000 auto and taxi drivers. But only 214,000 drivers got the benefit,” Gowda said, adding that several people were yet to receive the benefit of the financial package announced last year. He said only ₹58 crore was disbursed to horticulture farmers as against the allocation of ₹137 crore. “In last year’s package, from what they had announced, around ₹700 to ₹800 crore has still not been given,” Gowda added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/state-govt-s-financial-package-an-eyewash-congress-101622228784189.html
29-05-2021||India||Over 9% patients died outside hospital in Karnataka during 2nd Covid wave: Data||In the second wave of Covid-19, close to 9 out 100 (i.e.9.3%) patients died outside a hospital, shows the analysis of health bulletins released by the Karnataka state health department on so far. In comparison, during the Covid first wave, only 4 out of 100 (i.e. 3.8%) patients died outside a hospital, according to the data.As the second wave shows a declining trend in the state, Hindustan Times compiled a data on Covid-19 deaths from state health department bulletins and compared the deaths in the first and second wave of the pandemic. While the data of number of deaths during the first wave is between August 1 and September 30, 2020, a time when the state reported the highest number of cases, data on deaths during the second wave is between April 1 to May27.In the first wave of the virus, 6,551 people lost their lives to Covid-19 in the two months, while in the second wave 14,167 deaths were reported. While the number of deaths in the second wave is more than double compared to the first, experts say that the case fatality rate (number of deaths reported per 100 cases) is low. “If we look at the absolute number of deaths, they are definitely high in the second wave. But if you look at the number cases, the second wave had more,” said the senior bureaucrat, who didn’t want to be named.“The case fatality rate is the best way to understand this. Even though we reported more deaths, the case fatality rate in April 2021 was around 0.77% and in April 2020 the CFR was 4.09%. The average number of deaths has reduced in the second wave,” he added.Similarly, in the cases of hospitalisation, out of the 14,167 deaths, 1,322 were reported from outside a hospital, which is 9.3% of all deaths reported in the second wave. In comparison, in the first wave, out of the 6,551 deaths, only 251 (3.8%) died outside a hospital, as per analysis of data from the government bulletins.Giridhar Babu, head of epidemiology department at the Public Health Foundation of India and member of state Technical Advisory Committee (TAC) on Covid-19 said that change between the first and second wave shows that the medical facilities in the state were overwhelmed by surge in cases. “Several people were unable to find a bed in the second wave. The change in policy towards home isolation also meant that people started looking for hospitals late and they were unable to find them because of hospitals running out of space,” said Babu.Similarly, the second wave showed an increase in the number of deaths in the age group of 30-45. A comparison of the numbers shows that in the first wave around 11 out of 100 deaths belonged to the 30–45-year age group, in the second wave, 16 out of the 100 deaths were reported in this category.However, for the age category of under 30 years, there was no big change in the numbers. In the first wave, 2.2% of deaths belonged to those under 30, while in the second wave it marginally increased to 2.9%.The data also highlighted how many victims exhibited comorbidities. While 71.3% of Covid-19 cases in Karnataka showed some comorbidity such as diabetes or breathing problems, in the second wave, these number dropped to 61.7%. Does it mean more people without any comorbidities died? Babu says this may not be the case. “In India, people get commodities at least 10 years before other countries. This is one of the reasons why we have high number of deaths in the 30–45-year age category. The number of people without any reported comorbidities show that many people are unaware of the medical problems they have,” he said.He said that there are several lessons to be learnt from the first and second waves even as the state prepares to tackle the third wave which expected around November this year. “If we look at the Mumbai numbers, the number of deaths in 60 years + age category has come down because they have been vaccinated. So, we need to focus on vaccination before the third wave and an increase in the number of people dying outside the hospital shows that more investment is needed in creating beds,” he pointed out.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/over-9-patients-died-outside-k-taka-hospitals-during-2nd-covid-wave-data-101622228604236.html
29-05-2021||India||Drama as Didi hands report at PM meet, leaves; Bengal chief secy recalled to Delhi||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday conducted aerial survey of cyclone Yaas impacted areas in West Bengal and Odisha and held review meeting with officials in the two states, and announced immediate financial assistance of ₹1,000 crore.West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee, however, skipped the meeting chaired by him, although she did meet him to give a report of the damage caused by the cyclone. “Since morning we have been conducting aerial survey. We then went to Kalikunda because the Prime Minister had called a meeting. We didn’t know. We had (scheduled an administrative) meeting in Digha. But still we went to Kalaikunda and handed over the report...,” said Banerjee.Banerjee said, as per the report submitted to the PM, the state has suffered a damage of around ₹15,000 crore.The PM’s review meeting was attended by Union ministers Dharmendra Pradhan and Debasree Chaudhuri, governor Jagdeep Dhankhar and, interestingly, leader of the opposition in West Bengal and BJP leader Suvendu Adhikari. No state government officials attended it.Top leaders of the BJP, including party president JP Nadda and Union ministers Amit Shah and Rajnath Singh, slammed Banerjee for skipping the PM’s meeting. Nadda tweeted that it was “the murder of constitutional ethos & the culture of cooperative federalism”.TMC spokesperson Kunal Ghosh hit back. “ We don’t have time to respond to all these as our leaders are busy working...”Hours later, the Centre called state chief secretary Alapan Bandopadhyay, who accompanied Banerjee on Friday and who was to retire on May 31, to Delhi. The Centre sent a letter to the state government, asking Bandopadhyay to report for duty at the North Block office of the department of training and personnel in Delhi on May 31.Bandyopadhyay was given a three-month extension recently.TMC spokesperson Ghosh termed it a “vindictive action by the BJP which can’t get over its humiliating loss in recent polls”.In Odisha, chief minister Naveen Patnaik participated in the review meeting chaired by the PM, and did not demand any immediate package from Centre for undertaking relief and restoration saying that the country needs funds for Covid. “However, we sought assistance for long term measures to make Odisha disaster resilient...,” Patnaik said.The PM also announced a payment of ₹2 lakh each to the families of the deceased and ₹50,000 each to the injured.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/row-after-mamata-skips-pm-s-cyclone-meet-101622227584096.html
29-05-2021||India||‘Great disservice to your office’: India stings UNGA Prez for his Kashmir remark||India on Friday described as “unwarranted” and “regrettable” the remarks by UN General Assembly President Volkan Bozkir that Pakistan should raise the Kashmir issue more forcefully and that all parties should refrain from steps that affect the status of Jammu and Kashmir.Bozkir, a former Turkish diplomat who assumed office last September, made the comments at a Press interaction with Pakistan foreign minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi in Islamabad on Thursday. Bozkir, the first Turkish national to preside over the General Assembly, was on an official visit to Pakistan during which he also met Prime Minister Imran Khan.“We express our strong opposition to the unwarranted references made with respect to the Indian union territory of Jammu and Kashmir by the President of the United Nations General Assembly (PGA) Volkan Bozkir during his recent visit to Pakistan,” external affairs ministry spokesperson Arindam Bagchi said.Bozkir’s remarks that “Pakistan is ‘duty bound’ to raise the Kashmir issue at the UN more strongly are unacceptable”, and there is no basis for comparing the situation in Jammu and Kashmir to other global situations, Bagchi said.“When an incumbent President of the UN General Assembly makes misleading and prejudiced remarks, he does great disservice to the office he occupies. The PGA’s behaviour is truly regrettable and surely diminishes his standing on the global platform,” he added.At the press interaction in Islamabad, Bozkir said Qureshi had compared the Palestine and Kashmir issues. He also noted that Palestine has more “political wind” behind it, whereas the Kashmir issue doesn’t have the “same enlarged political wind behind it”.Noting that it is Pakistan’s duty to bring the Kashmir issue to the UN “more strongly”, he said a meeting could be held on the matter if a group of countries submit an application.Bozkir added, “As an impartial president of the General Assembly, I must also reiterate that the UN position on Jammu and Kashmir is governed by the UN Charter and applicable Security Council resolutions.“India and Pakistan’s Simla Agreement of 1972...states that the final status of Jammu and Kashmir is to be settled by peaceful means in accordance with the UN Charter and this is, I think, very important that we must all remember.”Bozkir further said, “I think both parties, all parties, must refrain from taking steps that could affect the status of Jammu and Kashmir. This is I think the very important part of how we look at the case.”In August 2019, India revoked the special status of Jammu and Kashmir and split the state into two union territories. Pakistan opposed the move, which Indian officials said was aimed at increasing development, curbing terrorism and bringing the region into the mainstream.India has rejected Pakistan’s criticism of these developments as interference in its internal matters.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/great-disservice-to-your-office-india-stings-unga-prez-for-his-kashmir-remark-101622226879025.html
29-05-2021||India||SC asserts HCs’ power to protect from arrest||High courts are empowered to protect an accused from arrest for a certain period of time even if it rejects the anticipatory bail plea, the Supreme Court ruled on Friday, while underscoring that bail provisions must be liberally construed by the courts to take into account myriad situations.A three-judge bench, headed by chief justice of India (CJI) NV Ramana, cleared up the legal position, as it held in favour of a high court exercising such powers under the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC) to “secure the ends of justice”.In the wake of two orders by the Allahabad high court, granting 90 days to two accused to surrender, the top court was called upon to remove the ambiguity in law as to whether a high court was authorised to protect an accused from arrest for some time even though it did not grant pre-arrest bail.The bench, which included justices Surya Kant and Aniruddha Bose, laid down that a high court could pass such protective orders under Section 482 of the CrPC, which recognised the HC’s inherent power to pass directions in the interest of justice.Inherent powers under section 482 of the CrPC include the power to quash first information reports (FIRs), investigation, or any criminal proceedings, and to pass any directive to prevent abuse of the process of any court and miscarriage of justice, depending upon the facts of a case. “This provision (section 482) reflects the reality that no law or rule can possibly account for the complexities of life, and the infinite range of circumstances that may arise in the future,” noted the bench.“Even when the court is not inclined to grant anticipatory bail to an accused, there may be circumstances where the high court is of the opinion that it is necessary to protect the person apprehending arrest for some time...,” it held.At the same time, the bench also flagged that the discretionary power could not be exercised by the high courts “in an untrammelled manner”.On the facts in the cases before it, the court noted that the accused in the first case was charged for causing the death of the petitioner’s daughter over dowry demands, whereas the accused in the second case was involved in brutally assaulting the brother and sons of the petitioner.The bench said the HC order restraining police from arresting them for 90 days did not withstand legal scrutiny since there were no special reasons cited why they were entitled to this relief even after their pre-arrest bail pleas were rejected. “During the said duration (of 90 days), they can roam freely without being apprehensive of coercive action. We are thus of the view that the high court committed a grave error in passing such protection to the accused. Such a direction by the HC exceeds its judicial discretion and amounts to judicial largesse, which the courts do not possess,” said the bench, cancelling the protective orders passed on February 8.The court gave liberty to the police to complete the investigations in accordance with the law.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-asserts-hcs-power-to-protect-from-arrest-101622227464071.html
29-05-2021||India||Stand with India in Covid fight: Blinken at meet with Jaishankar||US secretary of state Antony Blinken on Friday assured his Indian counterpart S Jaishankar that Washington would stand with New Delhi in tackling Covid-19 just as India had stood by the US in the initial days of the pandemic last year.The assurance came as Jaishankar met Blinken in Washington to discuss cooperation in the global response to Covid-19, including access to vaccines and raw materials, and regional developments such as the situation in Afghanistan. Jaishankar is the first Indian cabinet minister to visit the US since the Biden administration assumed office in January.“We remember in the earlier days of Covid, India was there for the US, something we’ll never forget, and now we want to make sure that we’re there for and with India,” Blinken told reporters before beginning his meeting with Jaishankar at the state department.Jaishankar said India-US relations had grown stronger over the years and expressed his gratitude for the strong support and solidarity shown by the Biden administration “at a moment of great difficulty for us”.The US administration and private firms have delivered relief materials and equipment worth more than $500 million to India to help the country’s response to a devastating second wave of coronavirus pandemic in India.Access to the US surplus stockpiles of Covid-19 vaccines and opening up supply chains for raw materials and components needed to ramp up the production of vaccines have been a focus area of Jaishankar’s five-day visit to the US. The Biden administration has announced it will donate 80 million doses of vaccines to countries around the world by June and India is hoping to get a significant number of jabs both directly and through the WHO-backed COVAX facility.Blinken said the US and India are working together on many important challenges that are having a profound impact on the lives of the citizens of both countries. “We are united in confronting Covid-19 together, we are united in dealing with the challenge posed by climate change and we are partnered together directly and through the Quad and other institutions of the UN in dealing with many of the challenges we face in the region and around the world,” he said.Describing the partnership between the US and India as vital, he added, “It’s strong and I think it’s increasingly productive.”Jaishankar met Blinken after he returned from a hectic visit to the Middle East to help shore up the fragile ceasefire between Israel and Hamas following 11 days of hostilities. He also met defense secretary Lloyd Austin, US trade representative Katherine Tai, National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan and director of national intelligence Avril Haines in Washington.Jaishankar tweeted that he and Austin had a “comprehensive conversation about further developing our strategic and defence partnership” and exchanged views on contemporary security challenges. He also expressed appreciation for the US military’s role in responding to the Covid-19 situation.In a separate tweet after his meeting with Tai, Jaishankar said trade, technology and business cooperation are at the core of India’s strategic partnership with the US. “Enhancing them is vital to post-Covid economic recovery,” he added.Jaishankar welcomed Tai’s “positive stance” on intellectual property rights issues – a reference to the US support for India’s call for patent protections to be waived for Covid-19 vaccines – and her support for efficient and robust supply chains.The situation in the Indo-Pacific and Afghanistan figured in Thursday’s meeting between Jaishankar and Sullivan, who tweeted that people-to-people ties and values are the “foundation of the US-India partnership and will help us end the pandemic, lead on climate, and support a free and open Indo-Pacific”.At a meeting with House Foreign Affairs Committee chairman Gregory Meeks and ranking member Michael McCaul, Jaishankar discussed developments related to the Quad and cooperation on vaccines. He also held a meeting with House India Caucus co-chairs Brad Sherman and Steve Chabot.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jaishankar-holds-talks-with-us-nsa-defence-secretary-101622227081864.html
29-05-2021||India||Covid-19: Rahul slams PM Modi over inoculation drive, warns of more waves||Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Friday cautioned the central government against more waves of the Covid pandemic if the country’s vaccine strategy is not fixed as he blamed Prime Minister Narendra Modi for the second wave and asked him to form a panel that should meet daily to take stock of the crisis.Gandhi concluded that Modi’s image is “dead” as a result of the mismanagement of the pandemic and that the ruling dispensation’s strategy to “spread lies” about Covid fatalities is not helping India’s war against the virus. “The second wave is because of the PM’s drama. The PM didn’t fulfil his responsibilities,” Gandhi said.In a virtual press meet, Gandhi asked the government to stop blaming the states and said, “If (Chhattisgarh CM) Bhupesh Baghel, (West Bengal CM) Mamata Banerjee and Modi are on the same page, the door will be shut for the coronavirus,” adding that the government “kept the door wide open” for the virus to circulate.“I told the PM if you don’t implement the vaccine strategy properly, you will give time and space for Covid to grow. In this way, Covid waves will continue to come. There will be a fourth, fifth or even sixth wave.”He labelled the modified vaccine strategy that opened jabs to all adults and allowed private hospitals to sell doses as “business” and said that the US has already vaccinated 50% of its population and Brazil is also ahead of India, the vaccine manufacturing hub of the world.“Masks, social distancing and lockdown are temporary solutions. Vaccination is the only permanent solution but its (the government’s) strategy so far has been completely wrong. The RSS-BJP doesn’t allow the PM to get any information. The PM should form a panel, hold daily meetings and talk regularly to experts to make (Covid management) strategy,” Gandhi said.The government has set up six group of bureaucrats, a national panel on vaccines and a core group to oversee various aspects of India’s fight against Covid. Information and broadcasting minister Prakash Javadekar hit back at Gandhi, while announcing that the country will vaccinate the entire adult population by the end of the year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rahul-slams-pm-modi-over-inoculation-drive-warns-of-more-waves-101622227404238.html
29-05-2021||India||‘Will vaccinate all by end of year’: Javadekar hits back at Congress||Union minister Prakash Javadekar said India will vaccinate most of its population by December, adding that the country’s vaccine drive will move up a gear from August.The minister was responding to Congress leader Rahul Gandhi who termed the country’s vaccine drive “nautanki” on Friday, and attributed the second wave of the Covid-19 to this.“The health ministry last week made it clear that within December the nation will produce 216 crore (2.16 billion) doses of Covid-19 vaccines which means that at least 108 crore (1.08 billion) people will be able to get their shots. So, Rahul Gandhi should understand that India will vaccinate all by December 2021” Javadekar said .Till Friday evening, India has vaccinated 44 million people fully and administered only one dose to 120 million people. It is currently vaccinating on average 2.2 million people a day.The health ministry’s projections of 2.16 billion doses being available is for the period between August and December and assumes significant capacity enhancements, and the approval of some vaccines that are still in clinical trials. The Ken reported that the actual number available would be around 1.09 billion doses and Reuters has said that the overall number could be an overstatement with Serum Institute of India, which makes Covishield, likely to miss the 750 million number mentioned by the health ministry by around 27% (or 200 million). Even assuming that India would vaccinate its entire 18-year plus population (940 million) by the end of the year, it will require the country to vaccinate a little in excess of 7.5 million people every day.The minister claimed that both supply and the pace of vaccinations would shortly increase“Covisheild, Covaxin, Zydus Cadila, Novavax, Genova and Sputnik, all these vaccines will soon be produced in India now… And with projected imports… India will have a total of 216 crore doses,” he said. To be sure, of these only Covishield, Covaxin and Sputnik have been approved for emergency use.Attacking Gandhi, Javadekar said: “The whole nation is condemning the words of Rahul Gandhi today. He used the words, “PM’s Nautanki exactly the way they are prescribed in their tool kit.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/will-vaccinate-all-by-end-of-year-javadekar-hits-back-at-rahul-gandhi-101622227344131.html

The ministry had written to all social media intermediaries to share the contact details of the new officials.The official added that significant social media intermediaries which have 5 million users or more, such as Koo, Sharechat, Telegram, LinkedIn, Google, Facebook and WhatsApp have shared details with the government.A WhatsApp representative said details of its grievance officer can be found on its website in the FAQ section. A person linked to Facebook said the company has shared the required details with the ministry.Also read: Standoff on IT rules as Twitter flags concernsThe official mentioned above said that after a stern communication was sent to Twitter, the company shared details of “a lawyer working in a law firm in India as their Nodal Contact Person and Grievance Officer”.“The rules require that these designated officers of the significant social media companies must be the employees of the company and resident in India,” the official said. “Twitter has not yet sent the details of the Chief Compliance Officer.”Twitter on Thursday raised concerns regarding “intimidation tactics by the police” and with the “core elements” of the new social media and intermediary guidelines. The statement prompted a backlash from the Centre which called the remarks an “attempt to dictate its terms”.The exchange represents a snowballing controversy over new guidelines that direct companies such Twitter, WhatsAapp and Facebook to regulate content, appoint officers who will be liable for compliance, and adopt features such as traceability of messages and voluntary user verification.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/google-facebook-and-whatsapp-submitdetails-of-new-compliance-officers-101622227164551.html

The data will also need to undergo a peer review.“The first interim efficacy analysis showed vaccine efficacy of nearly 81%, and the second interim analysis showed it to be about 78%. The final analysis was done at 130 confirmed case and it was found to be 78%,” said Dr Sanjay Rai, professor, community medicine department, All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), Delhi.“The interim analysis may be over, the analysed data needs to be peer-reviewed and published in a medical journal now,” added Rai, who is also the principal investigator of the study site at AIIMS.The developments were also confirmed by an official concerned in the central government, aware of the matter.“We have been made to understand that the interim analysis results for Covaxin phase 3 trials are almost done, and they are in the process of publishing the data,” the official said on condition of anonymity.Scientists typically analyse vaccine efficacy at multiple, preset intervals -- known as endpoints. The first endpoint for Covaxin was when 43 cases were recorded, at which point the details of these individuals was unblinded. The result, announced in March, showed that 36 of these cases were in the placebo group while the rest, 7, were in the group given the vaccine, pointing to an efficacy estimate of 80.6%.The second interim analysis result was released in April based on 87 symptomatic cases of Covid-19, and it showed that the efficacy against severe Covid-19 disease was 100%, with an impact on reduction in hospitalizations.The full analysis is yet to be released, either a pre-print or as a peer-reviewed document.While Bharat Biotech did not comment on the final analysis results, it did announce last month that the safety and efficacy results from the final analysis will be available in June, and the final report will be submitted to a peer-reviewed publication.Experts, however, say the data should be put in public domain so that those experts in the field also get a chance to scrutinize it.“Trial data should ideally be published in peer-reviewed top medical journal so that those people who are not a part of the clinical trial can study it, question it and cross-check the legitimacy of the trial,” said CM Gulhati, editor, Monthly Index of Medical Specialities (MIMS), pharmaceutical reference guide.The phase 3 study enrolled 25,800 participants between 18-98 years of age, including 10% over the age of 60, with analysis conducted 14 days post second dose. Covaxin was developed with seed strains received from the National Institute of Virology under the Indian Council of Medical Research.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covaxin-efficacy-78-in-phase-3-analysis-101622227104005.html
29-05-2021||India||Takes four months to get Covid-19 vaccine out for use: Bharat Biotech||The mystery over Bharat Biotech’s capacity was resolved on Friday with the company releasing a statement that there was a four-month lag between manufacturing and use, which meant that doses made in March would get used only in June, and those manufactured in April, in July.Bharat Biotech has supplied 20 million doses of its Covid-19 vaccine, Covaxin, to the Union government for roll-out in the national immunisation programme, the company added.“Production scale-up of vaccines is a step-by-step process, involving several regulatory standard operating procedures of good manufacturing practices. There is a four-month lag time for Covaxin to translate into actual vaccination,” the company said on Friday after an article in The Times of India pointed out that there seemed to be a huge gap between the company’s reported monthly capacity and the doses supplied.For instance, in March, according to information in the public domain, the company produced 15 million doses; and in April, 20 million. Yet, only 20 million doses in all have been supplied to the government, and many states say there is a shortage of Covaxin.The company did not divulge the number of doses supplied to the Centre in May, saying that it can’t share month on month data.“The manufacturing, testing, release and distribution of vaccines is a complex and multi-factorial process with hundreds of steps, requiring a diverse pool of human resources. For vaccines to result in actual vaccination of people, highly coordinated efforts are required from international supply chain, manufacturers, regulators and State and Central government agencies,” it said.Based on Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation guidelines, all vaccines have to be submitted for testing and release to the Central Drugs Laboratory. Once cleared, they are despatched to the depots of the state governments and the Centre. That process takes only two days, the company’s statement said.According to the Centre’s Co-WIN platform, of the total of nearly 204 million Covid-19 vaccine doses administered in the country since January 16, about 20 million (2,21,07,737) are Covaxin.“The chaos is a result of the government having under estimated the vaccine demand, and overestimated the production capacity of its manufacturers,” said Dr Chandrakant Lahariya, senior public health and vaccine expert.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/takes-four-months-to-get-vaccine-out-for-use-bharat-biotech-101622227044058.html
29-05-2021||India||SC seeks national tally of kids orphaned by Covid||The Supreme Court on Friday sought nationwide information on children orphaned or missing since the pandemic began in March last year and directed the states to provide all basic amenities to them at the earliest.The vacation bench of justices L Nageswara Rao and Aniruddha Bose directed authorities to immediately take charge of such children and ensure food, ration, clothing, and shelter is provided to them without awaiting further directions.“The district authorities are directed to upload information of children who became orphans after March 2020 on the portal,” the bench said.The direction came in suo motu proceedings whereby several orders have already been issued from time to time to protect children lodged in child care institutions during the pandemic.Amicus curiae and Supreme Court lawyer Gaurav Agrawal, assisting the court in the matter, highlighted the emerging problem of children orphaned during the pandemic and the need to provide them food, ration, shelter and clothing. Some of these children may have lost guardians (having already lost parents) or the sole earning member in the family, making them vulnerable, he said. Agrawal suggested that children in such families were likely to have gone missing, trafficked (especially girls) or engaged in child labour.Also read| Covid-19: Delhi’s gradual unlock to start from MondayAdditional solicitor general Aishwarya Bhati informed the court that under the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, there is a requirement to identify not just orphans but even those who are abandoned or seemingly abandoned. The law requires such children to be produced within 24 hours before the Child Welfare Committee. Considering the difficulty to physically present the children, the Centre has allowed virtual production of such children. ASG Bhati said that one child care institution in each district has to be earmarked for such children who are abandoned or in need of care and protection.The bench said, “We want you (the Centre) to tell us the facts and figures of the havoc caused by the Covid-19 pandemic creating a situation of so many orphans. We also wish to know the steps taken by authorities under the various provisions of law.”In addition to the information uploaded on the NCPCR website, the court directed the states to gather data from their respective child welfare departments on the number of children who are missing and steps taken to identify and rehabilitate them.Agrawal also requested the court to pass directions to safeguard the property, assets or houses left by deceased parents/guardians that otherwise belonged to the children orphaned during the pandemic but was open to misuse by relatives or other family members. This aspect would be dealt with by the court in the next hearing.Also read: India joins global push for Covid origin probeThe court said, “We are of the opinion that the Centre and states should get the latest information of children who have become orphans, whether it be due to the pandemic or otherwise, and steps taken for attending to their basic needs.” This information will be shared by Sunday evening with the amicus curiae, who was requested to prepare a chart showing nationwide data.NCPCR counsel Swarupama Chaturvedi informed the court that all district child protection units have been given the password to access the portal “Bal Swaraj”. The child rights body sought permission to file an affidavit to bring these facts on record. The court directed the states to take this matter up on priority as it said, “I hope you (states) understand the agony of children on streets. Days are passing with children going hungry without food.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-seeks-national-tally-of-kids-orphaned-by-covid-101622226984002.html
29-05-2021||India||‘We’ve been reduced to a mockery’: Judge in letter to acting CJ||Calcutta high court judge Arindam Sinha has purportedly written a letter to acting chief justice Rajesh Bindal and 29 other judges of the court, saying the law was not followed when the transfer plea filed by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) in the Narada case was listed before a division bench as a writ petition. He has also raised objection to several procedural matters, describing it as “mockery”.Dated May 24, a copy of the document surfaced in the public domain on Friday morning, hours before the division bench of five judges granted conditional bail to the four high-profile accused. Several senior lawyers of the court told HT that such a letter, purportedly written by a sitting judge, is unprecedented. HT saw a copy of the letter but could not independently verify its authenticity. The judge could not be reached.“The appellate side rules require a motion seeking transfer, either on the civil or criminal side, to be heard by a single judge. However, the first division bench took up the matter treating it to be a writ petition,” the letter says. “Even a writ petition under Article 228 of the Constitution should have gone to the learned single judge having determination. The communication could not have been treated as such a writ petition simply because no substantial question of law as to interpretation of the Constitution has been raised, as not recorded in order dated May 17, 2021, nor the subsequently filed application,” the letter says.“The mob factor may be a ground on merits, for adjudication of the motion, but could the first division bench have taken it up and continue to hear it as a writ question, is the first question,” the letter says. “By operation of interim order dated May 17, the accused persons continued to be in custody (jail) though they had obtained bail from designated court. When, on intervention of the high court, said persons were deprived liberty, there was no application on the record of this court, since the communication was not supported by affidavit,” the letter says, referring to the bail granted by the special CBI court hours after the arrest. The CBI moved the bench of the chief justice, challenging that order. The two-judge bench passed a stay order. “Whether the HC exercising power in the matter of transfer of a criminal case, at that stage on its own initiative, could have passed the order of stay, is the second question,” the letter says.“On May 19, members of the first division bench passed separate orders expressing their divergent views. It appears, the presiding learned judge’s view followed view expressed by the junior learned judge. While the first view was grant of interim bail, view of the presiding learned judge prevailed as an interim measure, to become order dated May 21, 2021,” the letter says. It adds, “The HC must get its act together. Our conduct is unbecoming of the majesty the HC commands. We have been reduced to a mockery. I am requesting all of us to salvage the situation by taking steps for the purpose of reaffirming sanctity of our Rules and unwritten code of conduct.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/weve-been-reduced-to-a-mockery-calcutta-hc-judge-to-acting-chief-justice-101622226504587.html
29-05-2021||India||Setback for India as Caribbean court stays Choksi deportation||A Caribbean court restrained Dominican authorities from removing fugitive diamantaire Mehul Choksi from the island nation until further orders, dealing a temporary setback to India’s efforts to repatriate him and make him stand trial in a ₹13,578 crore fraud case.Indian-born Choksi mysteriously disappeared from Antigua and Barbuda, whose citizenship he holds, on Sunday night, but was detained by Dominican police on Tuesday night on charges of illegally entering the island. The two islands are roughly 100 nautical miles apart.His lawyers alleged that Indian and Antiguan officials abducted the businessman but Antigua & Barbuda’s commissioner of police Atlee Patrick Rodney denied the charge on Friday.“We have no information or indication that Mehul Choksi was forcefully removed from Antigua. Only assertion we are hearing is from the attorney [of Mehul Choksi] and Dominica police is not confirming that story,” Rodney said in a local media interview. “We have no involvement in his movement from Antigua to Dominica, or wherever he left,” he added.Asked if he had information on how Choksi reached Dominica, Rodney said he received initial reports that the businessman travelled by boat.Indian officials are in touch with their counterparts in Dominica to make an attempt to bring him back through the deportation route, because India has no extradition arrangements with the Carribean country, people tracking developments said in Delhi. But those efforts suffered a temporary setback after the Eastern Caribbean Supreme Court agreed to hear a habeas corpus petition by Choksi’s lawyers, and ordered that he should not be removed from the country until further orders.Choksi’s legal team has asked the court that he should be released from police custody in Roseau immediately and allowed to stay in a hotel.Choksi’s lawyers – Wayne Marsh in Dominica and Vijay Aggarwal in New Delhi -- have argued that he is an Antiguan citizen and can be repatriated only there. The hearing was adjourned late on Friday to June 2. Choksi will be quarantined and administered a Covid-19 test, the court ordered.Antigua’s Prime Minister Gaston Browne told reporters on Thursday that he requested Dominica to declare Choksi persona non grata and send him to India instead of Antigua & Barbuda, where he has legal and constitution protection as a citizen. “We asked them (Dominica) not to repatriate him to Antigua. He needs to return to India where he can face the criminal charges leveled against him”, Browne told journalists. Browne added that Choksi had made a monumental error by fleeing to Dominica.Dominica has indicated that he will be sent back to Antigua after ascertaining all the facts. The acting police chief , Lincoln Corbette, said on Thursday that he will be sent to Antigua.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/setback-for-india-as-carribean-court-stays-choksi-deportation-101622226503936.html
29-05-2021||India||Delhi issues global tender for 10 million Covid vaccine doses; invites bids till June 7||The Delhi government has issued its first global tender for 10 million doses of Covid-19 vaccines and will accept bids till June 7, according to documents seen by HT.A vaccine maker interested in supplying to the Capital will need to commit to begin deliveries in tranches within 45 days of a contract being signed, among several conditions that the tender document lays down.Also read: Need God’s intervention, says Meghalaya health minister on surge in Covid casesSeveral states, such as Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh, have floated tenders to procure vaccines. Several prominent vaccine makers, including Pfizer and Moderna, have said that they have a policy to enter into agreements only with national governments and multilateral initiatives, putting a cloud over states’ attempts to procure doses directly from foreign manufacturers.“Health and family welfare department, government of NCT of Delhi intends to procure Covid-19 vaccine on urgent basis and accordingly issues this Global Expression of Interest (EOI) soliciting techno-commercial proposals from the International Manufacturers of Covid-19 vaccines or their Authorized Agents or from direct Importers with appropriate license, to import the Covid-19 vaccine in India.“A bidder may submit its techno-commercial proposal to the Central Procurement Agency, Director General Health Services, Government of NCT of Delhi… by 5 pm of June 7,” said the document, issued on May 27.The document added that companies from any country can supply to Delhi unless they share borders with India, a condition that effectively keeps out Chinese vaccines.Also read: Covaxin efficacy 78% in Phase 3 analysisAccording to Union government rules, which the EOI cites as necessary to follow, vaccines approved by western health regulators, Japan’s drugs agency and the World Health Organization will have an accelerated clinical approval process. China’s Sinopharm vaccine fit this criteria prior to the neighbouring nations bar being put in. The EOIs of other states, too, have this condition.Another set of documents, seen by HT, showed that the Delhi Cabinet, chaired by chief minister Arvind Kejriwal, on May 21 gave approval to the cabinet note containing the proposal regarding “procurement (of) Covid-19 vaccines through global EOI for vaccination of the eligible beneficiaries in Delhi”.According to government data shared with the Centre, 5.2 million doses have been administered in Delhi since the inoculation exercise started on January 16, with the maximum 634,000 getting it in the northwest district.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhi-issues-global-tender-for-10-million-covid-vaccine-doses-101622226204011.html
29-05-2021||India||Central Vista revamp to have space to park 16,000 cars||The new parliament complex and buildings that are being built as part of the Central Vista redevelopment project will have parking for at least 16,000 cars, and while that may mean a likely increase in traffic volume in the area, enough mitigation measures will be put in place to ensure there is no congestion or impact on traffic movement, the architectural consultant for the project said.According to details provided by the Central Public Works Department (CPWD), which is executing the project, to the Expert Appraisal Committee of the environment ministry, parking space for 14,095 vehicles will be provided in the common central secretariat buildings, central conference centre, SPG building and the residences of the prime minister and the vice president. Of the 14,095 parking slots, 13,719 will be in the common central secretariat buildings and the conference centre.In addition to this, designated parking space will be developed along Central Vista avenue for over 1000 cars and about 30 buses, according to the consultant (HCP Design, Planning and Management Private Limited). Currently, the area can accommodate up to 600 cars. As per the information provided by HCP, the new Parliament building and proposed MP chambers will have surface and basement parking for close to 900 vehicles.The exact number of existing parking spaces in the area, which houses multiple government buildings isn’t known.Once the project is complete, the employee population, which is currently around 57,000, in the area is expected to increase by 10-15%. In an email response to HT’s query, HCP said, “The increase in employee population is expected to be between 10-15%, as people essential for the functioning of the Government of India will be brought here as all ministries will be consolidated in the Central Secretariat.” But around 9000 people, currently operating from offices behind North Block and South Block will be moved to offices outside the Central Vista area.Also read | Labourers at Central Vista project follow Covid protocols: Centre tells Delhi HCThe project, civil society members say, will add to existing traffic congestion. According to Delhi traffic police, the traffic volume (pre-pandemic) at C-hexagon at India Gate is around 5,500 passenger car units per hour during rush hours. The C-hexagon sees a high volume of traffic as it is one of the crucial roads providing north-south connectivity. The average traffic speed is 40-45kmph (before the pandemic).Kanchi Kohli, legal researcher, Centre for Policy Research said: “The social and environmental footprint of the Central Vista redevelopment just got wider and more harmful. The traffic analysis of the redevelopment projects increased traffic which will result in congestion.”Civil society members argued that the government should put the traffic impact assessment in the public domain. Anuj Srivastava, spokesperson of LokPATH (people for Appropriate Transformation of Habitat), a collective of urban development experts and civic society members said: “The details about the entire project including traffic impact assessment should be put in the public domain….If the number as they say is 14,000 parking spaces, what are the building bye laws that they are following and who has scrutinised and sanctioned these numbers. CPWD has split the project into different components so that these assessments escape public and statutory scrutiny.”CPWD officials said that detailed studies have been done for traffic improvement and measures have been planned to ensure that the traffic on main roads is not affected.A senior CPWD official said: “We have carried out detailed studies and submitted our proposal for traffic improvement to Unified Traffic and Transportation Infrastructure (Planning & Engineering) Centre (UTTIPEC), which is the apex body that approves all transportation and traffic-related projects in Delhi. However, we will be providing service roads near the entrance/exits of the buildings to make traffic flow smooth without affecting traffic on main roads. We are also providing Automated People Mover/light metro which will encourage people to use public transport and reduce vehicular traffic.”Also read: Lack of labour slows office complex work in Central Vista projectAsking not to be identified, this person added: “Further, by constructing Common Central Secretariat building, we are not increasing the number of officials in the Central Vista area as a whole because the number of officials moving out of Central Vista hutments from A&B block, L&M block are more or less equal to the number of ministry people coming into the Central Vista. Moreover, more parking space inside buildings itself will reduce vehicles presently being parked on roads in absence of inadequate parking space inside buildings.”HCP, in an email response, added that mitigation strategies have been worked out after a detailed traffic impact assessment, to ensure that there is no impact on traffic movement in and around the area. Delhi Traffic police officials also said that the new constructions will not have much impact on the movement of existing traffic.“One of the main reasons for congestion at C-hexagon, especially in front of India Gate, was the haphazard movement of pedestrians. Now, subways are being constructed for pedestrian movement. The road infrastructure will also be augmented, so there is not going to be much impact on vehicular movement,” said a senior traffic police official who asked not to be named.The consultant in its response also said that the metro usage is expected to increase by 2-5%. The proposed people mover, a dedicated transit system connecting all the 10 common central secretariat buildings, will be connected to Delhi Metro Rail Corporation’s network at the Central Secretariat metro station.Also read: PM house in new Central Vista given green clearanceThe people mover will be able to ferry 20,000 people during peak hours, keeping much of the movement between the buildings underground, and also making it easy for commuters to transit to their offices from metro stations.The existing network of roads in the area will be widened to accommodate the increase in traffic, HCP said in its response. Dedicated subterranean routes for VIP movement, better pedestrian and non-motorised transport connectivity, shuttle services connecting all key buildings, efficient ingress and egress to Common Central Secretariat plots to ensure minimum impact on thorough traffic along the Rajpath are among the several proposed measures to minimise the impact in traffic movement, as per HCP.Kohli said, “The government proposes to offset this by carrying out additional road expansion and improvements over the next 10 years (as per the traffic assessment). One can expect major roads connecting to Central Vista being dug up or cordoned off during this time. These access roads are going to be securitised to facilitate VIP movement at the cost of public access.”Transport experts say the influence area for analysing traffic impact should be beyond the abutting roads. Amit Bhatt, director of transport, WRI India, said that the influence area for a project of this scale should include major closest arterial roads, which could mean a radius of one kilometre, including the C-hexagon that is used mainly by vehicular traffic moving from north to south of the city.“To ensure that there is not much impact on traffic in the area due to the new constructions, the mitigation strategies should be planned for an influence area. The emphasis should be to encourage most government employees and visitors to use public transport (metro or bus). Another important measure which can help in addressing the issue of congestion, especially during peak hours, is staggering of office timings.”Experts say that there is a need for a comprehensive traffic movement plan for the area. Sewa Ram, professor of transport planning at the School of Planning and Architecture, said, “There won’t be a problem in traffic due to the new buildings planned at Central Vista. There is a need to make a comprehensive circulation plan in such a way that the Central Vista-destined traffic is isolated completely from the rest of the traffic movement. This traffic should move externally so that there is no conflict with vista-bound traffic.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/central-vista-redevelopment-to-create-parking-for-16-000-cars-101622226143947.html
29-05-2021||India||Dowry death cases: SC takes note of ‘casual’ approach by trial courts||The Supreme Court on Friday noted with grave concern the “casual” approach adopted by trial courts in recording statements of accused in cases related to dowry deaths, and passed a slew of directions necessary to give full meaning to rights of accused and prosecution during trial.Dowry death is punishable under Section 304B of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and carries a sentence that can range from seven years to life term. This provision presumes that the death of any woman within seven years of marriage caused by any burns or bodily injury or otherwise than normal circumstances shall be presumed to be a case of dowry death provided there is evidence that she was subjected to cruelty by husband and his family members “soon before” her death.“It is a matter of grave concern that often trial courts record the statement of an accused under Section 313 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC) in a very casual and cursory manner,” a bench of Chief Justice of India (CJI) N V Ramana, Justices Surya Kant and Anirudhha Bose noted.The bench directed the trial judges that while deciding upon such cases, the prosecution produces incriminating material against the accused and seek their defence at the initial stage of trial. If the trial court is of the view that the charge is not made out, an order of acquittal can be passed at that stage.The bench also took note of the words “soon before” in Section 304B of IPC and told trial courts not to adopt a strict interpretation of the words as what is needed to establish is a “proximate and live link” between the cruelty and consequential death of the victim.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-takes-note-of-casual-approach-by-trial-courts-in-dowry-death-cases-101622226024665.html
29-05-2021||India||Delhi broke a weather record every month since August 2020, shows data||Every month since August 2020, Delhi has broken at least one weather record, India Meteorological Department (IMD) data shows. Met officials and scientists said that while these extreme weather recordings are the immediate result of temporary atmospheric events over (and in and around) the national capital, the larger role of the climate crisis in the overall shifting of weather patterns is evident.In August 2020, the city recorded 236.5mm rainfall, the highest for the month since 2013. Met officials also observed that 50% of the total rainfall fell in just two days of precipitation, August 13 (68.2mm) and August 20 (54.8mm).In September, Delhi went on to record the warmest month in almost two decades. The Capital’s average maximum temperature that month was 36.2 degrees Celsius, breaking the previous record of 36.1 degrees Celsius in 2015. The last time Delhi recorded higher average maximum temperature in September was in 2001, when the mercury soared to 36.3 degrees Celsius.In October and November, the scenario was the opposite. They were colder.In October, Delhi broke a 58-year-old record, clocking a mean minimum temperature of just 17.2 degrees Celsius. November broke an even older record, with the month’s mean minimum temperature dropping to 10.2 degrees Celsius, a level last seen in 1949. The mean minimum temperature of November was lower only in 1938 before that, at 9.6 degrees Celsius.This trend of colder than usual record continued in the months of December and January as well, with December witnessing eight so-called cold wave days, the highest since 1965. January recorded the highest number of cold wave days since 2008 (at seven days) and also broke the record for the highest rainfall for the month in 21 years (56.6mm).IMD’s criteria for a cold wave in the plains is that the minimum temperature should be 10 degrees or lower, and the departure from normal minimum temperature 4.5 degrees or less for two consecutive days.Kuldeep Srivastava, head of IMD’s regional weather forecasting centre, said that these extreme weather recordings between October and January were the immediate impact of fewer western disturbances passing over Delhi.Western disturbances are cyclonic storms originating over the Mediterranean that affect weather in north-west and north India.“Last winter, we recorded lower than usual temperatures because of fewer western disturbance activities in the region. Usually, in the months of October, November, December and January, we get around five to six active western disturbances each month; last year we only got two to three.” Srivastava said.He added: “A western disturbance results in cloud formation over a region, which traps heat during the day and helps increase night time temperatures. In the absence of these clouds, what we saw this winter was that heat was not getting trapped and Delhi was recording lower than normal temperatures.”Also read: Delhi issues global tender for 10 million Covid vaccine doses; invites bids till June 7Then, in February the weather conditions changed again. This February was the second warmest in 120 years, with the mean maximum temperature in the month touching 27.9 degrees Celsius, falling marginally short of the all-time record of 29.7 degrees Celsius in 2006.March recorded the hottest day in 76 years, with the mercury levels touching 40.1 degrees Celsius on March 29.After a sweltering February and March, in April the conditions changed again and the lowest minimum temperature in at least a decade was recorded on April 4, at 11.7 degrees Celsius.May broke several historic records, according to IMD. Under the impact of cyclonic storm Tauktae, Delhi on May 19-20 broke the record for the highest single-day rainfall for the month ever, with 119.3mm of precipitation. This also pushed the month’s rainfall in the city to 144.8—the second highest in the month since 2008.The gusty winds and the intense showers also successfully brought the temperatures down, breaking the record of the lowest maximum temperature ever.While acknowledging the role of temporary weather conditions that led to these extreme recordings, weathermen said the trend of extreme weather has been especially evident in the region over the past three years. The role of the climate crisis is clear, they added.Mahesh Palawat, vice-president of Skymet weather services, said that such extreme weather conditions are not just specific to Delhi but also being observed in several other parts of the country. As for Delhi, May is usually marked by extreme dry heat and high temperatures, he added -- and this year it hasn’t seen a single heat wave day, another record.Meteorologists declare a heatwave when the maximum temperature for a location in the plains crosses 40 degrees Celsius.In the hills, the threshold temperature is 30 degrees Celsius. Also, when the departure in the maximum day temperature is 4.5 degrees to 6.5 degrees above normal, a heatwave is declared.“Many all-time records are being broken in many parts of India in the last two to three years. We are seeing that extreme weather events are increasing. Over the last three years, we have also been noticing that the intensity of cyclones that are hitting the coasts of India is also increasing. All this is also an impact of the climate crisis, ” Palawat added.Also read | ‘India is infamous’: Nath stokes new row with remarkAP Dimri from the School of Environmental Sciences, Jawaharlal Nehru University, agreed that such extreme weather is a clear impact of the climate crisis at play.“Imagine your free atmosphere as a sponge that soaks up water. In an ideal situation, it will release water uniformly when its capacity is saturated. Under the impact of global warming, pressure is created at one point, which causes extreme weather conditions in one area; exactly like a sponge would squeeze out water under pressure. This month is a typical example of how weather patterns as we understand are changing. Delhi in May usually records at least a few days of temperatures reaching 40 degrees or above, but this time except for one or two days the temperature has not spiked. Increased warming of the land and of the seas is also altering weather patterns,” Dimri explained.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhi-broke-a-weather-record-every-month-since-august-2020-shows-data-101622226024014.html
29-05-2021||India||India joins global push for Covid origin probe||India on Friday backed calls for further investigation into the origin of Covid-19, and sought the cooperation of China and other parties for such studies, days after US President Joe Biden gave intelligence agencies 90 days to submit a fresh report at a time when scientists are seeking deeper examination of a theory that the virus may have originated in a lab.Biden’s directive to the US intelligence community to redouble their efforts to collect information to facilitate a definitive conclusion on the origin of Sars-CoV-2 has angered China, which said on Thursday that the US is playing politics. The country, where the virus was first detected in late 2019, again dismissed the theory that it could have leaked from a laboratory in Wuhan, ground zero of the pandemic.External affairs ministry spokesperson Arindam Bagchi said that a World Health Organization (WHO)-led study into a virus’s origin was an “important first step”, and more studies were needed to reach “robust conclusions”.“WHO convened global study on the origin of Covid-19 is an important first step. It stressed the need for next phase studies as also for further data and studies to reach robust conclusions,” Bagchi said in a statement. Without naming China, he added, “The follow up of the WHO report and further studies deserve the understanding and cooperation of all.”This week, multiple news reports have spoken of several angles the American intelligence is looking at to establish where the virus came from. On Thursday, the New York Times reported that Biden’s directions to the intelligence agencies came on the basis of yet-to-be examined evidence that requires computer analysis. Citing people aware of the situation, the report said that this evidence could include databases of Chinese communications, movement of lab workers and the pattern of the outbreak of Covid-19 in and around Wuhan.On May 23, a report by the Wall Street Journal cited current and former officials to describe intelligence reports that determined that three researchers from the Wuhan Institute of Virology became sick with flu-like symptoms in November 2019.The report notes that while this in itself was not enough to link to a lab leak, the timing and the number of people who fell sick and their ties to the lab plugs into several circumstantial clues that strengthen the theory.A WHO-led team, which spent four weeks in and around Wuhan in January and February, said in a report issued in late March that the virus had probably been transmitted from bats to humans through another animal, and that “introduction through a laboratory incident was considered to be an extremely unlikely pathway”.But, at the same time, WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said the team “expressed the difficulties they encountered in accessing raw data” relating to the outbreak at the Wuhan wet market and that the they had not been able to carry out adequate assessment of the lab leak possibility. “Further data and studies will be needed to reach more robust conclusions,” he said at the time.WHO is currently reviewing the recommendations in this report to prepare a proposal for the director-general on the next studies to be carried out.Keep lab theory on tableThe scientific community has been divided over what to make of the virus’s origin clues till now. In early May, science writer Nicholas Wade cited existing research to support the need to keep the lab leak theory on the table.Wade included several arguments: One, if the virus was naturally found in the famous horseshoe bats of Yunnan, how, or whether at all, did it travel to Wuhan, at least 1,500km away; two, how the Sars-CoV-2 virus appeared to have come fully evolved to optimally target humans, unlike the Sars-CoV virus, responsible for South Asia Respiratory Syndrome, that evolved over time; and three – a unique protein folding known as the furin cleavage site in this virus, which has not been found in other betacoronaviruses.Some scientists have disputed the biological inferences being drawn, particularly in the context of the furin cleavage site. “FCSs (furin cleavage sites) are abundant, including being highly prevalent in coronaviruses. While SARS-CoV-2 is the first example of a SARS virus with an FCS, other betacoronaviruses (the genus for SARS-CoV-2) have FCSs, including MERS and HKU1,” wrote immunologist and infectious disease genomics specialist at Scripps Research Institute, Kristian G Andersen, in a tweet on May 10.The questions about what clues China may hold are further strengthened by the lack of a resurgence in cases in the country. A country with the world’s highest population, China has recorded no new wave of infections since when the outbreak began.It recorded 7,280 new cases at its peak, on February 14, 2020, and the only time infections rose again in any significant manner was in mid January, 2021, when the 7-day average of new cases was a little under 2,000 for a few days.Need definitive conclusionIn March, Biden tasked the US intelligence community to prepare a report on the origin of Covid-19, including whether it emerged from human contact with an infected animal or from a “laboratory accident”.Biden said on Wednesday that he had received the report earlier this month, and asked for an additional follow-up as the intelligence community had “coalesced around two likely scenarios” but hadn’t reached a definitive conclusion.Biden asked the intelligence community to “redouble their efforts to collect and analyse information that could bring us closer to a definitive conclusion, and to report back to me in 90 days”.As part of this follow up, Biden outlined “areas of further inquiry that may be required, including specific questions for China”. He said the US will work with like-minded partners around the world to “press China to participate in a full, transparent, evidence-based international investigation and to provide access to all relevant data and evidence”.On Thursday, China’s foreign ministry responded to Biden’s move by saying the US was playing politics as the WHO study had concluded the “lab leak” theory was unlikely.

29-05-2021||India||At the United Nations, Delhi showcases its women power||Akanksha Arora is an Indo-Canadian auditor with the United Nations (UN) who has challenged the incumbent UN Secretary General for re-election later this year. Not even having the backing of her own country, the spunky Arora is unlikely to go far in her quest for the top job at the UN.But 2021 has been an extraordinarily good year for Indian women at the UN, with the appointment of Usha Rao Monari as the Associate Administrator of the UN Development Program in the rank of Under Secretary General. Several women from India have served at the UN Secretariat but none at the highest appointed position of Under-Secretary General. This is without doubt a singular achievement for Indian women in the UN system. Monari was earlier with the International Finance Corporation (IFC).Two other Indian women have moved to leadership positions at the UN in New York. Ligia Noronha heads the UN Environment Program’s New York office in the rank of Assistant Secretary General, and Preeti Sinha has taken over as the Head of the UN’s Capital Development Fund that deals with micro-finance.Also Read | How India’s water mission is overcoming the challenge in the NortheastThe role of Indian women was emblazoned on the UN stage when Hansa Mehta participated in the UN Conference on Human Rights in Paris in 1948 and ensured that these rights were gender neutral by amending the expression “all men are created equal” to “all human beings are created equal” in the Universal Declaration on Human Rights. She later served as the vice chairman of the Human Rights Commission of the UN in 1950.Thereafter, Vijay Lakshmi Pandit became the first woman President of the UN General Assembly (1953-54). This was, at that time, a truly remarkable achievement in a male dominated diplomatic world – for which India is justifiably proud. But not many know that she also led an “unofficial delegation” from India in San Francisco in 1945, when the UN conference took place, which laid the foundations of the organisation.Move on several decades. In 2009, after Hilary Clinton took over as Secretary of State, the United States dropped its opposition to creating a UN entity focussing on women. Resolution 64/289 creating UN-Women was adopted in the General Assembly on the afternoon of July 2, 2010. The session was presided over by India’s minister of state for external affairs, Preneet Kaur. India was one of the 27 Vice Presidents of the UNGA that year and had played a key role in negotiating the resolution. It is a matter of pride that Indian Foreign Service officer, Lakshmi Puri, became one of the first Deputy Executive Directors of UN Women to be followed by Anita Bhatia, from India, who had earlier been with IFC. Earlier, Geeta Rao Gupta had served as Deputy Executive Director of UNICEF.As one scans the horizon today, several other Indian women occupy prominent positions in other major multilateral organizations. Dr. Soumya Swaminathan is the Chief Scientist of the World Health Organization (WHO) leading the fight against COVID-19 while Dr. Neeru Chadha is a judge at the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea (ITLOS). Anshula Kant, formerly from State Bank of India, is one of the Managing Directors of the World Bank. And the IMF has two women from India in lead positions – Gita Gopinath, who, as its Chief Economist, is one of the Fund’s most prominent faces and Kalpana Kochar, who heads Human Resources.Incidentally, most Indian women at the top in the multilateral system today have strong Delhi connections. Soumya Swaminathan headed Indian Council of Medical Research, Ligia Noronha was for long with TERI, and Preeti Sinha ran the Yes Global Institute. But the real star is Delhi’s prestigious Lady Shriram College, the alma-mater of Usha Rao Monari, Anshula Kant and Gita Gopinath.Manjeev Singh Puri is a former Ambassador and Deputy Permanent Representative of India to the UNThe views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/at-the-united-nations-delhi-showcases-its-women-power-101622119920766.html
29-05-2021||Today's||It is time to revive MPLADS. It will help citizens||In April 2020, the Members of Parliament Local Area Development Scheme (MPLADS) funds were suspended for two years, i.e., 2020-21 and 2021-22. Under MPLADS, every MP is entitled to an amount of ₹5 crore annually. The scheme aims to address local development demands and the needs of an area through priority developmental, infrastructural, and asset-building works.The pandemic has hit India’s hinterland in the past few weeks, and the share of rural districts in Covid-19 cases and deaths is increasing every day. The “test-trace-treat” mantra is observed largely in the breach — with not enough testing, non-existent contact tracing, and the absence of medical infrastructure to offer treatment, thus leading to countless avoidable deaths. While appeals for help on social media platforms may have gone down, those suffering in rural India do not have the luxury to voice their distress and despair on online platforms. This makes it difficult to gauge the spread and damage of Covid-19 on rural lives and livelihoods. But there are now credible accounts of severe undercounting of both cases and deaths.At a time when the second wave is still devastating lives, and experts predict a third wave, it is even more critical for the government to restore MPLADS besides adopting a model of genuine decentralised decision-making, needed for local and rural Covid-19 relief measures.Suspending MPLADS has left parliamentarians bereft of an instrument in exercising their autonomy and foresight needed in alleviating the impact of the current pandemic. There is often a popular misconception about the funds — and it almost appears to some that this is akin to a personal fund that MPs only use for political patronage or personal benefit. But the truth is that the allocation and expenditure of MPLADS funds is only through a well-defined procedure, which involves close collaboration with local authorities.Anticipating the second wave, MPs could have engaged in a consultative and participatory process with district administrations last year. As we know, district authorities, civil society organisations, local communities, political volunteers, and elected leaders, including Members of Legislative Assembly (MLAs) and MPs of the areas concerned understand the concerns at the grassroots best, factoring in the local contexts and the social milieu of an area.Through timely MPLADS disbursement, elected representatives can recommend priority areas of work and local concerns to the district authorities, according to their understanding and feedback. In order to boost preparations for Covid-19, measures such as setting up makeshift hospitals, mobile medical vans, adequate testing mechanisms, critical infrastructure for storage and power needed for vaccination programmes at the panchayat levels, and timely awareness of Covid-19 symptoms could have been undertaken right from the time the first wave hit us, over and above the interventions in these areas by the district administrations.While experts have said that there is no scientific basis to believe that any future wave will disproportionately affect children, the second wave has offered a clear lesson — don’t become complacent, and be prepared. This may require setting up more paediatric ICU wards at government hospitals; boosting necessary oxygen infrastructure; provision of essential medicines and holistic protective kits for ANMs, ASHAs, anganwadis workers, teachers; plugging the infrastructural deficit plaguing anganwadi bhawans, primary health centres, nutrition rehabilitation centres; creating Covid-19 care facilities for pregnant mothers, specially-abled children and adults and other marginalised segments; and spreading awareness on Covid-19 symptoms and appropriate behaviour in regional languages.Restoring and utilising MPLADS funds for priority areas will help in addressing, partly, the resource crunch of the districts. It will also help pave the way for the much-needed collaborative synergies between the political representative and the administration on the ground to augment basic health care facilities in rural areas.The present dispensation — as much as it may want to avoid this inconvenient truth — is facing an enormous trust deficit due to the gross mismanagement of the pandemic. Restoring MPLADS will not only address the human capital needs of rural societies at large — but also restore the faith and confidence of citizens in their elected leaders.Manoj Kumar Jha is Member of Parliament, Rajya SabhaThe views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/it-is-time-to-revive-mplads-it-will-help-citizens-101622297618501.html
29-05-2021||Today's||Elderly women need better care and support||The pandemic has exposed, among other things, how the voices of women are rarely heard in the formulation and execution of policies that have a direct bearing on them. Among the most invisible cohort of women are the elderly.As a vicious second wave of the virus rips through the country, older women and their needs have been largely overlooked as the government and other institutions scramble to utilise the scarce resources available to tackle the pandemic.Elderly women in India are largely dependent on their families for economic and social well-being. They have limited autonomy and limited mobility, especially now with the onslaught of the virus. With their families preoccupied with the stress of lack of jobs and loss of loved ones, older women face increasing isolation and loneliness, leading to severe psychological problems. The small proportion of elderly women in care homes are often cut off from their families.With professional caregivers either unavailable or unable to reach homes, the task of care-giving for an elderly spouse largely falls on women who may themselves be in precarious health. Many of them are not conversant with digital devices, cutting them off further from an increasingly digitally connected world. This also means that tele-health care is out of their reach.The idyllic Indian traditional family hardly exists anymore, and in several families, the geriatric person could well be considered a burden on resources. This could lead to abuse of the elderly, particularly women, both emotionally and physically.Inclusive strategies for the well-being of geriatric women, and men, should be part of our public health policies going forward. Research-driven policies need to be tailored based on their voices as well.Irrespective of the virus, elderly women tend to suffer from a host of medical problems ranging from diabetes, hypertension, pulmonary disorders, heart disease, most of which require lifelong medication. The decline in sensory functions also limits their ability to live independent lives. Since women are more likely to be dependent on the spouse for an income, the death of an elderly spouse leads to them facing greater adversity. Many do not have pensions or other economic cushions, leaving them unable to fulfill even basic needs on their own.Though there was a realisation, well before the advent of the virus, that we have to plan for a geriatric population, this is not fully understood by either doctors or caregivers, few of whom have specialised in this field. To be sure, there are various government schemes for the elderly, though none targeted specifically at women.There is the National Policy on Older Persons launched in 1999 with the specific aim of catering to the elderly. There is also the National Programme for Health Care of Elderly which speaks, among other things, about capacity-building for medical and paramedical professionals and caregivers. This needs to be reviewed and strengthened at a time when the government and private institutions are looking at plugging the gaps in the creaky health care system.Elderly women need easy access to home health care, access to essentials preferably through home delivery, and above all compassion and care from their families and State systems. This would be a good time to engage stakeholders, including elderly women themselves, to frame more equitable policies for a more active, empowered and productive old age.lalita.panicker@hindustantimes.comThe views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/elderly-women-need-better-care-and-support-101622297617061.html
29-05-2021||Today's||India’s vaccine policy requires transparency||A recent study by Public Health England (PHE) which assesses the effectiveness of the Pfizer and the AstraZeneca vaccine, known in India as Covishield, against the B.1.617.2 variant of the coronavirus, which is the dominant strain in our country, has serious, if not disturbing, implications for India’s vaccine policy. We need our leading virologists and vaccine scientists to discuss and debate this matter. Even more, we need the government to explain and, if need be, defend its position. Sadly, and inexplicably, neither has happened.Let me explain why this is a matter of concern. The PHE study shows a single dose of either vaccine only provides 33% protection against B.1.617.2. There’s no doubt this is insufficient. Consequently, the study concludes: “Our findings would support maximising vaccine uptake with two doses among vulnerable groups in the context of circulation of B.1.617.2.”Now, on May 13, the government extended the gap between the two doses of Covishield to 12-16 weeks. If the PHE study is correct, recipients of one dose will only have 33% protection. So do we need to rethink the 12-16 week gap and reduce it, at least as Britain has done, for people over 50 and the vulnerable?This is the first issue that needs to be addressed. In the absence of Indian voices, let me quote what Professor John Moore, a top virologist at Cornell, said to this paper. “The Indian policy needs reconsidering. The protection conferred by a single dose is not going to be enough to stop the spread of B.1.617.2, particularly as the vaccines in use in India are not the strongest known.” Now Moore has also hinted at the second issue raised by the PHE study. Although it’s arguably more disturbing, it hasn’t got the attention it deserves.The PHE study shows that in the case of B.1.617.2, whilst two doses of the Pfizer vaccine are 88% effective, two doses of AstraZeneca — that’s our Covishield — are only 60% effective. That’s a huge difference of 28%. Does this suggest AstraZeneca/Covishield is an inferior vaccine compared to Pfizer, at least in terms of battling B.1.617.2?This question leads to two more, which further underline why the PHE study deserves to be discussed. First, do we need to expedite the entry of Pfizer to India? Newspaper reports suggest the sticking point is Pfizer’s demand for immunity. Apparently, every country where Pfizer is available has granted this. India is said to be reluctant. But now, if Pfizer is 28% more effective against B.1.617.2, are there grounds for rethinking? And, perhaps, urgently?The other question is different but no less important. We’ve given around 200 million first jabs, including close to 50 million repeat jabs and 90% are Covishield. Second, B.1.617.2 emerged in India and, undoubtedly, we have more cases than any other country. Why then are we relying on data from Britain on the efficacy of Covishield against B.1.617.2? Surely, after giving so many jabs of Covishield, we should have better data? In fact, shouldn’t India be telling the world about the efficacy of the AstraZeneca/Covishield vaccine against B.1.617.2 rather than depending on Britain to find out?Now, before I end, let me mention something I’ve been reliably but confidentially told. When the CoWIN app was being designed, members of the Covid Working Group suggested it should track the relationship between vaccination and infection. If that had been done, we would have had the world’s best data on the efficacy of AstraZeneca/Covishield against B.1.617.2. Unfortunately, the government did not heed that advice. Why? Worse, members of this group were required to guarantee they would not reveal their discussions for 10 years. Given that America’s Center for Disease Control holds its discussions in public and in Britain the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation reveals full details of its confabulations, why are our experts forced into a 10-year silence? They’re not discussing State secrets. But they are deliberating on matters of critical national concern which we have a right to know about. Why is it being kept from us?Karan Thapar is the author of Devil’s Advocate: The Untold StoryThe views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/indias-vaccine-policy-requires-transparency-101622297613150.html
29-05-2021||Today's||The battle of our times: State versus Big Tech||The battle between governments and Big Tech around the world is not surprising — both want to control information (not just the message, but also the medium), and thereby, power (and in the case of the latter, also money).Romantics see Big Tech as a unifying, liberating and free (in all meanings of the word) force. It may have been that at one time, but the truth is that Big Tech is mostly a commercial force, trading in user information and influence. By a quirk of how laws have evolved, it also enjoys considerable licence — for instance, many large technology firms make much of their revenue from the traditional media model, but without any of the responsibilities that being a media company entails. It’s called intermediary immunity, but many such firms behave like anything but intermediaries. To have companies that make money by tracking users and their behaviour (and then selling this data to others) speak of privacy and rights is worrying — almost as much as it is to allow Big Tech to be the arbiter of what people see (and what they don’t), and what is true (and what is not), or even who gets to be on a purportedly public media platform (and who doesn’t). States, even democratic ones with progressive views, are rarely the benign force for good they see themselves as. And if there is a legal provision that can help them control information, they will use it every time — even if they claim that they will do so only in rare circumstances. No State, however well-meaning, can be expected to use powers such as this responsibly. National security, sovereignty, communal harmony, and public safety are all real issues, but experience has shown that no State is immune from the temptation to use these bogies to choke dissent and stifle criticism. Laws and frameworks that depend on goodness or virtue or morality (of people, governments, or companies) are destined to fail. It was only a matter of time before the two clashed. Information is at the core of any power structure and what governments everywhere and Big Tech are fighting about is control — as in, who gets to control information and, therefore, the narrative. Political power has always meant (among other things) being at the right place in the information hierarchy. At one time, those who knew ruled, and those who didn’t, were ruled. Now, in an era of alternative facts (they are actually very real to some people), it has become clear that it is actually possible to manipulate information and shape the narrative, and decide what is shared, with whom, and when. Companies were among the first to realise how to do this by side-stepping established media channels and messaging techniques, and using Big Tech to go, as they say, DTC or direct-to-consumer. It was only a matter of time before political parties and governments caught on and caught up.It is important to understand the interests of the two warring sides. Companies want to be able to continue growing their user base, get their users to engage more (and create more content), enjoy intermediary immunity, and be in control of user data (for this is central to their revenue). The ideological framework they use to push these ends revolves around the idea of freedom. Governments want to control information — which means their efforts to regulate Big Tech are also, in many ways, an attempt to control all of us, by determining the sources and nature of information, and also the timing and volume of delivery. The ideological framework they use to push their objectives revolves around the idea of accountability. Users are caught between the State and Big Tech, and neither is particularly interested in their rights.Expectedly, regulating Big Tech is a tricky issue — and one that, in many countries in the world, has ended up before the courts, which too, aren’t always up to the task.Approached from the perspective of first principles, though, it’s easy (some might say simplistic) to define the objectives of such regulation.One, regulations have to ensure that Big Tech follows all other laws of the land, pertaining to individuals as well as companies. They will also have to protect the right of citizens to free speech, with restrictions, as stipulated in the fundamental rights chapter of the Constitution. Two, the regulatory framework has to protect the privacy of users, not discriminate against them in any way, and not unfairly affect their lives and livelihoods. In most countries, including India, these are all fundamental rights.Three, especially where content is concerned, Big Tech has to be responsible for what is on their platform. This may mean an end to intermediary immunity (and there has been a lot of research on how this is related to things such as freedom of expression and innovation), but companies whose primary business can be defined as media must be treated as media companies.Four (and this is covered in one, but merits repetition), the regulations should prevent the formation of monopolies (and Big Tech thrives on monopolies).Five, the regulatory regime will need to have enough safeguards to insulate it from partisan political pressure. The legitimacy of the regime rests on the State acting for the larger good, and not achieving narrow political objectives.These five principles could serve as a touchstone for any regulatory regime — and also for any challenges on the same. This will enhance the credibility of the policy as something that makes sure Big Tech conforms to the laws of the land while assuring citizens that it will not (and actually cannot) be used to stifle dissent.At the heart of this debate is an old question that has always confronted democratic societies — the balance between freedom and accountability. Big Tech is primarily focused on the former; the State is primarily focused on the latter; but for citizens, only the right balance works. Finding this balance has become more complex because of the nature of technology, the existence of multiple jurisdictions, the fact that each controversy gets linked to existing political positions rather than being treated on merit, and because neither complete control (like in China) nor complete, almost anarchy-like freedom (like in the early days of Big Tech where a policy regime was absent) is possible or desirable in India.Would traceability of messages, the main point of contention between WhatsApp and the Indian government pass the test? That’s for the Delhi High Court to decide. But both the WhatsApp case and the recent controversy with Twitter point to one fundamental truth. India needs a balanced regulatory regime, with the objective of protecting and empowering citizens, soon.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/the-battle-of-our-times-state-versus-big-tech-101622297612025.html
