04-05-2021||Mumbai||JEE Mains exam postponed: Students, parents raise concerns||Weeks after the National Testing Agency (NTA) postponed the third session of Joint Entrance Examination (JEE) Mains originally scheduled to take place in the last week for April, it has now indefinitely postponed the fourth and final session of the same exam on Tuesday. The news was not received well by affected students and parents, most of whom shared their displeasure on various social media platforms.“Instead of conducting online exams and putting students out of their misery, the Central and state governments are repeatedly delaying exams which is only making the situation worse for students, who consider this their most important year academically,” said Anupama Rai, mother of a JEE aspirant. She added that many JEE aspirants had not appeared for the February and March sessions of the exam because they wanted to focus on their Class 12 exam, and were waiting for the upcoming sessions to appear for their exam.This year, to give JEE aspirants a better chance at bettering their performance, the Union human resource development (HRD) ministry had announced that JEE Mains will be held in four sessions and students will get the choice to pick the highest score. As per information shared by NTA, 6.20 lakh and 5.56 lakh students appeared for the first two sessions held across India in the months of February and March. Rising Covid-19 cases, however, pushed NTA authorities to decide to postpone the April and now the May session indefinitely. “The rescheduling of April and May sessions of JEE Mains will be announced subsequently. Registrations for the May session will also be announced at a later date,” said the statement released by the NTA.Advait Parmar, 17, could not appear for the second session of JEE Mains in March as he was in quarantine after his father tested positive for Covid-19. “I re-registered for the April session of the exam and wanted to tick-off at least one exam of my list but now, the April, as well as the May sessions, have been postponed and I am unable to focus on studies anymore,” said Advait, who is also preparing for his Class 12 exam which remains postponed across school education boards in the country.Many also took to Twitter to share their concern with the state and Central government. “In the peak of the second wave of Covid, the government was busy holding election rallies and allowing religious festivals but are delaying exams which affect lives of lakhs of students across country. This is unacceptable,” said Ashutosh Singh, parent of another aspirant.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/jee-mains-exam-postponed-students-parents-raise-concerns-101620152958314.html
04-05-2021||Gurugram||Residents, RWAs pool resources to overcome shortage of beds, medicines, O2||Residents and Resident Welfare Associations (RWAs) in Gurugram are assembling resources to help Covid-19 patients amid an acute shortage of beds, medicines, and oxygen supply among others. As per the district administration data, the city recorded 63,720 fresh Covid-19 cases between April 1 and May 1 — more than what was recorded in 12 months of the pandemic put together.The first Covid-19 case in Gurugram was reported on March 17, 2020, and the city cumulatively recorded 63,313 cases till March 31 this year. The surge in the cases has been leading to an acute shortage of beds for Covid-positive patients since mid-April. Of the city’s 1,522 oxygen beds, 550 intensive care unit (ICU) beds, and 198 ventilator beds in 43 Covid-19 hospitals, there were no oxygen, ICU or ventilator beds as of Tuesday night, according to the Gurugram Covid Combat Companion (GC3) — a real-time portal managed by the district administration.Availability of vaporisers, oximeters, multivitamins, and selected cough and cold medicines have also taken a hit due to panic-bulk buying, and a general rise in demand. Shortage of oxygen has also been a major crisis, with at least 15 deaths due to non-availability of oxygen in the city last week, according to the private hospitals.Now, to mitigate the situation in Carlton Estate 1, a condominium in DLF 5, residents and the RWA have formed a Covid-19 medicine bank where medicines from recovered Covid-19 patients within the condominium are being collected and donated to other Covid-positive residents struggling to procure medicines. The RWA has also procured an oxygen concentrator for residents to be used during emergencies, which they said will be functional within a few days. “Our condominium has reported more than 70 Covid-19 cases since April, and a significant number of residents have recovered from the infection. At present, there are 42 apartments with active Covid-19 cases, and many patients reported difficulties in procuring the related medicines. So, to aid them, the RWA and residents came together and urged recovered Covid-19 patients to donate medicines that are being collected and stored within the condominium and are distributed among those in need,” said Pawan Tharwani, president, Carlton Estate Condominium Association (CECA).After struggling to secure a hospital bed and essential medicines for his Covid-19 positive father, Vishal Singh — a resident of Sahara Grace Condominium in Sector 28 — set up a temporary Covid-19 facility at a vacant space in the clubhouse last week. The facility has five beds, two nurses, amenities like 12 oxygen cylinders, oximeters, oxygen concentrators, and food supply for in-house residents. “My father had tested Covid positive in Allahabad last month, and being here, I could not do anything to help him to secure basic amenities like hospital beds and medicines. The anxiety kept my whole family awake for days, till his condition was stable. I realised I had to do something to help people in whatever possible ways, and I decided to approach my housing complex to start the five-bed oxygen supported Covid-19 care facility,” said Singh, adding that the housing society reported around 75 fresh Covid-19 cases during the second wave.Last week, the RWA of Fresco Apartments also procured an oxygen concentrator for its residents during emergencies. “On an average, the oxygen concentrator is used by two to three residents daily. It has helped them in breathing. Recently, a senior citizen in our housing society could not find a hospital bed for nearly two days, she used the device during the interim to control her dipping oxygen level. The device has proved to be lifesaver, especially for residents who have been waiting for ambulances or getting a bed in Covid-19 hospitals,” said Nilesh Tandon, president, Fresco Apartments RWA.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/residents-rwas-pool-resources-to-overcome-shortage-of-beds-medicines-o2-101620152058230.html
04-05-2021||Gurugram||Hospitals out of vaccines, delays in second jabs a concern||Timely inoculation of vaccine beneficiaries has become a challenge as private hospitals continued to shut their vaccination centres due to the unavailability of doses. While residents are concerned about getting their second vaccine dose, hospital managements said that vaccine manufacturers have put them on a long wait list and it may take around three to four months to get the required dosages.“Currently, hospitals are not getting any vaccine stock from manufacturers as they are obliged to provide doses to central and state governments. In all likelihood, vaccination for those between 18 to 44 years will be mostly carried out at government facilities. Private hospitals will come into the picture after three to four months. Besides, there has been no clarity on second dose inoculation of beneficiaries,” said Dr Nikhil Mishra, chief medical superintendent, Columbia Asia Hospital. A senior health official, requesting anonymity, said, “Clearly, people who require second shot have been facing problems as private hospitals have run out of vaccine stock and are facing difficulties in direct procurement of doses from manufacturers.”According to the district health department data, until May 3, over 178,219 people aged 45 to 59 years took their first dose, but only 13,843 of them have received the second shot. As many as 149,183 people above the age of 60 years have got their first shot, while 36,998 of them received the second shot.Due to the limited supply of vaccine, session sites have decreased to 59 from 89 in the district. Until the first week of April, vaccination took place at 37 government health centres and 52 private hospitals. As reported by HT on Monday, many big hospitals, including Artemis and W Pratiksha, shut their vaccination centres after failing to get a positive response from the manufacturers. Residents who visit the hospitals were directed to visit the government session sites to get their second doses.Dr Devlina Chakravarty, managing director, Artemis Hospital, said, “The hospital inoculated 500 to 900 people every day. But due to unavailability of stock, second dose beneficiaries who have been directly reaching hospital every day are asked to go back.” Earlier, private hospitals directly procured vaccines from the district health department, but with the start of inoculations for people aged 18 to 44, private facilities were directed to get the vaccines from manufacturers. Even the district health department has limited doses, with 13,000 doses currently in stock for second jab beneficiaries. Of these, nearly 4,110 doses were utilised on Tuesday at 30 government sites. Vaccine beneficiaries are worried about the delays in taking the second dose.Vineeta Mathur (60), a resident of Ridgewood Estate, said she has not been able to get the second shot of Covishield vaccine despite visiting many private and government health facilities over the last three days. “There are no slots available for the second shot at any private hospital in the city. Even after directly walking into a few big private hospitals, the staff clearly said they don’t have vaccine stock. At government facilities, only 100-150 tokens are being distributed in a day. The token distribution gets over before 9am.” She said that the government vaccination centre at the Sector 31 polyclinic and other Urban Primary Health Centres have long queues, with no social distancing norms being followed. “At a time when the pandemic is at its peak, the vaccination process could have been streamlined, especially for the elderly. Visiting hospitals or standing in queues for hours makes us vulnerable to contract the coronavirus infection,” said Mathur.Atul Gupta, a resident of Sector 43, who took the first dose of the vaccine along with his wife almost five weeks ago at W Pratiksha Hospital, is facing a similar dilemma. “The vaccination centre of the hospital was closed. We are not able to find any centre to get the second jab of Covaxin in Gurugram. Despite all efforts, there is no clarity on the vaccination process. Therefore, to avoid any further delay we have registered for a slot in one of the vaccination centres in South Delhi,” said Gupta. Residents also complained of issues with booking slots on the Co-WIN platform. Hemant Kumar, a citizen, tweeted: “As a senior citizen the second shot has been cancelled thrice by CoWin without assigning any reason.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/hospitals-out-of-vaccines-delays-in-second-jabs-a-concern-101620151880077.html
04-05-2021||Gurugram||Daily spike nears 5,000, zero ICU beds available||The district on Tuesday reported 4,475 new Covid-19 cases, taking active case count to 37,708. The death toll stood at 522, at least 11 deaths on Tuesday. At present, Covid-19 cases have been doubling every 34 days, according to government data. “Cases will continue to spike, which directly impacts the doubling rate of cases. With increased testing, we are trying to identify new cases and control the surge,” said Dr Virender Yadav, chief medical officer. The rapid surge in Covid-19 is also overwhelming the health infrastructure, with no beds with oxygen support, ventilators and intensive care available, according to the Gurugram Covid Combat Companion (GC3) portal. At present, 2,447 people are undergoing treatment at 43 Covid-19 hospitals in the district. “The consequence of high testing numbers is that Gurugram’s positivity rate has been high, compared to other districts,” Yadav said. As per the health department data, the test positivity rate, the proportion of positives out of total samples tested, has also increased to 33%, compared to the 10% reported in the second week of April, when the daily case count began escalating. The positivity rate of the state remains at 7%. To augment the health infrastructure, private companies will set up 700 beds, as reported by HT earlier. A city-based firm, Mankind Pharma Limited, on Tuesday, set up a 70-bed temporary Covid isolation ward with oxygen support at Civil Lines. Besides hospitalised patients, at least 192 mild to moderately ill patients are in isolation at district Covid care centres, while 35, 069 are in home isolation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/daily-spike-nears-5-000-zero-icu-beds-available-101620151879423.html
04-05-2021||Gurugram||Govt health centres limit inoculations due to low vaccine availability||Even as private hospitals shut vaccination centres due to lack of vaccines, the government health centres are inoculating only a limited number of people due to the low availability of vaccines.At nearly 30 primary health centres (PHCs) in urban and rural areas, many people were asked to return on Tuesday and book fresh slots. The district administration also issued a statement that government health facilities will not conduct vaccinations at private workplaces or residential areas.“For the second dose inoculations, the department received 13,000 doses on Monday night. It will be distributed to 30 vaccination centres in the district,” said Dr Virender Yadav, chief medical officer. Puneet Goyal, a resident of Sector 69, said that he had booked a vaccination slot at Mullahera PHC for Tuesday between 9am and 11am. “I reached the site at 8.45am and the centre was filled with residents by 9.30am. However, there was no sight of any PHC staff, not even a single person to ensure social distancing was being followed. The staff started arriving after 10.15am and announced they will vaccinate only 45 people who are due to get their second dose. It was a surprise for 99% of the people who had come for their first shot,” said Goyal. He said that more than 100 people returned without getting their jabs, including some who had to take their second dose. Another resident, Rajesh Kumar who waited for more than two hours, left the site without getting vaccinated. “The vaccine stock was over, and we were told to book an appointment for another day. We had to return without vaccination after wasting three hours and exposing ourselves to the Covid-19 risk. The state of PHC is not in a good state. The staff is not well trained and is short-tempered. No one was ready to provide the right information despite repeated attempts,” said Kumar. Many people who visited the Sector 31 polyclinic alleged similar concerns and said they returned due to large crowds and low vaccine availability. Currently, the health department is focussing on inoculating beneficiaries who have to take the second jab, with almost 12,000 vaccine doses in stock. At 30 sites, roughly about 100 inoculations each take place. Since many private hospitals ceased the vaccination drive due to the unavailability of vaccine dosages, people are turning up at government health centres to take their second dose. Gurpreet Singh, president, Resident Welfare Association (RWA), Ridgewood Estate, said, “Getting the prioritised population group, those above 45 years, vaccinated has become a challenge. Over 30 elderly people could manage to get their second dose at the nearby urban primary health centre. Earlier, many residents of the society received their first dose during a vaccination drive held within the condominium premises. Ideally, the drive for the second shot should have also been held within the society, especially when the coronavirus infection is widely spread. We have approached authorities to hold a vaccination camp but there has been no response.” Vaccination drives have been restricted by government PHCs at present. To hold such vaccination camps, RWAs and private companies will have to approach private hospitals, said officials.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/govt-health-centres-limit-inoculations-due-to-low-vaccine-availability-101620151878866.html
04-05-2021||Gurugram||Ambulance operators threaten to shut services due to price cap||A day after the regional transport authority (RTA) imposed a cap on the private ambulance charges for ferrying Covid-19 patients and victims, ambulance operators in the city said they will not run their ambulances on Wednesday unless the cap is removed or at least increased. Operators also submitted a memorandum to the deputy commissioner in this regard on Tuesday.Rajesh Yadav, president, Private Ambulance Association (PAA), said that the price fixed by the transport department is inadequate to run their services. “We will not run our ambulances with the prices imposed on Monday. We are ready to donate these ambulances to the district administration as we will suffer huge losses and will not be able to make our ends meet. Our drivers are risking their lives and handling Covid-19 patients and their bodies. The fixed amount is the same as it was 20 years ago. There has been inflation on all products and services, but the transport department wants us to operate at the same charge,” Yadav said, adding that they are ready to sell their ambulances and the drivers will look for other jobs if the prices are not revised. He said that according to the new policy, they will hardly get ₹150 for a trip.As per the two-page memorandum sent by 10 members of the PAA to Dr Yash Garg, a copy of which was seen by HT, operators said they have been providing ambulances to the health department officials and other senior officers for free, but now, they are facing harassment. “Last year, we had provided ambulances to the civil surgeon for two months, seven ambulances to a subdivisional magistrate, and a bill of ₹13 lakh is still pending. We have been running from pillar to post to get our dues, but no one is responding. We want to help the authorities and continue our operations, but who will think of us, and how can we run the operations after suffering a huge loss?” the memorandum stated.However, RTA officials said that the operators are taking advantage of the situation and threatening to stop operations, and that the authority will not revise the prices.Dhaarna Yadav, secretary, RTA, said they are not aware of any strike, and the fare has been fixed considering the situation of the people, as the ambulance drivers and operators were fleecing them. “We have fixed the fare per kilometre to ensure that the people are not extorted, and the prices be transparent. They were charging ₹10,000 for five kilometres, and the people had no other option than to pay them. This was a much-needed step, and we will ensure that there is smooth functioning of ambulances across the city,” she said.Yash Garg, the deputy commissioner of Gurugram, said the authority will look into the matter. “We will resolve this issue at the earliest,” Garg said.Salina Macknight, the vice-president, PAA, said that drivers are taking a huge risk as relatives of Covid-19 victims request the drivers to complete the formalities. “All the private ambulances were parked on Tuesday, and we are not taking any more bookings. Our drivers have tested Covid-positive, their treatment and hospital expenses are borne by us. We are paying for their food and lodging and are ensuring, after each patient is shifted, that the ambulances are cleaned and sanitised properly,” Macknight said.There are 39 private ambulance operators and nearly 250 ambulances in the city.Members of the PAA members said they invested more than ₹30 lakh to get advanced life support (ALS) ambulances and nearly ₹12 lakh for basic life support (BLS) ambulances, and are still paying the monthly instalments. Along with a minimum salary of ₹20,000 to each driver and incentives to transport patients and dead bodies, PAA members said they are facing a huge problem.On Monday, HT reported that ambulances were demanding ₹20,000 to ₹30,000 to transport patients to private hospitals within a five-kilometre radius, while for outstation transport, the rates went up to ₹1.5 lakh. As per the caps imposed on Monday, an ALS ambulance can be hired at a maximum of ₹15 per kilometre, and a BLS ambulance for ₹7 per kilometre.Vipin Kumar, former president, PAA, said amid the surge in Covid-19 cases, the drivers have been working for over 14 hours a day. “We have ferried hundreds of Covid-19 patients since April, keeping our fears of contagion aside. A 12-hour shift has turned into a 16-hour shift. Our men are continuously working for shifting bodies. With this amount, we can’t even fill petrol in the vehicles,” Kumar said.The PAA members also alleged that the fare imposed by the transport department was based on vehicles bought by the government, and for which maintenance and instalment costs are not considered.Private ambulance operators also alleged that they were buying oxygen cylinders in black as they were not being allowed to get them refilled at the designated stations for the past eight days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/ambulance-operators-threaten-to-shut-services-due-to-price-cap-101620151878292.html

04-05-2021||Chandigarh||₹50,000 fine if private ambulances overcharge patients in Haryana||The Manohar Lal Khattar-led Haryana government has directed the regional transport authorities (RTAs) to slap “minimum ₹50,000 penalty” on private ambulance drivers or owners if found charging more than the fixed price.As per instructions, advance life support (ALS) ambulance can be hired at the rate of ₹15/km and basic life support (BLS) ambulances cannot charge more than ₹7/km for transporting patients in any kind of emergency, including accidents.The state health department on Monday sent a letter to the transport commissioner informing how private ambulances have been fleecing patients.The health department said that it has come to the notice of higher authorities in state that private ambulance drivers and service providers are “charging exorbitantly higher rates” than what’s prescribed by the department.“This practice is prevalent while transporting patients within as well as outside state,” the letter reads.The health department has directed the transport commissioner to issue necessary instructions to all secretaries of the RTA in this regard.In case private ambulance drivers or owners resort to charging “exorbitant rates”, the RTAs will be authorised to cancel driving license of the ambulance driver.The department has directed that the RTAs can also cancel registration certificate of the ambulance or impound the vehicle and impose a penalty starting from a minimum of ₹50,000 in case of non-compliance of instructions.As per the letter, also marked to all deputy commissioners and civil surgeons, because of this unethical practice, citizens are bearing additional financial burden during the current Covid-induced crisis.The direction to impose heavy penalty on private ambulances found fleecing patients coincides with Haryana health and home minister Anil Vij warning private hospitals of strict action if found overcharging for facilities and other medical assistance from Covid patients in state.“Strict action will be taken if any hospital is found charging more than the fixed rates from Covid patients,” Vij had said on Monday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/rs-50-000-fine-if-private-ambulances-overcharge-patients-in-haryana-101620147858993.html

People are coming forward in large numbers to take the jab.As per figures of the Cowin portal, total 63,489 people were vaccinated at 1,022 vaccination centres in Haryana till 5pm on April 4. Over three lakh people in the age group of 18 to 44, including health and frontline workers have been vaccinated since the vaccine was rolled out for the above 18 age groups.On May 2, total 18,310 people were given the jab.

He had also led another group of men into committing a similar offence in December 2020. “He had a list of 100-125 nursing homes from various areas and he used to attach himself with one and tell them that he will try it out for a couple of days before providing his services. He used that opportunity to perform a complete reccee of the place and refuse the job. Weeks later, he would come and steal from there,” said Mahesh Bhosale, police sub inspector of Chaturshringi police station who is one of the officers investigating the case now. Hande is all of 25-years old and has a history of at least seven such known cases against him - one in Kothrud, three in Chaturshringi, one in Jalna, one each in Nigdi and Sangvi. He is now in custody of Pune police until May 10. When he was arrested by Kothrud police station officials, Hande was with Ajinkya Nursing Home. However, while working at the house in Sindh colony, he was attached with the Pune nursing bureau. “He even worked at that house for some time. We will check if Ajinkya agency employed him again. If that is true, they will be made accused too,” said PSI Bhosale. The case has drawn a sharp response from Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) member and activist Vijay Kumbhar who has questioned the police inaction in the case after he was granted bail in the Kothrud case. Kumbhar wrote a letter to chief minister Uddhav Thackeray and home minister Dilip Valse-Patil. “When the Kothrud case was brought to light, a demand was for necessitating police verification for agencies that provide such services and their employees. However, it was ignored,” said Kumbhar in the letter. He further blamed the police for not taking appropriate action in such cases. “Even if these cases get registered, why is appropriate action not being taken against them? For how many more years will these gangs be given a free hand? What is the reason behind the lack of a permanent solution to this problem?” asked Kumbhar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/caretakerturnedthief-had-list-of-over-100-nursing-homes-police-find-101620144137705.html
04-05-2021||Pune||Covid restrictions slow down Ring Road land acquisition process||The land acquisition process for the western part of the Ring Road project to be built by MSRDC has been allowed despite the Covid curbs being imposed in the state, however, it has slowed down the essential Joint Measurement Survey (JMS) procedure in the land acquisition process. Until April 28th, JMS in seven affected villages in western parts of the Ring Road has been completed. There are 38 affected villages on the western side of the Ring Road. With this speed MSRDC’s target to complete JMS procedure before monsoon starts is likely to be missed. The procedure of joint measurement survey started in the last week of March in western parts of the proposed ring road. “We had aimed to complete the JMS before Monsoon starts because it is not possible to do it in that season but now, there are certain problems we are facing as the Covid cases are increasing and curbs are in place,” said Sandeep Patil sub-divisional engineer Maharashtra State Road Development Corporation (MSRDC). Patil elaborated the difficulties faced in the process. “Land measurement is done in the farms and the isolated areas, and it is happening smoothly but to get the consensus of a village a meeting with villagers has to be conducted according to the procedure. In these it is difficult to organise it. Also, we don’t want to turn to the hard methods such as doing the measurements in police protection. As per the orders it has to be done with maximum amount of cooperation and consensus,” Patil said. If the joint measurement survey is not completed before Monsoon, then it will resume after the season, but it surely delays the timeframe of the project. Without the completion of JMS, the monetary returns to the affected people cannot be issued. Pune district collector had also ordered the completion of land acquisition process of western part before April 30th. “This process has to be completed to evaluate the monetary returns to be given to the villagers but as they are not sure how much they will get; they are hesitant to let us complete this procedure. We are trying to get help from the people’s representatives from concerned areas to persuade the locals,” Patil said. Until now, MSRDC has completed JMS in seven villages which include Ghotavade,Materewadi, Ambadveth, Bhare, Kasar Amboli, Katvadi, Mordarwadi in an area of 101.0467 hectares. The Pune Ring Road is a proposed circular outer road for the Pune Metropolitan region. The state government has given nod to land acquisition for the 173.70-km ring road project. It is to be implemented by the Maharashtra State Road Development Corporation (MSRDC). The Ring Road project would require acquisition of almost 1,600 hectares of land. The total project cost of this road is ₹26,000 crore and ₹5,000 crore is estimated for land acquisition.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/covid-restrictions-slow-down-ring-road-land-acquisition-process-101620143537775.html

04-05-2021||Other||Education minister hails SC order on fee relief to pvt school students||PATNAFollowing the Supreme Court’s order to private schools, offering relief to students towards fee payments, the state education department is considering framing a policy to ensure that the parents received the benefits as stipulated in the order.The Supreme Court, in a case filed by private schools of Rajasthan, has ruled that the schools shall not be charging money for the unutilized campus facilities and that the students be allowed to avail at least 15% reduction in annual fee for the academic session 2020-21, the pandemic phase. It also said none of the students be held up for want of payment of fees. The judgment was made public by the apex court on Tuesday.Private schools had gone to the apex court against the Rajasthan government’s order to cut tuition fee of students enrolled in CBSE-affiliated schools by 30% and the state board by 40%, respectively.Bihar’s education minister Vijay Kumar Chaudhary said the judgment was in tune with the state government’s appeal to private schools to offer relief to the students who remained off the campuses due to Covid19 pandemic. “In the last assembly session, we urged private schools to rationalize fee structure and charge minimal from the students so that the schools also get the amount required for the sustenance of their staff,” said Chaudhary.Additional chief secretary (education) Sanjay Kumar said the department was waiting for full judgment of the apex court to frame suitable strategy to act and help the parents get fee reduction in accordance with the order.There are over 25,000 private schools in the state with a total of around 50 lakh students.“The school has been charging transportation fee, computer fee, science laboratory charge, etc, even though my son did not go for off-line studies,” said Namrata Kumari of Shashtri Nagar, whose son is in class 10 at a private school in the nearby locality.National president of Private Schools and Children Welfare Association Syed Shamael Ahmad hailed the judgment, saying it made clear that the state government could not regulate the fee structure of private schools. “So far as granting relief to the students, private schools would definitely honour the verdict by giving 15% concession on fees,” said Ahmad.He said all private schools should abide by the SC verdict. “However, the guardians are also requested to clear the dues to the schools so that they could pay salary to teaching and non-teaching staff, who are dependent on the school to sustain their families,” said Ahmad.He urged chief minister Nitish Kumar to clear the payment of government grants to private schools on account of enforcing the right to education (RTE) and taking admissions of poor students on 25% seats. “Payment of RTE grants, amounting in several crores of rupees, to the qualified schools has been held up for the past four-five years at the district level. The CM must look into the issues and penalize officers responsible for this,” Ahmad said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/education-minister-hails-sc-order-on-fee-relief-to-pvt-school-students-101620142697708.html

As soon as the proceedings began at 11 am, the court was angry that not enough had been done and the court could not go on waiting, putting the lives of the people at risk. “We have all failed. All of us feel ashamed for what we have done. Don’t make a joke of the proceedings. We cannot wait. We cannot play with the lives of the people, you may. It is an observation on us also that we have failed. This has happened only because we depended on the state officials and false assurances given by the state officials,” bench observed. When the advocate general tried to defend the state government saying it had taken effective steps, sanctioned ₹50 lakh to the ESIC hospital on Monday along with manpower and took exception to the court’s remark that he should not make joke of the proceedings, the bench asked him to name the hospitals where beds had been increased. When the AG took the name of Rajedendra Nagar Hospital (150 beds), the bench said it was nothing. “You had said about 1,000 beds at the IGIMS and 500 beds at the ESIC hospital, but it could not start. PMCH is in a shambles, NMCH is struggling,” the bench said. “The orders we have passed from the first date when we first took the matter on April 15 speak for themselves. In our opinion, certain drastic measures need to be taken to tackle the situation in the state, which has already gone beyond control.” The court also questioned the functioning of dedicated Covid care centres, saying most beds were vacant since there were no facilities there. The court also asked additional solicitor general KN Singh to seek instructions in the light of today’s proceedings and AG to file a detailed affidavit on the progress made by the state’s health department in fighting the Covid crisis. “The court will pass appropriate orders on Thursday. The court will fail in its duty if necessary orders are not passed in the larger public interest to ensure right of life to the people in the state,” the bench said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/we-have-all-failed-hc-on-covid-crisis-101620142577687.html

Chief minister Nitish Kumar announced the decision through a tweet Tuesday morning after holding a meeting with cabinet colleagues and senior government officials on Monday night.“The decision comes in the backdrop of positivity rate which is hovering over 10% for the last one week. Despite restrictions, the infection is increasing,” said chief secretary Tripurari Sharan. The state reported 14,794 positive cases on Tuesday, taking the number of active cases to 110,430. The state capital continued to remain a hotspot, contributing 2,681 of the new Covid-19 infections during the last 24 hours. The state so far has recorded 2926 deaths, 105 of which were reported in last 24 hours. The state government, in the last week of April, had extended curfew timings from 9 pm to 6 pm and ordered closure of shops from 4 pm instead of 6 pm.The government had earlier restricted attendance of staff in offices and semi-government offices to only 25% while schools were closed till may 15. The universities and colleges have already closed down for summer vacation since May 1.During the lockdown, all offices, barring emergency and essential services, will remain closed, a notification issued by the state home department said.

Medical shops, grocery shops, and other essential services would remain open like the previous lockdown norms.The state government has banned plying of vehicles but allowed public transport to operate to 50% of capacity for carrying passengers travelling by rail or air. RJD attacks govt; Cong, BJP welcome lockdown The state government’s decision to enforce lockdown was criticized by the RJD. “The opposition has been demanding the lockdown for last 15 days. But the Bihar CM was awaiting orders from somewhere else. And when it has started affecting villages, the government has imposed the lockdown,” said leader of opposition Tejashwi Prasad Yadav.However, RJD’s ally Congress welcomed the decision. “We have requested CM for lockdown earlier and now it has been announced, although a bit late. Yet we welcome the decision,” said Congress MLC Premchandra Mishra.“The Bihar government is taking every decision in consultation from the group of experts and taking into account people’s opinion. We appreciate the decision on the lockdown,” said BJP spokesperson Nikhil Anand.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/bihar-locks-down-till-may-15-101620142518320.html

Bihar is purchasing the vaccines directly from the firms — the Serum Institute of India, the manufacturers of Covishield, and the Bharat Biotech, manufacturers of Covaxin. The state’s purchase would be in addition to the Centre’s allotment in due course of time, said an official of the health department. “We made advance payment of ₹36.74 crore to the Serum Institute on Tuesday for the first lot of 11.80 lakh doses of Covishield. We have also placed purchase orders for supply of 4.12 lakh doses of Covaxin with the Bharat Biotech. We are in constant touch with the firm to raise the invoice so that we can make advance payment for the vaccines,” the official added. The Centre has fixed a purchase rate of ₹315 per dose for Covishield and ₹420 per dose for Covaxin for states and union territories. “We are pursuing with the Serum Institute for immediate dispatch of the vaccines and it has assured us that the shipment will move Wednesday,” the officer said. Bihar has been going slow on vaccination because of lack of availability of sufficient vaccines. “We have around 8 lakh doses of vaccines available with us and intend to utilise them up in the next four days. The Centre has assured to replenish the vaccines before we exhaust our stock,” said Manoj Kumar, executive director of the State Health Society, Bihar, also the state’s nodal officer for vaccination. The lack of vaccines has forced Bihar to scale down its session sites from 2,800 almost a month back to 2,200 as on Monday. “We were faced with a shortage of vaccines a fortnight back when the number of inoculations dipped to around 70,000 a day against a peak of 3.75 lakh inoculations a day. We have picked up again and inoculated 1,16,805 lakh on May 3,” added Kumar. Bihar had so far inoculated 74,18,981 people against a target group of 2.30 crore people above 45 years of age. The state has decided to hold back the vaccination of 18 years and above population till it receives sufficient quantity of vaccines.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/bihar-places-order-for-first-batch-of-15-92-lakh-doses-of-vaccine-101620142517755.html

He breathed his last at the Fortis Hospital in Mohali. Malhotra is survived by his wife, son and daughter. Condoling the death, Punjab chief minister (CM) Capt Amarinder Singh said Malhotra was a distinguished academician, able administrator and a fine human being with qualities of head and heart. “He played a pivotal role in bringing socio-economic development in the northern region.

Assam waits for the next chief minister||Two days after the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and its allies returned to power for a second time, speculations continued to do the rounds on Tuesday across Assam on who will be the next chief minister of the state. There’s no clarity yet on whether incumbent Sarbananda Sonowal will continue to head the government or senior minister Himanta Biswa Sarma, who played a crucial role in the party’s poll performance, will be given the post. “It is clear that either among the two, the incumbent CM or the finance minister (Sarma) would be the next CM. Whoever is given the responsibility will accept it. I appeal to all BJP MLAs and workers to remain calm till a decision is reached,” BJP state chief Ranjeet Kumar Dass told journalists on Tuesday. Union agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar and BJP national general secretary Arun Singh, who were scheduled to visit Guwahati on Tuesday, are now expected on Wednesday to meet the newly elected legislators and get their views on government formation and the CM’s post. “It is natural for the public and voters to speculate who will be the next CM. But the BJP is a disciplined party and the party’s parliamentary board will meet in Delhi in the next 2-3 days to take a call on this,” BJP MP from Silchar Rajdeep Roy said. In the meantime, newly elected MLAs and leaders of alliance partners Asom Gana Parishad (AGP) and United Peoples Party Liberal (UPPL) are meeting both Sonowal and Sarma in Guwahati. “If my name is being discussed and I am being questioned on it, what do you expect me to answer? Someone has to become the CM as the post won’t remain vacant. You should ask a third person about it. It is embarrassing to face such questions,” Sarma told the media on Tuesday. Most BJP MLAs are saying that a decision on the CM’s post would be taken by the party high command with the consultation of the legislators. A senior BJP leader said on condition of anonymity that Rashtriya Swayamsewak Sangh (RSS) could also have a say on who will take the top post. “It is sad to see that in the fight for the CM’s chair, people of Assam are getting affected. It is clear that there is a difference within the BJP on this issue. We are worried the fight between the two for the post could hurt the state,” said newly elected Congress MLA from Mariani, Rupjyoti Kurmi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/sonowal-or-sarma-assam-waits-for-the-next-chief-minister-101620140178370.html
04-05-2021||Other||It is harrowing to call Covid victims’ kin: PGIMS nurse||When 24-year-old Sheetal Choudhary joined as a staff nurse at the Postgraduate Institute of Medical Sciences (PGIMS) four years ago, little did she know that three years down the line she would be single-handedly doing the unenviable job of arranging cremations for those succumbing to Covid through two waves of the pandemic.The energetic Covid warrior has been doing the job everybody shies away from — making the dreaded phone call to family members of the deceased, coordinating with the police, municipal corporation and PGIMS staff, sealing and sending bodies to the cremation ground — for the last year. Till May 1, she had arranged the last rites of at least 700 people claimed by the virus and has not taken a single leave in three months.On Sunday morning, Choudhary received a call from the father of an 11-month-old boy, who died of Covid on Saturday night. The father wanted to see his son’s face for the last time. Choudhary’s eyes brim with tears as she recalls the harrowing phone call. “I suffer a breakdown every day on seeing these deaths. It was very difficult for me to console the father and grandfather of the 11-month-old child who battled for his life for four days.”Choudhary, the nodal officer for Covid death management at PGIMS, says her morning starts with people begging her to arrange an ambulance so that they can take the body of their loved ones to the crematorium.“I sent 12 bodies to the cremation ground for last rites till Sunday afternoon and 14 on Saturday. Making the phone call to the family of patients and receiving them when they arrive for a final glimpse of their loved ones the next day,, however, is the hardest part of the job. I get at least 400 calls per day, most of which are by the family members of the deceased ringing up to ask when the body will be cremated and how many people are allowed to come,” she says.Choudhary says they use labels so that bodies of patients with the same name do not get mixed up. A team of 8 Class-4 employees seal the bodies.Unidentified body left at PGIMS“We have two ambulances and send bodies to two crematoriums in two shifts every day. Last month, I was only able to return home at 2.30am after making a cremation list for the next morning because over 30 patients had died in a single day. The bodies were lined up and our staff struggled to pack the body. A senior police official’s sister had succumbed to the virus at a private hospital in Gurugram and the staff had left the body at PGIMS without informing us. We struggled to identify the body,” she says.On the challenges faced by the staff, Choudhary says a few Covid patients’ family members had refused to appear for the cremation and asked them to perform the last rites.“Many people would demand that they be allowed to take the body to their native town or village. A few influential would demand that their relative’s body be cremated at the earliest, but I have always given bodies as per sequence,” she said.PGIMS medical superintendent Dr Pushpa Dahiya Choudhary is doing work, which other employees are refusing to do. “Her job is high risk, and she has been doing it for the last year. She is single-handedly doing the work of six-seven staff members,” Dahiya said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/it-is-harrowing-to-call-covid-victims-kin-pgims-nurse-101620139637958.html

Speaking to news agency ANI, Tope said Maharashtra is conducting tests on 280,000 samples on a daily basis and there has been no shortage in testing.“From 63,000, the tally of Covid-19 patients has come down to 61,000. At 84.07 per cent, our recovery rate is the highest in the country,” the health minister added.On Monday, the daily Covid-19 tally in Maharashtra dipped below the 50,000-mark for the first time in almost a month after 48,621 cases were reported in the last 24 hours, taking the caseload to 4,771,022, according to the state health department’s bulletin. On Sunday, the state had reported 56,647 new cases.However, the decrease in cases may be attributed to the lower number of tests done during the weekend. As many as 211,668 samples were tested for Covid-19 on Monday, 45,802 less than those tested on Sunday. While on Saturday, nearly 289,000 tests were conducted.The state capital Mumbai also saw a dip in daily cases on Monday at 2,624, the lowest single-day figure since March 17. The city’s caseload has now climbed to 658,621. On April 30, the daily cases went below the 4,000-mark in Mumbai and have not increased since then.As Hindustan Times had reported earlier, Maharashtra has managed to control the surge in cases from the last two weeks. The active cases as of Monday stood at 656,870 which were earlier projected to go over 1 million. The lockdown-like restrictions, which have been extended till May 15, helped the state in controlling the spread of Covid-19.The Union health ministry, meanwhile, on Monday said that Maharashtra along with states such as Chhattisgarh, Delhi, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, is showing early signs of plateauing or decrease in daily infections. The peak of 65,000 Covid-19 cases in Maharashtra has come down to around 62,000, Union health ministry joint secretary Lav Agarwal said during a press briefing, urging Maharashtra and other states to continue with their containment efforts to ensure the number of cases can come down further.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-covid-positivity-rate-on-decline-says-health-minister-rajesh-tope-101620136676137.html

Patil said “If the cases rise in the coming days, more oxygen will be needed. Strict lockdown will be imposed in the district from 11 am to break the chain of infection.” Besides Kolhapur, guardian minister of Sangli, Jayant Patil, also announced a complete lockdown in the district for eight days, starting Wednesday. “At this point, lives are more important than livelihood. Therefore, I urge everyone to follow lockdown norms and not step out,” said Patil. In Satara, fresh restrictions came into being from Tuesday, as cases spiked. Except for milk, and home delivery of food and medical services, everything will be closed. Maharashtra health minister Rajesh Tope said that while cases are on the decline in many cities, including Mumbai and Pune, some districts are showing a surge. “To make sure Covid doesn’t spread further, the local administration has decided to impose a stricter lockdown in Kolhapur, Sangli and Satara. There will be additional restrictions in these places,” said Tope, speaking to reporters in Mumbai. The state is already under curbs, which according to the order, will last till May 15.

Some private hospitals told PTI that they have been receiving requests from corporates for vaccinating employees and their kin since the government opened the vaccination program from May 1 for the 18-44 age group. "After the government allowed vaccination of people from the age group of 18 to 44 years from May 1, we have been receiving on-site vaccination requests from large corporates. They requested us to organize a vaccination drive for their employees," said Dr S K Raut, one of the directors at the Noble Hospital.Besides corporates, the hospital has been receiving requests from housing societies, and the hotel and hospitality industries, he said.Dr Raut said the Serum Institute of India (SII) told them that 50 per cent of the available doses will be given to the Centre, while 25 per cent doses will be given to state governments and the rest 25 per cent to private hospitals.The SII has not given any timeline on the next availability of vaccines."While the hospital is awaiting guidelines, we are also exploring the possibilities of procuring Sputnik-5 vaccine from Dr. Reddy's," he added.Dr Rupali Suryawanshi, head, Hospital Infection Control, Ruby Hall Clinic, is also awaiting the government's guidelines on the procurement of vaccines by private hospitals. "The government should tell us from where should we purchase the vaccine. We were also talking to the SII but it seems they too don't have clear guidelines as far private hospitals are concerned," she said.She recalled that the government had issued a clear notification on various aspects of vaccination, including costing, when the drive was rolled out for healthcare workers and other categories in the past. "Till these things get cleared, the ground level work for vaccination cannot start as the number of beneficiaries in the age group of 18 and 44 is very big," Dr Suryawanshi said, adding the hospital has been receiving many requests for tie-ups with companies which want their employees and their kin vaccinated. Authorities at Jehangir Hospital said they are also awaiting notification from the government. "There is no clarity as of today and we are hopeful that the picture will become clear about various aspects like the supply-chain logistics, pricing etc in the next couple of days," said Arti Irani, Head, Communications, Jehangir Hospital.Medical authorities at Sancheti Hospital said they are also receiving inquiries from various organizations about vaccination sessions. "We have applied to become a vaccination centre as we have been receiving inquiries from individuals and organizations for vaccination. However, since there is no clarity on how private hospitals should go about the vaccination, we are not giving any assurance to those who are approaching us," said Parag Sancheti, orthopaedic surgeon and chairman of the hospital.Dr Jitendra Oswal, deputy medical director at Bharti Hospital, said vaccination is currently halted at private hospitals. "It seems vaccination at private hospitals is unlikely to start anytime soon," he said.Dr Oswal observed that less than 10 per cent of population has received the first dose of the vaccine while only 2 per cent people have received the second dose.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/private-hospitals-in-pune-await-guidelines-on-procuring-covid-19-vaccine-doses-101620137219463.html

The state’s overall recovery rate has reached 69.43%.Government data shows that from 7,426 on April 27, the number of recoveries in the state shot up to 11,949 on Monday, when 17, 296 new Covid cases were reported taking the tally of active cases to 194,371. However, the overall recovery rate has seen a continuous decline since last year since new cases on most days in the second wave have continuously been higher than the recoveries recorded on the same day.Dr Ajit Singh of SMS hospital says the lower recovery rate in the second wave is also due to patients taking longer to recover as most cases admitted to the hospitals are of severe nature, requiring oxygen support, which is not adequate at the moment.He says many experts believe the number of cases were likely to peak with the second wave around May 15. “We will witness a steep surge and hopefully a drastic decline following the peak,” Singh said. He is hopeful that more people getting vaccinated in the coming days will also bring down daily active cases.However, the district administrations across the state are currently getting ready to deal with the impending peak of the disease. “The estimated peak could be very serious, but since vigilance has been increased across Rajasthan, the number of people stepping out on roads has sharply declined,” said an official.Rajasthan police says they have challaned 17 lakh people for violation of Covid-containment guidelines. Out of these, 4 lakh have been fined for not wearing masks.Jaipur police said that they are under instruction to send violators to institutional quarantine.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/jaipur-news/rajasthan-readies-for-peak-of-2nd-covid-19-wave-amid-tightening-of-curbs-101620137837941.html

HT has learnt.“If you stop essential services you will create a panic-like situation and we will end up in more trouble. People should understand that essential services need to remain open and the movement of people who are involved in essential work should not be curtailed,” Sawant said. More than two dozen towns and villages in Goa have imposed their own ‘lockdowns’ asking all non-essential shops to remain shut and restricting the timings of essential shops. While imposing their own lockdowns with varying durations, the local bodies have also restricted the timings of stores selling essentials with most lockdowns allowing the essential shops to only remain open during the morning hours. Sawant also announced that non-essential shops, which were allowed to remain open between 7 am and 7 pm as part of the restrictions, would now also have to shut shop. Restaurants, too, that were previously allowed to operate with 50% seating capacity, will now not be allowed to host patrons within the premises and can remain open only for takeaways. “Additional Restrictions are being imposed on shops selling non-essential items till May 10 2021. Restaurants will cease to function, except their kitchens for home delivery of food items,” Sawant said. Goa is facing an acute shortage of oxygen beds as well as liquid medical oxygen. The Goa Medical College and Hospital, the state’s premier medical facility, has converted its examination blocks into covid facilities.

On Monday, it had registered 157 deaths and 9,798 new infections.Expressing deep concern over the "imminent loss of lives due to oxygen shortage" across the state, the CM said with mounting caseload, he was unable to increase level 2 and level 3 beds due to oxygen availability constraints.The state was facing the prospect of shortage of oxygen beds, he said in an official statement here.He pointed out that the government of India had expressed its inability to even allow Punjab's local industry to undertake commercial import of LMO from Pakistan through the Wagah-Attari border, which is geographically proximate.Further, despite assurance that “adequate supply would be ensured to us from alternate sources, I regret to point out that this has not happened", said Singh.The total allocation of LMO from outside the state is currently 195 metric tonne, of which 90 metric tonne is from Bokaro in eastern India.The balance 105 metric tonne comes from LMO facilities in Haryana, Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand.However, Punjab is not getting its daily allocated quota, said Singh.The existing backlog for Punjab from these LMO facilities is 5.6 metric tonne from Panipat (Haryana), 100 metric tonne from Selaqui, Dehradun (Uttarakhand) and 10 metric tonne from Roorkee, he added.He pointed out that Punjab had now been given to understand by the Centre that there would be likely disruption of LMO supply from Tuesday from Panipat and Barotiwala.The CM said this would cause great stress on the already limited oxygen availability in the state, thus causing a medical emergency, including risk of loss of life for the large number of patients who are in critical condition and on regular oxygen support.The disruption should be avoided, he said, adding that, if necessary, the state must be compensated immediately from a nearby additional source.Referring to the "shortage of tankers", the CM said the state was airlifting two empty tankers daily to Ranchi, with the filled tankers returning by road from Bokaro on a 48-50 hour journey.He said that the state government had already requested the government of India to allocate 20 additional tankers (conducive to rail travel) to allow for regular evacuation of 90 metric tonne LMO from Bokaro on a daily basis, but had been told that only two would be provided, and even those were yet to come.He urged the Prime Minister and the Home Minister to step in immediately to help resolve the crisis.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/covid19-punjab-cm-seeks-uninterrupted-supply-of-medical-oxygen-from-centre-101620135400081.html

In a letter to the Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, the state health department mentioned that various international agencies, including the Redcross, are assisting with the management of the Covid-19 pandemic in India in form of oxygen generation plants and concentrators, medical equipment and other medical consumables.Rajasthan is among the top five states with a high caseload of Covid-19 patients in the country. More than 16,000 Covid-19 patients are currently on oxygen, including ventilators, and the number is expected to grow rapidly in the coming weeks, the state informed the Centre. In its letter, the state said it is making all efforts to contain the spread of Covid-19 and for the provision of oxygen. Looking at the present trend, the oxygen demand is likely to shoot up. The state also demanded pulse oximeters, N95 masks, and PPE kits, among other essentials required to fight the virus. A senior official of health department said Rajasthan requires around 530 MT of oxygen daily, looking at the daily number of active cases, which is on constant rise, but what is available is around 265 metric tons. “The state has urged GoI to provide 5000 oxygen concentrators,” he added.The Union health ministry has approved the allocation of 6,853 Remedesivir injections vials to Rajasthan which was received in donation from the USAID, the official informed. Meanwhile, chief minister Ashok Gehlot has directed swift preparation of plans for setting up an oxygen plant in Rajasthan and the purchase of essential equipment such as oxygen concentrators. After the review meeting on Monday night, the CM directed the departments of health and medical education, industry, urban development, autonomous government and district administration to make coordinated efforts for setting up or setting up new oxygen plants and purchase of oxygen concentrators. The CM said that oxygen concentrators can prove useful in catering to the need for oxygen for Covid-19 patients in hospitals. They should be procured as soon as possible and co-operation of Indian embassies abroad should be taken for the import. It should also be ensured that there is no delay in reaching them due to shipping and other reasons. Gehlot directed officers to keep constant coordination with the officials of the companies concerned to get the supply of oxygen coming from Jamnagar and Bhiwadi to the hospitals as soon as possible. He said that on Monday, Union home minister Amit Shah assured the state to provide additional tankers for the lifting of liquid medical oxygen. State urban development minister Shanti Dhariwal said the possibilities of setting up oxygen plants are being explored in big cities of the state. At some places, land has also been identified for the purpose. In the coming days, work orders will be issued for setting up the plant in coordination with the concerned departments. Additional chief secretary, industries, Subodh Agrawal, informed that the process of importing the concentrator from China and Russia is being finalised. Discussions are also being held for procurement from some firms from Dubai and Mumbai. He informed that by the end of May, about 25,000 concentrators will be available in the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/amid-covid-19-crisis-rajasthan-demands-share-from-international-supplies-101620135377827.html

It also noted that though the Centre has submitted that the apex court has not directed supply of 700 MTs, a “complete reading” of the order shows that the Union government was directed to supply medical oxygen in the said quantity.The persual of the Supreme Court order, the bench said, shows that it has recorded the Delhi government’s statement that against the demand of 700 MTs, the manufacturers have been able to supply only 445 MTs of oxygen.Also Read | Delhi HC seeks info of patients admitted, discharged at hospitals since April 1 to review 'malpractice' allegations“Supreme Court also took note of the allocation in favour of Delhi which was 490 MTs, which is sufficient to show that it directed that the Delhi government should be given 700 MTs,” the high court said. Pointing to the Supreme Court taking note of the “heart rendering” situation in Delhi and assurance given by Solicitor General Tushar Mehta to meet the Delhi government’s demands, it rejected statements that “Delhi is not entitled to receive 700 MTs.”“It pains us that the aspect of supply of oxygen for the treatment of Covid-19 patients in Delhi should be viewed from the way it has been done by the Central government,” the court said.Several hospitals in Delhi have, in recent days, approached the Delhi high court complaining of shortage of medical oxygen; there have also been instances of patients losing their lives due to its shortage.

Moga deputy commissioner (DC) Sandeep Hans said the decision was taken to curb unnecessary movement of people amid rising infections. “People are roaming around the streets without any reason. For how long will we challan them? From now on, we will be taking stern action against the violators and sending them to open jails. Besides, people are already facing financial troubles. So, we have decided to detain them instead of collecting challans,” said the DC. The open jail has been set up under Section 144 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC) and The Epidemic Diseases Act 1897. It will remain functional until further orders. DSP City Barjinder Singh said, “We have cleaned and sanitised the open jail.

04-05-2021||Pune||Civic Sanskriti: Riverfront devp has more under-currents than free-flowing solutions||Over 250 individuals attended an online meeting last Sunday on the proposed Mula Mutha riverfront development project which had a presentation from a municipal official. Conducted very cordially by Sajag Nagrik Manch, the meeting provided information about the project, estimated to cost ₹2,619 crore. Participants highlighted several concerns they feel should be addressed by the city authorities. Fundamental questions raised at the Sajag meet were: “Who asked for this project?” “If your mother is ill, do you take her to the hospital or the beauty parlour?” “Why this massive expense for Pune’s citizens in Covid times?” Similar concerns have been expressed by a member of Parliament, and other citizens, in letters to the municipal commissioner last month. There is agreement with the riverfront project that the current state of the rivers is of concern, especially that untreated sewage is discharged into rivers. There is also agreement on removing debris and waste, and preventing future dumping. However, there are different views about what exactly are the other problems being addressed. Since there isn’t an agreement about the problems, there is certainly no agreement about the solutions. The project highlights flooding impacts on residences and business close to the river, and proposes construction of high walls and embankments for protection.But why were buildings permitted in flood prone areas in the first place. Now, a cheaper, less destructive solution may be to rehabilitate flood-affected households in other locations. Removing debris and roads in the riverbed would improve the river’s carrying capacity. However, constructing metro pillars in the river would again reduce it. NGOs have highlighted studies from IITM that indicate an increasing number of extreme rainfall events in the country due to climate change. They also draw attention to a report by TERI ‘Assessing Climate Change Vulnerability and Adaptation Strategies for Maharashtra’ prepared for the state government Environment Dept, which projects an increase in rainfall by 10 to 32.5% by 2030. We are already experiencing this in Pune. The NGOs point out that creation of walls and embankments along the river will further inhibit the drainage of flash flood waters, creating greater risk for people living along the streams draining into the rivers. Further, the project proposes commercialization of the flood plains of the river to raise funds, for conserving the river. However, if the river bed and flood plains are destroyed, what is left to be conserved.The cumulative impact of construction of metro pillars, pipelines and the changes in the concretized streams and paving in the surrounding landscape as well as the increasing frequency of extreme rainfall events need to be taken into account. The municipal corporation needs to address urban flooding at a cityscape and regional level, rather than through modifying the river channel and building walls. It is to the credit of the project consultants that springs have been mapped and would be integrated into the project design. On the other hand, the project includes beautification of the banks and laying cycling and jogging tracks. Beautification is proposed with creation of ‘rural riparian’ banks, but ecologists disagree. Dr Swati Gole, Ecological Society cautions that the construction of walls to contain floods, creation of artificial green spaces on the embankments and a continuous body of impounded water would completely destroy the river biodiversity. Rocky outcrops and natural banks are part of this valuable biodiversity. A study by the Ecological Society shows the different habitats along the river, the conservation concerns, and a different approach to river restoration. The report is available at https://tinyurl.com/ES-CEE-MMReportVisits to the river show direct dependence on the river ecosystem such as collection of medicinal plants, small patches of vegetable growing, sheep grazing, and fishing. Instead of formal green landscapes that displace some of the poorest citizens of Pune, the design could integrate such subsistence uses of the river ecosystem. In fact as early as the 80s, Shri Prakash Gole spoke about creating utility points for laundries and rickshaw washing and treatment of their wastewater using eco-friendly technologies like root zone beds. Public surveys and consultations were done to develop the proposals. However, now the full project proposals are available. Other project documents such as the metro line, scientific inputs on climate change, as well as the ecological study of the river are also now available. All of these need to be considered together. Now is the time for widespread deliberations on the proposals with multi-disciplinary scientists, especially ecologists, and the public. The municipal corporation should not be in a hurry to implement this large-scale project without such deliberation. The rivers are a defining feature of our city. The Mula Mutha and other rivers of Pune need protection, conservation and restoration, but construction and commercialization will be counter-productive and may increase risk. Let the experiences, concerns and knowledge from multiple minds inform the way forward, much like a river itself forms.Sanskriti Menon is senior programme director, Centre for Environment Education.

We have to be with the people at this time. They should be the voice of all people's pain and suffering. You need to know what is going on, but what government is doing to fight covid? "Nothing," he said.Shivakumar said that people of the state are feeling helpless."People are feeling helplessness. 24 people died in the oxygen disaster in Chamarajanagar and many are dying of Covid anxiety. When Rajanarajeshwari Nagar Medical College was in an oxygen shortage later MP DK Suresh intervened and appealed to the CM then oxygen was supplied," said Shivakumar."We will lose people if we are not conscious. Now politics is not important. Save everyone, and reassure the families of patients are safe," he added.He also mentioned that it is very sad that young people are dying more often."The state put the demand for oxygen at 1750 tonnes. The center has given 850 tonnes. The central government controls everything," said Shivakumar."Not just the resignation of the health minister, but this government must go, How 33 ministers did not go to the districts they are in charge of? Did Suresh Kumar embolden the family of the dead?

04-05-2021||Patna||‘We failed, went by govt’s false assurances’: Patna high court on Covid crisis||The Pata high court on Tuesday upbraided the Bihar government for its handling of the Covid crisis but did not pass any order after being told mid-way through the hearing that the state government has announced a lockdown till 15 May.“At least one order has been complied with,” the bench of Justices Chakradhari Sharan Singh and Mohit Kumar Shah observed after the state’s advocate general Lalit Kishore informed the judges about the government’s decision.The judges, however, made it clear that they would pass “appropriate orders” on Thursday. “The court will fail in its duty if necessary orders are not passed in the larger public interest to ensure the right of life to the people in the state,” the bench said as it wrapped up Tuesday’s hearing.The bench said it wasn’t issuing any directions today though the state government had failed to implement its previous directions and their implementation “remained on paper”.Like at the previous hearings, the bench was upset with the state government for not doing enough when the hearing started at 11 am on Tuesday and observed that the court could not go on waiting and put the lives of people at risk.“We have all failed. All of us feel ashamed for what we have done. Don’t make a joke of the proceedings. We cannot wait. We cannot play with the lives of the people, you may. It is an observation on us also that we have failed. This has happened only because we depended on the state officials and false assurances given by state officials,” the bench observed.When Bihar’s top law officer Lalit Kishore claimed the state government had taken effective steps, the bench promptly told him that he should not make a joke of the proceedings.When he referred to the state’s Rajendra Nagar Eye Hospital where 150 beds had been marked for Covid patients, the bench brushed it away saying this was nothing and reminded the state about its assurances.“You had spoken about 1,000 beds at the IGIMS (Indira Gandhi Institute of Medical Sciences) and 500 beds at the ESIC (Employees’ State Insurance) hospital, but it could not start. PMCH (Patna Medical College and Hospital) is in shambles, NMCH (Nalanda Medical College & Hospital) is struggling,” the bench said.“The orders we have passed from the first date when we first took the matter on April 15 speak for themselves. In our opinion, certain drastic measures need to be taken to tackle the situation in the state, which has already gone beyond control”.“According to you, the government has taken effective steps, but it has failed and therefore we have to pass orders. The fact remains that you could not manage beds in ICU,” the court said, asking what happened to the PSA plant (pressure swing absorption plant for oxygen) at PMCH and why it was not functional despite statements made earlier to the court.The court also raised doubts about the functioning of dedicated Covid health centres, saying most beds are vacant and there were no facilities there. The court also asked additional solicitor general KN Singh to seek instructions from the Centre in light of today’s proceedings and told Bihar to file a detailed affidavit on the progress made by the Bihar government in fighting the Covid crisis.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/we-feel-ashamed-high-court-rebukes-bihar-government-on-handling-covid-crisis-101620125657210.html

Their delivery date is currently not known.Centre also said that Punjab will get 50 out of the 150 oxygen concentrators donated by Taiwan. Taiwan also donated 500 oxygen cylinders, out of which Himachal has been allocated 185 and Uttrakhand 300.Himachal will also get additional 282 oxygen cylinders donated by Kuwait, as per the letter of Union ministry of health and family welfare.A state official said Haryana has also been allocated 113 Pulse oximeters [received from abroad?], which will be dispatched to All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) at Jhajjar.India has received thousands of tonnes of medical supplies including oxygen generation units, cylinders, concentrators, cryogenic tankers, separators, ventilators, face masks etc., from countries such as the United States, Russia, Germany, France, Italy, Romania, Belgium, Uzbekistan, the United Kingdom, Kuwait, Bahrain, UAE, Thailand, and Taiwan to name a few.The Haryana government officials said they will start allocating the medical equipment to different hospitals in order of priority once they receive it. Shortage of medical oxygen to treat Covid-19 patients has resulted into a big crisis in Haryana hospitals. The Central government had initially allocated 162MT of medical oxygen to the state at the beginning of the crisis last month, which had to be revised quickly to 257 MT last week; however, the state government has now reached out to Centre with the demand for 300 MT of life-saving gas to meet the ever expanding demand.The chief minister, Manohar Lal Khattar has been reviewing oxygen availability status with visits to each district hospital after many Covid patients recently died due to its short supply in private hospitals.The state government has also formed district-level teams of officials to monitor and ensure uninterrupted supply of oxygen in all hospitals, public or private.Meanwhile, state health minister Anil VIj on Tuesday made it mandatory for all hospitals in the state with 50 or more beds to have their own oxygen generation plant. He said the decision was taken after learning from the Covid-19 experience.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/haryana-punjab-himachal-uttrakhand-get-1st-instalment-of-supplies-from-abroad-101620120796942.html
04-05-2021||Delhi||'You may be blind, but we are not': HC slams Centre over deaths due to scant oxygen supply in Delhi||The Delhi high court on Tuesday asked the central government to divert the unutilised tankers of oxygen to Delhi from states like Maharashtra where the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) situation is improving."If the need for oxygen and tankers has depleted in Maharashtra, they could be diverted to Delhi. This is not a permanent arrangement. Whenever the need arises again, you can send them back," the Delhi high court said, acknowledging a suggestion from the amicus curiae.Additional solicitor general (ASG) Chetan Sharma assured the high court bench that the central government is already considering the possibility of diverting oxygen cylinders to Delhi from other states and that the same would be done.A bench of Justices Vipin Sanghi and Rekha Palli also came down heavily on the Centre over the shortage in oxygen supply in the national capital. The high court bench said that the Centre must ensure that oxygen reaches Delhi, according to the instructions issued by the Supreme Court earlier.The bench said that it would result in contempt of court the directives of the apex court are not met.Representing the Delhi government, advocate Rahul Mehra pointed out that although the Supreme Court had instructed 700MT of oxygen to reach the national capital, only 433 MT has reached till now. "People are dying," he noted.When additional solicitor general (ASG) Chetan Sharma, representing the central government, said in response that these are "rhetorical statements", the court hit back."Is it only a rhetorical statement? It's the reality. You may be blind, but we are not. We cannot shut our eyes. This is so insensitive and unfortunate. How can you make such a statement?" the bench said.The court also asked the central government to clarify how many oxygen suppliers there are in its empowered group to tackle the Covid-19 crisis. "What you are planning is all in the future. But our main concern is to ensure if it is being done in the most efficient way possible. If the suppliers are major stakeholders, they should be brought into the allocation plan" the court noted.The Delhi high court suggested that the government could also consider consulting help from experts at the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) and the Indian Institute of Management (IIM). "Whatever fleet you have, use it at the maximum potential," the bench noted.The court also asked the Centre about the request of the Delhi government seeking aid from the Indian Army to set up field hospitals."This has to be done fast. The nature of the request is such," the bench observed.When ASG Sharma said that the matter is being considered and logistical issues are being seen, Justice Palli said, "It has already been 48 hours since the request was made to you."The matter would be heard post-lunch.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/you-may-be-blind-but-we-are-not-hc-slams-centre-over-deaths-due-to-scant-oxygen-supply-in-delhi-101620117558840.html

This was essential to curtail the number of cases and to break the chain. Any lockdown creates a financial crisis for people, especially for the poor. It hits the daily wage workers particularly hard, following which it becomes difficult for them to run their homes,” he said.“Today, we have taken two major decisions. Firstly, free ration will be provided to the around 72 lakh ration card holders of Delhi for the next two months to help the poor wade through their financial crisis. Having said that, one should not assume that the lockdown will continue for the next two months. Let us hope that the cases begin to decrease and the lockdown is lifted early,” he said.Kejriwal said the second decision is to provide all registered autorickshaw and taxi drivers in the city as monetary aid of Rs.5,000 each.“All autorickshaw drivers and taxi drivers are seeing some tough times, as their homes would run on their daily wages. Some do not have much savings too, and with the lockdown of the past few weeks, their daily earnings have depleted completely. Just as last year, when the lockdown was imposed, all of Delhi’s auto and taxi drivers were given Rs.5,000 each by the Delhi government. Today, we’re extending the same financial assistance to all the auto and taxi drivers to help them during this financial adversity,” he said.The national capital has been locked down since April 20 due to an unforeseen surge in Covid-19 cases, and the curbs has been extended twice with cases continued to remain near or above the 20,000 mark.The lockdown, the chief minister said during the announcement on April 19, would help the state government bolster the city’s health care infrastructure, which has been under severe pressure due to the increase in infections requiring hospitalisation. Even after the curbs, hospital beds, medical oxygen and space at funeral homes have been hard to come by for residents of the Capital.The Delhi government on April 20 announced it will resume its scheme of giving Rs.5,000 financial aid to those registered with the Delhi building and other construction workers welfare board (DBOCWW).He also appealed to all political parties to unite and work together to help people as Delhi reels under a raging fourth wave of the Covid-19 pandemic.“We are undergoing a very difficult period and the second wave in the country has been extremely dangerous. There is so much sadness everywhere, people are troubled and are falling ill all across. It is my earnest request that this is the time to help each other, this is the time to become a good human being. Everyone, irrespective of the party they belong to, be it the BJP or the Congress or the Aam Aadmi Party, everyone should together help each other. This is not the time for politics, everyone should work together. Be it any religion or caste, this disease does not discriminate. Be it the rich or the poor, everyone should help each other,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/arvind-kejriwal-announces-free-rations-for-card-holders-aid-for-taxi-auto-drivers-in-delhi-101620119836812.html
04-05-2021||Delhi||#CampusCalling: College students turn Covid warriors||Driven to save lives, students of various colleges in Delhi have been working hard amid the second wave of Covid-19. Whether it is to verify and share leads for available hospital beds or oxygen cylinders, or donating money to support the patients financially, many college goers have turned into virtual soldiers in Delhi’s fight against the coronavirus. “I joined Miranda House Covid help desk that has been working to help others 24X7, and is open to students and others who want to volunteer for the same. Despite being Covid positive myself, I’ve been contributing to this initiative since I feel it’s my duty to do so at this time, when people need me the most,” says Vidyanshi Singh, a first year student of Miranda House, Delhi University. She adds, “Whenever we get any leads of beds, plasma or oxygen from social media, reliable websites, or any official sources provided by the government, we first verify the resources personally and then forward the contacts to those in need. My seniors and I have helped a lot of people including my batch mates, by providing them verified sources to avail ventilator beds, ICU, plasma, oxygen cylinders, medicines or any other Covid resources in not just Delhi but in cities across India including Lucknow, Kanpur and Hyderabad.” Alongside, some students are also organising food deliveries for the Covid impacted families. And above and beyond providing all tangible help, some are trying to bring in positivity to the lives of others, by counselling those who are struggling with anxiety and other mental health issues due to the present crisis. “I’ve always wanted to contribute to humanity in whatever way I could. So when the new wave of pandemic struck, I decided to provide people with verified information about medicines, oxygen cylinders, beds, and also helped in getting food delivered to the Covid infected families. And incase they feel they need someone to talk, I ensure that I’m always available! I listen to them, and try and uplift their spirits. No feeling is more exhilarating than saving lives,” says Anchal Singh, a second year student of Miranda House.“Losing my professor to Covid, since she couldn’t find a bed in any of the Delhi hospitals, propelled me to helping others. I wanted to make sure that no one else faces such a situation, and so I actively started helping people out as much as I could,” says Sugandhika Ghalyan, a second year student of Lakshmi Bai College. She informs how college students pan India have made groups on social media, to help Covid patients procure what they are looking for. “I’m the central councillor of my college, and many of my college mates who faced difficulties in getting beds, ambulances, plasma and other requirements have reached out to me in the recent past. I started helping them, and gradually with the assistance of my seniors, I connected with students from across the country to form pan India student Covid teams, to help residents suffering in our respective cities,” adds Ghalyan. Sanjay Kataria, a Master’s student at Department of Library and Information Science, has recently distributed food, masks and ration to the daily wage labourers around the campus who have been adversely impacted by Covid and the lockdown. He says, “This is the best time to step forward and help people who are suffering. I double masked myself, and went along with a fellow hosteller to distribute food to the underprivileged and daily wage labourers around the campus. A lot of them don’t even have the money to get tested for Covid, and are facing a hard time. We distributed masks and basic medicines to them. I’ve also been helping people get access to hospital beds, oxygen, and plasma through my network of friends who are health care professionals.”Author tweets @FizzyBuddhaFollow more stories on Facebook and Twitter||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/campuscalling-college-students-turn-covid-warriors-101620119005112.html

04-05-2021||Lucknow||Lucknow youth out to ring in ‘Badlav’ with timely help to Covid-patients||Members of a group called ‘Badlav –Ek Kadam Shiksha Ki Ore’ are helping Covid patients in home isolation in Lucknow with oxygen cylinders, free food and medicines, apart from ambulance service.Team Badlav said they have been coordinating with district authorities to ensure essentials like food, medicines and even oxygen supplies reach Covid patients under home isolation in areas such Alambagh, Charbagh, Ashiana, Krishna Nagar and Hussainganj.“It all began when Covid-19 infected father of a friend died recently. We were not able to arrange an oxygen cylinder for him. An ambulance came nearly 15 hours late. He died at home. From that moment, I decided to help all Covid-affected people,” Somnath Kashyap, leader of Team Badlav said.Lucknow is the worst Covid-hit district in Uttar Pradesh. The state capital reported 3,058 fresh Covid infections on Monday, followed by Gautam Buddha Nagar-1,446, Kanpur-1,311, Varanasi-1,022, Prayagraj-858 and Ghaziabad-598. Many patients are alleged to have died in hospitals across the state due to shortage of medical oxygen. At least three cases of patients’ relatives vandalising hospitals in Meerut and Agra were received recently.Somnath claims some good people in district administration helped them arrange six oxygen cylinders which were given to the needy following proper procedures. With many city residents coming out in their support, the group has now arranged two ambulances.“Two ambulances that we run, have taken nearly 150 patients to various city hospitals. We are supplying food to more than 500 people daily along with medicines to Covid and non-Covid patients, for free,” he said.Those helped by the group are full of gratitude. “My Husband Abhas Bajpai (45) was advised oxygen support as his oxygen level dipped to 90. Doctors prescribed him Medrol and oxygen support which I got from team Badlav. When I called them for help ,they collected my original prescription and arranged oxygen support without any charges, they also helped my family with food and other medicines,” said Shalini Bajpai, a resident of Kesri Khera near Krishna Nagar in Lucknow.Team Badlav ensures that it provides oxygen cylinders only against original prescription and Aadhar cards as per the instructions of the district authorities.At a time when news of Covid patients dying due to shortage of medical oxygen and medicines and their struggles to get beds in hospitals is spreading gloom and doom, the Badlav group’s positive intent has lit a spark of hope. Somnath says many city residents including doctors, advocates, professors, teachers, businessmen, traders, writers, intellectuals and policemen have begun to support the group in their noble cause.“We are helping team Badlav because of their honesty in serving Covid patients, that too at a time when sons are refusing to touch their fathers if they are found positive. These boys are providing them all sorts of help including installation of oxygen cylinders at the bed side of a patient,” said Tarun Kumar, director of Desire Career Point.Somnath said they have created a WhatsApp group Badlav Covid Helping, through which they receive requests for help. Last year too, these young men distributed food during the lockdown. “People have seen us help others in the past. That’s why this time we have got monetary support from everywhere to run our service,” said Akash Pal, another Team Badlav member, who mostly does night shifts.The group has more than 50 members including Shanu Pal, Virendra Saroj and Satish Gupta, who play prominent roles.Lucknow residents can reach Team Badlav on phone numbers- 7275999311 and 8953547346 for help.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/lucknow-youth-out-to-ring-in-badlav-with-timely-help-to-covidpatients-101620116836699.html

In the first instalment, 95 oxygen concentrators have been allocated to Haryana. Thirty-five oxygen concentrators of the 150 Taiwan has donated will reach the Haryana warehouse at Gurugram on Tuesday, top government officials said.

Himachal Pradesh will also get an additional 282 oxygen cylinders that Kuwait has donated, the letter of from the Union health ministry said. Haryana has also been allocated 113 pulse oximeters that will be despatched to AIIMS, Jhajjar. Haryana government officials said that they will start allocating the medical equipment soon after receiving it as the state has been grappling with the shortage of medical oxygen amid the surge in Covid-19 cases. Haryana seeks increase in oxygen quotaEven as the Centre has increased medical oxygen quota of Haryana to 257 MT, the Manohar Lal Khattar-led BJP-JJP coalition government has requested to increase this quota to 300MT. The oxygen quota of Haryana was increased from 162MT to 257MT last week. Khattar has been visiting every district to review the oxygen availability status in district hospitals after patients died of short supply of oxygen in private hospitals in Rewari, Hisar and Gurugram recently. The Haryana government has also formed teams of officers in all districts to monitor and ensure uninterrupted supply of oxygen in all hospitals, including private ones. State health minister Anil VIj on Tuesday directed that it will be mandatory for all hospitals with 50-bed capacity to have their own oxygen generation plant.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/haryana-to-get-95-oxygen-concentrators-donated-by-taiwan-kuwait-101620114441356.html
04-05-2021||Delhi||Amid Covid-19 crisis, Delhi CM announces free ration for card holders, relief of ₹5,000 cash for auto and taxi drivers||Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Tuesday announced free ration to all beneficiaries living in the national capital. Citing a figure of 72 lakhs, the chief minister said that they will receive ration free-of-cost for the next two months amid the raging Covid-19 pandemic."It doesn't mean that the lockdown will continue for 2 months. It is just being done to help the poor going through financial issues," said Kejriwal while making the announcement, as per new agency ANI.The Delhi government also extended the financial help of ₹5,000 to auto-rickshaw and taxi drivers who have been hit by lockdown imposed in the national capital since April 19.The announcement comes a day after Kejriwal held a Covid-19 review meeting with deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia, the chief secretary and the principal secretary of health.During the meeting, Kejriwal instructed authorities to strengthen the home isolation system so that patients can get good treatment with timely counselling and to keep in touch with patients undergoing treatment in home isolation.He said that a clear record should be kept of how many Covid-19 positive patients are going to the hospital and how many are being treated in home isolation.Delhi is reeling under the devastating fourth wave of Covid-19 which has pushed the already burdened healthcare system to a breaking point. Hospitals are inundated with patients leading to a shortage of beds, ventilators and oxygen cylinders. With the continuous rising numbers, there is almost a waiting of 7-days if a person is trying to get the Covid-19 test done at their home.Most pharmacies as well have run out of basic tools like oximeters which is a key thing for patients to monitor oxygen levels.The national capital on Monday reported as many as 18,043 new coronavirus cases and 448 deaths in the last 24 hours, Delhi's daily health bulletin informed.This is the highest single-day death toll in the city since the pandemic broke out last year. The total active cases in the city now stand at 89,592. The cumulative positive cases now stand at 12,12,989, including 11,05,983 recoveries and 17,414 deaths.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/amid-covid-19-crisis-delhi-cm-announces-free-ration-for-card-holders-relief-of-rs-5-000-cash-for-auto-and-taxi-drivers-101620113221518.html
04-05-2021||Patna||Bihar Congress slams Nitish Kumar government’s handling of Covid-19||The Congress party has accused the Bihar government led by chief minister Nitish Kumar of failure to manage the Covid-19 crisis, which has found the health infrastructure in the state crumbling under pressure with shortage of beds, medicines, oxygen support and trained manpower reported across the state.“The state government is unable to draw its quota of oxygen, allotted by the Centre, for want of storage facility. This often led to a serious crisis of oxygen for patients admitted in hospitals,” said Bihar Pradesh Congress Committee (BPCC) president Madan Mohan Jha.Chairman of BPCC media department, Rajesh Kumar Rathore alleged black marketing of oxygen cylinders and drugs like Remdesivir had gone beyond government’s control. “A 40-kg cylinder of oxygen is being sold at ₹50,000 to ₹1 lakh, as hospitals are grappling with oxygen shortage,” he said.Several hospitals in Bihar have reported shortage of oxygen and medicine such as Remdesivir over the past few days. Patna high court pulled up the state government on Monday saying it lacked expert advice, trained manpower, adequate oxygen and life saving drugs to deal with the second wave of the pandemic, which has left hundreds dead and thousands others scrambling for hospital beds in the state.A senior officer of the health department, pleading anonymity, said the state was able to get 120-135 MT of medical oxygen per day against the current requirement of nearly 250MT. “There is a serious problem in getting the centrally allocated quota of oxygen, as not a single hospital has cryogenic storage-- required for storing liquid medical oxygen,” he said.The centre has allocated 214MT of medical oxygen to Bihar every day, out of this, 34 MT is to be created from the Air Separation Units (ASU) in the state, he added.Covid patient Rita Dubey, who was admitted to the Nalanda Medical College Hospital (NMCH) in Patna in a serious condition, was prescribed Remdesivir injections, which retailers claimed to be out of stock. Her son Prashant Dubey claimed he was forced to buy two vials of the life-saving injection of 100mg potency for ₹56,000 from the black market. The drug carries MRP of ₹2,800 per unit.“Other crucial drugs like Doxy 100mg and Azithromycin 500 are also out of stock at medicine retail outlets. Subsequently, I had to pay double the cost of these medicines,” alleged Dubey.Health minister Mangal Pandey didn’t reply to questions over the alleged shortage of oxygen, oxygenated beds and common antibiotics.Criticising the state government over its alleged failures, BPCC president Madan Mohan Jha said a Covid task force made up of Bihar Pradesh Youth Congress (BPYC) members had helped over 250 Covid patients in accessing medical facilities in the month of April. BPYC officer bearers said they had arranged ICU beds for over three dozen Covid patients and distributed more than 100 oxygen cylinders in the past one month.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/bihar-congress-slams-nitish-kumar-government-s-handling-of-covid19-101620111376435.html

Yadav claims he was at the hospital to take “stock of the facilities” for treatment of Covid patients.The former MP was booked for “forcibly” visiting the Covid-19 wards at Magadh Medical College Hospital in Gaya and not wearing a personal protection equipment (PPE) kit during the rounds. The FIR adds that Yadav and his supporters didn’t listen to hospital staff and guards who were trying to stop them.Yadav and his supporters were booked at the city’s Medical police station under the Disaster Management Act 2005 and Section 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) after a complaint was filed by Dr P K Agarwal, the superintendent of Magadh Medical College Hospital, said Abhishek Singh, Gaya’s district magistrate (DM).Yadav said he has been visiting several hospitals across the state to help patients with admission and to check the status of oxygen supplies. Earlier on May 2, he was stopped outside Ara Sadar Hospital in Bhojpur district citing Section 144.“The condition of govt hospitals is very bad. There is no cleanliness in the Red Zone. Attendants are forced to sleep on the ground. What have Nitish Kumar and Mangal Pandey done for so many days?” Yadav said.He alleged that the state government was trying to hide its shortcomings. “Private hospitals are minting money as government hospitals have failed to provide quality treatment to the common man,” he said.Supporting Yadav's claims, a Patna resident said Yadav was at least visible in the midst of suffering people and was speaking for them, when no other politician was visible anywhere. "Hospitals are not admitting patients. Where will people go? Despite his own health issues, he is helping people he doesn’t know and who may never have voted for him,” said Surendra Prasad. Prasad said Yadav helped his patient get admission in a hospital.Another Patna resident, Kumari Manisha, whose relative is admitted in a private hospital in the city said, “I got Remdesivir from Yadav. The medicine is available in black market at a very high price, but the former MP gave it to me for free."Meanwhile, the district police chiefs across Bihar have been asked to ensure effective implementation of Covid-19 related restrictions.Bihar recorded 11,407 new Covid infections on Monday to go past the five lakh-mark. 82 fresh fatalities pushed the death toll to 2821 in the state, health department bulletin said.

04-05-2021||Mumbai||Adverse foreign court orders do not disentitle woman to minor kids’ custody: Bombay HC||The Bombay high court has rejected a Sri Lankan national’s plea saying his estranged wife has lost the right to retain custody of their minor children because of her “improper conduct” of keeping them in India in defiance of the order of a Sri Lanka court and refusing to accept its summons.The couple got married in March 2010 and lived in the US, where their first child was born in 2013. The second child was born in 2014 in India. The discord started after the couple shifted to Sri Lanka in 2015. The husband said the woman brought the children to India (Thane) on the basis of a district court order of October 3, 2017, ostensibly for two weeks, and did not return to Sri Lanka thereafter. He said the district court order was stayed by a Sri Lankan high court on October 10.Also Read | Pharma firms must supply Remdesivir vials to Maharashtra on time: Bombay HCThe Bombay high court said its focus, as per settled law, was on the best interest of the children. “We find the children appear to be comfortable with their mother in India. Their progress report appears to be satisfactory and merely because there are orders passed by a foreign court against their mother, according to us, that would not disentitle her from continuing with their custody.”The court rejected the petitioner’s emphasis on the question of the identity of the children as Sri Lankan nationals. It said the Supreme Court has held that factors such as citizenship of children pale into insignificance while determining what is in their best interest for the purpose of custody. “...the fact that children are Sri Lankan citizens, and the elder child is also an American citizen cannot be a deciding factor insofar as the relief sought in the petition is concerned.”The Bombay high court noted the two children have been admitted to a school in Thane. It added they “appeared to have developed roots” and have also become conversant with the local language and adjusted to the school.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/adverse-foreign-court-orders-do-not-disentitle-woman-to-minor-kids-custody-bombay-hc-101620104115682.html

Hence, it is being stopped with immediate effect,” the CMO stated in an order issued Monday evening.Ohri said the direction has been issued to prevent causing inconvenience to attendants of Covid-19 patients as the responsibility for oxygen arrangement has been fixed on private hospitals.“The attendants of Covid-19 patients are already in trouble and some hospitals have asked them to arrange oxygen cylinders for which they run pillar to post and stand in queues for hours. This cannot be allowed to happen. Now the hospitals will have to ensure availability of oxygen for patients and they can use their own staff to fetch cylinders if need be,” Ohri told PTI.Asked about the situation of oxygen availability in hospitals of Gautam Buddh Nagar, the CMO said, “Hospitals are being provided oxygen in adequate quantity and there is no need for panic. More patients are admitted to hospitals depending on the availability of resources in them.”Gautam Buddh Nagar is one of the worst-hit districts in Uttar Pradesh with 250 deaths linked to Covid-19 and 7,982 active cases while its overall infection tally stood at 45,792, according to officials figures on Monday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/private-hospitals-can-t-ask-attendants-to-arrange-oxygen-for-patients-noida-cmo-101620099783160.html

04-05-2021||Delhi||Biomedical waste generation at maximum as Covid-19 cases surge in Delhi||With the number of Covid-19 infections rising over the past several weeks, the city is facing a massive surge in biomedical waste.According to Biotic Waste Management, one of the largest common biomedical waste treatment facilities in Delhi, Covid-19 waste generated last July was around 7.2 tonnes per day, which increased to 12.5-13 tonnes per day by the end of April 2021.“We have a total capacity of 34 tons per day so while we have a margin, if cases keep increasing, then we will reach capacity,” said Vikas Gehlot, spokesperson for Biotic Waste Management, the common biomedical waste treatment (CBWT) facility which caters to north, north-east, south, southeast and New Delhi.“For the first time, there is a slight worry that we may reach capacity, but overall waste management is better than last year, mainly because of guidelines that have categorised biomedical waste and ensured that food and general waste is not coming to us,” said an office bearer of SMS Water Grace Pvt Limited, another CBWT.Data shared by the three municipal corporations shows that general biomedical waste collected spiked to around 3 tonnes in April, compared to only around 700kg collected in March.East Delhi Municipal Corporation collected 748.28kg of hazardous waste in April, compared to 170.8kg in March. The north civic body collected 2,776 kg of biomedical waste in April, out of which 959.1kg was collected between April 23 and April 30, when the cases began rising at a rapid and unprecedented rate.In south Delhi, too, between April 23 and April 30, biomedical waste collected was 291.7kg.Experts pointed out that the actual production of biomedical waste in the national capital is much higher than what is being collected by the civic agencies.Delhi has reported an average of 23,890 new Covid-19 cases everyday in the past week. On Monday, 18,043 new cases were recorded in the city, with a positivity rate dropping to 29.56%.“Unlike last year, the biomedical waste generation is not limited to hospitals and quarantine centres now. The cases are rising at such a fast pace that every household is now producing such waste, and much of it is not being disposed off in a safe manner. Trash from thousands of patients in home isolation is not even being collected separately as biomedical waste,” said Sunil Chhabra, solid waste management expert and volunteer with Save Our Planet, a citizens’ group working with waste collectors in Delhi-NCR.Sanjay Gahlot, president of Delhi Safai Karamchari Union, said that masks, gloves and other hazardous biomedical waste is carelessly strewn all around the city. “With the rising number of cases these days, these could become the reason for infections,” said Gahlot.East Delhi mayor Nirmal Jain, said waste is segregated at households. “The quantum of biomedical waste has increased but we are managing it safely,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/biomedical-waste-generation-at-maximum-as-covid-cases-surge-in-delhi-101620082193191.html
04-05-2021||Delhi||Arvind Kejriwal tells officials to strengthen monitoring of Covid-19 patients in home isolation||Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Monday asked state government officials to revive and strengthen the home isolation monitoring system for Covid-19 patients, and issued specific directions on mandatory phone calls by medical officers within 24 hours of a patient testing positive, providing pulse oximeters, and maintaining records.The review meeting was chaired by Kejriwal and attended by deputy CM Manish Sisodia, chief secretary Vijay Dev, and other senior officials.With the city adding more than 20,000 new Covid-19 cases every day for over two weeks, government officers in several districts said they were unable to contact people isolated at home. Officials, who asked not to be named, said that while district surveillance teams were earlier getting in touch with around 31 contacts of each infected person as part of the state’s contact tracing efforts, this has stopped completely because of the sheer number of cases in the city.“During the meeting, he [Kejriwal] directed that people being treated at home should receive a call from a doctor within 24 hours of being tested positive. He also directed that a clear record be kept of the number of Covid-19 patients going to the hospital and of those being treated at home. Kejriwal directed that patients in home isolation who do not have an oximeter should also be provided one, along with a Covid-19 kit,” the government said in a statement issued after the meeting.Kejriwal instructed officers present to pay special attention to home isolation patients who may need hospitalisation, the government said.Till Sunday evening, over 50,000 Covid patients in Delhi were being treated at home, according to government data||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/arvind-kejriwal-tells-officials-to-strengthen-monitoring-of-covid-19-patients-in-home-isolation-101620081214656.html
04-05-2021||Delhi||Alarm bells ring constantly in Delhi, with even officials scrambling for oxygen cylinders||Private hospitals in Delhi on Monday continued to post SOS messages on social media, raising alarm over oxygen supplies dipping precariously even as the state government maintained it has not been receiving its quota of 590 metric tonnes of oxygen.The Delhi government regulates the allocation to each hospital depending on the average supplies being received and the number of patients admitted to the hospitals. The actual supply that Delhi might receive is calculated on the basis of the supply projections by the companies.Delhi had received 448 MT of oxygen on Sunday, slightly lower than Saturday’s 454MT, according to a government official.“With so many patients on high oxygen support – today 39 patients were either on ventilator or high-flow oxygen – our daily requirement for oxygen has gone up to 1.2MT a day. The government had earlier allocated 0.9MT that has been almost halved to 0.49MT. How can we treat the same number of patients with such little oxygen?” asked Rajiv Biala, vice president, Institute of Brain and Spine in Lajpat Nagar that dipped into the last few cylinders. The hospitals asked patients to look to other facilities on Monday. He said, “We need at least 90 to 100 cylinders a day, we are somehow getting 50 to 60 after begging and borrowing from other hospitals. Our vehicles are stuck at refilling plants.”Around 2.30pm, attendants of patients admitted at IBS Hospital, Lajpat Nagar, tweeted that the hospital was running out of oxygen and the lives of people were in danger.Akash Hospital, Dwarka, also claimed it got inadequate supplies. “Today, we got a good supply of liquid oxygen but our vehicles are standing outside two to three stations to get the cylinders filled. And now the government has reduced our allocation by up to 30%,” said Dr Ashish Chaudhary, managing director of the hospital. The hospital had been allocated 4.7MT on April 29, which was increased to 5.1MT on May 1, and then reduced to 2.75MT on May 2.The hospital has been running at capacity and has added 40 makeshift beds in the parking lot and the driveway to cater to the rush of patients.The total allocation to Covid-19 hospitals by the Delhi government has reduced from 380MT on April 29 to 363.87 MT on May 2. This is largely because the quantity of oxygen promised to the government by the suppliers has reduced from 445MT to 425MT. The allocation to Covid-19 hospitals went up to 438.4 on May 1, when the suppliers promised 520MT to Delhi.“The government is not sure how much oxygen they will get and on a daily basis they keep increasing or decreasing the allocation... Patient care is suffering,” said Dr PK Bharadwaj, secretary, Delhi Voluntary Health Forum.He said, “If the oxygen situation is sorted, hospitals can increase the bed strength by a minimum 5,000.”Several hospitals including IBS hospitals and Batra hospital had to close admissions on Monday in view of limited stock.Smaller hospitals and nursing homes said being at the tail end of supplies, they were in a precarious situation.“The bigger hospitals, once they get the liquid oxygen, are okay for some time. We have to go queue up outside filling stations for hours; our vehicles just drop the oxygen and go back to the filling station. I need 220 cylinders, the quota was reduced to around 103 cylinders and I get only about 50 to 60 a day,” said Dr CM Bhagat from Bhagat Chandra hospital in Palam.The hospital raised as SOS on Monday night. “We have also asked our patients to arrange for oxygen and many have their own cylinders and concentrators. The problem occurs when they need high flow or ventilators,” he said.Deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia on Monday said the government was in touch with several entities to boost oxygen supply in the capital.“It is imperative we receive adequate oxygen and increase our capacity of beds. But we need intensive and immediate help to ensure proper oxygen supply in Delhi, and we are in touch with private entities, the social sector, and the Centre for the same,” Sisodia, who is also the nodal minister for Covid-19 management, said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/alarm-bells-ring-constantly-with-even-officials-scrambling-for-oxygen-cylinders-101620080163000.html
04-05-2021||Delhi||Fire rules order may cost Delhi 6000 Covid beds||Several small nursing homes in Delhi have started doing away with Covid-19 beds in their facilities on the second floor and above, with the health department enforcing a fire safety norm that is likely to end up costing the city around 6,000 Covid-19 beds, a union of health care providers said.“The keepers of all nursing homes, providing Covid-19 related treatments, who have not submitted NOC from fire department are hereby directed to carry out nursing home activities on the ground and first floors only,” the order dated April 30 read. The order, signed by state medical superintendent Dr RN Das, also warns nursing homes of action if any contravention comes to light.Health infrastructure in the city has been under immense pressure due to the surge of cases in the fourth wave, with hospital beds and medical oxygen extremely hard to come by.As on Monday night, only 1,353 of the 21,395 beds and 23 of the 5,147 ICU beds were vacant, showed government data.Experts have questioned the timing of this order.“Any hospital that has 50 beds or more cannot be restricted to just the ground and first floors. We have been in discussion with the government for nearly two years now on fire safety norms, which none of the small nursing homes can meet and should not need to meet as we are allowed in the residential areas as per the Master Plan for Delhi 2021. Now, this notice suddenly in the middle of the [Covid-19] peak is uncalled for,” said Dr Ajay Bedi, head of the nursing home cell of the Delhi Medical Association.Bedi said he is shutting 20 of the 40 beds in his nursing home that caters to Covid-19 patients.“This order directly means that more than 6,000 beds used in various nursing homes and private hospitals on the 2nd floor of the premises shall be made unavailable with the immediate effect and causes the collapsing medical facilities of the city to be undermined,” said a letter from the National Medical Forum.The 2019 norms make it mandatory for all two-storey buildings to get no-objection certificates (NOC) from the Delhi Fire Services(DFS).The norms also make it mandatory for institutes that are two-storeys tall or higher to have a six-metre-wide access road for fire tenders. Their corridors need to be at least 2.4 metres-wide, and their staircases two metres-wide staircases.There are 1,478 registered hospitals, nursing homes, maternity homes and health sub-centres in Delhi, data shows. Only 103 of these had a clearance certificate from the fire department in April 2019, according to a letter sent by DFS to the Director General of Health Services. Nursing homes’ registrations were renewed without inspections in 2020 due to Covid-19.“We are shutting down well-equipped and staffed beds and creating beds in makeshift facilities. How does this make sense?” said Dr Bedi.“This is not the time to look for compliance to such guidelines. With the current load of cases, hospitals are adding beds in the galleries, do you see the NABH [National Accreditation Board for Hospitals & Healthcare Providers] objecting to it?” said Girdhar Gyani, director general, Association of Healthcare Providers (India).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/fire-rules-order-may-cost-delhi-6000-covid-beds-101620079155520.html
04-05-2021||Chandigarh||Chandigarh’s Covid response fraught with lapses||Call it laxity, insensitivity, incompetence or short-sightedness, Chandigarh’s fight against the deadly second wave of Covid-19 is fraught with lapses and the administration’s response is failing on the focus points of testing and treatment.In fact, the hospital infrastructure that is being pushed to the extreme is crumbling, able to hold only 850 patients at present, even though the infection number is expected to hit more peaks.At a time when new cases are rising at a rapid pace, hospitals have started making provisions for adding new beds, mostly equipped with ventilators, which are the need of the hour.Deepak, whose 62-year-old mother was admitted at Government Multi-Specialty Hospital in Sector 16, was told to arrange for a ventilator when her oxygen level dropped to 60 on Monday evening.“I could not arrange it and she died. I cannot speak a word beyond it,” the Dadumajra resident said.Badnore satisfied with UT’s efforts: AdmnMeanwhile, the UT official statement on Monday said that administrator VP Singh Badnore was satisfied with the efforts made by UT, and directed that more ventilators and oxygen concentrators should be arranged for future needs.UT, however, has been able to mobilise only 126 ICU beds for Covid-19 patients, which are clearly not able to accommodate the rush of those requiring intensive care.Painting a rosy picture, the UT official release also stated that the administration had set up 100 beds at the Sector-48 hospital and 21 more oxygen beds were being added. At Government Medical College and Hospital in Sector 32, 155 beds were available, which had now been increased to 200 oxygen beds. At GMSH-16, with the addition of 48 more beds, the total capacity will increase to 248.Former vice-president of the Indian Medical Association Dr RS Bedi said, “We are not prepared on the scale we could have been after we witnessed the first wave. The last eight months, we could have created specialists to run more ICUs efficiently. But we were sleeping during that time.”‘No concrete plan to deal with crisis’Hospitals in the city have said that due to non-availability of a trained workforce, they were unable to expand ICU facilities. But there was no concrete plan on how to deal with the crisis, they have said.While the administration is turning to the Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER) for more beds, the institute has said that expanding Covid-19 services would hit routine health-care.UT adviser Manoj Parida said, “We have created enough infrastructure for Chandigarh residents keeping in mind the requirement. PGIMER should push their capacity as they have enough workforce. Every resource at administration-run hospitals is being utilised but that is not proving to be sufficient.”Our capacity is limited: PGIMER directorPGIMER director Dr Jagat Ram said, “Our beds have been increased from 50 to around 360, which are almost full; around 50 patients in the emergency block are yet to be adjusted. There is a limit to our capacity. If it comes to arranging more beds, our non-Covid services will be badly affected.”Meanwhile, issue of test reports from government-run facilities are experiencing considerable delays, with not more than 1,000 samples being processed in a day due to the involvement of private players in the process of sample collection by UT hospitals. Only now, GMCH-32 has placed an order for two new testing machines, while the work at Virus Research and Diagnostic Laboratory has been pushed.A city-based social activist, RK Garg, said, “A sample of a relative was given on April 29 and the report was delivered on May 3 and the patient had to stand in this summer for more than one hour at the civil hospital in Sector 45. This should be stopped immediately and reports should be delivered on the mobile within 24 hours.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarhs-covid-response-fraught-with-lapses-101620076575239.html
04-05-2021||Other||32 ventilators lying unused to be installed in Mohali hospitals||After Hindustan Times reported that 32 ventilators were gathering dust at the upcoming Dr BR Ambedkar State Institute of Medical Sciences, Mohali, for the last nine months, the district administration on Monday swung into action.Five ventilators will be installed at the civil hospital in Phase-6; 15 will be made available for the upcoming 104-bed makeshift Covid hospital; while 12 others will be installed at another 100-bed facility being created in the district with the support of the army.HT had reported that several parts of the state were reeling under an acute shortage of critical care facilities for Covid-19 patients and the number of active cases had crossed the 9,000 mark. Mohali is among the nine worst-hit districts of Punjab, where more than 22,000 Covid cases and 180 deaths have been reported since April 1.Deputy commissioner of Mohali, Girish Dayalan, said that all 32 ventilators will be made operational in about twenty days.‘We’re working on war footing’Dr Bhavneet Bharti, director principal of the upcoming Dr BR Ambedkar State Institute of Medical Sciences, said, “We are working on a war footing; appointment letters have been issued to the faculty to ensure human resources are in place while the faculty joins. Arrangements are being made for setting up an oxygen generation plant to ensure uninterrupted supply to the institute. We are well aware that the health facilities in the district are overwhelmed by the sudden surge in Covid cases. So we are trying our best to meet the manpower and the equipment challenges, and will hopefully get a go ahead as soon as the team of the National Medical Council conducts the inspection of the facility.”The ventilators were received nine months ago under PM Cares Fund, but the installation remained pending due to unavailability of an oxygen generation plant and paucity of technical manpower. The ventilators also needed some software up-gradation for which a technician from Bharat Electronics Limited (BHEL) had been contacted, said DC.On April 27, Hindustan Times had reported how eight ventilators, which the civil hospital in Phase-6 had bought around eight months ago, were lying unused due to a lack of infrastructure and staff to operate them. The next day, the hospital authorities had handed over the ventilators to two private hospitals in Mohali—Max and Fortis.Mohali has emerged as a medical tourism destination with 30 private hospitals, having top-class facilities, catering to patients from the region. These currently have 256 ICU beds, of which 240 were occupied as on Sunday. There are three major government-run civil hospitals in Phase-6, Kharar and Dera Bassi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/32-ventilators-lying-unused-to-be-installed-in-mohali-hospitals-101620076574268.html

The counting of past service has remained one of the most important issues at PU in recent years and it was also one of the main agendas during the last PUTA elections.However, as per the recommendations of the panel, the 52 teachers, whose cases are still in the pipeline, have to submit requisite documents to the varsity.“PUTA has been approached by several colleagues that a 15-day period is not sufficient for them to arrange all the documents especially under the prevailing situation. It is therefore requested that an extension of at least three months may be granted to enable them to do the needful,” reads the letter of PUTA submitted to the registrar.PUTA president Mritunjay Kumar said, “We are hopeful that the request will be accepted keeping in view the present situation.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/counting-of-past-service-panjab-university-teachers-seek-3-month-extension-for-document-submission-101620076572995.html

04-05-2021||Chandigarh||Chandigarh MC planning complete waste clearance at Dadumajara dump site||Even as the legacy mining project at the city’s oldest garbage dumping site in Dadumajra has got a deadline extension, the municipal corporation (MC) is now planning to start the removal of waste from the rest of the site.The MC will soon float a tender for the work and expects it to be financed through the Swachh Bharat Mission or Atal Mission For Rejuvenation And Urban Transformation (AMRUT). While there is 5 lakh metric tonnes (MT) of legacy waste to be removed, in the next planed phase, the MC plans to remove around one lakh MT of waste dumped on the site over the years.Speaking during the MC general House meet on Wednesday, municipal commissioner KK Yadav said, “We will clear the waste from the waste. For this, a tender will soon be floated. It will be financed through AMRUT or Swachh Bharat Mission funds, which the central governments allots.” The issue came up during the discussion on a new eight-acre sanitary waste site coming up in Dadumajra.It is learnt that the MC is considering the use of plasma technology to clear the waste and the timeline for the entire project can be four to five months.In the election year, the ruling BJP is trying to resolve the nixing issue of garbage dump site, which is a major electoral issue in south Chandigarh. Notably, the current legacy mining site has courted controversy, with major fires breaking out repeatedly at the project site.The legacy mining project which is being carried out at a cost of ₹33 crore, started in December 2019, was to be completed in 18 months. But, only 30% has been completed so far.The project ‘s deadline was revised in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic. Now, the firm has been directed to complete it by December this year. So far, 1.5 lakh MT of legacy waste has been removed, MC officials claim.On Thursday, mayor Ravi Kant Sharma and Yadav visited the garbage processing plant to take stock of the ongoing work, compost plant and progress of the legacy mining project. The mayor appreciated the enhancement of conveyer belts from three to five at the project site to mine the waste. He asked the officials concerned to complete the work within the deadline.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarh-mc-planning-complete-waste-clearance-at-dadumajara-dump-site-101620076514444.html
04-05-2021||Chandigarh||Panjab University governance reforms: Panel proposes no election for faculty deans’ appointment||The sub-committee constituted by the high-level committee, which has been formed to recommend governance reforms at Panjab University in light of the National Education Policy, has proposed that deans of various faculties of PU be appointed by the vice chancellor (V-C) from among the professors on seniority basis by rotation.Currently, they are appointed through election, from among the members of each faculty. The recommendations of the sub-committee were accepted by the high-level committee during its last meeting on April 19.Based on these suggestions, the recommendations of the panel and the comments of the Punjab government, the final report will be prepared by the committee and submitted to the office of the Vice-President of India, M Venkaiah Naidu, who is the chancellor of PU.According to the sub-committee’s proposal, there will be no bifurcation of major and minor faculty. It has also been proposed that the arts faculty be named as humanities and social sciences, faculty of languages as faculty of languages, culture and fine arts and faculty of engineering and technology as design, engineering and technology.The 11-member panel of experts was constituted by the chancellor in February, after the University Grants Commission (UGC) in November had informed PU to initiate governance reforms, as per provisions mentioned in the PU Act and regulations.As per a report submitted to the high-level committee, 35 stakeholders sought changes in appointment of faculty of deans and only nine said that the existing system should continue.According to the proposed composition of faculties, upto five people in each faculty will be nominated by the V-C from among the experts in the respective faculties.Punjab govt takes up matterAs nominees of the Punjab government to the high-level committee had sought time to take the views of the state government over the proposed changes, mainly regarding the substitution of ‘registered graduate constituency’ and the nominations by the chancellor of the university in senate, state government officials held a meeting last week.According to sources, the meeting was also attended by a few ex-senators. Sources who attended the meeting said, “During the meeting the constitution of the high-level committee was discussed. The committee has been constituted to look into the feasibility and give recommendations. They are not the final authority. Decisions have to be taken in consultation with the Punjab government.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/panjab-university-governance-reforms-panel-proposes-no-election-for-faculty-deans-appointment-101620076513281.html
04-05-2021||Chandigarh||3BHK flat in Sector 63 goes under hammer for ₹1.05 crore||A three-bedroom flat in Sector 63 fetched ₹1.05 crore against a reserve price of ₹86 lakh in the Chandigarh Housing Board (CHB) auction that concluded on Monday. Two other residential properties, also three-bedroom flats in Sector 63, went for more than ₹1 crore against a reserve price of ₹86 lakh. This was the first auction held by CHB in one-and-a-half years. Even though CHB could auction only 36 dwelling units out of the 109 built-up freehold properties up for auction, it bettered its previous auction performance. CHB’s last auction in December 2019 had turned out to be a damp squib due to lack of buyer response to its 212 properties, the blame for which was pinned on high reserve prices. The offerings included 64 residential units, of which nine were on leasehold and 55 on freehold. Most of these were located in Sector 63. This time around, the CHB has reduced the reserve price by 10% to make the properties more attractive to buyers. CHB earned ₹29.41 crore from the auction of 36 dwelling units. This was the first phase of the auction.Properties sold in Southern Sectors The CHB invited e-tenders for the sale of 109 built-up dwelling units on free-hold basis. The units were available in Sector-38 (West), Sector-49, Sector-51 and Sector-63. The deadline for submission of e-bids was 2pm, April 30, and the technical bids (first envelop) were opened on April 30 after 3pm. Single bid each was received for 12 dwelling units, two bids each for eight units, three bids each for seven units, four bids each for four dwelling units, six bids each for two dwelling units, eight bids each for two dwelling units and 12 bids for one dwelling unit. Realty sector looking up Even as the city gets battered by the second wave of Covid-19 infections, the CHB getting a positive response for its auction indicates that the real estate sector is showing an upward trend. Yashpal Garg, chief executive officer, CHB, said, “The e-tender was very successful and provided an opportunity to genuine buyers to have a residence in Chandigarh. We were neither expecting so many bids nor such high bids against the reserve prices. It will impact the real estate prices in those particular areas. Out of the 105 bidders, only 36 remained successful bagging the property they had set their eyes on. We will invite bids again for the remaining units.” Kamal Gupta, president, property consultant association, Chandigarh, said, “In the midst of the pandemic, CHB could sell properties at reasonable prices. This suggests the market is still strong. If CHB had rationalised prices and reduced these as per market conditions, the response may have been better.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/3bhk-flat-in-sector-63-goes-under-hammer-for-rs-1-05-crore-101620076453405.html

On Sunday, bodies of 20 Covid victims were cremated but the families of 13 victims were asked to wait till Monday. Again, on Monday, seven other families were asked to wait till Tuesday. As deaths started rising in April, the crematorium in Sector 73 had created a separate enclosure for Covid victims. Since April 1, as many as 186 persons have succumbed to the virus in the district. Narinder Pandey, the head priest of the crematorium says, “We had to ask seven families to wait till Tuesday to carry out the last rites of their loved ones. We are helpless. We can cremate only 20 bodies a day. Only four bodies are cremated in an electric crematorium in a day.” A resident of Sector 69, whose father died due to Covid-19 at a private hospital on Saturday, said, “We were already shattered by the death. Now, we have been asked to wait for another day for the cremation. Even the hospitals don’t hand over bodies to the family. They only give it to the nodal officer as per the protocol.” During the waiting period of over 24 hours, the mourning families have additional tasks—to arrange a 1 litre sanitiser and four PPE suits. Three PPE suits are for the crematorium staff and one is for the family member who is allowed to light the pyre. 90 quintals of wood used every day With 20 bodies being cremated every day, 90 quintals of wood are being used every day since April 1. For cremating one dead body, four quintals are used. Before April, only 24 quintals of wood were used. The cremation is done by three employees of the cremation ground and one member of the family. Mohali MC commissioner Kamal Kumar Garg said, “We have already made a special enclosure for the cremation of Covid victims. We have enough space. I will check, how there is a waiting period of one day.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/for-mourning-kin-of-covid-victims-it-s-a-painful-wait-for-last-rites-in-mohali-101620075612930.html

04-05-2021||Delhi||Vaccination of 18-44 year olds takes off in Capital||The Delhi government on Monday inoculated 37,562 people aged between 18 and 44 against Covid-19, widening the vaccination drive on the lines of the Centre’s decision to make all adults eligible for the jabs, even as states grappled to acquire more doses from manufacturers to ramp up immunisations.While the third phase of vaccinations was officially launched from May 1, Delhi began wider inoculations only on Monday as supplies ran low. While the Centre is sponsoring vaccinations for those above 45, it has said that the states and private hospitals will have to directly procure doses from manufacturers to cover those in the 18-44 age group.Delhi deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia said 301 centres have been established at 76 schools. “Mass vaccination for youth of Delhi has begun in Delhi… Our target is to establish 3,000 such centres in 300 schools, subject to the availability of vaccine,” he said in a tweet. Sisodia added that there was 100% turnout at the vaccination centres on Monday. An official said that all slots were booked for the next two days.More than 45,000 beneficiaries in this category can get jabs at the 300 centres in a day, according to the government.“I am glad that the vaccine process for 18+ has started smoothly. It’s heartening to see that youngsters are coming out in large nos to get vaccinated. Get your elders vaccinated too. Encourage ur friends and relatives also to get vaccinated,” chief minister Arvind Kejriwal tweeted.Around 9.2 million people in India are eligible for the jabs in the 18-44 age group.Sisodia said the Delhi government has received 450,000 vaccine doses so far for the third phase. “We want to ensure that all citizens between the ages of 18-45 are vaccinated, and are committed to scaling up vaccination centres in Delhi in a way that each school has 10 vaccination centres,” he said during his visit to a school to inspect the drive.India has two Covid-19 vaccine manufacturers active at the moment, and both of them put together produce about 80 million doses a month. The two manufacturers are Serum Institute of India (SII), which is locally manufacturing Oxford University-AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine under the brand name Covishield, and Bharat Biotech, which is producing Covaxin.As per SII chief executive officer Adar Poonawalla, the company has a production capacity of about 60-70 million Covishield doses per month. Bharat Biotech currently produces about 10 million doses of Covaxin in a month.On Monday, 250 people per centre were called in for the vaccination drive, with 100% turnout, Sisodia said. “I am confident this turnout will prevail because the youth is looking forward to get the Covid-19 vaccine. I met several people who informed me that while they faced no hindrances in getting vaccinated at the centres; there were challenges with regard to booking appointments. This is so because we only have 450,000 vaccines at the moment with limited centres, but we will resolve these challenges as we continue to expand our centres,” he said.Sisodia, who is also Delhi’s nodal minister for managing the Covid-19 situation, said the Delhi government was in constant touch with companies and will continue to receive more doses.Delhi labour minister Gopal Rai said the Delhi government aimed to allocate at least one school in each of the 274 wards of Delhi.The Centre has made it clear that free vaccine doses are meant only for those above the age of 45, who are seen to be more at risk of severe disease or death with Covid-19. Vaccine makers will need to supply in a 50-50 ratio, with half going to the Centre, which will pass it on to states for the 45-plus vaccination in a formula it is yet to announce, and the rest directly to states and private hospitals.The government has set up the vaccination centres in schools to accommodate the large number of beneficiaries in this phase, an official told PTI.Before the current phase, vaccines were being given to those aged above 45 at about 500 centres in the national capital.Around 60,000 people aged above 45 can be inoculated in the Capital every day, the official quoted above said. Pre-registration is mandatory for vaccination in the 18-44 age group, and there are no walk-ins under this category for now, the official added.While Delhi’s Max Hospital started vaccinating people in the 18-44 age group at limited centres from Saturday, Fortis Healthcare began the exercise on Sunday.The Delhi government has placed orders for 13.4 million vaccine doses, which will be delivered over the next three months. Of these, 6.7 million doses are of Covishield vaccine, which are being procured from the Pune-based Serum Institute of India, the official said.Kejriwal last Thursday said that a plan has been formulated to vaccinate all adults against Covid-19 within the next three months. He had then said that everybody aged above 18 would be administered Covid-19 vaccines free of cost in Delhi.Experts said it is imperative for the vaccine drive to cover as much ground as quickly as possible.“The vaccination drive was announced for people over the age of 18 years from May 1 without ensuring availability of doses. No one is able to procure Covishield, which is what we have been administering...,” said Dr PK Bharadwaj, secretary, Delhi Voluntary Hospitals Forum and the chief executive director of Saroj Hospital.Dr Narin Sehgal, Delhi secretary of Association of Healthcare Providers (India), said, “There is no clarity from the Delhi government on whether the private centres will receive any doses from them; they have started the drive today. Only a few private hospitals have started the immunisation drive with doses that they have procured themselves.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/vaccination-of-18-44-year-olds-takes-off-in-capital-101620073625676.html

In a statement, AAP state unit president Bhagwant Mann said the party will extend all possible cooperation to the state government. “In view of the impact of the Covid pandemic, the state government appears to be preparing for a complete lockdown in the state but the question is whether it has found a solution to the problems faced by the people during lockdown,” he said. He said that the businesses of the people will be shut down during the lockdown and the employees of factories and companies as well as construction workers will lose their jobs. “This will make it difficult for the needy and poor to support their families,” he said, demanding that the state government should make arrangements to ensure that no family goes hungry. Demanding financial assistance for labourers and poor, Mann said that just as the Arvind Kejriwal government in Delhi has provided assistance of ₹5,000 to poor labourers, taxi and auto drivers, the Punjab government should do the same.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/extend-help-to-poor-before-imposing-lockdown-aap-to-cm-101620073332226.html

Of a total of 450 oxygen cylinders in the district, the administration has been able to collect only 150. The authorities had directed the suppliers to deposit all the cylinders and centralised the supply of oxygen through a single vendor. Officials said they were also getting oxygen supply from Mandi Gobindgarh-based plants but did not have enough empty cylinders for refilling. They could arrange an extra 0.5 metric tonne (MT) if they get the 300 cylinders, an official said.As of now, the district is getting 2 MT oxygen against the daily consumption of 2.23 MT at government and private hospitals for Covid and non-Covid patients. Moga sub-divisional magistrate (SDM) Satwant Singh, who has been tasked with monitoring oxygen supply in the district, said, “We have information that private dealers and individuals have hoarded 300 cylinders. While some have hoarded these cylinders for black marketing, others have done so due to panic in wake of scarcity of medical supplies.”“If we trace these cylinders, we can get maximum supply of oxygen from plants in Mandi Gobindgarh. We may take legal action against hoarding of cylinders. We just want to save lives in this medical emergency,” said SDM. Moga deputy commissioner Sandeep Hans said, “We are regulating the oxygen supply by centralising it through one vendor. The purpose of this is to stop hoarding and black marketing of oxygen and to ensure it is supplied to the patients in need.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/300-oxygen-cylinders-missing-in-moga-district-101620072974457.html

Two large processions of tractor-trailers are scheduled to leave for Delhi from Beas town of Amritsar district and Harike Pattan village of Tarn Taran district on May 5 and May 20. On Monday, the committee leaders held meetings with farmers of various villages of Amritsar Kathunangal block. “We admit that there is coronavirus, but an exaggerated scare is being created around it. As per the government figures, the death rate of the virus is 1.11% which is very low. The death rate of tuberculosis is 7%,” said Sarwan Pandher, general secretary of KMSC, which has a considerable base in Majha. “The repeal of the three laws is more important for the farmers. These laws are a direct attack on our livelihoods. People may survive the coronavirus but how will the farmers be saved from the three laws. Our fight against the anti-farmer laws will continue as it is a do-or-die battle for us. We will move in thousands to the national capital,” he added.KMSC’s Tarn Taran president Sukhwinder Singh Sabhran on Monday held a meeting of farmers of various villages in Tarn Taran’s Bhikhiwind sub-division. In the meeting, social distancing norms were hardly followed and no one was seen wearing face masks.“We will take more than 500 tractors from Tarn Taran alone on May 20. Where was the coronavirus when huge rallies were organised by the BJP and other political parties in the election-bound states? The administration can lodge FIRs against us but we are not bothered about it,” said Sabhran.Amritsar senior superintendent of police (rural) Dhruv Dahiya said he was not aware of the farmers’ march on May 5. “Nobody will be allowed to flout the rules,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/farm-union-in-punjab-gears-up-for-delhi-march-amid-second-covid-wave-101620072973520.html

The committee comprising deputy director (local bodies) Rajat Oberoi and Amritsar civil surgeon Dr Charanjit Singh has been saying that some of the families have not turned up to record their statements. Three of the victims were from Amritsar, two from Gurdaspur and one was from Tarn Taran district. “We had called their families to record their statement but only three families reported to us. We have given last opportunity to the rest of the families to come on Tuesday, or we will conclude our findings without their statements,” said Rajat Oberoi. The management of Neelkanth Hospital had blamed the district administration for the incident, saying they had intimated the officials about the shortage of oxygen a day before the incident. Punjab chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh had directed the Amritsar deputy commissioner to constitute the inquiry panel. The civil surgeon had claimed that the hospital was authorised to admit only level-2 Covid-19 patients but it allowed even critical level-3 patients without informing the health department. Also, the hospital didn’t have any senior doctor on night duty in the intensive care unit (ICU), he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/probe-into-amritsar-hospital-deaths-delayed-as-panel-yet-to-record-statements-of-victims-kin-101620072972082.html

A case of abetment of suicide was registered against sub-inspector Karamjeet Singh, the SHO. The ASI, a resident of Jaimal Wala village in the district, was deployed at the police post nearly six month ago. Minutes before ending his life, he called his son and sent him a suicide note over phone. In the note, he alleged that the SHO was pressurising him to demand ₹50,000 from an accused in a 6-year-old case of brawl case on the pretext of reopening the investigation. The ASI refused to accept this but the SHO asked him to either demand it from the accused or pay from his own pocket, it was alleged. “I told the SHO that I do not take bribes. But he used to call me to his office and harass me. Therefore, I am going to kill myself,” the purported suicide letter reads. Talking to mediapersons, the victim’s son said, “The SHO had been harassing my father for the last 10 days. He called me around 6am saying he was going to commit suicide as SHO Karamjeet Singh was demanding ₹50,000 from him. I immediately reached the police post only to find that he was taken to a hospital where he died.”Superintendent of police (headquarters) Gurdeep Singh said, “A case under section 306 (abetment of suicide) of the Indian Penal Code has been registered against Karamjeet on the complaint of the victim’s wife. The accused has not been arrested yet.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/asi-shoots-self-dead-in-moga-sho-booked-for-abetting-suicide-101620072912111.html
04-05-2021||Other||New Covid-19 variant highly infectious; R0 up to 3: TIFR-IISc model||The new variant of the Covid-19 virus prevalent in the second wave is likely to be almost two to two-and-a-half times more infectious than the previous variant according to a statistical model by Tata Institute of Fundamental Research (TIFR), Mumbai, and Indian Institute of Science (IISc), Bangalore.Allowing the virus to be two to two-and-a-half times more infectious than the virus strain seen last year best explains the observed Covid-related fatalities in Mumbai between February and April this year, finds the model.This was revealed in the latest report released on Monday. A simulation model, developed last year by scientists from the two institutes, projects that the R naught (R0) or reproduction number of the virus has increased from two-two-and-a-half times to over three under the new variants in the non-slum regions, where the second wave was more severe.R0 denotes the expected number of individuals a single person exposed to the virus infects in a city where everyone else is susceptible. This means, a person infected with the new strain of the virus is likely to infect over three people they come in contact with.“The increased R0 is an indicator that the new variant of the virus is much more infectious. This is in line with the rapid spread of the virus in the second wave and more number of people getting infected,” said coordinator of the simulation project at TIFR Sandeep Juneja, who is the dean of the institute’s school of technology and computer science.The R0 for the overall city (slums and non-slum areas) is likely to be three-and-a-half to four-and-a-half. The R0 is higher in slums owing to a higher population density.“However, as the current infections in the city are largely in non-slums or high rises, the increase in R0 from non-slums is a better measure of the impact of more infective variants to the city,” said Juneja.The model which makes this prediction mimics a city with a population of 13 million. It takes into consideration different population demographics, densities, household sizes, city movement restrictions and interaction of people with each other. The initial parameters that were chosen were such that the death rates matched the actual observations in last April. The simulations that arose from the parameters chosen were done for various scenarios such as population compliance, lockdowns and other restrictions, role of local trains, vaccinations.Murad Banaji, senior lecturer in mathematics, department of design engineering and maths at the Middlesex University, London, who has been studying the epidemic in Mumbai, agreed that the mutant circulating in the city was more transmissible.“The epidemiological evidence, the speed of spread in particular, does point to whatever variants are circulating in the city being more transmissible and/or more able to infect people who have previously been infected. The spread has been wider than we would expect, and this has undoubtedly resulted in more fatalities. On the other hand, I have not seen evidence that whatever variants are circulating in Mumbai are more lethal (causing more severe disease in those infected). Overall, I think we can be fairly confident that new variants have played a role in Mumbai’s latest wave, causing increased spread and hence fatalities; but I don’t feel I’ll be able to put numbers on this,” he said.Lancelot Pinto, a city-based pulmonary specialist, said that the current variants of the virus appear to be more transmissible. “Epidemiologists have been maintaining that the new variant is more infectious. While earlier one in five people in a family in close contact would contract the disease, now we seldom see that. Now, almost all members of the family test positive for the virus. On the ground, in our experience, it does appear that the variant at play now is more infectious. We are also seeing a rise in the close contact transmission rate,” said Pinto. However, with the number of cases now dropping, the current reproduction number (Rt), which is an indicator of the infectiousness of the virus at a given point in time, is likely to have reduced.“Looking at the drop in cases, one can assume that the Rt in Mumbai could be less than 1, although our model doesn’t calculate Rt,” said Juneja.If Rt is below 1, an infected person infects one or less than one person on an average.In yet another measure of the infectiousness and severity of the new strain of the virus, the TIFR-IISc model projects that the variant is likely to cause 1,500-2,500 additional deaths by September. The scientists arrive at this after plotting estimated fatalities for various scenarios, such as 2.5% of infected people infected with infectious strain on February 1 (two to two-and-a-half times more infectious), with lockdown from April 15-May 15 and with vaccination effectiveness of 0.75. This was plotted against a scenario without infectious strain and without lockdown. Irrespective of the scenarios, the model predicts that the city may record a few thousand new infections each day in September, which correspond to a few hundred reported cases daily. “This is taking into account that there are no new variant or significant reinfections, which could substantially increase the number of cases,” Juneja said.Vaccine effectivenessThe analysis by the TIFR-IISc model as well as by Banaji point to the effectiveness of the vaccination drive in saving the lives of the elderly.According to Banaji, as on April 25, up to 580 lives could already have been saved by the vaccination drive focussed on the elderly. “We have to remember that the estimate of 580 fewer fatalities is based on what we would expect to see if the elderly had continued to form 80% of the city’s fatalities, as was true from the start of the year to the end of March. But it is also roughly consistent with the drop in the delayed case fatality rate in the city. So we definitely have seen fewer recorded fatalities during April than expected based on the epidemic’s path up to the end of March,” said Banaji.In the TIFR-IISc model, the reduction in fatality numbers due to the senior citizens vaccinated in March will start to show up around May. “If vaccination continues at a rapid pace, say more than 50,000 new persons daily, then by July it leads to significant reduction in fatalities, so much so that one can hope to return to fatalities near single digits by the end of June or early July. There are caveats. We don’t understand how infectious, virulent, and prevalent the variants of SARS-CoV-2 virus are. There may also be immune escape by a virus mutation that makes antibodies produced by an earlier infection or a vaccine shot ineffective,” said Juneja.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/new-covid-19-variant-2-5-more-infectious-than-last-year-s-strain-tifr-iisc-model-101620072551512.html

The sudden change in weather has destroyed acres of crops in Alaychi Wadi, Merdi, Modhalwadi, Kelewadi, Valhivare, Dharrkhid and Bandeshet villages. The hailstones have also damaged many of the houses that did not have sturdy rooftops, and impacted the glass windows too. The unexpected change in weather has also changed the façade of the village, making it looks like an ice-covered hill station. “The hailstones fell heavily on the roofs and windows of our houses. Though it was very cloudy for the past few days, we did not expect such a drastic change in weather. All the vegetables that were yet to be harvested have been destroyed and this has greatly affected us farmers,” said Jaideep Pavshe, 42, a resident of Merdi village. The tribals who practice summer farming have been the most affected. Many villagers are asking for compensation as the farms and crops have been destroyed.Murbad taluka’s tehsildar Amol Kadam said, “We have reached out to the villagers and are providing them support, especially to those whose houses have been damaged. We shall talk to the collector and decide if further support can be provided. These seven villages are within Thane District but are situated closer to Malshej Ghat. Around 150 houses were damaged, with some of the roofs having ripped apart completely. We are still assessing the damage to crops and other problems faced by the villagers.”Murbad taluka has a population of around 22,000.Amid the destruction, children in these villages were excited as they enjoyed playing with the layers of ice.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/hailstones-destroy-homes-crops-in-thane-district-s-murbad-101620072371495.html

Besides them, political parties too have set up parallel systems to help Covid-19 patients. Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leaders have set up jumbo Covid-19 centres in cities such as Nagpur, Pune and Mumbai, facilitated the procurement of oxygen and Remdesivir injections, donated ambulances and put up vaccination centres in various cities.For Yuva Sena functionary Rahul Kanal, throughout April, the day started at 8am and ended at 4am the next day, as he was flooded with requests for arranging hospital beds, Remdesivir or oxygen cylinders for Covid-19 patients in Mumbai. Kanal said that everyday, they would get around 1,000 requests from people. “Now as the cases in Mumbai have come down, the requests have reduced. But we still get tagged for Remdesivir and ambulances. Smaller hospitals have issues in getting Remdesivir; those admitted to civic-run facilities do not have to run around for the drug. We guide people to collector’s office and (FDA Food and Drug Administration) to get the injections.” Kanal added that Yuva Sena has been feeding stray dogs and cats too. “With the lockdown imposed, the strays do not get food. We distribute dog and cat food packets to non-governmental organisation (NGO), which take them to different areas of the city,” he said. AAP’s national joint secretary Ruben Mascarenhas said he was being tagged for aid on social media. He later decided to set up a helpline with party members and volunteers, as it would not have been possible to help everybody, considering the volume. “I woke up with about 1,000 requests on social media accounts, which has now come down to about 500, as the cases have reduced. Later, we set up a helpline to keep things organised. We have had 12,000 calls in the past three-four weeks, of which we have helped 40% of the callers. Typically, there are five requests — Remdesivir, oxygen, hospital beds, ambulance and plasma,” he said.Congress legislator from Bandra (East) Zeeshan Siddique said that he was responding to requests from the hospital bed, as he was admitted for Covid-19 for 15 days. “I had nothing much to do apart from resting. So I used to divert all the requests I got on Twitter and Instagram DMs (direct messages) to the team,” he said. Siddique, the state’s youngest legislator, had set up a helpline last year. “In 2020, we used to get requests, but not as many as these. The second wave has hit hard. In the past one-and-a-half months, the resources have been exhausted,” he said, adding that his social media feed and helpline buzzed the most at night, with requests for ICU (intensive care unit) and ventilator beds.Even though, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) and the state government have streamlined the allotment of hospital beds and distribution of Remdesivir, Siddique and Mascarenhas said they have to follow up with officials for immediate allotment. “We guide people to BMC war room but again get calls that even after a few hours, the bed has not been allotted,” Mascarenhas said.The young politicians that are getting tagged for requests are collaborating with each other. “I tag leaders like (Shiv Sena parliamentarian) Priyanka Chaturvedi, Kanal, Siddique, Jiten Gajaria from BJP in my posts. The idea is to get people help in the least possible time,” Mascarenhas said. “Right now humanity comes first. Nobody should think twice in seeking help from someone from another party. Ruben, Priyanka Chaturvedi, etc… we are all helping each other to save lives at the moment,” Siddique said.BJP’s top leaders, including Union minister Nitin Gadkari, leader of Opposition Devendra Fadnavis and state unit chief Chandrakant Patil have put in their efforts in helping strength of the health infrastructure. The party facilitated setting up of three 100-bed Covid-19 hospitals each at Nagpur’s National Cancer Institute, Nelson Hospital and KT Nagar. They also set up a Covid care centre at Koldongari in Andheri, among others, and procured 78 metric tonnes of oxygen for Nagpur from a private company. BJP’s attempt to procure the stock of 60,000 vials of Remdesivir from a Daman-based pharma company had mired in controversy after the company’s director was summoned by Mumbai Police for questioning over stockpiling suspicions. Similar controversy erupted after Radhakrishna Vikhe Patil, BJP parliamentarian from Ahmednagar, had procured Remdesivir vials directly and distributed them in his constituency. The Aurangabad bench of the Bombay high court has slammed him for his “surreptitious and illegal” procurement using a chartered flight. The court has ordered the police for action. Vikhe-Patil said that he did so to save lives and was ready to face action.Meanwhile, the state Congress unit will donate ₹2 crore to chief minister’s (CM) relief fund to facilitate the expenses for vaccination of citizens in Maharashtra free of cost. Congress legislative party chief and revenue minister Balasaheb Thorat announced that 53 party legislators from both the houses will donate their one-month salary to the fund. He also announced that he would donate his one-year salary and the amount for vaccinating 5,000 employees in the group of companies he heads to the fund.The party has also asked all its workers till gram panchayat level to adopt families in their villages for vaccination. “Party leaders and workers will donate the expenditure of vaccination of their family as well as of those adopted by them to the CM’s relief fund. The workers will also ensure that the families adopted are taken to the vaccine facilities, monitored for side-effect and for their second doses. This will help us expedite the drive and complete it in due time,” said Maharashtra Congress chief Nana Patole.Another Congress leader said that six executive presidents, district in-charge leaders, district presidents, tehsil presidents have been given responsibility to monitor the drive in villages. “Workers who are not in a position to pay for vaccine doses will help in taking beneficiaries to the centres and ensuring that they get their shots in time. The donation towards the vaccination shots is to be deposited to tehsildars at tehsil level,” the leader said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/covid19-wave-political-party-workers-take-the-lead-on-ground-101620072191464.html
04-05-2021||Other||Political row over Adar Poonawalla’s claims||Serum Institute of India (SII) chief Adar Poonawalla claim that he had received “aggressive demands” from some “powerful people” of the country for vaccines has turned into a political slugfest between the ruling Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) and Opposition Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).The MVA has asked Poonawalla to disclose the names, while BJP said they have information on who threatened the SII chief, but will disclose the names at an “appropriate” time.Maharashtra minister of state for home Shambhuraj Desai, who is a Shiv Sena leader, said, “If someone is threatening Poonawalla, he can file a written complaint with the police department. We will probe the matter.” Maharashtra Congress chief Nana Patole in his media interaction appealed to Poonawalla to disclose the names of the “influential” people who threatened him and promised security. “It is beyond logic to understand why Poonawalla has been provided Y-category security by the central government without any request or proven threat perception. It needs to be checked if the security had been provided to keep a watch on the industrialist. Both Poonawalla and the central government need to clarify on this issue,” said Patole. In an interview with British newspaper The Times, Poonawalla who heads Pune-based SII, talked about receiving “aggressive calls from some of the most powerful people in India”, demanding the supply of vaccines. He said that the level of expectation and aggression was “unprecedented”. Currently, Poonawalla is in London to be with his wife and children.The state BJP also jumped into the controversy, with leader Ashish Shelar claiming that he knew the people threatening Poonawalla. “Various names are cropping up in the case related to the threats to SII’s Adar Poonawalla. If the links are connected to the local party, then it needs to be taken very seriously. We have specific information about it and BJP will expose them. The people who are involved should be ready to face consequences,” warned Shelar.A news channel had claimed that Shiv Sena workers were threatening Poonawalla for vaccines. Industries minister Subhash Desai wrote a strong-worded letter to the channel, objecting to it defaming the party. The channel anchor expressed regret later, calling it “mixing of identities”. But Sena has demanded an apology on prime time show over the allegation.The name of farmer leader Raju Shetti has also cropped up in this matter. Shetti has warned that he would not allow vaccine trucks to leave the state till Maharashtra gets its “rightful share” of the doses. “I have never called Poonawalla and had warned central government that I will not allow discrimination to Maharashtra. The state has the highest number of Covid-19 cases and the [SII’s Covishield] vaccine is produced here. Hence, we are entitled for a larger quota,” said Shetti.Meanwhile, NCP slammed Poonawalla over the vaccine prices. “He [Poonawalla] sold vaccines at ₹150 per dose to the Centre and at ₹400 per dose for the states. When people started questioning him, he reduced the price by ₹100. All this has created suspicion [over profit making] about him. No one is trying to defame him,” NCP’s chief spokesperson Nawab Malik said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/political-row-over-adar-poonawalla-s-claims-101620072131483.html
04-05-2021||Chandigarh||Death of 66-year-old Covid patient triggers outrage in Ludhiana||High drama took place outside Arora Neuro Hospital near Mall Road as relatives of a 66-year-old woman patient diagnosed with Covid accused the authorities of medical negligence that resulted in the patient’s death. The woman’s son alleged that his mother died due to lack of oxygen. He claimed that the cylinder had run out of oxygen and the attending nurse did not change it due to which, his mother’s saturation level dropped and she died. The deceased is Adesh Rani, whose son Deepak said despite being diagnosed with Covid, but her condition was stable and she even walked to the hospital during her time of admission two days ago. “We were not satisfied with the treatment she was getting at the civil hospital and decided to shift her here. But, the attending nurses stopped the oxygen flow due to which my mother’s saturation level began to fall. I raised an alarm following which it was learnt that no oxygen was left in the cylinder. After a couple of hours, my mother died. She has not died due to the Covid, but medical negligence,” Deepak alleged. Meanwhile, the hospital authorities termed the allegations baseless and said the woman was admitted to the civil hospital initially. They said she was brought to their hospital two days ago and was suffering from acute respiratory failure.A medical expert said that sudden thrombotic complication was witnessed, which resulted in the patient’s death.Dr Gaurav Sachdeva, while expressing grief over the patient’s death, said, “In this particular case, the patient was sick and brought from civil hospital. We had tried our level best, but could not save the patient. Currently, doctors are under tremendous pressure. They need support, not abuses from people. Our sympathies are with the family, but there has been no lapse in the treatment. We are doing so much to accommodate the patient. We have increased the capacity of the hospital, but one thing needs to be understood that the number of staff and doctors is still the same.”Division Number 8 station house officer Jaswinder Singh said the matter was being probed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/death-of-66-year-old-covid-patient-triggers-outrage-in-ludhiana-101620072014517.html

04-05-2021||Chandigarh||Ludhiana’s Jawaddi school, health centre to get 100 beds for critical patients||With hospitals in district reaching full capacity and kin of Covid patients running from pillar to post to find vacant beds, the Ludhiana administration has decided to add 100 Level-2 beds (50 each) to the Covid care facility set up at Government Meritorious School and community health centre (CHC) in Jawaddi. The financial hub of Punjab has become the Covid capital of the state by clocking around 1,500 cases on an average for the last three days and recording a high number of daily deaths. The rising cases have stretched the health infrastructure in the city with patients and their relatives desperately hunting for L-2 facilities.Deputy commissioner Varinder Kumar Sharma on Monday directed the officials to run the centres at Jawaddi as Level-2 Covid (critical care) facility and asked them to install piped oxygen supply, beds, ACs, and complete other compulsory requirements at both the sites.Sharma said both the facilities have the necessary infrastructure and these must be utilised for the treatment of critical patients to reduce the load on other hospitals and helping them to convert their Level-2 beds to ICU ones. He also visited the sites and issued necessary directions to the officials, while asking them to ensure that the Covid facility at Jawaddi health centre starts by Thursday (May 6) and meritorious school by next Monday.Councillor Mamta Ashu said the entire team of her husband and cabinet minister Bharat Bhushan Ashu was committed to providing best healthcare services to people. Mamta said she was personally monitoring the entire situation and more such Level-2 facilities would be set up in other parts of the district as well.DC Sharma said the infrastructure at both the buildings was being upgraded by roping in industrial associations such as Chamber of Industrial and Commercial Undertakings (CICU), which is funding the installation of piped oxygen supply lines.Sharma said that district administration was fully geared up to meet any situation arising due to the pandemic and there was no dearth of resources — neither oxygen, nor other necessary drugs.He said the administration needed the active support of the public to tackle the devastating second wave of Covid-19. He urged the people to exercise restraint and not panic due to any reason, besides strictly adhering to norms of social distancing, masking, and hand hygiene.CICU president Upkar Singh Ahuja said the country was going through quite tough times and it was their duty to come forward and help in controlling the pandemic. “Covid cases are increasing day by day and our hospitals are finding it hard to provide beds. Keeping in view this situation, CICU is taking initiative by providing support to set up 50+ bed hospital with proper oxygen pipeline and all other equipment required at the meritorious school as it is located at a strategic location. It is close to a big hospital and critical patients can be shifted there easily,” he added.Municipal councillor Mamta Ashu, ADC (G) Amarjit Bains, SDM (West) Amrinder Singh Malhi, civil surgeon Dr Kiran Ahluwalia Gill, and DMCH expert Dr Bishav Mohan were also present. Meanwhile, following DC’s appeal to industry to return the oxygen cylinders, the industries/factories of the city gave 91 oxygen cylinders, including 17 filled. All 17 filled cylinders were immediately given to civil hospital.DC Sharma said they (industrialists) have upheld the tradition of Punjabis to help the people in despair. He also appealed to other industries/factories to come forward and give oxygen cylinders, either empty or filled. The DC said the administration has already ramped up the oxygen generation capacity.Nodal officer Harpreet Singh Sekhon said thatany industry/factory can contact him on his mobile number (83901-00001) for cylinders.Amid the steep rise in the demand for medical oxygen, district magistrate-cum-DC Varinder Kumar Sharma had set up an 11-member committee to inspect and collect the cylinders. This committee is headed by GLADA chief administrator Parminder Singh Gill, besides ADCP Jaskaran Singh Teja, PPCB SE Sandeep Behal, executive engineer Manohar Lal, assistant labour Commissioner Baljeet Singh, besides others.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ludhianas-jawaddi-school-health-centre-to-get-100-beds-for-critical-patients-101620072011990.html
04-05-2021||Chandigarh||Ludhiana police toil to enforce fresh directives, book 25 for violations||A day after the government issued fresh restrictions and put a cap on the number of passengers travelling in public transport or personal vehicles besides announcing closure of shops dealing with non-essential items, cops toiled hard to enforce the orders. The police have booked as many as 25 people under section of 188 of the IPC and registered 20 FIRs against those violating the directives. The violators included three-wheeler drivers and shopkeepers, who open their business despite restrictions and also the residents found roaming around in streets without masks. The police also stopped commuters at checkpoints and enquired for their reason for stepping out. The cops were found informing people about new restrictions wherein no more than two persons can travel in a car at a time and only one person can ride a two-wheeler.Most of the three-wheelers plying on the city roads were found occupied by more than five passengers at a time. According to the orders of the state government, the occupancy in a public transport has been kept at 50%. As per this, a three-wheeler driver cannot accommodate more than three passengers at a time in his/her vehicle.Three-wheeler drivers, however, rued that if they ferry only two to three passengers, they will suffer losses at the time when they are already finding it difficult to survive. Don’t let customers inside: Eatery owners toldIn Sarabha Nagar main market, the police found some of the eatery and bakery owners were allowing customers to step in for takeaways. The cops warned the eatery owners against letting the people inside. ACP (Civil Lines) Jatinder Singh said they have asked the eatery owners to handover the takeaways to the customers outside the premises.Three held for not wearing masksThe Jagraon City police have arrested three persons — Harkirpal Singh, Abhishek Gautam and Prabhjit Singh — for travelling in a car without wearing masks. A case under section 188 of IPC has been registered against them.

He pleaded that since he had suffered lumber, spine and sacrum injuries in the said accident, he would not be able to serve at the place of deputation.While disposing of the petition, the division bench comprising justice Tarlok Singh Chauhan and justice Chander Bhusan Barowalia observed that the petitioner has failed to realise that the health workers in over-crowded hospitals, the policemen and other frontline workers are already beset with overwhelming load of Covid-19 patients and these workers are exhausted from almost a year of restless fighting against the pandemic.The court observed that the state is currently fighting the grimmest battle against Covid-19 which is nothing short of a disaster culminating in mass deaths and, therefore, it is imperative that the frontline workers are made to work on rotation basis or else the health system is likely to collapse with the sudden and drastic surge in Covid-19 cases.The bench said the petitioner is trying to escape from the duties and responsibilities that have now been assigned to him as there is no contemporaneous records to show that the petitioner is in any manner incapacitated to serve at the transferred station and if the petitioner is fit enough to render his services in Kangra district, why he cannot serve at the makeshift Covid facility in Una.A government servant is the holder of a status and that cannot be made depending on his will, the bench said.“Once a person accepts the status as per rules, he no longer remains only a simple individual, but an integral part of governance, and at times even in the face of government,” said the division bench.The court said that in the garb of self-unwillingness to serve, the petitioner cannot be permitted to shirk from his duties and responsibilities and this tendency has to be dealt and curbed with an iron fist.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/hc-dismisses-plea-by-kangra-doctor-deputed-for-covid-duty-101620071955282.html

The living continue to suffer and the dead are deprived of dignity,” she said.Mufti’s comments came after the government dismissed a teacher and then a revenue officer in what it said was in the “interest of the security of the state”.The general administration department issued an order on Friday stating that Lt governor Manoj Sinha, after considering the facts and circumstances of the case, observed that the activities of Idrees Jan, a teacher of Government Middle School, Kupwara, are such as to warrant his dismissal from service.Similarly, in another order, Nazir Ahmad Wani, naib tehsildar of Pulwama, was dismissed under similar clauses.The dismissals come after the government last month set up a special task force to identify and scrutinise employees involved in any case related to posing a threat to the country’s security or anti-national activities.The order, however, has not gone down well with employees and union leaders. Former employee union leader and chairman of Jammu and Kashmir Civil Society Forum Abdul Qayoom Wani expressed resentment over the sacking calling it a jab on the employees’ integrity.It has demanded that the decision be revoked and reviewed judiciously under the service norms so that justice can prevail.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/mehbooba-criticises-sacking-of-govt-staff-over-anti-state-activities-101620071953187.html

These crushers were not indulging in any illegal mining and were generating revenue for the government. However, a conspiracy was hatched to shut them all and Sachdeva conducted raids in November last year and accused the stone crusher owners of keeping illegal raw material with them,” said Randhawa.“However, Sachdeva failed to prove his allegations or submit any report. On February 10, he served notices to us, slapping fines up to ₹25 lakh. Since we wanted hassle-free trade, we moved the high court on April 19, which granted us permission to run the stone crushers till the probe was completed,” he said.The former MLC also claimed that anti-corruption bureau has booked Sachdeva in corruption cases but “pressure” from the top brass has scuttled the investigations.Randhawa alleged that in the past two and a half years, Dr Jitendra Singh and his ”agents” have caused a loss of ₹350 to ₹400 crore to the state exchequer.He also accused Dr Singh of throwing open auction of liquor licenses to outsiders from J&K forcing locals to starve.Meawnhile, Sanjeev Sharma, BJP executive member and parliamentary affairs in-charge for Dr Jitendra Singh, said that the latter will file a defamation case against Randhawa.“MoS PMO will file a defamation case of ₹1 crore if Randhawa does not come up with evidence within 24 hours,” he said.J&K BJP president Ravinder Raina said, “Since Randhawa has levelled serious allegations, they must be probed and whosoever found guilty must be taken to task. Also, he used unparliamentary language in his presser, which was highly objectionable. We will seek an explanation from him.”“This notice of show cause initiates disciplinary proceedings against you in line with directions of J&K BJP president with respect to addressing a press conference and a series of media interactions today by you while levelling unfounded allegations against a senior leader of party holding responsible position in Union Council of ministers,” read the notice issued by the panel.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/jk-bjp-leader-accuses-union-minister-dr-jitendra-singh-of-aiding-illegal-mining-in-tawi-river-101620071892107.html

Experts, who are part of consultation meetings, said while schools are likely to be asked to send the data of student performance in internal assessments, data on school-wise and subject-wise performance for the previous years can be used as an indicator to ensure accuracy in scoring. “When schools send scores, they are most likely to be inflated and this is a fear across boards and schools. But the state board does have data on how each of the schools performed during all these years. Data sent by schools can thus be cross referenced with these details. If a school has had 100 students scoring distinction, it will be questionable if the number suddenly becomes 200. Similarly, there is data on subject-wise performance of students, which can be used to check their performance this year,” sad an expert on the condition of anonymity. On May 1, CBSE announced its marking criteria for Class 10 students in an 18-page document. Students will be marked on the basis of their pre-boards, midterm and unit test exams for Class 10. Similarly, ICSE released its assessment criteria to schools on the same day wherein students will be marked on the basis of their average performance in classes 9 and 10. The state education department is yet to come up with its own assessment criteria 1.7 million students. While an official from the education department said a decision is yet to be made, he added that details are being worked out. “The number of students is quite high as compared to other boards, hence the decision is taking longer,” he added. On April 20, the state government, in a cabinet meeting held that day, decided to cancel Class 10 exams to the state board owing to the growing Covid-19 infections in the state and the resultant lockdown. State education minister Varsha Gaikwad announced that students of Class 10 will be marked on the basis of internal assessments. Since then, the state education department has held numerous consultation meetings with various stakeholders including schools, teachers, parents, educationists and technology firms to assess and understand feasible ways of marking students.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-board-data-likely-to-act-as-reference-point-for-class-10-marking-101620071831495.html
04-05-2021||Mumbai||At 36.1°C, Monday Mumbai’s hottest day in May in decade||On Monday, the city recorded its highest daytime temperature in May at 36.1 degrees Celsius, matching that in May 2016. Monday’s reading was 3 degrees Celsius above normal, and marks the highest daytime maximum recorded in May in 10 years, as per data with the India Meteorological Department (IMD). On May 31, 2016, the mercury had climbed to 36.1 degrees Celsius as well, as per the automatic weather station in Santacruz.After a relatively cooler April which saw a near normal average daytime temperature of 33.8 degrees Celsius, days have been growing hotter in May, in line with IMD forecasts. Since April 30, both minimum and maximum temperatures have shown an upward departure from normal, showed IMD data.However, Monday’s temperature isn’t the hottest that Mumbai has been this pre-monsoon season, which runs from March to May every year. On March 27, the city sizzled at 40.7 degrees Celsius, the highest of the season. “As we have already conveyed in our long-term forecast, it is going to be a hotter than normal summer season in Mumbai this year. April was cooler due to the formation of rain bearing weather systems over Central India. But as we go further into the summer season, their cooling impact on the Konkan coast will diminish,” said a spokesperson with IMD’s regional centre in the city.As per IMD’s seven-day forecast for the city, there will not be any respite from heat in coming days, with maximum daytime temperature expected to hover between 35 and 36 degrees Celsius. The minimum temperature, which was 26.5 degrees on Monday, is also set to rise slightly and remain at around 27 degrees Celsius in the next week.Meanwhile, rain, thunderstorms and even hail continued to lash parts of central and western Maharashtra on Monday, affecting parts of Jalgaon, Dhule, Pune, Ahmednagar, Nasik, Nandurbar, Satara, Aurangabad, Jalna, Beed and Osmanabad districts. IMD on Monday issued a severe weather warning for parts of Madhya Maharashtra, Vidarhbha and Marathwada. Kolhapur, Satara, Sangli and Solapur were placed under ‘orange’ alert, indicating a high possibility of severe weather over the next 20 hours.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/at-36-1-c-monday-mumbai-s-hottest-day-in-may-in-decade-101620071771337.html
04-05-2021||Mumbai||NEET-PG delayed: Students unhappy||Hours after the Prime Minister’s office’s announcement that the National Eligibility-cum-Entrance Test for Post Graduate courses (NEET-PG) will be postponed by at least four months in order to boost availability of medical personnel to fight Covid-19, the reaction of parents and students. This decision comes less than a week after the National Medical Commission (NMC) in its circular requested medical colleges to continue the residency period of PG medical students as part of the Covid task force, especially at a time when the country is witnessing the second wave of the pandemic. “Medical personnel completing hundred days of Covid duty will be given priority in the forthcoming regular government recruitment programs. While medical interns shall be deployed in covid management duties under the supervision of their faculty, final-year MBBS students can be utilised for tele-consultation and monitoring of mild covid cases under supervision of senior faculty,” said a statement released by the PMO on Monday. Final-year PG medical examinations have been stalled in most states due to the deterioration of Covid situation. Similarly, no fresh admissions to PG medical and diploma courses were done due to the postponement of National Eligibility-cum-Entrance Test (NEET-PG) exams. NEET-PG exams are generally conducted in February every year and the final year examinations are generally held between April-May in Maharashtra colleges. Students of most PG colleges were roped in last year to augment trained manpower for treatment of Covid and non-Covid patients. “When medical and nursing students are being roped in for Covid task force, why are students and interns from other branches of medicine including physiotherapy, ayurveda spared,” asked Sudha Shenoy, parent of an MBBS student. Many students took to various social media sites to share their unhappiness with the decision to postpone NEET-PG. Many felt this delay will severely affect the plans of higher studies of PG medical students. “We’ve been working non-stop for several months now and the government needs to understand that if they conduct exams on time, they will still have more students/manpower to join the Covid task force,” said Anukriti Thakur, a final year PG resident doctor.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/neetpg-delayed-students-unhappy-101620071712032.html
04-05-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra records 48,621 new Covid-19 infections||Maharashtra on Monday added 48,621 fresh Covid-19 infections, taking the tally of infections to 4,771,022. The slight dip in cases is however due to a drop in tests conducted in the past 24 hours owing to the weekend. The state tested 211,668 samples in the past 24 hours. Mumbai reported its lowest single-day figures since March 17 (2,377 cases), with 2,624 fresh infections. The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) tested 23,542 samples in the past 24 hours—lower than what it tested on Saturday (28,636) and Friday (37,607). On Monday, the areas that constitute the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR) added 4,056 new cases. Pune district added 7,718 new cases. Maharashtra added 567 fatalities, to push its toll to 70,851. Mumbai added 78 deaths. The state has managed to control the rise of cases in the state over the past two weeks. The state was projected to have an active case count of 1.1 million (1,094,996) by May 2. However, the state managed to keep the growth of cases under control. The active cases in the state on Monday stood at 656,870. Over the past few days, the active case count has remained around 650,000. Of the projected 1.1 million active cases, 300,000 cases are expected to be from Mumbai and its surrounding districts of Thane, Palghar and Raigad. The region now has 137,688 active cases. State health department officials said the numbers are under control due to the tightening of restrictions on the movement of people by the government. Since mid-April, the state enforced a complete curfew, followed by a near lockdown from April 22. “These are mathematical projections; they are sometimes accurate and often not. The idea of these projections is to understand the magnitude of the outbreak and what to prepare for. Having said that, the manner in which we were seeing cases in mid-April, if not 1.1 million, we would have reached 800,000-900,000 by now had the government not intervened with restrictions and imposing a lockdown,” said a senior health department official, who did not wish to be named. Pune district continued to remain at the top in terms of the active case count with 108,915 cases, followed by Nagpur district with 70,186 active cases. Mumbai’s active caseload stood at 59,970, while Nashik remained at 51195. The high number of daily deaths remains a concern for state health department and district authorities. Of the 567 deaths reported on Monday, 283 occurred in the past 48 hours and 146 in the past week. The remaining 138 deaths are from the period before last week. Thane rural areas reported 56 deaths on Monday. Ahmednagar district reported 48 deaths followed by Satara district with 47 deaths. Kolhapur district recorded 31 fatalities, while Solapur district reported 29 deaths. As the number of cases is showing signs of stabilising in urban areas, the tier two cities, mainly rural areas, continue to report cases burdening its health infrastructure. On Monday, Ahmednagar district reported 2,002 fresh cases, while Nashik district saw 3,673 new cases. Satara added 2,429 fresh cases, while Kolhapur and Sangli rural areas reported 1,402 and 1,157 fresh cases, respectively. Jalna and Parbhani districts added 880 and 868 fresh cases. Beed district saw 1,262 new cases, Yavatmal added 1,383 new cases, Buldhana added 1,409 cases. Wardha, Bhandara, Gondia and Chandrapur added 545, 551, 228, and 832 cases, respectively. Chandrapur has an active case count of 27,640, while Bhandara has 10,235 active cases. Buldhana has 11,884 active cases. Latur and Beed districts have active case count of 12,365 and 12,657, respectively.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-records-48-621-new-covid-19-infections-101620071711364.html
04-05-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra: AAP accuses Chandrakant Patil of influencing bail for Chhagan Bhujbal||The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) has demanded the arrest of Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader and former minister Chandrakant Patil, alleging that he had confessed to having influenced the bail of Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) minister Chhagan Bhujbal. AAP sought an investigation in the matter. Bhujbal was in prison from March 2016 to March 2018 for allegedly laundering the kickbacks he allegedly received as the public works minister.The controversy began when Bhujbal criticised Prime Minister (PM) Narendra Modi for losing West Bengal elections. Bhujbal said that barring Assam, the BJP has been vanquished all across, indicating that an anti-BJP wave is sweeping across the nation. He said if elections were held now, BJP would face a crushing defeat. In response to this, Patil warned Bhujbal, reminding that he was out on bail and would face the music if he indulged in such rhetoric again. Patil also said that Bhujbal’s nephew Sameer used to come to his bungalow (during BJP rule in state when Patil was a minister) to plead his case. According to AAP leader Priti Sharma Menon, Patil had claimed in his interview to news channel ABP Majha that the then BJP government had favoured Bhujbal. “Chandrakant Patil said the then government had gone out of their way and ensured bail for Chhagan Bhujbal. Patil should be arrested and a probe should be ordered,” said Menon. The BJP denied that Patil made any such remarks about influencing the judiciary. “There was no way we could have interfered with the judicial process against Bhujbal in the first place. Patil said that Sameer was going everywhere regarding bail for his uncle and even met Patil in his bungalow. The interviewer asked whether this was the reason how Bhujbal got bail since his nephew used to come to him. Priti Menon picked this part and is unjustly attacking Patil,” said BJP spokesperson Madhav Bhandari.Bhujbal was not available for comment despite several attempts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-aap-accuses-chandrakant-patil-of-influencing-bail-for-chhagan-bhujbal-101620071651376.html
04-05-2021||Other||Bookie, 2 bizmen accuse ex-Mumbai Police chief Param Bir Singh of extortion||A cricket bookie and two businessmen from Mumbai have written to Maharashtra director general of police (DGP) Sanjay Pandey, alleging that former Mumbai Police commissioner Param Bir Singh ran a recovery and extortion racket in Thane while serving as that city’s police chief between 2015 and 2018. The three have also named a former encounter specialist and a serving inspector of Thane Police of being part of Singh’s alleged illegal activities. The bookie and businessmen alleged that the cops extorted crores of rupees from them. Police sources said Pandey has entrusted the complaints to state crime Investigation department (CID) for inquiry. Singh, who is posted as the commandant general of Maharashtra home guards, did not respond to calls and messages for response over allegations. The complainants – bookie Sonu Jalan and businessman Ketan Tanna and Munir Ahmed Pathan – had met the DGP Pandey last month and filed their complaints against Singh. As per their complaints (of which HT has copies), the three alleged that on Singh’s instructions, the two other cops named in the complaint, had taken “contracts” for recovery of money from private individuals. These officers, the complaints stated, would call up businessmen on the pretext of inquiry in a fake complaint and then extort them by threatening to implicate them in false cases.The complainants have claimed that under Singh’s leadership, the two police officers would also allegedly extort money from those who had received calls from Ravi Pujari for extortion, claiming that they had links with the gangster.Jalan, who was arrested by Thane Police in 2018 in a Maharashtra Control of Organised Crimes Act (MCOCA) case, stated that Singh, with the help of these “corrupt” officers, manipulated complaints with the intention of extortion from innocent persons. A first information report (FIR) has already been registered against Singh on a complaint by Akola police inspector BR Ghadge, who had alleged that as he had refused to follow Singh’s “illegal” orders to benefit some accused in a criminal case, the former Thane top cop conspired with others and registered extortion and corruption cases between August 23 and September 3, 2015, against him. Ghadge claimed that the accused had falsely implicated him to harass him.Recently, Singh was removed from the post of Mumbai Police commissioner following the Antilia explosives scare and the murder of Thane trader Mansukh Hiran. Hiran was in possession of the vehicle in which explosives were found outside billionaire Mukesh Ambani residence. Hiran reported the vehicle stolen around a week before it was found with the explosives in late February. He was found dead on March 5. Mumbai Police officer Sachin Vaze has been named as the main accused in both cases. After Singh was removed as the commissioner, he wrote a letter to the chief minister, alleging that the state’s then home minister Anil Deshmukh had instructed Vaze and some other officers to extort money from establishments. Deshmukh has resigned and the Central Bureau of Investigation is probing the allegations against him.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/bookie-2-bizmen-accuse-ex-mumbai-police-chief-param-bir-singh-of-extortion-101620071591980.html
04-05-2021||Mumbai||Those with ailments not given priority for Covid jabs, live in fear||As the civic body’s vaccination drive remains way behind its target owing to shortage of vials, patients with immunocompromised diseases, who are the most vulnerable. but are still to get the jab, remain the most hit. Pratik Soni, 30, has been on dialysis for the past 13 years. In March, when the state started the mass inoculation programme for those above 45 years with co-morbidities, he went to Tunga Hospital in Malad with the hope of getting the jab. But with a heavy heart, he had to return home without vaccination due to age restriction. On March 31, Soni, a patient living with chronic kidney ailment, started developing a fever with breathlessness. Next day, he immediately rushed to the Bandra-Kurla Complex (BKC) jumbo centre for Covid-19 testing. He was quarantined in a separate ward and on April 1, his report came positive for the infection. Patients on dialysis are the most vulnerable as they have to undergo dialysis on alternate days, which not only weakens their immunity, but exposes them to other possible Covid-19 infected patients. “I wanted to get the vaccine, but due to the age restrictions, I couldn’t. I got discharged within six days on April 6, but I remained positive for the next 20 days. Every alternate day, I have to travel to BKC from Borivli for dialysis. I am glad I survived the infection, but many don’t,” said Soni. Vasundhara Raghavan, chief executive officer (CEO) of Kidney Warriors Foundation, had written to the Central government requesting to include kidney patients for universal vaccination. She said, “Earlier, the government didn’t include patients on dialysis, and now when the age limit for vaccination has been increased to 18 years, vaccines aren’t available. The vaccination slots are getting filled within seconds. This is similar to booking Tatkal railway tickets.” Similar demands have been raised by patients who suffer from other chronic ailments such as tuberculosis, HIV and cancer, who are equally vulnerable to the infection. A 44-year-old Malad resident, who has been living with HIV, is running from pillar to post for the vaccine. Talking to HT, she said, “In the third phase, the government didn’t include vulnerable groups. I even wrote a letter to the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) to include HIV patients in the list of beneficiaries, but nothing happened. I stay with my two children and elderly in-laws. If I contract the Covid-19 infection and spread it to my family, who will be responsible for that?” The patient lost her husband to HIV in 2018. Since then, she has been earning her living by working with a non-government organisation (NGO) as a counsellor for people living with HIV. Social activists believe such delay can further increase the fatality rate in Mumbai, which already stands at 2%. Ganesh Acharya, a person living with HIV, said, “The government should have prioritised the vulnerable group. With the second wave, as the cases have doubled and every second person is getting infected, we are now living in fear.” As per data provided by the BMC, unlike last year, the highest number of infections is visible among people in the age group of 20 to 40 years. “Last year, due to lack of awareness, people above the age of 60 years were contracting the highest number of infections. But this year, the infection rate is the highest in young adults, so it is essential to vaccinate them at the earliest to control the ongoing second wave,” said Dr Avinash Supe, in-charge of the BMC Covid-19 death committee.  “We have 136 centres which are capable of vaccinating 75,000 daily. But if we don’t get the vaccines, we can’t do anything. In fact, until the Centre gives us the nod to include patients with chronic illness in the priority list, we can’t immunise them,” said a senior officer from the BMC health department.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/those-with-ailments-not-given-priority-for-covid-jabs-live-in-fear-101620071531339.html
04-05-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Kin of 104 cops who died of Covid this year await compensation||None of the families of the 104 policemen, who lost their lives to Covid-19 this year, have received any compensation from the state government, as the state scheme for providing financial aid of ₹50 lakh to each of the families of such policemen has not been renewed after December 2020. As a result, some of the families of deceased cops are facing serious issues. Kavita Mahale, 30, wife of Sanjay Mahale, a constable posted with Nardana police station in Dhule, is now at the mercy of her parents, as she was finding it difficult to provide basic necessities for her two children after her husband’s demise. Sanjay succumbed to the disease on March 25 and his father passed away after eight days. Sanjay’s mother had already died six months ago due to a prolonged illness. “In just six months, I lost my husband and both in-laws. I moved back to my parent’s place in Nandurbar as there is none left in my late husband’s family who would take care of us. Now, my children and I are completely dependent on my parents. I haven’t received a single penny from the government yet. How am I supposed to feed my children and raise them? I have also applied for a job on behalf of my husband, but by the time I get the job I still have to feed my children. The solatium could be very helpful,” said Kavita in tears. Gaurav Wani, an engineering student and son of head constable Sanjay Wani, who was posted with Kolshewadi police station in Kalyan, is equally perplexed. Three months have passed since his father’s death due to Covid, but the family hasn’t yet received any compensation from the state.“My father died of Covid-19 on January 19 at Vedanta Hospital in Thane, and now the responsibility of the family is on my shoulders,” said Gaurav, a third-year engineering student. His sister is also a college student.Similar is the case of the family of head constable Ramesh Survase from Chunabhatti police station who died last month due to Covid. Survase’s brother Vishnu said the compensation money would help his brother’s wife take care of her two children aged 17 and 12 years. A senior IPS officer said the scheme for financial aid to families of deceased policemen has ended in December 2020 and hasn’t been renewed thereafter. Sanjeev Singhal, additional director general of police (administration) said, “We have written to the government requesting that funds be released so that the grieving families of deceased policemen could get much needed financial aid.”During the initial days of the pandemic, many police personnel pressed into Covid-related work had contracted the virus and were falling sick. The disease was spreading among the police force rapidly, and thus there was a sense fear and panic among the men in khaki. Later, the state government announced a financial help to the families of deceased policemen with ₹50 lakh solatium and a government job to one family member. Mumbai Police went a step ahead and announced an additional ₹10 lakh fund for each family from police welfare funds. So far, hundreds of families got benefits and many family members even got jobs in the police force.Though the fatalities in police department remained limited to 12 a month from January to March this year, in April more than 6,000 personnel contracted the disease and 68 of them succumbed, making April the second-deadliest month after September 2020 for the police department.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-kin-of-104-cops-who-died-of-covid-this-year-await-compensation-101620071412712.html
04-05-2021||Delhi||Delhi govt schools request CBSE to extend date for class 10 results||Two days after the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) announced the guidelines for the revised assessment scheme for class 10 students, in the wake of board exams being cancelled due to the Covid-19 pandemic, principals of Delhi government schools have expressed concerns over the timeline given by the board and said it may be difficult to submit the result sheets to the CBSE by June 5, as directed. The board plans to declare the results on June 20.The CBSE on Sunday asked each school s to form a results committee, comprising the school principal, five teachers, and two external examiners, by May 5 and to finalise a “rationalisation document” by May 10. The committee would be in charge of preparing the class 10 results which will be calculated this time on the basis of internal tests and assessments.The unprecedented spike in Covid-19 cases and fatalities in the second wave of the pandemic across the country -- and the fourth wave in Delhi -- had forced the CBSE to cancel class 10 exams. But with several government schools turning into Covid care centres and vaccination centres, and teachers being allotted Covid-19 duties, several principals said they would not be able to carry out the steps listed by the CBSE within the stipulated time frame.For instance, principals have said it is “impossible” to select five teachers and two external examiners by May 5 and follow guidelines like ensuring that there is no overlap of teachers in the committees of two nearby schools.Sukhbir Singh Yadav, president of Vice- and Principals’ Association of Delhi, said, “All heads of schools are of the opinion that nothing should be started in May. Many schools have been converted into vaccination centres and Covid care centres in Delhi. There is a 100% risk of getting infected if principals and teachers are asked to step outside of homes. It is not possible to form a committee by May 5.”In a letter to the CBSE chairperson on Monday, Yadav asked the board to defer implementation of the May 1 notification till the pandemic situation improves.Sujata Tamta, head of school at Sarvodaya Kanya Vidyalaya at Molarband, said, “We won’t be able to form the results committee by May 5. Our vice-principal and around seven teachers have already tested Covid positive and this number keeps increasing. Many of the teachers also have to arrange medicines and other items for their family members who are ill. We will revisit this in a few days.”CBSE officials, however, said the members of the committee could work from home. Controller of examinations Sanyam Bhardwaj said, “We are only talking about five teachers and they don’t have to come to the school. This can be done from home as well.” Schools have to submit marks to the CBSE by June 5 and results will be declared on June 20.Awadhesh Kumar Kha, principal of Sarvodaya co-ed Vidyalaya in Rohini Sector 8, however, said the different clauses and modalities stated in the notification will make it difficult to coordinate remotely.The board had also directed that if any candidate has not appeared in any of the assessments conducted by the school, the school may conduct an offline/online or a telephonic one-on-one assessment.“Work from home will not be feasible because not many internal exams were conducted due to the pandemic. The notification from the CBSE suggests that teachers will have to conduct these exams by May 15. We have around eight sections of class 10 in our school. To ensure standardisation of marks, as directed by the CBSE, will require analysing subject-wise marks of three years and these things cannot happen remotely. Teachers will have to come to school for this,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-govt-schools-request-cbse-to-extend-date-for-class-10-results-101620071411976.html

All his duty hours and free time is spend with the patients, and seeing his dedication, various other doctors have joined him at Gauri Hall ICU Covid-19 Centre in Badlapur. The humble doctor, an intensivist, is too shy to speak of his dedication and instead claimed, “I am merely performing my duty as a doctor. This recent wave is difficult for everyone, and all of us need to do whatever we can to help people. I am also trying to tell people not to delay treatment and ignore even a single symptom.” Nakade is the doctor in charge of the intensive care unit (ICU) of the hospital and has increased ICU beds from 30 to 50 for the second wave and also managed to add a few more for emergency. He works over 22 hours a day and at times even the entire 24 hours without a wink of sleep, said his colleagues. His family includes parents and his three brothers. More than 250 patients have been discharged from this centre in the past four months. Dr Pooja Ghodwinde, his colleague, said, “We have joined this centre in September, and since then Nakade has never been to his house in Panvel. He increased the ICU beds to accommodate more patients. However, these days none of the beds are vacant. He not only treats the patient but also feeds them if anyone is in need to be fed. His level of dedication is completely difficult to attain.” Ghodwinde who stays at Titwala visits her house once in a month. Jaideep Shivre, 65, a senior citizen admitted there, said, “I was admitted in this centre in March. All my family members were tensed as I am diabetic and a heart patient. For the 15 days I was admitted there, I haven’t seen Dr Nakade rest. He will perform the work assigned to someone else without minding it. I have seen him cleaning urine and stool of patients, feeding them. He gave me so much positive energy and shared positive thoughts when I was feeling low. I am really thankful to him that I am fine because of his continued care, day and night.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/doctor-lives-in-covid-care-centre-to-care-for-patients-101620071352740.html

Police could not immediately share the current status of the case.The latest racket was busted after the special staff of the outer north district police learnt that a gang was allegedly hoarding and selling oxygen concentrators illegally.“Based on the inputs we received, we sent a policeman as a decoy customer to purchase an oxygen concentrator on Friday,” said the DCP.The decoy was offered a machine for ₹1.1 lakh though the maximum retail price was only ₹40,000. Police arrested the two sellers, Anuj Jain and Shekhar Kumar, from Sanjay Gandhi Transport Nagar in outer Delhi and seized five concentrators kept in their car.Their questioning led police to a house in West Delhi’s Janakpuri, from where 60 oxygen concentrators were recovered, and five more from another car. A third suspect, Keshav Chaudhary, was also arrested.Chaudhary’s questioning allegedly pointed police to a warehouse in Janakpuri where more concentrators were allegedly stored.“When we visited the warehouse on Saturday evening, we were surprised to learn that Anil Jain was inside,” the DCP said.With Jain locking himself in and refusing to surrender, police looked for a gas cutter but could not operate it without an oxygen cylinder. Nearly 12 hours later, police had finally managed to secure an oxygen cylinder and began to cut the shutter when Anil Jain surrendered.The DCP said that 45 oxygen concentrators were recovered from the warehouse.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/gang-black-marketing-oxygen-concentrators-busted-101620071352064.html
04-05-2021||Delhi||Back to school as nearly 91K queue up for vaccines in Delhi||Hand sanitisers, double masks, and face shields — residents of the national capital stepped out of their homes on Monday during a lockdown to queue up for Covid-19 vaccine jabs at public schools in different parts of the city that have been converted into inoculation centres as part of the state government’s plans for the expanded drive to cover those between 18 and 44 year of age.The summer heat, which was just shy of 40°C on Monday afternoon, did not play spoilsport for people who said they’ve been waiting for a vaccine since the pandemic broke out. No sign of hesitancy here.Classrooms that were abruptly shut because of the virus last year, opened again on Monday, but this time as “war rooms against Covid-19”, a civil defence volunteer said.At the Kendriya Vidyalaya in Tughlaqabad, Class 1-D became an observation room where those who got the jab waited for 30 minutes to observe for adverse events.Class 2-D was the attendance room, where one had to show their appointment slip. A few rooms away, two auxiliary nurse midwives (ANMs), sitting on class teacher’s chairs in front of an undusted blackboard with notes from a February 2020 mathematics lesson, were ready to administer the vaccines to beneficiaries.Schools across the city saw similar scenes on Day 1 of the expanded drive, which was rolled out two days late, owing to a shortage of doses in the city.As the Capital reels under the fourth wave of infections, the Delhi government began the mass vaccination programme in 76 schools, which had 301 inoculation centres between them.More than 45,000 beneficiaries in this category can get jabs across the 300 centres in a day, according to the government.Around 9.2 million people are eligible for the jabs in the 18-44 age group.Deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia on Monday said the Delhi government has received 450,000 vaccine doses so far for the third phase.On Monday, about 90,803 people across age-groups across the city got doses of the vaccine.“We waited for this moment for more than a year. I checked the Co-WIN website all day on Sunday. I lost all hopes of getting a slot, but one finally opened up around 11.30pm,” said Aditya K, who took the jab at the Tughlaqabad school.Outside the centres, Delhi Police personnel and civil defence volunteers ensured people kept the required distance.Some volunteers said it was unclear to many people that walk-in vaccinations weren’t allowed for the 18-44 age group.A civil defence volunteer posted outside a school in south-east Delhi’s Molarband said, “There were many people who do not use smartphones but came with their Aadhaar cards. It was difficult to explain to them that one has to use the internet and get themselves registered. Many believe it is a walk-in vaccination site. The government must come up with an alternative method for people to get an appointment.”But it wasn’t smooth sailing everywhere.Officials at a school in Badarpur said they did not get time to prepare signage that would have helped people. Every school had at least three vaccination points.The centre number is specified on the appointment slip, but these were not displayed in most schools.A couple had to be pacified at a school in south-east Delhi’s Jaitpur after they were told they were at the wrong centre.“The address of the centres in the Co-Win app is vague. I went to three different schools before coming here,” said Amar Singh, who was waiting outside the girls senior secondary school in Jaitpur.At several places, the drive began well after 10am, leading to large crowds. For instance, vaccine vials arrived late at a Delhi government senior secondary school in Jangpura.The school’s principal, Harish Chand, said 15 teachers, five IT persons, five civil defense volunteers, five ANMs and one doctor were deployed at the vaccination site.“There is also an ambulance outside if anyone reports any adverse event,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/back-to-school-as-delhi-queues-up-for-vaccines-101620071351214.html
04-05-2021||Delhi||Pleas seek mother’s milk for Covid-19 orphans||While requests for leads on hospital beds, oxygen cylinders, plasma and medicines galore on social media amid the Covid-19 pandemic in the capital, pleas for breast milk donors for newborns and infants whose mothers were infected with the virus or succumbed to it are also slowly making their way onto our timelines.The Delhi Commission for Protection of Child Rights (DCPCR) said that they have acted on several similar requests on their helpline number or through people who tagged them on social media. Officials at breast milk banks in Delhi too said that they have been receiving several such request from many private maternity hospitals.Between Sunday and Monday, a Delhi-based family’s plea, for a breast milk donor for a newborn whose mother died of Covid-19 last week, caught the attention of Twitter. A family friend whose number was shared in the message confirmed the authenticity of the message and said that they managed to arrange milk from personal acquaintances.In another request floating on social media, a Lucknow-based family pleaded for a breast milk donor for a day-old infant whose Covid-positive mother died while giving birth. Several others requested for breast milk donors for infants separated from Covid-19 infected mothers.Abhinav Sharma, a resident of Rajendra Nagar, said that his wife, a new mother, tested positive for Covid-19 last week. “We had to find a milk donor for our one-week-old son. We put out a request on Instagram and Facebook following which several lactating mothers approached us. We then contacted a breast milk bank for guidance, and they helped in the selection of the donor and collection of milk,” he said.Ohika Chakraborty Malik, the spokesperson at Breast Milk Foundation in Safdarjung Enclave, said, “We recently received a request from a private maternity hospital in Rohini wherein the mother was Covid positive and had given birth to twins. We sent them batches of milk stored with us.”Malik said that there is a scarcity of stored mother’s milk at their bank currently. “There has been no donation amid the pandemic. Our freezer is almost empty right now. We request lactating mothers to come forward and donate milk so that we can help more such kids,” she added.Officials at the Delhi Commission for Protection of Child Rights (DCPCR) said they have also received several requests for donors through social media in the last few weeks. Ranjana Prasad, a member of the commission, said, “We helped such families connect to the milk banks and possible milk donors. We also counselled them to not panic and start giving pasteurised milk to infants whose mothers are not in a position to nurse them.”Nurses working in maternity wards across several Covid designated hospitals also said infected mothers can nurse their infants while taking all precautions.Babita Rani, a senior nursing officer at the Covid maternity ward at the Employees’ State Insurance Model Hospital in Basaidarapur, said, “We have several such mothers at our hospital. We make them wear masks, and wash their hands before nursing their kids. In case the mothers are too weak to sit for long then we express milk and feed the kid. In case mother died of Covid or any other complication, the infant can be given pasteurised milk.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/pleas-seek-breast-milk-donors-for-infants-whose-mothers-are-infected-or-have-died-due-to-covid-101620071291864.html
04-05-2021||Mumbai||Vaccination for 45+ age group to resume in Mumbai on Tuesday||Vaccination for citizens above the age of 45 years, who are to receive their second dose only, will resume in Mumbai at select municipal and government vaccination centres on Tuesday, after being suspended for three days since Saturday due to shortage in stock. The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) will separately issue a list of vaccine centres operational on Tuesday for this age group. Meanwhile, vaccination for the age group 18-44 years will continue on Tuesday as well, for the fourth day since the drive started on May 1. It will take place at five vaccine centres for the beneficiaries who have registered on the CoWin application and have received a slot from BMC. It will take place at BYL Nair Hospital at Mumbai Central, SevenHills Hospital at Andheri, BKC Jumbo Facility, Rajawadi Hospital at Ghatkopar, and Cooper Hospital at Vile Parle. BMC will vaccinate 2,500 people in this age group on Tuesday. Slots for bookings were opened by the civic body on Monday evening at 7.30pm and all slots were booked within seven minutes. At 7.37pm, BMC tweeted, “All the 500 slots each at all the 5 centres have been booked in Mumbai. We look forward to vaccinate those who have booked their slots. Please carry the ID with which you registered.” On Monday, BMC vaccinated 2,394 beneficiaries from the age group of 18-44 years. In the past three days, a total of 5,813 beneficiaries from this age group have been vaccinated. Since this phase of the drive started on May 1, BMC had kept aside 20,000 doses as a separate stock to facilitate vaccinations for this age group which are being utilised. On Monday, eight beneficiaries aged 45 years and above were vaccinated at the BKC jumbo facility. Apart from this, 30 healthcare workers, two frontline workers, 410 citizens aged above 60, and 375 citizens between age 45 years and 59 years were vaccinated at HN Reliance Hospital and Mallika Hospital.Drive-in vaccination centreMumbai’s first-of-its-kind drive-in vaccination centre will start at Kohinoor Parking Lot on JK Sawant Marg near Shivaji Park in Dadar (West) on Tuesday, to cater to senior citizens and specially-abled citizens. Kiran Dighavkar, assistant commissioner of G-North ward which has jurisdiction over this area, said, “It is the largest vaccination facility with capacity to vaccinate 5,000 beneficiaries per day across seven booths. Two of these booths are reserved for drive-ins.” The parking lot has enough space for 60 to 70 vehicles queuing up, leading to the two booths, Dighavkar said. A registration stall will also be set up, but beneficiaries will be registered by the staff at the centre as they are waiting in queue. BMC tweeted on Monday evening, “Drive-in facility for 45+ specially-abled. @mybmcWardGN has started a new vaccination centre at Kohinoor Parking Lot, JK Sawant Marg, Dadar (W), for 45+ citizens coming for their 2nd dose of Covishield, starts at 10 am tomorrow & has 7 vaccination rooms. #VaccinationForAll.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/vaccination-for-45-age-group-to-resume-in-mumbai-on-tuesday-101620071291212.html

In a letter, DCI further suggested that institutes should not lay off their staff in such trying times. “We are all aware of the unprecedented surge in Covid-19 cases and the country is currently fighting a second wave of the pandemic. It goes without saying that the economic position of a person contributes a lot to their mental condition and staying mentally strong is the need of the hour,” said the circular released by the council in the last week of April. It further stated that the circular follows recent directions issued by the Union Ministry of Labour & Employment, advising employers to not default on the payment of monthly salaries to their employees. “All institutes are advised to extend their support and contribute to the national cause by not deducting salaries of staff and students employed at present, or laying off faculty or other employees, and ensure on-time payment during this hour of need,” said the circular signed by the DCI deputy secretary, Mukesh Kumar. A similar demand has been made by several state governments as well as final-year resident doctors’ organisations who have been working extended shifts for the past 13 months. “Most colleges are overworked at present, especially with the second wave of the pandemic pushing the present health infrastructure to the brink. It will be impossible for the medical and dental college hospitals to function without their employees. So we are all ensuring that no one loses their job in the midst of such crisis,” said the head of the management of a private dental institute in Pune.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/ensure-no-job-losses-salaries-are-given-to-staff-on-time-dental-council-of-india-to-colleges-101620071232439.html

Police said that an analysis of the phone numbers behind the scams revealed that many were operating from outside Delhi to cash in on the chaos due to the pandemic. According to Delhi Police spokesperson Chinmoy Biswal, eight such cases have been registered at the cyber cells and police stations across Delhi in the recent days.With social media flooded with several such complaints and police directly receiving many complaints, Delhi Police chief S N Shrivastava on Monday directed the district cyber cells in Delhi as well as the crime branch to act on the matter, said Biswal, adding thatthe Cyber Prevention Awareness and Detection (CyPAD) and Economic Offences Wing (EOW) too have stepped in.“Senior officers of Indian Cyber Crime Coordination Centre of the MHA and NPCI too were invited to find a solution,” Biswal said.The NPCI agreed to freeze the bank accounts used by cyber criminals, said Biswal. For instance, if a complaint is received regarding such cheating, police will contact NPCI to freeze the bank account of the suspects which increases the scope of retrieving the money.Police will also reach out to the Department of Telecommunications (DoT) to ensure that the phone numbers used by the fraudsters are required to undergo the mandatory KYC process. Police said this will deter the scamsters from using the phone to dupe more victims.Police have urged the public to lodge such complaints on their helpline number, 155260, and on www.cybercrime.gov.in. Victims can also simultaneously seek help from police’s Covid helpline 011-23469900 or send an email to acp-cybercell1@delhipolice.gov.in.“Each complaint shall be duly enquired into and appropriate action will be taken. CyPAD will act as the nodal point for interacting on a daily basis with the concerned authorities. All major cyber criminal networks, based out of Jamtara, Mewat, Purulia and other places, shall be under intense scrutiny,” said Biswal.“It is noticed that people in desperation are not exercising due diligence or even the slightest of verification before transferring money online to unknown persons who are claiming to be oxygen or medicine providers. We urge people to be very careful and transfer money only after verifying the contacts,” Biswal said.In one such case of fraud, Hemant Kumar, an outer Delhi resident, sent an SOS message seeking oxygen for his sick father and was contacted by a man who offered to provide a cylinder if he made an advance online payment of ₹45,000. While the suspect remained incommunicado after receiving the money, the victim approached Adarsh Nagar police on Monday which swung into action and caught the accused.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/police-join-hands-with-mha-npci-to-act-on-cyber-crime-during-pandemic-101620071231207.html
04-05-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai’s plans to tackle third wave of Covid-19||A week after chief minister Uddhav Thackeray struck a note of caution, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has come up with a plan to scale up infrastructure which will enable the city to tackle 2,500 moderate to severely symptomatic patients daily by setting up a 400-bed facility catering solely to children within a month, additional oxygen plants and oxygen refilling plants, and new Covid jumbo centres in anticipation of a possible third wave between July and September. In all, 6,000 oxygenated beds will be added to the current capacity of 11,200 and 1500 ICU beds will be added to the city’s current 2,900 beds. The focus will be on children’s well-being, civic officials said. The BMC will build a 400-bed Covid facility for children at the NESCO jumbo centre in Goregaon, which is expected to be ready within a month. It also plans to create crèches for children in Covid facilities to cater to families where both parents are infected and admitted. Apart from that, the BMC is planning to build four oxygen plants as well as stock up on medicines like Remdesivir, Tocilizumab injections, officials added. However, the officials did not give any timeline for when the oxygen plants or the crèches would be available, as yet. “We have decided to have at least 400- bed pediatric Covid-19 ward for children. We will also have a crèche where children will be taken care of in case both their parents are infected due to Covid-19. We are also considering having separate Covid wards for senior citizens. We want to be in a position to handle around 2,500 symptomatic patients who need hospitalisation daily, up from the 1,500 such patients [who needed hospitalization in] the second wave,” Sanjeev Jaiswal, additional municipal commissioner of BMC, said. “There may or may not be a third wave, but we need to prepare for it. Also, with mutations we also need to change our focus. In the first wave it was the elderly [who were most affected], [in the] second wave, [it was the] above 30-age group, and [in the] third wave it may be children [who could be affected]. Hence, we need to strategise accordingly,” Dr Shashank Joshi, member of Maharashtra Covid-19 task force said.The CM and Mumbai suburban guardian minister Aaditya Thackeray have held meetings with civic officials for preparations for a third wave since Saturday. As part of the BMC’s scale up, 1,500 beds were added to the NESCO centre, of which 1,000 beds are oxygenated. The NESCO jumbo centre, which was set up last year, will now have 3,700 beds. The city currently has six jumbo centres with 8,000 beds. Four more jumbo centres are expected to come up in next two months at Kanjurmarg, Malad, Sion and Mahalaxmi which will add another 7,000 beds.“If at all we announce any relaxation in lockdown by June 2021, there are several models that suggest a third wave might come between July to September 2021. We need to understand that these are just predictions and there is no surety about the third wave, but we need to be prepared for handling it, and hence we are constantly ramping up our health infrastructure,” Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner of the BMC, said. The state is under an effective lockdown which began on April 23, and it is expected to end on May 15. Experts argue that the lockdown is the most effective time to scale up infrastructure to tackle a spike in cases, which is likely to occur once the current restrictions on movement are relaxed.“Mumbai saw a massive spike last month and sustained it because of constant capacity increase in beds & facilities. As the virus mutates and targets different age groups, our response to it must actively mutate as well,” Aaditya Thackeray tweeted on Monday. “Historically about such scenarios there is a trend that the second wave is more damaging than the first wave, but the third wave is less damaging than the second wave. However, our preparations have to be obviously for more damage than the second wave,” state task force member Joshi said.Meanwhile, BMC chief Iqbal Singh Chahal on Monday appealed to more and more citizens to get tested as the city’s daily testing figures are falling down. “Our testing was more than doubled and had touched 56,000 tests on a single day in April but now it has been observed that the testing figures have fallen to around 28,000 on Sunday. It is likely to fall further during weekends. Our aggressive testing policy has resulted in reduction of positivity rate. This might have reduced the natural demand for home collection of swabs by our citizens in the last few days. We need to increase the testing to 40,000 per day, at least, if not more. I request you to appeal to our eminent citizens to come forward and test themselves to increase Covid testing to maximum possible level,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbais-plans-to-tackle-third-wave-of-covid19-101620071171184.html
04-05-2021||Other||Delhi RWAs ask govt to arrange oxygen for Covid patients in home care||New Delhi: Families of Covid-19 patients in home care have requested the government to make arrangements for oxygen cylinders and refills, with the boom in cases choking supplies and driving up prices.The shortages have meant that families must contend with travelling long distances, waiting for extended periods, and paying exorbitant rates for oxygen cylinders that may last just a few hours. Garvit Singhvi, a resident of Greater Kailash-1, said arranging oxygen support for his parents, who tested positive for Covid-19, was difficult. His father’s oxygen saturation had dropped to 85%. “We wanted to have oxygen support at home while we hunted for hospital beds. The first fight was to arrange an empty cylinder, which I got from a friend in Hisar. But getting it refilled was a struggle,” he said. “There was a long queue at one of the oxygen plants in Mohan Cooperative area. But we didn’t get the oxygen even after waiting for nearly three hours. We then somehow managed it from another plant after waiting for around five hours.”Singhvi said his parents were lucky to get admission in a hospital.SB Singh, president of Lajpat Nagar 3 RWA, said they have had difficulties getting oxygen cylinders refilled. The RWA has maintained 12 oxygen cylinders and one concentrator for its residents. He said, “It is difficult to find a place where we will get oxygen. A few days ago, we sent our volunteers to an oxygen plant in Naraina at 6am, but got just two cylinders, that too at 7pm.”He said all the cylinders in his area are in use. “While supply to hospitals should be the priority, we request the government to make arrangements to ensure that people in home care who need oxygen get it easily.”A district magistrate said, “The priority is first given to hospitals. But we have kept a quota of oxygen for people who are not in the hospital setup. The queues are long, but we are trying to ensure that people don’t have to wait long.”A senior official with the central district said, “We don’t have an oxygen plant in our district. People have to go to Mundka and Burari to get oxygen.”Satyajit Vaish, a resident of Panchsheel Park, who has been trying to arrange oxygen for residents in need, said, “There are so many people who are undergoing treatment at home, as they are finding it difficult to get a bed in the hospital. It is not possible for people to go out and stand in a queue for hours on end to get a cylinder refilled. We are trying to help people get oxygen at home. But getting the cylinders refilled is such a huge challenge. It is good that the government has regulated the supply to check on black-marketing, but there is a need to streamline the oxygen supply for people undergoing treatment at home.”RWAs said that earlier, they could get oxygen refilled from dealers in their areas. “But most oxygen refillers have stopped taking calls. Not everyone can travel to the oxygen plant. The government should make some provision to resolve this problem. There should be some more centres where people can go to get the cylinders refilled,” said Pankaj Agarwal, president of Safdarjung Enclave RWA.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/delhi-rwas-ask-govt-to-arrange-oxygen-for-covid-patients-in-home-care-101620070991186.html
04-05-2021||Delhi||Manish Sisodia writes to Rajnath Singh seeking army’s help to set up more beds, transport oxygen||Delhi’s deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia has written to Union defence minister Rajnath Singh urging him to mobilise the army to set up and run Covid-19 facilities, to augment bed strength by another 11,000, and ensure adequate supply and transportation of medical oxygen and 40,000 additional oxygen cylinders, as the Capital grapples with the tsunami of fresh infections and daily deaths, and people frantically search for oxygen and other medical essentials.Since Delhi is recording an average of 25,000 new cases every day, and about 10% of these require some form of hospitalisation, the additional health infrastructure will soon be at its capacity, Sisodia wrote in the letter dated May 2.“The army has always stood at the forefront during times of crisis, helped and protected the citizens of this great nation. I shall be grateful if your ministry could lend the services of our armed forces to set up, operationalise and run some Covid health facilities with about 10,000 oxygenated non-ICU beds and 1,000 ICU (beds). Since health infrastructure machinery is overwhelmed by the management of the existing hospitals and the upcoming Covid hospitals, it will be a timely help to the people of Delhi if the ministry of defence, with the considerable resources at its command, is tasked with the responsibility to provide and man the additional Covid health facilities,” Sisodia wrote.He also requested the defence ministry to arrange for the supply of medical oxygen for the Covid health facilities that will be set up.The letter came after the Delhi high court, on Saturday, directed the Delhi government to seek the help of the armed forces in getting oxygen and setting up more Covid facilities. On Saturday, the court also asked the Delhi government why nothing was done despite the court asking it two to three days ago to that to seek the help of the armed forces.While the defence ministry is yet to respond to the letter, the Centre informed the high court on Monday that defence minister Rajnath Singh is looking into the request of the Delhi government asking for the army’s help to set up hospitals with oxygenated and ICU beds.A bench of justices Vipin Sanghi and Rekha Palli was informed by additional solicitor general (ASG) Chetan Sharma that an officer was in contact with the defence minister, and they will let the court and amicus curiae know more details once they receive information.“The matter is now being looked into by the defence minister himself,” Sharma said.The court asked the Centre for a report on the matter, while stating that there was a “good case” to seek the army’s help.“…there is a good case made out for the army. It is a national calamity, no doubt about it,” the bench said.Delhi has 16,272 non-ICU oxygen beds and 4,866 ICU beds at the moment, and the Delhi government has said it will create an additional 15,000 oxygenated non-ICU beds and 1,200 ICU beds in the next 10 days. But it is yet unclear how it will get the oxygen to supply for these beds given that the Capital has been grappling with a shortage.Sisodia also urged the ministry to provide cryogenic tankers for the transport of liquid medical oxygen. “Additional allocation (of medical oxygen by the the Centre) has been made from plants located more than 1,500km from Delhi -- i.e. Durgapur, Rourkela and Kalinga Nagar. The government of Delhi, with necessary help from the government of India and other state governments, is augmenting the transport infrastructure by sourcing cryogenic tankers even from abroad. It would be an extraordinary help from the armed forces if the ministry can provide cryogenic tankers for transport of liquid medical oxygen,” he wrote in the letter.Delhi also needs the army’s help in procuring about 40,000 D-Type medical oxygen cylinders, the deputy CM said.“The operational details can be mutually worked out after receipt of in-principle approval from the defence ministry,” Sisodia wrote.The Covid-19 crisis in Delhi worsened in April, and was compounded by the scarcity of oxygen and beds.Taking note of the situation, the Supreme Court on Sunday issued an order asking the Centre to address Delhi’s oxygen issue by Monday midnight. It also asked the Centre to create a buffer stock of oxygen that can be used by all states.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/manish-sisodia-writes-to-rajnath-singh-seeking-army-s-help-to-set-up-more-beds-transport-oxygen-101620070691720.html

Officials said that the train from Hapa will halt at Gurgaon and the LMO will be transferred to trucks of the Delhi government and taken to the city. While another Oxygen Express train, carrying 30.86 tonnes of LMO from Angul in Odisha, will arrive in Delhi by Monday evening, railway ministry officials said this is meant for supply in Haryana. “Railways is set to deliver its biggest single day load of nearly 205 tonnes to Delhi by tomorrow morning,” the ministry said in a statement on Monday. The move is expected to give a breather to the national capital which has been facing an acute shortage of oxygen supply for the past few weeks. Several hospitals in Delhi have sent out desperate calls to authorities to replenish their oxygen supplies which dropped precariously and threatened lives as the health infrastructure was crumbling under the pressure of an unprecedented rise in the number of Covid patients requiring oxygen or ICU support.Till Sunday, Delhi received 454 MT of oxygen in the last 24-hours against its increased quota of 590 MT. The Delhi government has demanded 976 MT of medical oxygen to add 1,200 ICU and 15,000 oxygen beds.The central government last week directed states to ensure free movement of vehicles carrying oxygen amid reports of some states diverting the vehicles for local use while hospitals sent out frantic appeals for emergency supplies.“EG 2 (Empowered Group 2, formed by the PMO comprising officials from different ministries and experts) decides oxygen pipeline for states. EG 2 on Thursday set the ball rolling for mapping the sources of medical oxygen and their production capacity to match the requirement of 12 high-burden states, and has developed a framework to guide them,” railway ministry spokesperson said.“Oxygen pipeline is a railway operation term which means oxygen express trains on hand with us for various destinations (states) in the country. We have an online real-time system to monitor the movement (pipeline) of Oxygen Express trains. EG 2 group is already working since long and is closely monitoring the situation in the country. Officials of our Ministry are also part of it,” he explained.The national transporter has so far delivered around 1,125 tonnes of LMO in 76 tankers to various states. “Seven Oxygen Express trains are on the run currently, with 422 MT LMO in 27 tankers. Haryana will receive its fourth and fifth trains carrying nearly 72 MT LMO from Angul (Orissa) and Rourkela (Orissa),” the ministry said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/oxygen-express-trains-to-deliver-205-mt-of-oxygen-rlys-biggest-single-day-load-to-delhi-101620070691010.html

There were protests across the state against the decision on Monday, seeking the withdrawal of fresh restrictions. In Faridkot, a protest was carried out through the main-street of the town to the major market. Malkit Singh, a shopkeeper said that they don’t have any other alternative to generate revenue. “We are middle-class people and depend on our shops completely. Liquor shops are open and even government offices are working with 50% staff, so why can’t we open our shops? Our survival is at stake, we are ready to follow the strictest of covid norms, but we must remain open,” he added. Later, a local Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leader Gurdit Singh Sekhon led a delegation to meet deputy commissioner Vimal Kumar Setia and requested for some relief. In Sangrur and Barnala, protesters raised slogans against the government, adding that even a few-hour window to open shops will work for them. They also met Sangrur SDM and DC to seek relaxation in restrictions to ‘save’ their business.“The government says there is no lockdown, but our shops are being closed. This cannot work,” said Jaswinder Prince, chief of Sangrur Vyapar Mandal.In Patiala, Rakesh Gupta, president, Patiala District Beopar Mandal, said, “The authorities have failed to identify essential services, as police forcibly even shut grocery stores on Monday. When banks and government offices, which witness huge rush, are allowed to operate, then what crime have we done.” Fatehgarh Sahib-based readymade garment trader said the government should allow the traders to open their shops on rotational basis “We stocked up summer merchandise worth ₹40 lakh before the onset of summer season but it appears that sale will drop this year too, due to covid,” Gupta added.Patiala deputy commissioner Kumar Amit said traders and shopkeepers must support the government. In Jalandhar, Kapurthala and Shaheed Bhagat Singh Nagar districts of Doaba, it was business as usual for small towns, though in bigger cities, non-essential shops remains closed. Police was deployed in large numbers across Jalandhar city for implementation of restrictions. In SBS Nagar, police booked 15 people for violation of covid-19 norms. Over a 1,000 persons were fined for not following covid-19 guidelines, and their samples were also taken. In Kapurthala, deputy commissioner Deepti Uppal inspected Kapurthala city to ensure there was no violation of government orders.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/punjab-traders-protest-against-closure-of-shops-due-to-covid19-101620070032241.html
04-05-2021||Mumbai||AI pilots say many got Covid-19, want pay cuts to be rolled back||Air India’s Airbus pilots on Monday- appealed to civil aviation minister Hardeep Singh Puri to revert their pay cut that they term as “illegal”. A senior pilot with the Indian Commercial Pilots Association said, “...This deadlier second wave has gripped the country requiring travel restrictions on Indians worldwide due to the elevated risks of infection. The number of passengers and crew testing positive for COVID-19 has increased fourfold, and consequently, Air India pilots’ rate of infections has shot up drastically, likewise for our family members.”Despite raising their concerns through various meetings and representations, the pilots said they find it demoralising that even Puri’s office has not addressed any of their grievances. As a result, Air India pilots continue to bear the longest-standing pay cuts in the Indian market despite undertaking the longest and most diverse missions under the Vande Bharat scheme. The letter read, ‘We have not slowed down or disrupted work in any way despite having been exploited shamelessly by the management under the guise of this pandemic. We haven’t even been categorized as front line workers despite having been at the frontline from day one alongside other frontline workers in the country like the medical staff. Ironically, we were the first to get a pay cut but are the last to be considered for vaccination.’ The pilots pointed out that the increasing frequency of Vande Bharat Mission (VBM) flights has also led to their increased workload and also the risk of getting infected. They also said that even after taking all possible precautions, many of the airline pilots are struggling for their lives in the hospital.Making an urgent appeal to Puri to reverse the long-standing pay cut the letter read, “If we cannot get the support from management and ministry that we deserve, the least that can be done is to restore our rightful wages so that if the worst comes to pass, we can provide for our family‘s immediate medical needs and future well-being.”Air India spokesperson said, “We would not like to make any comment on such internal issues.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/aipilots-say-many-got-covid-19-want-pay-cuts-to-be-rolled-back-101620069910827.html

04-05-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra’s vaccination drive slows down for want of doses||For a third day in a row, Maharashtra’s daily Covid-19 vaccinations went below the 100,000 mark owing to the unavailability of doses, resulting in fewer inoculation sessions across the state.There is uncertainty over the full-fledged resumption of the drive from Tuesday, as the state is yet to get its fresh stock of 1.05 million doses, promised to be delivered in the next three days by the Centre. From 534,228 doses, the state’s highest one-day inoculation figures, administered on April 26, Maharashtra’s daily numbers dropped to 47,613 on May 2 and 78,759 on May 3, according to figures on the CoWIN portal. After keeping the number of daily inoculations over 100,000 doses throughout April, it dropped below the mark for the past three days. In April alone, 10 million doses were administered in Maharashtra. Even after launching the third phase for beneficiaries in the 18-44 age group on May 1, the day’s count stood at 95,240. The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare said the state will get 1,050,000 more doses in three days. The ministry has stated that as of 8am on Monday, the state has administered 16,338,923 of the 16,362,470 doses supplied by the Centre. The state government has merely 23,547 doses with it, as of Monday.State authorities said many centres were shut on Monday for both the 18-44 and above 45 age groups, owing to the non-availability of doses.“After supplying about 16 million doses in 110 days of the drive for the beneficiaries above 45 years, the supply has now come down by half from May 1, as per the changed policy. This means the vaccination rate will dwindle to half of its pace in April henceforth for 45-plus beneficiaries because of reduction in the supply by the Centre. The pace of the vaccination for the age groups of 18-44 years cannot pick up unless we procure the stock from two domestic manufacturers — Serum Institute of India (Covishield) and Bharat Biotech (Covaxin),” said an official from the health department.According to the changed policy by the Centre, half of the vaccines manufactured by these two players, will go to the government of India, while the remaining half will be available for procurement by state governments, private hospitals and industrial sector. Dr DN Patil, state immunisation officer, said they expect a fresh stock of about 450,000 doses of Covaxin in the next couple of days for the age group of 18-44 years. “After we received 300,000 doses of Covishield, we rolled out the third phase from May 1 with 3 to 10 centres per district for the age group. We will add similar number of centres after getting a fresh stock of Covaxin,” he said.The state government has placed a demand for 120 million doses at the rate of 20 million a month as it wishes to complete vaccination of 57.1 million people in the age group of 18-44 years in six months. According to the officials, though the state is ready to import the doses of other vaccines from manufacturers like Pfizer and Johnson & Johnson , there is no stock available in the international market. The officials feel that the pace of vaccination is expected to be low through the entire month of May.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtras-vaccination-drive-slows-down-for-want-of-doses-101620068170412.html

04-05-2021||Chandigarh||70% doses reserved for people with comorbidities in 18-45 age group in May||With the state getting 3.30 lakh vaccines for 18-45 years category from the Serum Institute of India for May, chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh on Monday ordered 70% of the doses to be reserved for individuals with comorbidities, and the remaining 30% for high-risk category of employees and workers in this age group. Chairing a virtual review meeting, Amarinder said that within these groups, district-wise allocation has also been prioritised based on population index, mortality and density. The state government had last week ordered 30-lakh doses of Covishield directly from the SII. “Given the severe supply constraints, it has been decided to limit the vaccination for 18-44 age group in this phase to major urban centres,” he said, expressing concern that even for the 45+ age group, the state was in short supply, as a result of which only a few vaccine centres were currently functioning. He said the state expects 2 lakh doses to arrive tomorrow for vaccination of 45+ category. Of the 33,46,500 Covishield doses received so far, a total of 32,91,0450 have already been utilised. The Union ministry of health and family welfare has allocated 6.2 lakh doses, including 4.7 lakh Covishield and 1.5 lakh Covaxin, for the state during the first fortnight of this month for free vaccination of 45+ population. In the 18-44 age group for May, the maximum allocation of 50% has been prioritised for Group A of the most affected districts of SAS Nagar, Jalandhar, Ludhiana, Amritsar, Bathinda and Patiala, according to an official spokesperson. Another 30% has been reserved for the Group B districts of Hoshiarpur, Pathankot, SBS Nagar, Faridkot, Kapurthala and Gurdaspur, while 20% will be utilised in the other districts that have the least cases at present. These decisions have been taken in accordance with the vaccine strategy recommended by the state’s vaccine expert committee. The committee recommended that when further doses are available or as the epidemiologic situation changes, the prioritisation framework may be modified. Obesity, disabilities included  in list of comorbidities Accepting the recommendations of the committee, the chief minister approved expansion of the list of comorbidities to include obesity (BMI>30), disabilities (e.g. spinal cord injury) and multiple co-morbidities determined to increase risk by a treating physician, in addition to those specified by the central government. He pointed out that since individuals with co-morbidities are at highest risk of severe disease and deaths, it was imperative to vaccinate them on priority. For the remaining 30%, the CM said that while the strategic roadmap contains a list of professions at risk, given the limitation of vaccine availability, for the month of May, the top three categories have been chosen. These are government employees, construction workers, teachers and other staff at government and private educational establishments. The committee has also recommended that increased doses be sought in partnership with private sector and other sources for allocation of available doses.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/70-doses-reserved-for-people-with-comorbities-in-18-45-age-group-in-may-101620065356350.html

While the doses were reported as limited last week, there is no stock at all this time and many vaccination centres are not functioning. No one has a clear idea when the doses will be available,” said Pingale.Malvika Jha, 49, is awaiting her second dose after the first taken on April 2.“I took my first dose as soon as the age group above 45 years old was open for getting vaccinated.

04-05-2021||Pune||Monday musings: From the bubonic plague to Covid, Pune’s crematoria burn through memories||Crematoria have never been in such focus as they are today in India. Pyres are burning round the clock as Covid fatalities surge every day. The foreign and Indian press has shown images from cremation grounds from across the country, much to the criticism of some. In Pune, the wait for cremation is extended, as 170-180 bodies are being brought in daily, although official figures reported by the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) and the State health department do not match with records from the crematoria. Is this the first-time the city is witnessing such scenes? During the 1896-97 bubonic plague that hit the city, Pune, then called Poona by the British ruling the nation, saw scenes as scores of bodies were cremated one after another. There’s no precise record of the actual number of fatalities, though old reports and historians such as Mandar Lawate, say that around 5,000 deaths were recorded in Pune between October 1896 and May 1897. Given that the population of city - including those residing in municipal limits, cantonments and the suburbs – was 0.161 million, the fatality rate was in the range of 3.1 %. With many succumbing to the plague, Pune’s Omkareshwar ghat on the banks of the Mutha was flooded with bodies being cremated for months. During the period, the ghat stretching from Omkareshwar temple to Lakdi pul (near Deccan), was the only place for cremating bodies as compared to 21 crematoria that Pune has today. Pyres were seen burning from a distance, day and night, as being witnessed these days in many cities. “The situation was grim. British officer WC Rand had appointed police personnel to note down records of bodies coming in to the cremation ghat. Once the body was cremated, police used to visit the residence of deceased as part of a house-to-house search for infected patients and suspects. However, the search wasn’t just limited to identifying suspects. The houses where patients succumbed to the plague were cleaned, fumigated, dug-up (to destroy rats) and lime washed. The family members of the deceased used to be taken to a segregation camp at Swargate, while infected patients were shifted to a temporary facility at Sangam ghat near Shivajinagar,” said Lawate. Sassoon hospital was reserved largely for British or European patients, while special plague hospitals were erected in various parts of the city, one each for the Hindu, Muslim, and Parsi communities. More than the grief of passing away of loved ones, locals from Pune were extremely unhappy with suppressive measures by 34-year-old Walter Charles Rand, an Oxford-educated officer of the Indian Civil Service, to contain the plague. Rand was serving in Satara when he was appointed on February 10, 1897, as an assistant collector and chairman, Poona Plague Committee. In his plague report drafted in July 1897, Rand, in his introductory remarks mentioned: “The outbreak of bubonic plague with which I have to deal with in this report is the first that has occurred in Poona within the memory of living man, while of the occurrence of a similar epidemic in former times I am not aware of any authentic record. At the time of the present outbreak, the disease was quite unknown to the inhabitants of this part of India.” On containment measures, Rand explained in detail the gravity of the disease and urgency with which it had to be dealt. “There was, it is true, no Indian example of the suppression by strong measures, of an epidemic of the plague which had established itself in a large town, but the possibility of so suppressing the disease had been demonstrated at Hong Kong in 1894. It was certain that if the plague was not to be allowed to run its course, but was to be stamped out of Poona, stringent measures would have to be taken,” Rand observed in his report made available by National Library of Scotland. The report was later submitted to the British regime in England by RA Lamb, chairman, Poona Plague Committee, post Rand’s assassination by the Chapekar brothers. As the discontent against Rand grew in Poona, Damodar, Balkrisha and Vasudev shot Rand and Lieutenant Charles Ayerst at Ganeshkhind (now Pune University). While Ayerst died immediately, Rand succumbed to the injuries on July 3, 1897. Scared by the pandemic, many fled the city and took shelter at Fergusson College, which then was outside Pune. The situation was reported in great details by Lokmanya Tilak’s “Kesari”, then a weekly newspaper. The plague took a break intermittently and returned every after few years, though its intensity lowered. Like Covid, the bubonic plague did not discriminate between rich and poor. At the same time, many came forward to help, just as the Pune, in the grip of Covid, is seeing today.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/monday-musings-from-the-bubonic-plague-to-covid-pune-s-crematoria-burn-through-memories-101620038466378.html

The landscape planning should include plantation of native species. A minimum of 1 tree for every 80 sqm of land should be planted and maintained. The existing trees will be counted for this purpose. The species with heavy foliage, broad leaves and wide canopy cover are desirable. Water intensive and/or invasive species should not be used for landscaping,” it noted.It also said that there should be two continuous online Ambient Air Quality Monitoring stations in the project area before the start of demolition work. “As committed, at least 50 anti-smog guns and 15 anti-smog towers shall be provided to curb air pollution during construction phase. 15 anti-smog towers shall be installed during operation phase as proposed,” it added.Kanchi Kohli, legal researcher, Centre for Policy Research, said, “The Central Vista project has been broken up into several components: a new parliament, Central Vista avenue and now this consolidated proposal which still does not include the Prime Minister’s Office, as the land use change for that is still pending.

04-05-2021||World||UK factory activity expands at fastest rate since 1994||British manufacturing activity grew at the fastest pace in almost 27 years last month, amid supply chain delays and shortages of raw materials, as businesses tried to make up for ground lost during the coronavirus pandemic.The IHS Markit/CIPS Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) for manufacturing activity rose to 60.9 in April from 58.9 in March, slightly above an earlier flash estimate of 60.7 and its highest reading since July 1994.New orders rose at the fastest pace since November 2013, and two-thirds of businesses expect production to be higher in a year's time.But the index was also lifted by lengthening delivery times and rising costs of raw materials - factors which sometimes indicate an imminent pick-up but which are currently hampering growth."The sector remained beset by supply-chain delays and input shortages ... which contributed to increased purchasing costs and record selling price inflation," IHS Markit said.Price pressures are on the radar of the Bank of England as it finalises new forecasts and policy decisions ahead of their release on Thursday, though the central bank is likely to look through price rises caused by short-term disruptions.A narrower measure of manufacturing output alone showed weaker growth than the broader activity index. Output grew faster in August when many manufacturers had not long reopened after Britain's first lockdown.Britain's economy shrank by almost 10% last year - the biggest fall in output in more than 300 years - and even with rapid growth this year it may take until 2022 for it to regain its pre-crisis size, a slower rebound than the United States.Manufacturers are still dealing with the knock-on impact of COVID-19 disruptions which have increased shipping costs and led to shortages of key components such as microchips used for car electronics.British firms also face greater friction trading with their European Union counterparts due to trade barriers which came into force on Jan. 1 due to Brexit, though IHS Markit said this was proving less troublesome than feared.Overall confidence rose to its highest in seven years."Optimism reflected expectations for less disruption related to COVID-19 and Brexit, economic recovery, improved client confidence and planned new product launches," IHS Markit said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-factory-activity-expands-at-fastest-rate-since-1994-101620117895693.html

But it has warned that Afghanistan would suffer isolation and sanctions if it backslides on human rights.A February 2020, U.S.-Taliban accord struck by the Trump administration specified a May 1 deadline for completion of a U.S. troop withdrawal from America's longest war.Biden, however, decided to complete the withdrawal before the anniversary of the Sept. 11, 2001, al Qaeda attacks on the United States that triggered the U.S.-led invasion.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taliban-would-roll-back-afghan-women-s-rights-us-intelligence-report-101620148927883.html
04-05-2021||World||Sri Lankan Parliament postpones debate on China-backed Colombo port city bill||The Sri Lankan Parliament on Tuesday postponed a debate on the controversial Colombo Port City Economic Commission Bill which was scheduled for discussion on Wednesday.All party leaders in the House agreed that the debate should be rescheduled as the Supreme Court's determination on the constitutionality of the bill had not yet reached Parliament, officials said.The USD 1.4-billion Colombo Port City project, expected to play a key role in China's ambitious 'Maritime Silk Road' project in India's backyard, is said to be the single largest private sector development in the island.China has built the port city on reclaimed sea, adjoining the Port of Colombo.The Colombo Port City Economic Commission Bill aims to provide for a special economic zone to establish a commission to grant registrations, licenses, authorisations and other approvals to operate business in such economic zones.As per the schedule on Wednesday, the Supreme Court's determination of the bill was to be read in Parliament by Speaker Mahinda Yapa Abeywardena before the House was opened to debate on it. However, the determination has not yet reached Parliament.The apex court had concluded the examination of the bill on April 23. The Supreme Court has heard 18 petitions filed against the bill by the Opposition parties and civil groups.Some of the pleas called for the Supreme Court to order a national referendum and a vote of two-thirds majority in Parliament to pass the bill.The bill was gazetted on March 24 and placed in the order paper of Parliament on April 9. While the Opposition parties demanded the bill be debated upon for at least three days, the government had scheduled the debate for just one day.The Opposition has questioned the government on why was it rushing ahead with the bill.Petitioners have branded the Port Commission Bill as a threat to the sovereignty of Sri Lanka, objecting to a clause which allows foreign persons to form the board of the commission.Some groups have claimed that the port city could end up becoming a Chinese colony, if the bill is approved in its present form.Sri Lanka, in recent years, has carried out various development projects with an estimated USD 8-billion in loans.The huge Chinese loans sparked concerns globally, after Sri Lanka handed over the Hambantota Port to China in 2017 as debt swap, amounting to USD 1.2 billion for a 99-years lease.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/sri-lankan-parliament-postpones-debate-on-china-backed-colombo-port-city-bill-101620133743082.html
04-05-2021||World||Covid in US: Biden admin to reallocate vaccines to states with greater interest||The Biden administration will begin shifting how it allocates Covid-19 shots to states, moving doses from states with lower demand to those with stronger interest in vaccines, an administration official said Tuesday.The change away from a strict by-population allocation comes as demand for the coronavirus vaccines has dropped nationwide, but especially precipitously in some areas, with some states turning down part or all of their weekly dose allotments. The federal government will now shift some of those doses to areas with higher demand, in an effort to speed shots in those areas.The administration says those states would have the shots available whenever demand for vaccines in their states increases — a key priority of the Biden administration.Governors were informed of the change by the White House Tuesday morning. The Washington Post first reported on the new allocation.This week, Iowa turned down nearly three quarters of the vaccine doses available to the state for next week from the federal government because demand for the shots remains weak.Individual states have made similar shifts internally to account for changing demand. Last week, Washington state changed the way it allocates coronavirus vaccine to its counties. Previously the state doled out supplies to counties proportionate to their populations. But Gov. Jay Inslee said Thursday that the amounts now will be based on requests from health care providers.The official who confirmed the reallocation decision spoke on the condition of anonymity before the news was shared publicly,||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-in-us-biden-admin-to-reallocate-vaccines-to-states-with-greater-interest-101620146612016.html
04-05-2021||World||Canada taken to court over Covid policy that pushes asylum-seekers to US||Canada's pandemic-era policy of turning back asylum-seekers trying to enter between official border crossings is unlawful and violates their rights, a legal action filed on Tuesday alleges.The Canadian Association of Refugee Lawyers filed the legal action in federal court claiming the policy is unlawful because it fails to consider the situation of asylum-seekers and whether they have reasonable alternatives available.The policy also denies asylum-seekers their right to a hearing, according to a copy of the legal action seen by Reuters.It is the first legal action against this policy since it was instituted in response to Covid-19 in March 2020.Between March 21, 2020, and April 20, 2021, Canada turned back 387 asylum-seekers trying to cross between ports of entry, according to the Canada Border Services Agency.Even though Canada said they could return at a later date to make refugee claims, the legal action argues Canada is not ensuring that the turning away of refugees is temporary.Canada has previously said the turn-back policy, which it has been renewing monthly, is a necessary public health measure. Canada also says it has assurances from the United States that "most" asylum-seekers will be returned to Canada to pursue refugee claims.But the United States deported at least one asylum-seeker turned back under this policy, according to the man's lawyer and correspondence seen by Reuters. Others were held in a detention centre.Canada's Public Safety Minister could not immediately be reached for comment.Burundian Apollinaire Nduwimana tried to cross into Canada in October at Roxham Road, which has become a common destination for asylum-seekers skirting the Safe Third Country Agreement (STCA).Under the STCA, asylum-seekers crossing at a formal port of entry along the Canada-U.S. border are turned around and are often held in U.S. immigration detention. Last month, the Federal Court of Appeal upheld the contested agreement after a lower court ruled the pact violated asylum-seekers' fundamental rights under the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.Nduwimana aimed to avoid being turned back under the STCA, only to be turned back under the new policy. Canadian border officers handed him to U.S. authorities, who, he says, brought him to the immigration detention centre at Batavia, New York.According to his lawyers, U.S. authorities tried multiple times to deport him to Burundi, to which Canada has deferred deportations for reasons of humanitarian crisis.Nduwimana is not directly affected by this legal action. But his case demonstrates the potential repercussions of this policy, lawyers say.He was allowed to enter Canada under an exemption to the turn-back policy after being detained for five months. He has now filed a refugee claim.He was one of nine turned-back asylum-seekers granted a national interest exemption letter by Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Minister Marco Mendicino. According to the government, seven have come to Canada.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canada-taken-to-court-over-covid-policy-that-pushes-asylum-seekers-to-us-101620145688555.html

Whoever violates the television and video law, especially people using satellite dishes, shall be punished with one year imprisonment and a fine of 500,000 kyat ($320)," MRTV state television said."Illegal media outlets are broadcasting news that undermines national security, the rule of law and public order, and encouraging those who commit treason."In the face of widespread opposition, the junta has struggled to impose order since overthrowing elected leader Aung San Suu Kyi and ending an unsteady transition to democracy.Violence has spiralled since the coup and security forces have killed more than 760 civilians, the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners (AAPP) advocacy group says. The junta disputes the figure and says 24 police and soldiers have died in the protests.Myanmar media reported that five people were killed by at least one parcel bomb on Tuesday, including an ousted lawmaker and three police officers who had joined a civil disobedience movement opposing military rule.Meanwhile, the Chinland Defence Force, a newly formed militia in Chin state bordering India, said on its Facebook page on Tuesday that its forces had killed at least four Myanmar army soldiers and wounded 10 in a clash overnight.The Myanmar army did not comment on the claim.Villagers had found the beheaded body of a junta appointed local administrator in the northwestern Sagaing region, independent broadcaster DVB reported, a day after another local official was stabbed to death in the biggest city, Yangon.Reuters was unable to reach local police for comment.Pro-democracy supporters held protests on Tuesday in the second-biggest city of Mandalay, including one by education staff calling for a boycott of schools and universities when they reopen in June, Myanmar Now reported.The junta said it had to seize power because its complaints of fraud in a November election won by Suu Kyi's party were not addressed by an election commission that deemed the vote fair.Suu Kyi, 75, has been detained since the coup along with many other members of her party.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/myanmar-announces-ban-on-satellite-tv-as-security-threat-101620140231363.html

On Tuesday, it confirmed five new locally acquired cases.The stricter measures, which will be effective from May 8, include extending checks on where incoming travellers have been to three weeks earlier, instead of two weeks currently.All visitors with a recent travel history in higher risk countries and who arrive from Saturday onwards will also need to be ini quarantine for 21 days, instead of 14.Social gathering will also be limited to five people, while indoor gyms and fitness studios will be shut.The new measures amount to the tightest local restrictions since Singapore started easing curbs in the middle of last year after a partial lockdown.Among infections detected in the latest Covid-19 cluster in a hospital, nine out of 40 cases had already been fully vaccinated."Because of vaccination, these cases are either asymptomatic or had mild symptoms, and none has required oxygen so far," said health minister Gan Kim Yong."Therefore vaccination remains an important tool to help lower the risk of infection and severe disease," he said.The minister also said authorities could not rule out a return to a partial lockdown again, if the situation worsened.Though Singapore's daily cases are only a fraction of the number being reported among Singapore's Southeast Asian neighbours, a jump in infections would be a setback for the Asian business hub, which has successfully contained its earlier outbreaks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/singapore-tightens-covid-19-curbs-as-overseas-virus-variants-emerge-101620132786197.html

It saw its contribution to global output collapse by 49% to 4.7 trillion dollars in 2020, causing the loss of 62 million jobs, according to the World Travel and Tourism Council. International visitor spending plunged by an unprecedented 69%.“We emphasize that the resumption of travel and tourism is crucial for global economic recovery because of the direct and indirect economic impact this sector has on others,” the document said. The pandemic is an opportunity to “shape a more resilient, sustainable and inclusive tourism sector,” it also said.Thomas Bareiss, a deputy German economy minister who took part in the virtual meeting, said a new start for tourism after the pandemic should be guided by the principle of “build back better.”“We agreed that we want a more resilient, more sustainable and more inclusive tourism sector in order to be better equipped for the future,” Bareiss said in an emailed statement.The ministers are set to back efforts for safe mobility, coordinating with initiatives including the European Union’s Digital Green Certificate. That document will show the bearer has been fully vaccinated, has immunity via recovery, or recently tested negative.EU member states would reopen borders to travelers from countries with relatively low infection rates, as well as those who are fully vaccinated against Covid-19, under a proposal unveiled on Monday.

The meeting was told that Pakistan's agreement with the EU did not include any condition with regard to religion.Pakistan had made a total of eight agreements with the EU on various human rights issues including human freedom, enforced disappearances, women rights and minority rights.The meeting was told that the country would suffer an annual loss of $3billion if the EU revokes its GSP status.In January 2014, the EU granted Pakistan status under its flagship trading scheme, the General Scheme of Preferences Plus (GSP ).The GSP provides enhanced and preferential free trade between the EU and a small list of countries that are meant to be among those developing countries with the best human rights records.According to the October 2019 report of the United States Commission on International Religious Freedom, at least 80 people have been convicted of blasphemy in Pakistan and many of them face the death penalty.In December 2020, the U.S. House of Representatives passed a resolution calling the worldwide repeal of blasphemy, heresy and apostasy laws, some of which have resulted in the imprisonment and/or deaths of Christians accused of speaking against Islam.Pakistan's blasphemy laws, both in content and application, are contrary to Pakistan's human rights obligations to respect and protect the right to life, freedom of thought, conscience and religion or belief, freedom of opinion and expression, equality before the law, prohibition of discrimination and the right to life.

04-05-2021||World||Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu faces midnight deadline to form government||Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu faced a midnight deadline Tuesday to form a government, a daunting task that would likely require convincing the Jewish far right to cooperate with an Islamic party.Netanyahu, who is on trial for corruption, was given a 28-day window to forge a majority coalition following a March 23 general election, Israel's fourth inconclusive vote in less than two years.The prime minister's right-wing Likud party won the most seats in the vote, but as results came in on election day, it became clear that he would again struggle to secure a majority in the 120-seat parliament.Over the past month, Israeli media have been rife with speculation about possible deals that could see Netanyahu extend his record 12 consecutive years in power.But hours before his negotiating window was due to expire at 2100 GMT, the core obstacles facing the 71-year-old premier remained largely unchanged since the morning after the vote.A coalition will require coming to terms with his estranged former protege Naftali Bennett, leader of the hawkish Yamina party.It will also require persuading the far-right Religious Zionism alliance to tacitly cooperate with the Islamic conservative Raam party.'End of Zionism'Religious Zionism has vowed not to sit in such a coalition.Orit Strok, a lawmaker from the party who lives in a settlement in Hebron in the occupied West Bank, told army radio that sitting with Raam would "bring a Trojan horse into the government of Israel" and mean "the end of Zionism."Netanyahu said Thursday that he had offered Bennett to serve as premier ahead of him if that would help maintain the right's hold on power.Bennett immediately replied that he never asked Netanyahu for the opportunity to be prime minister."I asked him to form a government, which, unfortunately, he cannot do," Bennett said.Political scientist Gayil Talshir of Hebrew University said a Netanyahu-Bennett arrangement was doomed because it would require support from Likud defector Gideon Saar, whose New Hope party won six seats.Saar has maintained that he is committed to ousting Netanyahu."Bennett did not say no to (Netanyahu's) offer, he just said it's not realistic," Talshir told AFP.As his coalition talks faced roadblocks, Netanyahu has also floated the idea of passing legislation that would enable direct election of a prime minister.He would need 61 Knesset votes to do it, unlikely given the election results, but Talshir said: "This is what Netanyahu tries to do now, to get the legislation passed."Eyes on Lapid?Netanyahu has a reputation as a political survivor and may yet have more moves to make."This is a day for people with strong nerves," political commentator Sima Kadmon wrote in the Yediot Aharonot newspaper."As always, nobody knows what trick Netanyahu intends to pull out of his hat at the last minute."Barring a breakthrough before midnight, President Reuven Rivlin can reclaim the mandate.He could give opposition leader Yair Lapid, whose centrist Yesh Atid party finished second in the March vote, 28 days to try to form a government, or he could ask parliament to recommend its own candidate for the premiership."It's time for a new government," Lapid said Tuesday."In one more day, if nothing happens, we will be faced with two options: an Israeli national unity government, solid, decent and hard working, or a fifth election."The coalition deadline comes just days after 45 mainly ultra-Orthodox Jewish pilgrims were killed in a stampede in Mount Meron in northern Israel.A government investigation has been opened into the tragedy, called one of Israel's worst peacetime disasters.Lapid said it was "preventable," assigning blame in part to the fact that Israel "does not have a functioning government."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/israeli-pm-benjamin-netanyahu-faces-midnight-deadline-to-form-government-101620127860545.html

I've got no family left if you don't help me. Everybody will die. Help me, help me," she pleaded.Cameroon's two western Anglophone regions have been gripped by fighting since 2017 as English-speaking rebels try to break away from the predominantly Francophone government.More than 3,500 people have died and 700,000 have been displaced in the violence with both sides accused of committing atrocities.The woman later told Australia's Special Broadcasting Service (SBS) she had made the public display to ask Morrison to help desperate people seeking asylum from Cameroon."There are people seeking asylum and Australia must try to help them escape," the woman told the broadcaster, identifying herself only as Lillian.Under Canberra's immigration policy, asylum-seekers who reach Australia are sent to Australian-run detention camps offshore.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/australian-pm-morrison-hears-emotional-plea-for-cameroonian-asylumseekers-101620123776716.html
04-05-2021||World||EU drug regulator starts review of China's Sinovac Covid-19 vaccine||The European Union’s drug regulator announced Tuesday that it has started a rolling review of China’s Sinovac coronavirus vaccine to assess its effectiveness and safety, a first step toward possible approval for use in the 27-nation bloc.The European Medicines Agency said Tuesday that its decision to start the review is based on preliminary results from laboratory studies and clinical studies.“These studies suggest that the vaccine triggers the production of antibodies” that fight the coronavirus “and may help protect against the disease,” the agency said in a statement.The EMA, which so far has approved four coronavirus vaccines, added that no application seeking marketing authorization for the Sinovac vaccine has been submitted yet. The agency also is conducting rolling reviews of three other vaccines: the one developed by German biotech company CureVac, the American-developed Novavax and Russia's Sputnik V.The agency said its experts will “evaluate data as they become available to decide if the benefits outweigh the risks” of the vaccine. The rolling review will continue until “enough evidence is available for a formal marketing authorization application,” the EMA said, adding that it could not predict timelines.The announcement from the Amsterdam-based agency came a day after a top World Health Organization official said the WHO is set to decide this week whether to approve two Chinese COVID-19 vaccines for emergency use.Such approval would mark the first time that a Chinese vaccine had been granted a so-called emergency use listing from the U.N. health agency, and would trigger a broader rollout of Chinese vaccines that are already being used in some countries beyond China.Mariangela Simao, assistant director-general for access to medicines, vaccines and pharmaceuticals, says some “final arrangements” remain to be made before the crucial word from a WHO technical advisory group comes on the Sinopharm and Sinovac vaccines.China and a number of other countries, including Brazil, Mexico, Indonesia and Turkey, already are using the Sinovac vaccine, which is made using killed or inactivated coronavirus.No Phase 3 study data on the vaccine has yet been published in peer-reviewed journals. The vaccine has been studied in several countries. The most closely watched research involved about 12,000 health workers in Brazil, where researchers reported 50.7% effectiveness against symptomatic COVID-19 and much stronger protection against severe disease.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/eu-drug-regulator-starts-review-of-china-s-sinovac-covid-19-vaccine-101620127385029.html

Biden signed a proclamation restricting travel from India, with some exceptions, after the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) updated India’s Covid-19 assessment from Level 3 to Level 4, the highest level on its scale. The CDC has warned that even vaccinated travellers “may be at risk for getting and spreading” coronavirus variants.The United Kingdom has already put India on its ‘red list’, which means foreigners who have been in or through India in the previous 10 days will be refused entry to the UK. Those with British or Irish nationality, or with residence rights in the UK, will be able to enter Britain on the condition of mandatory quarantine in a government-approved hotel for 10 days. The Australian government recently imposed a ban on its citizens from returning home if they have spent time in India up to 14 days before flying back. Any requirement of flight operation will need special permission from the embassy.Here’s the list of other countries that have restricted flights from India:||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-travel-ban-these-countries-have-restricted-flights-to-and-from-india-101620125693859.html

"We don't have enough raw materials, we don't have enough manufacturing in the right places, so it is allowing the nations that have manufacturing in place to hoard their vaccines, so we got to fix that piece."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/melinda-gates-sees-us-government-donating-covid-19-vaccine-doses-soon-101620126656812.html

04-05-2021||World||Covid-19 lockdown rules to end on June 21, says Boris Johnson||British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said coronavirus lockdown rules are set to be scrapped in seven weeks’ time, as he hailed the U.K.’s successful vaccine rollout ahead of key elections this week.On the campaign trail, Johnson said the pandemic data was likely to allow people in England to stay overnight with friends or relations, with indoor hospitality able to reopen from May 17.Remaining social distancing rules are also likely to be canceled from June 21, he added, although he warned that international travel will need to be carefully monitored after May 17 to avoid reimporting the virus again.The prime minister is making his case to millions of voters in England, Wales and Scotland who are taking part in elections on May 6. At stake is who gets to govern London and Scotland, as well as more than 140 local English districts. In Scotland, the prospect of a new referendum on independence from the rest of the U.K. hangs in the balance, depending on the result.The U.K.’s Future May Be in the Hands of Scotland’s Rebel YouthAfter a year on the back foot defending a pandemic strategy that delivered the worst death toll in Europe, Johnson has spent much of 2021 championing his government’s success at rolling out vaccines faster than most other wealthy nations.“With the vaccine rollout going the way that it is - we have done 50 million jabs as I speak to you today, quarter of the adult population, one in four, have had two jabs,” the premier said on a visit to Hartlepool in northeastern England Monday. “You are seeing the results of that really starting to show up.”Johnson’s Popularity Faces a Key Test in a Brexit HeartlandHe said the next stage in the government’s plan to gradually ease lockdown on May 17 was on track. “But it also looks to me as though we’ll be able to say social distancing as we currently have to do it, the one-meter plus, I think we have got a good chance of being able to dispense with the one-meter plus from June 21.”Currently under “one-meter plus” guidelines, people are advised to maintain a distance of at least a meter from each other indoors, while wearing a face covering or taking other protective measures. Removing the rule could allow businesses and citizens to return to something closer to pre-pandemic normality.Foreign TravelBut speaking on Tuesday, Trade Secretary Liz Truss urged people to hold off booking overseas holidays until the so-called travel task force issues its findings. The government has previously said non-essential travel will be allowed from May 17 at the earliest.“The really important thing is that we don’t move too fast and jeopardize the progress we’ve made, so people will have to wait a bit longer, I’m afraid, to be able to hear the news on exactly what’s happening on the travel front,” Truss told Sky News. “We need to be cautious and we need to make sure that we’re not simply importing the virus after we’ve successfully dealt with it in Britain.”Thursday’s elections take place against a difficult backdrop for Johnson. He’s beset by questions over whether he broke rules in the way he funded the refurbishment of his official apartment, following weeks of negative headlines about his conduct and the actions of some of his senior ministers. On Sunday, a senior Tory said the premier would have to resign if he’d broken the rules.“I know that people want to focus on trivia, but I’m focusing on the issues that matter,” Johnson said Monday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-lockdown-rules-to-end-on-june-21-says-boris-johnson-101620120100849.html

Starting on Monday, any user with at least 600 followers can be a host, the company added.Twitter introduced Spaces last year to compete with viral app Clubhouse, which jump-started the audio chat trend and attracted celebrities and entrepreneurs, but remains limited as an invite-only app.Over the coming months, Twitter said a limited group of users will be able to sell tickets to access their Spaces conversations, and will determine their own pricing and how many tickets to make available. Hosts will keep the majority of the revenue, while Twitter will earn a "small amount," the company added.The move is part of Twitter's effort to be a bigger player in the "creator economy," as influencers and independent writers are increasingly earning money from their content on platforms like YouTube or Substack.Facebook last month announced its own plans for audio chat features, and also said it would allow listeners to tip hosts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/twitter-to-introduce-ticketing-for-audio-spaces-feature-101620118259680.html
04-05-2021||World||Fauci advises India to marshal all resources, including Army, to fight Covid-19||Terming the situation in India “very desperate”, America's top public health expert Dr Anthony Fauci has suggested the government marshal all its resources, including the armed forces, to immediately build makeshift field hospitals, and urged other countries to help with not only materials but also personnel.In an exclusive interview to PTI, Fauci, who is the Chief Medical Adviser to US President Joe Biden, also called for a nationwide lockdown, not necessarily for six months but “for a few weeks” to break the “continuity and transmission of infection.”Dr. Fauci’s suggestions and dire assessment of India came as the number of new Covid infections in India officially passed 2 crore, almost double the number three months ago. Of these more than 2,20,000 people have died, according to official figures.In contrast, the United States has recorded 3.2 crore cases and 5,77,000 deaths in a population that’s one-fourth of India’s 120 crore since the pandemic began. Still, because of India’s inadequate healthcare infrastructure, weaker economy and lower standard of living, the suffering has been magnified, especially in the second wave that has led to a huge shortage of oxygen and hospital ICU beds.The government says the infection rates have consistently dropped since April 30, when it recorded more than 400,000 cases. It reported over 355,000 cases on Tuesday.“Given the fact that India is under such terrible stress right now with the extent of the outbreak, the rest of the world should pitch in to help, similar to what the United States is doing,” he said.“The world can help by supplying India with materials, and perhaps even personnel, but certainly materials that they need to adequately address it (the pandemic),” he said.The 80-year-old physician and immunologist, who serves as the director of the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, on Monday also recommend mass vaccination to arrest the current spread of the deadly disease across India.“Right now, they should start getting as many people vaccinated as they possibly can, with both the vaccines that they developed themselves in India as well as supplies of vaccines that they may be able to procure from other suppliers, be that the United States, be that Russia… whatever country is willing whenever companies are willing to supply vaccine,” Fauci said.However, getting someone "vaccinated now" does not solve today's problem, he noted, adding that it helps prevent a problem several weeks from now.The more immediate problem is how to care for and treat the thousands who are thronging overflowing hospitals across the country every day, in desperate need of oxygen and basic treatment.“It is quite obvious to everyone that the situation in India is extremely serious," said Fauci, who is considered one of the world’s top infectious disease specialists.“When you have so many people getting infected…the lack of the capability to take adequate care of everyone; when you have shortages of hospital beds and oxygen and shortages of supplies, that really becomes a very desperate situation. Which is the reason why we feel it's important for the rest of the world to help out, to the extent they can,” he said.Fauci, who has been keeping a close tab on the worst health crisis in India, said there are certain things that India can do immediately, mid-term and long-term basis. He recommended taking the help of the country's armed forces to immediately build makeshift field hospitals. "You will recall, last year when China had a very serious problem, they marshalled their resources to very, very rapidly build new hospitals, to be able to handle all the people who required hospitalisation," he said.Referring to media reports, he said there is a drastic shortage of hospital beds in India and people are being taken care of in makeshift arrangements."So, it would be possible, perhaps, with the help of your own military, to put up field hospitals as you would do as if in a wartime setting, so that people who are sick and require a hospital bed, will have a hospital bed," he said. He also underlined the need for a countrywide lockdown for a few weeks to arrest the spread of the virus.“A few days ago, I recommended and I believe at least parts of India are doing it, that you shut down the country in lockdown,” he said."Because other countries, including for example what China did last year, what Australia did when they had an outbreak, what New Zealand did, what other countries did is to completely lock down for a relatively limited period of time. You don't have to lock down for six months. You can lock down for a few weeks,” Fauci suggested.He explained that when a lockdown in imposed, it definitely interferes with the dynamics of the viral outbreak and you could interfere with the continuity and the transmission of infection, the top immunologist noted, citing the experience gained by other countries.Responding to a question whether the current surge in infections in India posed a threat to other countries, Fauci said, “Well, I mean, obviously, when you have a massive amount of infection in one country there's always a risk of infections.“You want to be careful that that doesn't spread widely elsewhere,” Fauci added."We are very sorry that India is going through this very, very difficult time. And that's the reason why we know we are in great solidarity with them and trying to do whatever we can to help them," Fauci said, referring to the Biden administration rushing medical equipment and life-saving drugs to India to help it fight the pandemic..||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/fauci-advises-india-to-marshal-all-resources-including-army-to-fight-covid19-101620111230887.html

04-05-2021||World||Lubbock city in Texas bans abortion, allows family to sue providers, helpers||Declaring Lubbock a "sanctuary city" for the unborn, voters have approved a local ban on almost all abortions, and the Texas legislature is considering a law to bar the procedure as early as six weeks into a pregnancy.Lubbock, home to some 260,000 people, is the 25th such "sanctuary city" - all but two in Texas - to have banned abortions in the last two years.Drucilla Tigner, a policy and advocacy strategist for ACLU-Texas, said most other towns that have passed similar sanctuary city measures have populations of a few hundred or thousand, and often have no medical providers whatsoever, let alone one that provides abortions, as Lubbock does.The Lubbock ordinance bans abortion in all cases except when a woman's life is in danger. It also allows any private citizen of Texas and also the family member of any woman who has an abortion to sue the provider or anyone who assisted.Nearly 63% of votes cast in the May 1 election supported Lubbock's abortion measure, the county elections office said Monday. Turnout was 22.6%. The measure is expected to take effect once the official tally is complete, which could take up to a month.The American Civil Liberties Union on Monday said it is weighing legal measures, calling the Lubbock vote unconstitutional and detrimental to women's health. The ACLU last year sued other such "sanctuary cities" in Texas. That lawsuit was dropped after the ordinances were changed to remove wording that labeled two reproductive rights groups as criminal organizations.Lubbock is a medical hub for 1 million people in West Texas. The ordinance "has a huge impact on not just the people of Lubbock, but that entire region," Tigner said.Planned Parenthood, which last year reopened a clinic in Lubbock, said in a written statement that it "will follow legal restrictions as required."A woman's right to have an abortion through the first trimester of pregnancy was protected nationally in 1973, following the Supreme Court's landmark 7-2 ruling in Roe v. Wade.Abortion fights at the local level have heated up since the Supreme Court attained a 6-3 conservative majority under former President Donald Trump. If Roe v Wade is overturned, abortion would be governed by state and local law.Jim Baxa, whose West Texas for Life was among the organizations that got the ordinance before voters, said his bigger goal was to see Texas ban abortions at the state level.Baxa said West Texas for Life got the "sanctuary city" idea after seeing similar measures pass in east Texas two years ago. After the Lubbock city council unanimously rejected the measure as violating state and federal law, West Texas for Life collected enough petition signatures to force a vote.The Texas Senate in March approved five bills restricting abortion - including one that would ban abortion as soon as a fetal heartbeat is detected, as early as six weeks in some pregnancies. The Texas House is expected to take up the measures later this week.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/lubbock-city-in-texas-bans-abortion-allows-family-to-sue-providers-helpers-101620109518905.html

Giannandrea joined Apple in 2018 after spending about eight years at Google.Apple declined to comment on Bengio's role. Bengio did not respond to a request for comment.Bengio who left Google last week after about 14 years said last month he was pursuing "other exciting opportunities".His decision followed Google's firings in recent months of fellow scientists Margaret Mitchell after alleging she transferred electronic files out of the company and Timnit Gebru after she threatened to quit rather than retract a paper.Mitchell and Gebru had co-led a team researching ethics issues in AI, and had voiced concern about Google's workplace diversity and approach to reviewing research. Bengio had expressed support for the pair.As one of the early leaders of the Google Brain research team, Bengio advanced the "deep learning" algorithms that underpin today's AI systems for analyzing images, speech and other data.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/apple-hires-ex-google-ai-scientist-who-resigned-after-colleagues-firings-101620109399451.html

On this day, people express their gratitude for the firefighters by wearing a symbolic red and blue-ribbon badge to raise awareness about the dangers that firefighters face.Know about the history and significance of International Firefighters' Day:The International Firefighters' Day came into existence after a tragic incident in Australia's Linton. The incident occurred on December 2, 1998, during which five firemen were killed while trying to douse a wildfire.All the five firefighters -- Garry Vredeveldt, Chris Evans, Stuart Davidson, Jason Thomas and Matthew Armstrong -- were part of a strike team and were rushed in to attend an SOS call. All of them died battling the fire.After the incident, a proposal was sent out to all countries on January 4, 1999, to honour the firefighters and others who lose their lives while performing their duty.One of the main aspects to celebrate this day is fire prevention and the need to improve intensive and thorough training.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/international-firefighters-day-know-history-and-significance-101620106695978.html

04-05-2021||World||US should push North Korea diplomacy, not pressure: China||China's US ambassador expressed hope Monday that President Joe Biden's policy toward North Korea will give more importance to diplomacy and dialogue instead of “extreme pressure” to try to stop Pyongyang's nuclear program and denuclearize the Korean Peninsula.Zhang Jun said China also hopes the review of US policy will give equal emphasis to both the nuclear issue and the peace and security issue.“Without tackling the security and the peace issue properly, definitely we do not have the right environment for our efforts for the denuclearization,” he said.The White House said last Friday that Biden plans to veer from the approaches of his two most recent predecessors as he tries to stop North Korea's nuclear program, rejecting both Donald Trump's deeply personal effort to win over leader Kim Jong Un and Barack Obama's more hands-off approach.Press secretary Jen Psaki announced administration officials had completed the review of US policy toward North Korea but did not detail its findings.The Biden administration appeared to signal it is trying to set the stage for incremental progress, in which denuclearization steps by the North would be met with corresponding actions, including sanctions relief, from the United States.There was no mention of US security guarantees for North Korea or a formal end to the Korean War, both of which had been demanded by the North and considered by the Trump team as part of a larger package.China assumed the presidency of the UN Security Council this month and ambassador Zhang told a news conference that Beijing will look “very carefully” at the US policy review in hopes it will give more emphasis to dialogue.China and Russia circulated a draft resolution a year ago on lifting some sanctions against North Korea, and Zhang said it's still on the table.He stressed that while China is implementing sanctions against the North, it also believes the Security Council should consider adjusting and lifting sanctions “which are really hindering the humanitarian access ... and making people suffer.”“At a certain stage, timely adjustment (of sanctions) will really produce good results with the creation of more favorable environment for the tackling of this issue,” the ambassador said.North Korea said Sunday that Biden was mistaken in calling the country a security threat in a speech to Congress last week and warned of an unspecified response.As for the current situation, China's Zhang said: “We do hear harsh words and we do see some tensions at certain level, but in general it remains stable.”Referring to North Korea and the United States, he said both sides “should really think seriously about what they should do next ... and in particular avoiding taking any actions which may make the situation even worse.”“All efforts should go along the direction of resuming dialogue, making more efforts, walking towards each other instead of walking against each other,” Zhang said.“Otherwise, I do not see any possibility of finding a lasting, sustaining solution simply by exercising pressure,” whether “it's extreme pressure or light pressure.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-should-push-north-korea-diplomacy-not-pressure-china-101620103711995.html
04-05-2021||World||US ban on travellers from India comes into effect||The travel ban imposed by US President Joe Biden for people coming from India, which is experiencing one of the worst waves of the Covid-19 pandemic, came into effect on Tuesday.Biden issued a proclamation on Friday restricting travel from India starting from May 4.Certain categories of students, academics, journalists and individuals have been exempted from the ban, according to the US State Department.US nationals, those having green cards, their non-citizen spouses and children below 21 years of age, are among the various categories exempted from the restrictions.The new travel restrictions have been imposed for an indefinite period and will require another presidential proclamation to end it."I have determined that it is in the interests of the United States to take action to restrict and suspend the entry into the United States, as non-immigrants, of non-citizens of the United States who were physically present within the Republic of India during the 14-day period preceding their entry or attempted entry into the United States," says the proclamation signed by Biden on Friday.The decision was taken at the recommendation of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), within the Department of Health and Human Services, which determined India is experiencing widespread, person-to-person transmission of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19.“The World Health Organization has reported that the Republic of India has had more than 18,375,000 confirmed cases of Covid-19. The magnitude and scope of the Covid-19 pandemic in India surging,” Biden said, adding that India accounts for over one-third of new global cases.The number of new cases in India is accelerating at a rapid rate, he said.Secretary of State Tony Blinken later gave an exemption to certain categories of visa holders, in particular students and non-citizen spouses and dependents of American nationals and those of legal permanent residency.According to the State Department, the travel ban exemption to certain categories is in line with a similar exemption that the US has granted to some categories of travellers from Brazil, China, Iran and or South Africa.Students seeking to commence studies in the fall, academics, journalists and individuals who provide critical infrastructure support in countries affected by a geographic Covid-19 restriction may qualify for the exception, it said.This includes qualified applicants who have been present in India, Brazil, China, Iran, or South Africa, it added.The pandemic continues to limit the number of visas our embassies and consulates abroad are able to process, it said.India is struggling with an unprecedented second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic with more than 3,00,000 daily new coronavirus cases being reported in the past few days.According to Indian health ministry data, single day rise of 3,68,147 Covid-19 infections and 3,417 fatalities pushed the country's tally of cases to 1,99,25,604 and death toll to 2,18,959 on Monday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-ban-on-travellers-from-india-comes-into-effect-101620102824549.html
04-05-2021||World||Key lawmakers urge Biden to ship AstraZeneca vaccine to India, other countries||A group of powerful US Democratic lawmakers have expressed frustration over the delay in the implementation of the Biden administration’s decision to release the country’s supply of unusable AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccines to India and other countries that need them and demanded their speedy delivery.“Time is of the essence. Without assistance from the United States, new vaccine-resistant mutations could arise across the globe, threatening international public health and the United States’ national security and economic prosperity,” four Democrats, who head powerful congressional committees, said in a joint letter to Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Health Secretary Xavier Becerra.The signatories are Carolyn Maloney, chairperson of one of the most powerful of House committees, the oversight committee; James Clyburn, chair of the House select subcommittee on the coronavirus crisis; Raja Krishnamoorthi, the Indian American chair of the House subcommittee on economic and consumer policy; and Stephen Lynch, chair of the House subcommittee on national security.Clyburn, it should be noted, had rescued Biden’s faltering presidential run in the primaries by rallying African American Democrats to vote for Biden in South Carolina. Biden’s massive win in the state forced his rivals to pull out in his favour and cleared the decks for his nomination. Clyburn is Number 3 in the House Democratic caucus as the whip.Lawmakers have also pressed the Biden administration to reverse President Donald Trump’s opposition to India and South Africa’s proposal to the World Trade Organization (WTO) to temporarily waive intellectual property rights to help developing counties get the same access to vaccines, therapeutics and technologies as the high-income countries.Also Read | India may see 1.02mn Covid deaths by August 1: US-based bodyIn a letter sent last Friday, which probably got overshadowed by everything else happening at the same time, the four legislators had seemed worried about inordinate delays in the shipping of these supplies by the administration’s plans to obtain the approval of the country’s foods and drug regulator.They had cited White House press secretary Jen Psaki’s as the chief reason for their worry. “Before any AstraZeneca doses are shipped from the United States, the FDA will confirm any such doses meet its expectations for product quality,” Psaki hd said on April 26. “This is being done in the context of the FDA’s ongoing review of all doses made at the plant where these AstraZeneca doses were produced.”AstraZeneca’s Covid-19 vaccine, which is made and retitled in India as Covishield, is not approved for use in the United States and the company has not even applied for it. It has also faced questions about the use of old data in support of its efficacy claims. Even if AstraZeneca were to apply and get the approval for is vaccines, the United States won’t need them. It has enough — either physically in possession or secured through pre-orders — of Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna’s two-shot vaccines and Johnson & Johnson’s single-shot vaccines to inoculate all Americans.More than 52% of eligible Americans — 147.5 million, which is 44% of the population — have received at least one dose of a vaccine. India has inoculated 154.6, millions of is people which is an extremely small percentage of its population, and the availability of vaccines has been strained in recent days as people rush to get themselves inoculated, panicked by the ongoing surge of Covid-19 cases.The United States has contracted for $ 60 millions of AstraZeneca vaccines, but did not have any in its stockpile April end. It is expected to receive 10 million doses of them shortly.It doesn’t need any of them, India does.The four lawmakers called for a briefing from the Biden administration on the reasons for the delay stressing their “our oversight of this matter”.They said they want to know about the process by which the administration will select countries that will get these AstraZeneca vaccines, the time taken to ship consignments, legal and contractual barriers, and whether the United States will have enough vaccines left from other sources to meet its domestic needs.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/key-lawmakers-urge-biden-to-ship-astrazeneca-vaccine-to-india-other-countries-101620101835637.html
04-05-2021||World||Seven US businesses drop H-1B lawsuit against federal agency||A group of seven American businesses Monday announced to have dropped an H-1B lawsuit against the US Citizenship and Immigration Services after the federal agency agreed to accept and adjudicate previous decisions on foreign work visas.In March, the American Immigration Council, on behalf of the seven businesses, had filed a suit, challenging USCIS’ arbitrary rejection of H-1B petitions filed after October 1 solely because the H-1B workers’ intended employment start date fell after October 1.The lawsuit alleged that based on this timeline, USCIS created an absurd choice: foreign workers needed to start on October 1 (and not a day later) or the US employer had to misrepresent the intended employment start-date by “back-dating” the petition.“Arbitrary rejections restrict business immigration in the US. The resolution of this case showcases the importance of litigating to challenge unlawful agency actions and advance a fair process for employment-based immigration,” said Leslie Dellon, senior attorney (business immigration) at the American Immigration Council.Filed in the federal district court for the district of Massachusetts, the lawsuit had called for stopping USCIS’ arbitrary and capricious refusal to accept timely and properly filed H-1B petitions, which are subject to the annual statutory cap on H-1B visa numbers allocated each year, a media release said.“We dismissed the lawsuit because USCIS promptly corrected its error. All of our clients' applications have now been accepted by the USCIS. It is unfortunate that legal action was required. But we thank the USCIS for doing the right thing,” said Mintz members and co-counsel for the plaintiffs Douglas Hauer and Laurence A Schoen.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/seven-businesses-drop-h-1b-lawsuit-against-us-federal-agency-101620095272323.html
04-05-2021||World||It’s not just India. New virus waves hit developing nations||It’s not just India. Fierce new Covid-19 waves are enveloping other developing countries across the world, placing severe strain on their health-care systems and prompting appeals for help.Nations ranging from Laos to Thailand in Southeast Asia, and those bordering India such as Bhutan and Nepal, have been reporting significant surges in infections in the past few weeks. The increase is mainly because of more contagious virus variants, though complacency and lack of resources to contain the spread have also been cited as reasons.In Laos last week, the health minister sought medical equipment, supplies and treatment, as cases jumped more than 200-fold in a month. Nepal is seeing hospitals quickly filling up and running out of oxygen supplies. Health facilities are under pressure in Thailand, where 98% of new cases are from a more infectious strain of the pathogen, while some island nations in the Pacific Ocean are facing their first Covid waves.Although nowhere close to India’s population or flare-up in scope, the reported spikes in these handful of nations have been far steeper, signaling the potential dangers of an uncontrolled spread. The resurgence -- and first-time outbreaks in some places that largely avoided the scourge last year -- heightens the urgency of delivering vaccine supplies to poorer, less influential countries and averting a protracted pandemic.“It’s very important to realize that the situation in India can happen anywhere,” said Hans Kluge, the regional director at the World Health Organization for Europe, during a briefing last week. “This is still a huge challenge.”Ranked by the change in newly recorded infections in the past month over the previous month, Laos came first with a 22,000% increase, followed by Nepal and Thailand, both of which saw fresh caseload skyrocketing more than 1,000% on a month-over-month basis.Also on top of the list are Bhutan, Trinidad and Tobago, Suriname, Cambodia and Fiji, as they witnessed the epidemic erupt at a high triple-digit pace.“All countries are at risk,” said David Heymann, a professor of infectious disease epidemiology at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine. “The disease appears to be becoming endemic and will therefore likely remain a risk to all countries for the foreseeable future.”On May 1, India reported a record 401,993 new cases in the prior 24 hours, while deaths touched a new high of 3,689 the following day. The nation’s hospitals and crematoriums are working overtime to cope with the sick and the surging number of deaths. Compounding the crisis, health-care facilities are also facing a shortage of medical oxygen, unable to treat distressed patients with coronavirus-infected lungs gasping for air at their doorsteps.The abrupt outbreak in Laos -- a place that only recorded 60 cases since the start of the pandemic through April 20 and no death to date -- shows the challenges facing some of the landlocked nations. Porous borders make it harder to clamp down on illegal crossings though entry is technically banned.Communist-ruled Laos has ordered lockdowns in its capital Vientiane and banned travel between the capital and provinces. The health minister reached out to neighbors like Vietnam for assistance on life-saving resources. Nepal and Bhutan have seen cases erupt, in part due to returning nationals. Nepal, which has identified cases of the new Indian variant, has limited resources to combat the virus.‘Very Serious’The situation is “very serious,” according to Ali Mokdad, Chief Strategy Officer for Population Health at the University of Washington. “New variants will require a new vaccine and a booster for those already vaccinated -- they will delay the control of the pandemic.”Mokdad said the economic hardship of poorer countries make the battle even tougher.Thailand, which had been seeking to revive its ailing tourism industry, just reintroduced a two-week mandatory quarantine for all visitors. A government forecast for 2021 tourism revenue was cut to 170 billion baht ($5.4 billion), from January’s expectations for 260 billion baht. With the country’s public health system under pressure, authorities are trying to set up field hospitals to accommodate a flood of patients.About 98% of cases in Thailand are of the variant first identified in the U.K. based on a sample of 500 people, according to Yong Poovorawan, chief of the Center of Excellence in Clinical Virology at Chulalongkorn University.Red ZoneIn Cambodia, since the beginning of the current outbreak, more than 10,000 locally acquired cases have been detected in more than 20 provinces. The Cambodian capital Phnom Penh is now a “red zone,” or a high-risk outbreak area. In Sri Lanka, the island-nation at the southern tip of India, authorities have isolated areas, banned weddings and meetings and closed cinemas and pubs to cap a record spike following last month’s local New Year festivities. The government says the situation is under control.Across the oceans in the Caribbean, Trinidad and Tobago announced a partial lockdown after the country’s daily cases hit a record high, closing restaurants, malls and cinemas until late May. The case count in the latest month is about 700% more than the previous month.That high level of increase is also seen in Suriname, on the northeastern coast of South America. Cases in April rose over 600% from that in March.After staying relatively Covid-free thanks to strict border controls, some of the Pacific island-nations are now seeing their first wave. Cities in the tourist hot spot of Fiji have gone into lockdown after the wider community contracted the virus from the military.“The recent rise in recorded cases throughout the Pacific reveals how critical it is to not just rely on strong borders but to actually get vaccines into these countries,” said Jonathan Pryke, who heads research on the Pacific region for the Lowy Institute, a Sydney-based think tank. “India is a shocking warning to this part of the world about how quickly this pandemic can spiral out of control.”There’s a duty for developed countries, recovering from the pandemic thanks to rapid inoculations, to contribute to a more equitable global distribution of vaccines, diagnostic tests and therapeutic agents including oxygen, according to Heymann, the professor at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine.The world hasn’t seen a concerted global response yet, and that is a concern, said Jennifer Nuzzo, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security in Baltimore.Getting back to pre-2020 normalcy “really depends on helping countries gain control of this virus as much as possible,” she said. “I really hope countries can look within themselves and figure out what they can do to help.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/its-not-just-india-new-virus-waves-hit-developing-nations-101620092537375.html

He was extradited to the United States, where he was convicted of murder and sentenced to death. He was executed in 2002.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/armed-man-shot-by-officers-outside-cia-headquarters-fbi-101620089784218.html
04-05-2021||World||US' FDA expected to give nod to Pfizer vaccine for teens within week||The US Food and Drug Administration is expected to authorise Pfizer's Covid-19 vaccine for young adults age 12 and older by next week, according to a federal official and a person familiar with the process, setting up shots for many before the beginning of the next school year.The announcement is set to come barely a month after the company found that its shot, which is already authorised for those age 16 and older, also provided protection for the younger group.The federal official, speaking on the condition of anonymity to preview the FDA's action, said the agency was expected to expand its emergency use authorisation for Pfizer's two-dose vaccine by early next week, and perhaps even sooner.The person familiar with the process, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss internal matters, confirmed the timeline and added that it is expected that the FDA will approve Pfizer's use by even younger children sometime this fall.The FDA action will be followed by a meeting of a federal vaccine advisory committee to discuss whether to recommend the shot for 12 to 15-year-olds.Shots could begin after the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention adopts the committee's recommendation. Those steps could be completed in a matter of days.The New York Times first reported on the expected timing for the authorisation.Pfizer in late March released preliminary results from a vaccine study of 2,260 US volunteers ages 12 to 15, showing there were no cases of Covid-19 among fully vaccinated adolescents compared with 18 among those given dummy shots.Kids had side effects similar to young adults, the company said. The main side effects are pain, fever, chills and fatigue, particularly after the second dose. The study will continue to track participants for two years for more information about long-term protection and safety.Pfizer isn't the only company seeking to lower the age limit for its vaccine. Results also are expected by the middle of this year from a US study of Moderna's vaccine in 12- to 17-year-olds.But in a sign that the findings were promising, the FDA already allowed both companies to begin U.S. studies in children 11 and younger, working their way to as young as 6 months old.More than 131 million doses of Pfizer's vaccine have already been administered in the US, where demand for vaccines among adults has dramatically slowed in recent weeks.While younger people are at dramatically lower risk of serious side effects from Covid-19, they have made up a larger share of new virus cases as a majority of US adults have been at least partially vaccinated and as higher-risk activities like indoor dining and contact sports have resumed in most of the country.Officials hope that extending vaccinations to teens will further accelerate the nation's reduced virus caseload and allow schools to reopen with minimal disruptions this fall.The US has ordered at least 300 million doses of the Pfizer shot by the end of July, enough to protect 150 million people.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-fda-expected-to-give-nod-to-pfizer-vaccine-for-teens-within-week-101620085679952.html

She won Gates’ heart after meeting at a work dinner, sharing a mutual love of puzzles and beating him at a math game.The couple's sprawling Seattle-based foundation is easily the most influential private foundation in the world, with an endowment worth nearly $50 billion. It has focused on global health and development and US education issues since incorporating in 2000.The couple were married in 1994 in Hawaii. They met after she began working at Microsoft as a product manager in 1987.Last year, Bill Gates, formerly the world's richest person, said he was stepping down from Microsoft's board to focus on philanthropy.Gates was Microsoft’s CEO until 2000 and since then has gradually scaled back his involvement in the company he started with Paul Allen in 1975. He transitioned out of a day-to-day role in Microsoft in 2008 and served as chairman of the board until 2014.The Gateses will be the second high-profile Seattle-area billionaire couple to end their marriage in recent years.Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos and MacKenzie Bezos finalized their divorce in 2019. MacKenzie Scott has since remarried and now focuses on her own philanthropy.

04-05-2021||India||India-UK virtual summit: Massive push to enhancing bilateral trade, bolstering defence ties||India and the UK on Tuesday launched an Enhanced Trade Partnership that envisages facilitating market access in specific sectors, and unveiled plans to finalise an interim trade deal by mid-2022 as a precursor to a free trade agreement.At a virtual summit between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his UK counterpart Boris Johnson, the two sides also set a target for doubling bilateral trade by 2030 and adopted the Roadmap 2030 to elevate ties to a comprehensive strategic partnership over the next decade.The Enhanced Trade Partnership, part of the UK’s efforts to ramp up trade ties with countries around the world following its exit from the European Union (EU), will see Britain open up its fisheries sector to more Indian players, facilitate more opportunities for nurses, recognise Indian seafarers’ certificates and enter into a joint dialogue on a social security agreement. In return, India lifted restrictions to enable British fruit producers to export their produce to the country and improved access to medical devices through the acceptance of the “UK Certificates of Free Sale”. The two sides will also work towards reciprocal opening up of legal services. These actions are likely to generate some 25,000 new direct and indirect jobs in India, Sandeep Chakravorty, joint secretary (Europe West) in the external affairs ministry, told a news briefing.The virtual summit was held after Johnson cancelled a state visit to New Delhi twice because of the Covid-19 situation – first in January to focus on an outbreak in the UK and in April due to the second wave of infections in India. Ahead of the summit, Johnson announced a trade and investment package with India worth £1 billion, including a £240 million investment by the Serum Institute of India (SII) in the UK.Johnson informed Modi about SII’s investment and manufacture of vaccines in the UK, especially research on nasal vaccines, Chakravorty said. He noted SII is a multi-national company that has a presence in the Netherlands and plans to manufacture vaccines in other countries.Following the launch of the Enhanced Trade Partnership, the two sides agreed to frame a roadmap for pre-free trade agreement (FTA) talks by end of this year, finalise an interim trade deal by early or mid-2022, and conclude talks for an FTA “at an early date”, Chakravorty said.Chakravorty described the launch of Roadmap 2030 as a “big deliverable” of the summit that is in line with the vision of the two leaders to elevate India-UK ties into a comprehensive strategic partnership. The roadmap lists several activities and initiatives to be pursued by the two sides in five key areas – trade and economy, defence and security, climate action, health and people-to-people contacts – over the next decade.The two countries also signed eight agreements, including a memorandum of understanding (MoU) on a migration and mobility partnership that will facilitate the legal movement of students and professionals and strengthen cooperation in combating illegal migration. The MoU creates a new scheme under which up to 3,000 young Indian professionals can every year avail of employment opportunities in the UK for two years without being subject to a labour market test.The other agreements covered emerging technologies, digital infrastructure and data policies, cooperation in telecommunications and ICT, customs cooperation, and cooperation on medical products regulation.Modi and Johnson agreed to advance defence ties to a new level, with a focus on maritime and industrial collaboration. They agreed to new cooperation on maritime domain awareness, including new agreements on maritime information-sharing. The UK was invited to join India’s naval information fusion centre and an exercise programme that includes tri-lateral exercises.India and the UK are also working to conclude a Logistics Memorandum of Understanding between their armed forces. They will build on existing collaboration on India’s future combat air engine requirement by working together on the indigenous development of the Light Combat Aircraft Mark 2.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/indiauk-virtual-summit-massive-push-to-enhancing-bilateral-trade-bolstering-defence-ties-101620152299223.html

04-05-2021||India||At virtual India-UK Summit, PM seeks speedy extradition of Nirav Modi, Mallya||Prime Minister Narendra Modi sought the speedy extradition of economic offenders Nirav Modi and Vijay Mallya from the UK during a virtual summit with his British counterpart Boris Johnson on Tuesday, the ministry of external affairs said.“They discussed the extradition of economic offenders and Prime Minister [Modi] said that the economic offenders should be sent back to India at the earliest for trial,” Sandeep Chakravorty, joint secretary (Europe West) in the external affairs ministry, told a news briefing. Last month, UK home secretary Priti Patel approved the extradition of fugitive businessman Nirav Modi after a British court found him guilty of fraud and money laundering in the Punjab National Bank scam. Nirav Modi is the second high-profile economic offender after former liquor baron Vijay Mallya whose extradition has been cleared by a trial court in the UK. Mallya lost his appeal against extradition in April 2020 and an opportunity to approach the UK Supreme Court the next month but the British government has claimed his extradition is being held up by a “confidential legal issue”. Officials familiar with Mallya’s case say he has sought asylum in the UK and it is unclear how much time the British authorities will take to decide on his application. “Prime Minister Johnson said that he faced some legal hurdles because of the nature of the criminal justice system in the UK, but he was aware of it and they will do whatever possible to make sure that these people are extradited at the earliest,” Chakravorty said, without giving details.Nirav Modi has been held in Wandsworth prison, on the outskirts of London, since March 2019, when he was arrested based on India’s extradition request. As in the case of Mallya, officials from CBI and Enforcement Directorate are confident the UK high court will reject Nirav Modi’s plea against his extradition as there is irrefutable evidence of fraud and money laundering against him.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/at-virtual-india-uk-summit-pm-seeks-speedy-extradition-of-nirav-modi-mallya-101620150978706.html

The letter read, “It is disheartening to witness the top management make a mockery of pilots discharging their duties in a risky environment. We were hoping that Air India would not let down the crew and their families who stand by the nation during this pandemic... We feel let down by the self-serving approach of the management, which sees no injustice in organising vaccine camps at few bases but excludes pilots.”The Indian Commercial Pilots Association (ICPA), in its letter to the director of operations on Tuesday, raised their concern about their flying crew not being vaccinated against Covid-19. Pointing out that many crew members have tested positive for Covid-19, the ICPA said the flying crew has been risking its life during this pandemic.They said those on desk jobs or those who could opt for working from home can get vaccinated, but not the flying crew, leaving them vulnerable.The ICPA pilots said that it is due to their unwavering support that the Vande Bharat Mission (VBM) and relief operations have continued to run smoothly even in the face of a resurgence of even deadlier strains of Covid-19; only to get a discriminatory pay cut in return.The association said it is not in the position to risk the lives of pilots flying without vaccination as there is no healthcare support, no insurance, and a ‘massive opportunistic’ pay cut.“If Air India fails to set up vaccination camps on a Pan-India basis for the flying crew above the age of 18 years on priority, we will “STOP WORK (sic),” the letter warned.“Our finances are already spread thin covering our bedridden colleagues and provisioning for families lest we inadvertently infect them with the deadly virus that is an ever-present occupational hazard for us,” the letter concluded.In an email response, the airline spokesperson’s said, “Air India is aware of an official communique from one of its unions sent to the management. This is an entirely internal issue that is meant to be sorted out within the organisation. While we appreciate your keen interest in each and every issue related to Air India, we will not like to make any comment on an issue that, in any case, has no reason to be discussed in the external public domain.” The airline’s Boeing pilots, the Indian Pilots Guild (IPG), who were the first to write to the airline management on April 28, had stated that it was disappointing to see inadequate efforts been made to protect pilot’s well being.The IPG letter read, “Despite the second wave choking the nation’s medical resources, not a single pilot has refused any flight sighting risk of infection as a reason. Several of our colleagues are being hospitalised at an alarming rate and are in critical need of oxygen... it is in the nature of our duty to be at risk of exposure to the virus. At the very least, our company should leave no stone unturned to keep us safe.” The IPG too had warned the management to keep the aircrew on top priority, and that they would have to decide in the interests of their pilots and their familiesThe airline however replied to the pilots on April 30, assuring them to conduct the vaccination drive from May 1. The letter accessed by the paper read, “...The operations department, in coordination with the medical department, will initiate the process of vaccinating all operations staff. This includes operations ground staff, dispatchers, crew, both cockpit and cabin, above the age of 18 years. The logistics of venues and processes are being worked upon across the country as of now and the same will be communicated as soon as they are finalised...”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-covid-19-vaccine-for-flying-crew-will-stop-work-air-india-pilots-warn-management-101620149718890.html

04-05-2021||India||100 million-year-old bones of sauropod dinosaurs discovered in Meghalaya||Researchers have identified fossil bone fragments of sauropod dinosaurs dating back to about 100 million years from an area around West Khasi Hills District in Meghalaya.The yet-to-be-published findings were made during a recent field trip by researchers from the Geological Survey of India's Palaeontology division in North-East.The GSI researchers noted that this is the first record of sauropods of probable Titanosaurian origin discovered in the region.Sauropods had very long necks, long tails, small heads relative to the rest of their body, and four thick, pillar-like legs. They are notable for the enormous sizes attained by some species, and the group includes the largest animals to have ever lived on land.The finding makes Meghalaya the fifth state in India after Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, and Tamil Nadu and the only state in the North-East to report Sauropod bones having titanosaurian affinity, they said.Titanosaurs were a diverse group of sauropod dinosaurs, including genera from Africa, Asia, South America, North America, Europe, Australia and Antarctica."Dinosaur bones from Meghalaya were reported by GSI in 2001 but they were too fragmentary and ill-preserved to understand its taxonomic identification," said Arindam Roy, Senior Geologist, Palaeontology Division, GSI."The present find of bones is during fieldwork in 2019-2020 and 2020-21. The last visit of the team was in February 2021. The fossils are presumably of Late Cretaceous, about 100 million years ago," Roy told PTI.He noted that the best-preserved fossils are limb bones, adding the type of curvature, development of lateral and proximal margins of the partially preserved bone are indicative of it being a humerus bone.He, however, noted that the conclusions are drawn from preliminary studies and detailed work is going on.The bone fragments were collected from poorly sorted, purplish to greenish very coarse-grained arkosic sandstone interlaid with pebbly beds.More than twenty-five disarticulated, mostly fragmentary bone specimens were recovered, which are of different sizes and occur as isolated specimens but some of them were found in close proximity to each other, the researchers said.Taxonomic identification up to genus level is difficult due to poorly preserved, incomplete, fragmentary nature of the bones and most of the recovered bones are partially petrified and partially replaced, they said.Therefore, only three of the best-preserved ones could be studied. The largest one is a partially preserved limb bone of 55 centimetres (cm) long. It is comparable with the average humerus length of titanosaurids.Robustness of the bone, the difference in curvature in the lateral margins and the proximal border being relatively straight, are some of the morphological characters that hint at the titanosaurid affinity, according to the researchers.Another incomplete limb bone measuring 45cm in length is also comparable with the limb bones of titanosauriform clade, they said.“The abundance of bones recovered during the present work and especially the finding of few limb bones and vertebrae having taxonomic characters of titanosauriform clade are unique,” Roy said.“The record of the sauropod assemblage of probable titanosaurian affinity from Meghalaya extends the distribution and diversity of vertebrates in the Late Cretaceous of India,” he noted.An incomplete chevron of caudal vertebrae and also cervical vertebra have also been reconstructed from a few recovered bone specimens.The other fragmentary specimens though partially preserved might probably be parts of limb bones of a sauropod dinosaur.Titanosaurian sauropod dinosaurs were the most diverse and abundant large-bodied terrestrial herbivores in the Southern Hemisphere landmasses during the Cretaceous Period but they were not endemic to the Gondwanan landmasses, the researchers said.Gondwanaland is the southern half of the Pangaean supercontinent that existed some 300 million years ago and is composed of the major continental blocks of South America, Africa, Arabia, Madagascar, Sri Lanka, India, Antarctica, and Australia.In India, the Late Cretaceous sauropod dinosaur generally belong to the titanosaurian clade and has been reported from the Lameta Formation of Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra and Kallamedu Formation of Tamil Nadu, the researchers said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/100-million-year-old-bones-of-sauropod-dinosaurs-discovered-in-meghalaya-101620123476721.html
04-05-2021||India||After emphatic win in Kerala, Left mulls national-level alternative against BJP||Taking a cue from the emphatic victory in Kerala, the Communist Party of India (Marxist) will take a fresh initiative to build an alternative against the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) at the national level, party’s acting secretary A Vijayaraghavan said on Tuesday in the state capital.During the recently-concluded assembly polls, the CPI(M)-led Left Democratic Front (LDF) won 99 out of 140 assembly seats in the state, bucking a four-decade-old political tradition of oscillating the Congress and CPI(M)-led fronts alternately. In the left surge, the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) drew a blank.Talking to newsmen after the party’s secretariat meeting, Vijayaraghavan said the new government will be sworn in after the Left Democratic Front (LDF) meeting on May 17.“Due to pandemic situation, strict restrictions are in force. Let the situation ease a bit, there is no hurry,” he said, adding the LDF will observe a victory day on May 7. Party workers have been asked to lit lamps in their homes while observing Covid-19 protocol. He said the “historic victory” in Kerala has given a fresh impetus to secular and democratic forces in the country and the party will take initiative to build a new alternative against communal forces. “Our victory and high vote share are historic. It is a victory of the Left and secular forces. This victory has national relevance as well,” he said, adding the victory was clinched in trying times. Vijayaraghavan said all opposition parties, including the Congress and the BJP, had teamed up against the government and many central agencies pitched their tents in the state, intimidated officials and others but their designs fell flat with people’s mandate.He said the loss in Kerala will hasten the fall of the Congress in the country, adding that the party tried its best to weaken secular forces in Kerala and its national leaders were also part of it. Vijayaraghavan was referring to the Gandhi family’s intense campaign in the state.“The Congress and the BJP were in a race to raise baseless allegations against the government. At one point, both were talking in a single voice. They also tried to sabotage some of the welfare programmes. People have given them a befitting reply,” he said. Meanwhile, outgoing opposition leader Ramesh Chennithala alleged a CPI(M)-BJP nexus to weaken the Congress in Kerala. “A close look at the results show in many seats, the NDA’s vote share has gone down. Most of these votes have shifted to the LDF camp. We suspect it is a part of a conspiracy of the BJP’s pet “Congress mukt” campaign,” he said in Thiruvananthapuram. BJP state president K Surendran denied this, saying the Left successfully injected a fear psychosis among minority communities that led to the consolidation of their votes in its favour.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/after-emphatic-win-in-kerala-left-mulls-national-level-alternative-against-bjp-101620148280240.html

The joint team were able to recover incriminating materials including huge quantity of arms and ammunition from the hideout,” a spokesman of Jammu and Kashmir police had said at that time. It was also revealed that Nazir was involved in providing logistic support to the terrorists. However, his family alleged he was framed by the police.Similarly, assistant professor Bari was arrested in a terrorism-related case and booked under the Public Safety Act (PSA) in March this year. Specific details of Idrees Jan’s misconduct have not been revealed yet.The dismissals come following identification and scrutiny of government employees believed to be involved in anti-national activities and or in cases posing a threat to the country’s security. The LG had set up a special task force for this purpose.Now, the JK Employees Joint Action Committee is protesting their termination and demanding that the reasons for termination are made public and the employees are given a chance to explain their position. “Termination of employees without giving them a chance to be heard is against the spirit of law and the constitution of the country. This move has spread panic among the employees who are not only stressed but also over burdened,” said Mohammad Rafique Rather, president, JK Employees Joint Action Committee (EJAC)He also alleged that the decision was taken in haste. “The dismissed employees should be allowed to put up their defence.” He also requested LG Manoj Sinha’s intervention in the matter.On Monday, Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) president Mehbooba Mufti alleged that the terminations were done on “flimsy grounds”. However, her comments led to a backlash with many pointing out that many government employees were dismissed for anti-national activities during her tenure as the chief minister of the erstwhile state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jammu-and-kashmir-employees-union-protests-dismissal-of-3-employees-101620138677851.html

As they were living closely it must have been spread among them," Mishra told PTI."Now we are developing a method to test the samples of their faeces. This method would be useful in future as every time it is not possible to collect saliva samples from wild animals," he added.He further said the virus which is present in the lions at the Nehru Zoological Park here is not any new variant."They have mild symptoms and they are eating well and they are fine," he said.Replying to a query, he said there is every possibility of animals contracting the virus as they are also mammals like human beings.Mishra further said these animals must have got infected through zoo-keeping staff.A senior official of the zoo said they keep sending the samples of the animals to CCMB from time to time for analysis.As the lions started showing symptoms such as fever, the zoo officials collected the samples and sent them to CCMB.The official further said the samples from the wild animals will be collected either by 'Squeeze cage' method or by tranquilising them.In the 'squeeze cage' method, the animal will be confined in a cage without any space so that it cannot move or resist while taking samples.In view of rapid spread of the coronavirus in the country, the Ministry of Environment Forests and Climate Change, recently issued an advisory to close all zoological parks, national parks, tiger reserves and wildlife sanctuaries for visitors till further orders to control the spread of the pandemic.Accordingly, the zoo here, Kakatiya Zoological Park, Warangal, Kawal and Amrabad Tiger Reserves, all National Parks and wildlife sanctuaries in Telangana were closed from May 2, an official release had earlier said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/lions-in-hyderabad-zoo-test-covid-19-positive-samples-examined-by-ccmb-101620124769839.html

Mamata’s party Trinamool Congress immediately demanded a recount but was turned down by the EC.Hindustan Times reported that on Monday, Banerjee said she will move court against the EC’s decision and alleged that the refusal by polling officer was made under pressure. Showing a text message in her mobile phone to reporters, Banerjee said, “I cannot reveal who forwarded this but the returning officer, who wrote it, clearly says that his life was under threat. In the message, he said he was held at gunpoint and forced not to order a re-counting which we demanded.”WATCH: ‘I may be murdered…’: Mamata reads out Nandigram poll officer’s alleged messageThe Election Commission said “the returning officer of an assembly constituency performs statutory functions under the Representation of the People Act, 1951 in quasi-judicial capacity independently. Whether it is nomination, polling or counting, the RO acts strictly in accordance with the extant electoral laws, instructions and guidelines of the ECI.”The poll panel further said that when an application for recounting of votes is made the returning officer shall decide the matter and may allow the application in whole or in part or may reject it in its entirety if it appears to him to be frivolous or unreasonable.“After the counting in Nandigram AC, the election agent of a particular candidate requested for recount, which was rejected by the RO (returning officer), through a speaking order, on the basis of material facts available before him in accordance with the provisions of Rule 63, as above, and declared the result. In such a case, only legal remedy is to file an EP (election petition) before the high court,” the poll commission said.As per provisions of the Representation of the People Act, 1951, the decision of a returning officer can only be challenged through an election petition under section 80 of the Act.ALSO READ: Mamata Banerjee, a street fighter who’s now beaten Left, Right, CentreThe Election Commission said, “Each counting table (in Nandigram) had one micro-observer. Their reports never indicated any impurity of counting process on their respective table. The RO caused the entries of votes polled by each candidate after each round to be written on the display board which could be easily seen by the counting agents. No doubt was raised on the result of round-wise counting. This enabled the RO to proceed uninterruptedly with the counting of votes.”The poll panel further said that a copy of each of the results after each round was shared with all the counting agents, who the result sheets.Refuting the allegations of malpractice, the Election Commission said “polling officers on ground perform in extremely competitive political environment diligently with full transparency and fairness and, therefore, attribution of any motive in such cases is not desirable.”Taking cognisance of media reports on alleged threat to the life of the returning officer, the Election Commission said it has directed the chief secretary of West Bengal to provide adequate security to the officer.The Trinamool Congress won 213 of the state’s 294 assembly constituencies, with the BJP winning 77. Counting was held for 292 seats, as voting for two seats will take place at a later date.

04-05-2021||India||Odisha IFoS officer Abhay Kant Pathak, in jail in DA case, compulsorily retired||Senior Indian Forest Service (IFoS) officer Abhay Kant Pathak, in jail since November last year on charges of amassing assets disproportionate to his known sources of income, was compulsorily retired on Monday after the Centre approved the state government’s recommendations for the same.As part of its policy of zero tolerance towards corruption, the Odisha government last year recommended retirement of the 1987 batch IFoS officer, accusing him of being “very corrupt and high-flying”. The state had accused Pathak of depositing his “ill-gotten” wealth in his son Akash Pathak’s bank accounts and said that he was also involved in a job racket run by his son, who posed as managing director of Tata Motors to rob unemployed youth of huge amounts of cash on the false pretext of giving them jobs in the company.In the last 1 year, more than 104 state officials have been given compulsory retirement over corruption issues.Pathak, who served as the additional principal chief conservator of forests would have become the next principal chief conservator of forests of Odisha in June this year had he not been named in a corruption case in November last year. The state vigilance department accused Pathak of amassing disproportionate assets worth ₹9.35 crore, 435 % of his total income and claimed it to be the biggest disproportionate assets case in Odisha’s history.Pathak, working as Odisha’s additional principal chief conservator of forests (Plan, Programme and Afforestation), was arrested after vigilance conducted raids at 13 places including his official residence in Bhubaneswar, his office, his apartment, the apartment of his nephew, driver’s house, his house at his native village in Khagaria, Bihar, luxury apartments and farmhouse in Pune and residence of his son’s manager at Samata Colony, Pune. His son Abhay Pathak, who owned Mercedes, BMW and Tata Harrier brand vehicles as well as high-end bikes such as Yamaha FZS, was arrested too.The vigilance sleuths had alleged that Pathak and his family made at least 20 trips to different cities through chartered planes at an expenditure of over ₹3 crores during Covid lockdown last year. The vigilance sleuths found hotel bills totalling over ₹90 lakhs for expenses made at Hotel Taj Mahal Palace, Mumbai and advance booking worth ₹20 lakhs at Taj Lake Palace, Udaipur in Rajasthan for the impending marriage of Pathak’s son with the daughter of former BJD minister Pradip Panigrahy.Panigrahy was also accused of conspiring with Pathak’s son Akash to cheat job seekers by promising jobs at Tata Motors without any authority to do so. He is also behind bars for more than 5 months.In January this year, a vigilance court in Odisha granted bail to Pathak and his son in the disproportionate assets case. However, he and his son remain behind bars in another case of non-payment of money to a travel agency in Bhubaneswar. The father-son duo had booked chartered flights, five-star hotels and air tickets through the agency which cost around ₹2.78 crore. They paid the agency ₹2.13 crore while ₹65.16 lakh is yet to be cleared....||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/odisha-ifs-officer-abhay-kant-pathak-compulsorily-retired-for-corruption-101620124878949.html
04-05-2021||India||New insectivorous mammal species discovered in India after four decades||A new insect-eating mammal species almost the size of a house mouse has been discovered in India after over four decades. A Zoological Survey of India (ZSI) team discovered the grey-coloured shrew that feeds on insects on the remote uninhabited dormant volcanic island of Narcondam in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands.“Till date, 422 species of mammals have been reported from India. We have added one more... with the new discovery. It is after four decades that we have discovered an insect-eating mammal. In between, a few other mammal species like macaques and bats have been discovered,” said Kailash Chandra, former director of ZSI, who retired last week.The last insect-eating mammal species were discovered on South Andaman Island in 1978. It was named Jenkin’s Andaman shrew. The new animal has been named Crocidura Norcondamica after the Narcondam Island where it was found. Also Read | Rare butterfly species documented on Vetal tekdi by Pune research studentsEarlier, 11 species of shrew have been reported from India.The latest finding has been published in Scientific Reports, an online multidisciplinary open-access journal from the publishers of Nature.“The new species show substantial genetic differences with other shrew species earlier discovered from India, Myanmar, and Sumatra,” said Shantanu Kundu, a scientist from the ZSI’s Centre for DNA Taxonomy.The animal lives on the forest floor, feeds on insects and helps control the insect population in the dense forest of Narcondam.Due to the remoteness and inaccessibility throughout the year, the smaller islands of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands are not as explored as the larger islands.“As the island [Narcondam] is uninhabited, the new species may not face the human disturbances, but the extremely restricted insular habitat and the associated limited population size will automatically result in increased vulnerability of the species,” said Chandra.According to ZSI scientists, further field studies on taxonomy, ecology, and distribution of the animal will help understand the present status and promote conservation plans.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/new-insectivorous-mammal-species-discovered-in-india-after-four-decades-101620122958574.html

Total revenue collection from various own tax and non-tax sectors during 2020-21 financial year is estimated at ₹56, 363 crore against ₹46,970 crore collected in 2019-20 financial year.The increased collection of GST is important for Odisha in a pandemic year as the state is looking at more expenditure on health than was budgeted for 2021-22 due to the second wave of Covid-19. With daily cases likely to touch around 15,000 by May second week, the state government estimates it may have to spend far more than the ₹9,164 crore it had budgeted.Last month, Odisha chief secretary fixed a target of ₹40,000 crore as tax collection from own sectors like stamp duty and registration fees, sales tax, state GST and excise duty apart from another ₹21,500 crore from non-tax sectors like mining, water tax and forest tax for the 2021-22 financial year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/odisha-records-highest-ever-gst-in-april-despite-covid-induced-slowdown-101620122297024.html

04-05-2021||India||PM Modi, PM Boris Johnson to boost trade during virtual summit||Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his British counterpart Boris Johnson are set to unveil a “Enhanced Trade Partnership” to deepen bilateral cooperation during their virtual summit on Tuesday, part of London’s post-Brexit efforts to conclude new trade deals around the world. The partnership includes lower trade barriers and improved market access for certain British items such as fruits and medical devices. The partnership is also being described by the British side as a precursor to a possible free trade agreement. Ahead of the virtual summit, Johnson announced a package of trade and investment deals with India worth £1 billion, including a £240 million investment by the Serum Institute of India (SII) in the UK, that is expected to create more than 6,500 jobs. This virtual summit is also expected to lead to deeper relationship in healthcare, climate action and defence. The trade barriers addressed by the Enhanced Trade Partnership include the lifting of restrictions to enable fruit producers across the UK to export their produce to India for the first time, and improved access for medical devices through the acceptance of the “UK Certificates of Free Sale” in India, thus removing the need for additional accreditation of British medical devices exported to India. Under the partnership, the two sides will also commit themselves to removing barriers in the Indian legal services sector that prevent UK lawyers from practising international and foreign law in India, said a statement from the UK Prime Minister’s Office. This measure “could significantly increase UK legal services exports and UK legal services imports from India”. The two sides will also work to deepen cooperation in educational services and conclude work on recognition of UK higher education qualifications, which is expected to encourage an increase in student flows, skills transfer and knowledge-sharing between the two sides. However, experts believe the Indian side is in no rush to sign new free trade deals, especially at a time when the Indian government is pushing its “Make in India” and Aatmanirbhar Bharat (self-reliant India) initiatives. Some Western countries have expressed concerns about these initiatives restricting access to the Indian market. Johnson’s summit with his Indian counterpart is part of the British government’s pivot to the Indo-Pacific and efforts to conclude more trade deals around the world after the UK’s exit from the European Union (EU). Britain has so far concluded trade deals with Japan and Singapore. The new trade and investment deals announced by Johnson include new Indian investments of more than £533 million into the UK that are expected to create more than 6,000 jobs in vital sectors such as health and technology, and deals worth £200 million will support low carbon growth. British businesses have secured new export deals with India worth more than £446 million. This includes CMR Surgical exporting its next generation “Versius” surgical robotic system that helps surgeons perform minimal access surgery under a deal worth £200 million. Annual trade between India and the UK is currently worth around £23 billion. More than 800 Indian companies have a presence in the UK, which they were using as a base to access markets in the EU.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-pm-boris-johnson-to-boost-trade-during-virtual-summit-101620117376690.html

04-05-2021||India||'Unconstitutional': Supreme Court strikes down Bengal law regulating real estate||The Supreme Court Tuesday struck down West Bengal’s law on regulating the real estate sector saying it was “unconstitutional” as the state's statute encroached upon the Centre's Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act (RERA).The top court also said that WB HIRA has failed to include valuable safeguards for the homebuyers'.A bench of justices D Y Chandrachud and M R Shah said the West Bengal Housing Industry Regulation Act (HIRA), 2017 is more or less identical to the Centre's RERA and hence repugnant to Parliament's law.”The state law has encroached upon the domain of the Parliament and hence is unconstitutional,” the verdict said.It said however that homebuyers who have purchased properties under state law before its verdict, will not have to worry as their registration and other acts would remain valid.The judgement came on a plea of ‘Forum For People's Collective Efforts’ , an umbrella homebuyers association, challenging the constitutional validity of West Bengal Housing Industry Regulation Act, 2017, which is more or less identical to the Centre's RERA.Pronouncing the verdict through video conferencing, Justice Chandrachud said that fundamental features of WB HIRA overlaps and is a word-to-word copy of Centre's RERA. The bench, which passed a lengthy verdict on the issue, said that WB HIRA touches upon entry 6 and 7 of the concurrent list which was occupied by the law passed by Parliament and set up a parallel regime in the state.“The state doing so is plainly unconstitutional,” the bench said, adding that provisions in the legislation show that there is repugnancy in WB HIRA and RERA.“WB HIRA is directly in conflict with RERA, without any valuable safeguards for the home buyers”, the bench said, adding that it is invoking powers under Article 142 to hold that registrations of properties done under the state law before its verdict, will be valid. The top court had during the hearing of the petition wondered whether a state, in the name of cooperative federalism, enacts legislation under the concurrent list to occupy the same subjects in which Parliament has enacted a law.It had observed that both Centre's RERA and WB HIRA dealt with issues of providing reliefs to home buyers and promoting real estate sectors but some of the provisions of the State's legislation were in direct conflict with the law passed by Parliament.The top court had said that a state can have legislation but to supplant the Centre's law and not to be direct conflict or to override it and say that “now we will not follow your law but our law”It had wondered why a state would have a similar law enacted when there is already a law passed by Parliament and said many provisions in WB HIRA are repugnant to Centre's RERA.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/unconstitutional-supreme-court-strikes-down-bengal-law-regulating-real-estate-101620116648420.html

He also said that the state will ensure availability of an adequate number of beds and oxygen to infected patients.DMK’s legislature party will meet on Tuesday at the party headquarters to internally elect Stalin as their leader so that he can stake the claim to form the government. “It will be a simple affair at the Raj Bhavan due to the Covid situation,” Stalin had said Sunday night after the party’s victory.Meanwhile, out-going chief minister Edappadi Palaniswami submitted his resignation to governor Banwarilal Purohit.

04-05-2021||India||Armed forces use lease route to cut red-tape, stay prepared for adversaries||Rather than getting caught in the laborious defence acquisition process, the armed forces are using the financial powers of vice-chiefs to lease out critical weapon platforms from strategic allies like the United Sstates, France and Russia. The vice-chiefs have the power to purchase ₹300 crore worth of equipment as part of capital purchases as well as half of ₹500 crore can be used for emergency requirements for the service but outside capital outlay.According to South Block officials, the leasing of two Predator unmanned aerial vehicles from the US, a nuclear power submarine Akula class to replace the presently leased INS Chakra from Russia, and the proposal to lease a Airbus 330 multi-role transport tanker from France are examples in this direction. While the leasing process allows the armed forces to train on a platform that it plans to acquire, it also short-circuits the labyrinth of acquisition process like acceptance of necessity, request for information, request for proposal, defence acquisition committee, finance ministry approvals and finally the Cabinet Committee of Security (CCS).Faced with a northern neighbour who is constantly inducting stand-off weapon systems like weaponized drones, nuclear powered submarines, fifth generation aircraft and large warships, the leasing system at least allows the Indian armed forces to be prepared for future wars. “The leasing of two Predator drones from US allows India to train and be prepared to induct 10 such drones in each of the three services. The MQ9 Predator drone is a highly versatile UAV with capacity to target the adversary through Hell-fire missile and laser guided bombs. The process for acquisition of drones has already begun,” said a top admiral of Indian Navy. The Navy is also eyeing to lease Rafale maritime fighters for its upcoming indigenous aircraft carrier INS Vikrant as the American fighters like F-18 and F-15 are too heavy and large for 45,000 tonne flat-top warship.After its tender to purchase mid-air refuellers was canned by the Defence Ministry, the Indian Air Force is now leasing one Airbus 330 MRTT while eyeing further lease of five more refuellers currently with France through the proper acquisition route.While the Indian Army has no plans to take weapon platforms on lease as of now, the military purchased anti-tank weapon systems, UAVs and laser guided shells from Israel under emergency purchases powers with the vice-chief at a time when India and China were locked eyeball to eye ball at Pangong Tso in eastern Ladakh.While Chinese President Xi Jinping has offered support to Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi to ride out of Covid-19 crisis, the paramount leader has refused to budge on the Gogra-Hot Springs issue in eastern Ladakh as if the present government will allow the land dispute to be swept under the carpet or to be left to future generations.With Beijing determined to play hardball on the border with India, the latter will have to be in advanced state of preparedness with high tech weapons in case the balloon goes up when the pandemic with origins in Wuhan sweeps India.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/armed-forces-use-lease-route-to-cut-red-tape-remain-prepared-for-adversaries-101620114293042.html

Former Congress president Rahul Gandhi has slammed the government for enlisting the project under "essential services". He urged the NDA government to work with a vision to curb the growing Covid cases and not spend money on Central Vista redevelopment project at a time when the country was reeling under the pandemic that has almost choked the healthcare system.“Central Vista -not essential.

Jagmohan is known for his contributions to the Jammu region, including the creation of the Shri Mata Vaishno Devi Shrine Board (SMVDSB) when he was the Jammu & Kashmir governor.The board was created in 1986 and the model has been emulated for the management of shrines and temples across India.SMVDSB chief executive officer Ramesh Kumar said Jagmohan’s contribution is remarkable, and he will be remembered forever. “He was the man behind the creation of the board in 1986. The entire facilities and creation of infrastructure were his brainchild. He is the man behind what exists today,” said Kumar. “It was his vision of development...all the facilities that exist today are because of him.” Kumar said they vow to carry forward Jagmohan’s legacy. “We will remember him forever. Earlier, only 10 lakh [one million] pilgrims used to visit the cave shrine every year but with his vision and creation of facilities, the footfall increased to one crore [10 million] per year. It was he who propelled this pilgrimage on the national and international map. We deeply condole his sad demise.”Former Jammu & Kashmir police chief SP Vaid called the board a very big contribution of Jagmohan. “He will be remembered for it. Because of him, all the facilities came up and for that, he will be remembered by millions not only in Jammu & Kashmir but across the country.”Also Read | Mehbooba criticises sacking of govt staff over ‘anti-state’ activitiesVaid called Jagmohan a very able administrator too. “[Jagmohan] worked in very difficult times in the early 90s when Pakistan-sponsored terrorism raised its ugly head and Jammu & Kashmir had all sorts of law-and-order problems, but he faced them head-on. He was a very able administrator.”Former deputy chief minister Kavinder Gupta echoed Vaid. “He played an indispensable role in Jammu & Kashmir when terrorism was at its peak. Had he not been there, the Kashmiri Pandit community would have been wiped out. He played a proactive role in bureaucracy. A visionary leader and administrator, he created the Shri Mata Vaishno Devi Shrine Board that brought a sea change in the concept of pilgrimages across India. His model is still being studied by other shrines and temples...,” said Gupta. “He will be remembered for his indispensable contribution to Jammu & Kashmir.”Ravinder Raina, the chief of Bharatiya Janata Party’s Jammu & Kashmir unit, said Jagmohan was a national leader. “When Jammu & Kashmir was passing through difficult circumstances, he was the one who dealt a severe blow to Pakistan-sponsored terrorism. He gave his services like a true soldier of the nation… he conceived and speeded up developmental projects, created Shri Mata Vaishno Devi Shrine Board, and brought this pilgrimage on the international map. All these flyovers and big institutions were conceived and executed by him. Today, he may not be with us, but he will live in the hearts of the countrymen.”Devender Singh Rana, the provincial president of the National Conference, said, “Jagmohan was the architect of the Shri Mata Vaishno Devi Shrine Board, which led to...ushering of a new chapter in the facilitation and management of the pilgrimage.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jammu-mourns-demise-of-former-union-minister-jagmohan-101620111736782.html

The agency has booked some Kerala police officers, they said without naming them.A Supreme Court bench of justices AM Khanwilkar, Dinesh Maheshwari and Krishna Murari called the matter “serious” and ordered the CBI probe on April 15. It accepted the report of a court-appointed panel that looked into the role of the police officers. The court said the CBI will be at liberty to use the contents of the report for the registration of a preliminary inquiry for further investigation.Also Read | The 1994 espionage case that led to Isro scientist Nambi Narayanan’s arrestThe Kerala police registered two cases in October 1994 after Maldivian national Rasheeda was arrested in Thiruvananthapuram for allegedly obtaining secret drawings of ISRO rocket engines to sell to Pakistan. Narayanan, the then director of the cryogenic project at ISRO, was arrested along with his colleague, D Sasikumaran, and Fousiya Hasan, a Maldivian friend of Rasheeda. Former Supreme Court judge DK Jain inquired into the circumstances that led to the framing of Narayanan, 79, and his arrest. The CBI probed the matter and exonerated Narayanan in 1996.The Supreme Court called the police action against Narayanan “psycho-pathological treatment”. In September 2018, it said his “liberty and dignity”, basic to his human rights, were jeopardised as he was taken into custody and, eventually, despite all the glory of the past, he was compelled to face “cynical abhorrence”.In 2018, the Supreme Court directed the state government to pay him ₹50 lakh compensation for his wrongful incarceration, malicious prosecution, and humiliation for being framed in a false case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cbifiles-case-in-framing-of-isro-scientist-nambi-narayanan-101620099975528.html
04-05-2021||India||India received 17 consignments of medical aid from nations to battle Covid surge||The Centre on Tuesday prepared an exhaustive list of consignments of medical equipment that India has received from different nations amid spiraling surge in coronavirus disease cases.The government said between April 24 and May 2, India has received 17 consignments – comprising of essential medical equipment such as oxygen concentrators, cylinders of medical oxygen, ventilators and BiPAP machines, bedside monitors, anti-viral drugs, rapid kits to detect Covid-19 virus, pulse oximeters, N95 masks and personal protective equipment among others -- from 14 countries.The United Kingdom was the first to rush its consignment to India on April 24, where it sent 95 oxygen concentrators, 20 Lumis BiPAP machines, 20 ventilators and allied equipment.

A special military flight from Italy brought in the oxygen generation plant and a team of specialists to support the response to a massive surge in Coronavirus infections that has stretched healthcare facilities in many cities. The plant, capable of supplying an entire hospital, will be deployed at the ITBP hospital in Greater Noida, the Italian embassy said. The Italian support included 20 ventilators. The Italian specialists include a team from the Maxiemergenza 118 emergency service of Piedmont region, a doctor from Lombardy region and a representative of the Italian health ministry. The delegation was received by European Union (EU) Ambassador Ugo Astuto and Italian ambassador Vincenzo De Luca, who said, “Italy stands with India in the fight against Coronavirus...The medical team and equipment provided by Italy will contribute to saving lives in these terrible moments.” Italy is the third EU country, after France and Germany, to include an oxygen generation plant in its support package. France sent eight high capacity plants on Sunday while Germany is set to deliver a similar plant this week. The fourth consignment of medical supplies from the UK, containing 60 ventilators, also arrived on Monday. According to the Indian embassy in Qatar, 300 tonnes of medical aid from around the world, including ventilators, oxygen concentrators and PPE kits, are being flown in free of charge by Qatar Airways. The Singapore high commission said three cryogenic oxygen tanks and almost 1,000 oxygen cylinders were being despatched by the Singapore Red Cross and its corporate partners on the Indian warship INS Airavat. According to an official count, India has already received 1,656 oxygen concentrators, 965 ventilators, 1,782 oxygen cylinders, 17 large cylinders, 20 large oxygen concentrators, 150 bedside monitors, 480 BiPAPs, 20 high flow humidifying oxygen therapy devices, nine oxygen generation plants, 136,000 doses of Remdesivir, 200,000 packs of Favipiravir and other supplies. However, few details are officially available regarding the distribution of this equipment and other supplies. France and Italy are the only two countries that have specified where some of the equipment they supplied will go – the eight French oxygen generation plants are being distributed among hospitals in Delhi, Haryana and Telangana, while the Italian plant will go to the ITBP Hospital in Greater Noida. This has resulted in questions regarding the allocation of the supplies, including on social media. The external affairs ministry has said an empowered group of ministers and senior officials is responsible for allocation of the supplies in response to the needs of state governments. Once the foreign relief materials arrive at an Indian airport, they are handed over to the Indian Red Cross Society, which receives all supplies on behalf of the government. People familiar with developments said on condition of anonymity the supplies are then handled by the Red Cross, the Union health ministry and state-run HLL Lifecare, which is responsible for procurement and warehousing of medical supplies for the government. However, there was little clarity as of Monday how much of the materials had been despatched from HLL’s warehouses at the Delhi airport. The issue of transparency in distribution of relief materials has been raised by the media in countries such as the US. Asked about the matter, a US embassy spokesperson in New Delhi said: “As each US shipment arrives, USAID is transferring ownership of provided materials upon their arrival to the government of India through the Indian Red Cross organisation.” The spokesperson added: “We refer you to the government of India for information about the deployment and use of these materials subsequent to their transfer.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/more-covid-19-help-pours-in-for-india-questions-raised-about-aid-allocation-101620098535360.html

04-05-2021||India||US flights with Covid-19 medical supplies for India delayed till Wednesday||US Air Force flights that were scheduled to leave for India with essential life-saving supplies have been delayed till Wednesday due to maintenance issues, the Pentagon said here on Monday.We just received word from USTRANSCOM that the flights for India are "delayed until at least Wednesday due to maintenance issues", a Pentagon spokesperson said.So far, only two US Air Force flights have landed in India.Three US Air Force C-5 Super Galaxies and one C-17 Globemaster were scheduled to leave for India Monday to deliver critical supplies amid a surge in coronavirus cases there.Officials, however, did not say how this would impact the emergency aid supplies to India, in particular life-saving oxygen cylinders and concentrators.Earlier in the day, Pentagon Press Secretary John Kirby told reporters that the US will continue to fly its planes with health care supplies for India, which has faced one of the worst outbreaks of Covid-19 in the world.Three US Air Force C-5 Super Galaxies and one C-17 Globemaster are continuing to deliver critical healthcare supplies to India, which is experiencing one of the worst outbreaks of Covid-19, the Pentagon said.“We continue to assist the government and the people of India as they continue to struggle with their Covid outbreak,” Kirby said.US Transportation Command and its components continue to demonstrate their capability to provide immediate assistance to a partner nation, he said.The United States will continue to assess the situation, he said."We'll stay in touch with our counterparts in India, should there be a need for additional help. The (defense) secretary was very clear in speaking to his counterpart in India that we'll continue to do whatever we can to help,” Kirby said.Meanwhile, Senator Amy Klobuchar said the tragic crisis in India is a reminder that "we can only beat Covid-19 if we beat it everywhere".The United States, she said "is stepping up and providing relief and aid to our ally in this time of tremendous and heart-breaking need".Congressman Alan Lowenthal said the Biden Administration has taken early positive steps but the scale of the tragedy in India is simply unbearable."We must do more to facilitate access to vaccines. We have a duty to save lives and to reduce the risk of terrifying new variants," he said."The Covid crisis in India is heartbreaking and could have huge implications for the rest of the world. The fight against this pandemic is a global one and we must do our part to help combat this surge and save lives," Congresswoman Jennifer Wexton said in a tweet."India is in crisis. President Biden’s decision to send supplies and vaccine doses to India is a necessary one. But we must also eliminate vaccine patents — and work to expand vaccine production and availability globally. We must work to save lives everywhere," Congresswoman Cori Bush tweeted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/us-flights-with-covid-19-medical-supplies-for-india-delayed-till-wednesday-101620092502489.html

We stand with India, particularly during these difficult times India is experiencing, and are sending life-saving equipment to our Indian brothers and sisters," Foreign Minister Gabi Ashkenazi said in the statement."Israel and India share strategic ties that span a wide range of political, security, and economic issues. India is one of the most important countries for Israel broadly in the international arena and particularly in Asia-Pacific," the Foreign Minister said, adding that the emergency assistance is an "expression of deep friendship" between both countries.He thanked all those who cooperated in arranging the comprehensive package.The economic division at the Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs is said to have roped in key economic bodies, including the Israel-India Chamber of Commerce, Israel-Asia Chamber of Commerce, Manufacturers' Association of Israel, Federation of Israeli Chambers of Commerce and the Israel Export Institute for the aid package.Separately, Amdocs has announced to donate 150 oxygen generators, which will be sent to India as part of the Israeli aid package, the press statement said.The JDC (American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee) is said to have also joined Israel’s aid efforts and will donate oxygen generators and other equipment."We recall that at the beginning of the coronavirus crisis last year, India mobilised to assist Israel and within this framework approved the air delivery of masks, gloves and raw materials for medicines to Israel and also helped arrange the repatriation of Israeli citizens," the statement said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/israel-to-send-life-saving-medical-equipment-to-india-amid-covid-19-crisis-101620085668047.html
04-05-2021||India||PM Modi-Boris Johnson virtual summit brings 1 bn pound worth of deals||The British government has finalised GBP 1 billion worth of trade and investment with India, creating over 6,500 jobs in Britain, ahead of the virtual summit between UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson and his Indian counterpart Narendra Modi on Tuesday.The investments confirmed by Downing Street on Monday evening form part of an Enhanced Trade Partnership (ETP), which the two leaders will formally sign off during their talks.The ETP will set the ambition to double the value of UK-India trade by 2030 and declare a shared intent to begin work towards a comprehensive Free Trade Agreement (FTA).“Like every aspect of the UK-India relationship, the economic links between our countries make our people stronger and safer,” said Johnson.“Each and every one of the more than 6,500 jobs we have announced today will help families and communities build back from coronavirus and boost the British and Indian economies. In the decade ahead, with the help of (the) new partnership signed today and a comprehensive Free Trade Agreement, we will double the value of our trading partnership with India and take the relationship between our two countries to new highs,” he said.The trade and investment package unveiled by the British government contains over GBP 533 million of new Indian investment into the UK, covering areas such as healthcare and technology.This includes a GBP 240 million investment by the Serum Institute of India (SII) in the UK into its vaccine business and a new sales office in the country, expected to generate new business worth over USD 1 billion.Serum Institute's investment will support clinical trials, research and development and "possibly" manufacturing of vaccines, to help the UK and the world defeat the coronavirus pandemic and other deadly diseases, Downing Street said.British businesses have also secured new export deals with India worth more than GBP 446 million, which is expected to create more than 400 British jobs.This includes CMR Surgical exporting its next-generation “Versius” surgical robotic system, which helps surgeons perform minimal access surgery being rolled out to hospitals in India.This export deal is worth GBP 200 million and will result in the creation of 100 new jobs in the UK.“With almost 1.4 billion people, India’s population is bigger than the EU and US combined and by far the largest market the UK has committed to negotiating a trade deal with to date,” Downing Street said.The ETP agreed between India and the UK is said to create immediate opportunities for British businesses in India across industries including food and drink, life sciences and the service sector.Non-tariff barriers on fruit and medical devices will be lowered, allowing British businesses to export more of their products to India and boosting UK growth and jobs.It also commits both sides to addressing immediate market access barriers as well as continuing to seek further opportunities on the road to an FTA.“A future UK-India trade deal will support hundreds of thousands of jobs and boost the economies of both the UK and India by potentially lowering or removing current tariffs such as those of up to 150 per cent on whisky and up to 125 per cent on automotives as well as on other British products. It would also create huge benefits for British services -- four out five of India’s fastest growing imports are for services like IP and telecommunications,” Downing Street said.The trade barriers addressed by the ETP include lifting restrictions to enable fruit producers across the UK to export British apples, pears and quince to India for the first time and improved access for medical devices through the acceptance of UK Certificates of Free Sale in India, removing the requirement for additional accreditation of UK medical devices when exporting to the Indian market before they can be sold.There is also a commitment to deepening cooperation in educational services and concluding work on the recognition of UK higher education qualifications, which will encourage an increase in student flows, skills transfer and knowledge sharing between the UK and India.It has also been agreed for both sides to work on removing barriers in the Indian legal services sector preventing UK lawyers from practising international and foreign law in India, a step that Downing Street could “significantly increase” UK legal services exports and UK legal services imports from India.According to official statistics, trade between the UK and India is already worth around GBP 23 billion a year, supporting more than half a million jobs.Last week, Johnson spoke to Indian business leaders from companies Infosys and HCL and the software majors are among the Indian firms listed as part of a series of investment deals, set to create 1,000 jobs each in the UK.Some of the others on the list include the likes of biotech firm Global Gene Corp, TVS Motors and Goila Butter Chicken.The UK companies clinching export deals with India include Morningside Pharmaceuticals with an R&D pact, Kloudpad with a data centres deal, BP in a partnership with Infosys and GoZero Mobility with an e-bicycles deal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-boris-johnson-virtual-summit-brings-1-bn-pound-worth-of-deals-101620085690967.html
04-05-2021||India||Tanzanian diplomat dies of Covid as missions battle surge in Capital||The defence advisor at the high commission of Tanzania has died of Covid-19, the first death within the diplomatic community in New Delhi amid the devastating second wave of Coronavirus infections sweeping across the country.Col Moses Beatus Mlula was taken to a leading private hospital of New Delhi in a serious condition on April 27 but it declined to admit him, people familiar with developments said.“He was waiting in front of the private hospital when his condition worsened. The army’s foreign division received a call for help and immediately took him to Base Hospital,” the people said. Mlula died on April 28 at the Base Hospital at Delhi Cantonment.The people cited above said there were reports of Indian staff and junior diplomats testing positive at several foreign missions, including those of the Philippines, New Zealand, Thailand, Vietnam, Palestine, the US and Afghanistan. Some of those who tested positive were self-isolating at home while a handful had been hospitalised. There was no official word from Indian officials on these developments.The foreign missions too are tight-lipped on issues such as whether the treatment of infected staff has been affected by the shortage of oxygen and hospital beds, especially after a spat between the government and the opposition Congress over Youth Congress volunteers delivering oxygen cylinders to the Philippines embassy and the New Zealand high commission.The people cited above acknowledged that some missions faced difficulties in accessing both medicines and hospital beds but pointed out that this should be seen in the overall context of swamped healthcare facilities in Delhi and the NCR.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tanzanian-diplomat-dies-of-covid-as-missions-battle-surge-in-capital-101620086127080.html
04-05-2021||India||UK PM announces new £1 bn trade deal with India||UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Monday announced new UK-India trade and investment worth £1 billion, including an investment of £240 million by the Serum Institute of India (SII) for its vaccine business in Britain, ahead of a virtual summit with his Indian counterpart Narendra Modi.The virtual summit on Tuesday will witness the roll-out of a new “Enhanced Trade Partnership” that is expected to pave the way for a future free trade agreement. More than 6,500 new jobs are expected to be created in the UK by the new bilateral trade and investment announced by Johnson.The package contains new Indian investments of more than £533 million that is expected to create more than 6,000 jobs in vital sectors such as health and technology. Deals worth £200 million will support low carbon growth.The investments include £240 million to be pumped in by SII for its vaccine business in Britain, and a new sales office that is expected to create a “large number of jobs”, the UK Prime Minister’s Office said in a statement. SII’s sales office is expected to generate new business worth more than $1 billion, £200 million of which will be invested into the UK.SII’s investment will also support clinical trials, research and development and possibly manufacturing of vaccines. This will help the UK and the world to defeat the pandemic and other deadly diseases. SII has already started phase one trials in the UK of a one-dose nasal vaccine for the coronavirus in partnership with Codagenix INC.British businesses have secured new export deals with India worth more than £446 million, which are expected to create more than 400 British jobs.

04-05-2021||India||Covid-19: What you need to know today||From the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic, some states and Union territories have expended more energy in managing the numbers than managing the spread of the viral disease. It’s almost as if by showing fewer reported cases — these are, in any case, a fraction of the actual cases — and recording fewer deaths, the pandemic will magically go away. At one level this is outright dishonesty; at another, it is understandable because it comes from untrained minds unfamiliar with both science and data (and the importance of both in addressing the pandemic). Then if mygov.in thinks it’s alright to advise people to put oil in their nostrils — don’t try this at home; actually, don’t try this at all — what chance do science and data have in the country? Mathematically, as much chance as Ayush-64 actually working as a Covid-19 treatment. For those who came in late, this is another cure being sold on the basis of a completely disingenuous study. For instance, give me a bunch of healthy individuals, asymptomatically infected with Covid-19, and I can show that Japanese whisky, in moderate doses, helps them (again, don’t try this at home). The fact that the eminently qualified worthies who have been put in charge of India’s Covid response don’t think it is necessary to identify such claims for what they are says a lot about them.But back to the numbers — anyone looking at India’s Covid-19 numbers over the past few days can be forgiven for thinking the country is beating back the second wave. On Friday, India saw 408,331 new Covid cases. On Saturday, this number fell to 392,497. And on Sunday, it fell further to 363,921. This is far from the truth (although there is nothing more I’d like to see than the numbers coming down). Over these three days, the number of tests carried out has fallen (quite sharply), from 1.945 million on Friday to 1.804 million on Saturday, and then, to 1.504 on Sunday. Fewer tests mean fewer cases. The corresponding positivity rates on the three days: 21%, 21.7%, and 24.2%.This is understandable (and also shows there hasn’t been large-scale gaming of the positivity rate). But at the disaggregated level, there is clearly an effort to show things are better than they actually are. A quick revision of what we know of positivity rates may be in order: when a region starts testing more (from a low base), the positivity rate increases, then stays the same for some time — in fact, as evident from the experience of the first wave in states such as Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, and Kerala, it stays at a high plateau for weeks sometimes — before beginning to decline. A sharp decline in the positivity rate with an increasing number of tests is actually a red flag. Delhi saw this last year — a very sharp peak in the case trajectory (peaks are actually more rounded) brought about by a faulty testing strategy — and it means the positivity rate is being managed in some way. Is that happening now? Most likely.Consider Uttar Pradesh — I pick it because it is India’s most populous state, and also escaped the brunt of India’s first wave, which doesn’t bode well for it now. Between April 26 and May 2, the number of cases in the state has ranged between 29,000 and 35,000. It was 33,551 cases on April 26, but only 30,857 cases on May 2 (it was as low as 29,751 cases on April 28). In this period, the number of tests has increased from 176,720 to 297,385, which is good, and the positivity rate has declined sharply from 18.9% to 10.3%. In fact, it has consistently dipped — 18.9%, 17.8%, 15.9%, 15%, 14%, 11.3%, and 10.3%. That’s an 8.6 percentage point drop in the positivity rate in seven days in a state that has seen neither surges nor plateaus of the kind seen in Maharashtra, Karnataka, Kerala, and Tamil Nadu. That’s entirely within the realm of the possible — but there’s a very low probability of it happening.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid19-what-you-need-to-know-today-101620075202433.html

The same day, senior advocate Sachin Datta, appearing for the Jaipur Golden Hospital, told high court that the hospital lost 20 patients due to the shortage of oxygen, and was still facing a deficit in supply.The Delhi government on April 28 constituted a a committee to ascertain the number of deaths due to shortage of oxygen in the hospitals across the national capital, following a direction by the high court on April 27.The four-member committee was mandated to examine the case sheets of all such patients, and to determine whether the cause of death was shortage of oxygen or otherwise; in addition to seeking data from all hospitals and nursing homes on such deaths. In response to the query of the city government, six hospitals and nursing home sent reports on an email id created for this purpose.Documents reviewed by HT have shown that the committee said that all 21 patients at Jaipur Golden Hospital were sick or critical and suffering from Covid-19. It said that all 21 patients were getting oxygen therapy or ventilation throughout their hospital stay including at the time of resuscitation, and there was no mention of oxygen shortage in any of the case records.“In view of natural virulent course of the disease and lack of any evidence suggestive of oxygen shortage in the case records, the committee was of the opinion that shortage of oxygen as the cause of death could not be ascertained,” the Delhi government told the high court bench on Monday.The committee noted that the deaths took place over the course of seven hours. While the first patient died at 10.44pm on April 23, the last death was reported at 5.51am on April 24, the document seen by HT said. The committee said that many of the patients had one or multiple co-morbidities such as heart disease, diabetes, hypothyroidism and hypertension.“All these patients were receiving some form of oxygen therapy and/or ventilator support during the hospital stay,” the report said, adding that “all patients were given supplemental oxygen till their resuscitation/death”.“There was no mention of shortage of oxygen in any of the case sheets and patients were given oxygen supplementation till last, based on the clinical requirement, as per records made available to the committee. …The reason of death in all 21 cases has been uniformly mentioned as “respiratory failure” in the proforma submitted by the hospital,” the report said.The committee has also said that even though shortage of drug was recorded in the case sheet of one patient. However, shortage of oxygen, if any, was not recorded.The hospital did not respond to requests for comment.Meanwhile, some relatives of the 21 who died at the hospital labelled the Delhi government’s move a “cover up”.“This is a complete cover up by the Delhi government. Hospital authorities started making SOS calls to the government regarding the shortage of oxygen but to no avail, “ said Erick Massey, whose mother Delphin Massey (61) died on the same day.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/21-at-jaipur-golden-died-of-co-morbidities-not-lack-of-oxygen-delhi-govt-report-to-hc-101620071231788.html

On Sunday, two relief aircraft from the US landed in the Capital carrying over 1,000 oxygen cylinders, regulators and other medical equipment as well as 125,000 vials of remdesivir.Several countries have been extending a helping hand to India, to fight the second wave of the pandemic that has hit the country hard, resulting in a shortage of oxygen, beds, drugs and other medical essentials.Between April 28 and May 2, the Delhi airport has handled around 25 Covid relief flights, which have brought in around 300 tonnes of medical supplies from various countries such as the US, the UK, the UAE, Uzbekistan, Thailand, Germany, Qatar, Hong Kong and China.The relief material received so far comprises over 5,500 oxygen concentrators, approximately 3,200 oxygen cylinders, over 928,000 face masks and about 136,000 remdesivir injections.All the relief material received on Monday was transferred to the cargo area of the airport and stored inside a temperature-controlled warehouse, JEEVODAY, set up to handle relief material, until the goods are dispatched to their destinations, Delhi airport officials said.The airport operator, DIAL (Delhi International Airport Ltd), said they have a dedicated team of operators at the cargo terminal -- clearing agents, staff from the warehouses and government agencies such as the customs and Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) — who together ensure that all incoming relief material is processed and handled without delay.“We ensure priority landing is given to flights carrying Covid relief material, and such aircraft get parking at the cargo bays near the cargo terminals, just like aircraft bringing in vaccines. We make sure consignments are processed and cleared in the least possible time,” DIAL said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/covid-relief-aid-flows-in-as-20-ventilators-oxygen-production-unit-arrive-from-italy-101620071111220.html
04-05-2021||India||Stalin rises to the helm but AIADMK retains bastions||Chennai: MK Stalin led the DMK and its allies to a comfortable victory with 159 seats out of 234 in the Tamil Nadu assembly, as they were backed by Chennai and regions of the north, south and the centre. But defying the trend in these regions, the AIADMK retained its grip over its bastion, which is the western belt or Kongu region, from where outgoing chief minister Edappadi Palaniswami and other top ministers in his cabinet hail. A combination of their work and caste factor helped the party in putting up a tight fight along with its allies and securing 75 seats. Chennai Chennai, with 16 assembly seats, showed that it remains the DMK’s fort with the party winning 15 and its main ally Congress securing one. Stalin won from the city’s Kolathur constituency for the third time. His son, who made his debut from late DMK patriarch M Karunanidhi borough -- Chepauk-Thiruvallikeni -- also won by a wide margin. AIADMK’s heavyweight outgoing ministers D Jayakumar and ‘Mafoi’ Panidarajan lost in the city wave that supported the DMK. In 2016, when J Jayalalithaa retained power, the AIADMK performed the worst in Chennai (37.5%) compared to other regions, winning only six seats. This was largely due to the electorate’s anger in the aftermath of the 2015 December floods in Chennai. The DMK wrested back these six constituencies and improved its vote share. North In the northern region, the DMK has gone from winning 35 seats in 2016 to 47 this election out of 64 seats. This region includes districts, such as Villupuram and Dharmapuri, where there are caste tensions. The AIADMK’s last-minute announcement of 10.5% internal reservation for the Vanniyar community, a core votebank of its ally Pattali Makkal Katchi (PMK), within the MBC (Most Backward Caste) quota resulted in a consolidation of non-Vanniyar votes. A considerable Dalit population in the region backed the DMK which is in alliance with Viduthalai Chiruthaigal Katchi (formerly known as the Dalit Panthers of India). The AIADMK’s law minister CV Shunmugam also lost to former partyman Dr R Lakshmanan who joined the DMK -- both candidates are Vanniyars. Interviews with voters before the polling indicated that the Vanniyars in this region weren’t appeased by the reservation, which they believed was a hasty decision done for political gains and may not come through -- some weren’t aware of the Bill being passed in the assembly. West The Vanniyar reservation, however, did have some gains in the western belt, which has a presence of Vanniyars as well as Gounders, a community to which Palaniswami belongs. A combination of caste factor as well as the work done by ministers here has helped the AIADMK regain its position after losing much of it to the DMK in the 2019 parliamentary elections. This region catapulted Jayalalithaa to become chief minister for the second time in 2016 where the party gave its best performance winning 84% of the seats. In 2021, this has reduced to 66% but higher than DMK’s 33%. However, following Jayalalithaa’s death in December 2016, a divided AIADMK’s alliance with the BJP led to a strong anti-incumbency that had helped Stalin sweep 38/39 Lok Sabha seats. On his home turf Edappadi constituency, Palaniswami won for the seventh time and bettered his margin by winning with a 92,849 vote difference this election compared to 42,022 vote margin in 2016. The party won six out of the eight segments falling within the Salem parliamentary constituency, which includes Edappadi seat. “He has caused a ripple effect as even those surrounding Salem voted for the AIADMK,” said political analyst Maalan Narayanan. South and Central region In DMK’s traditional stronghold, it reigned supreme --more than doubling its performance in the central region from 41.3% in 2016 to 86.9% this election. The DMK now has 40 MLAs from this region and AIADMK has come down from 27 to six MLAs. “The crop loan waiver has had no effect in the delta region,” said Narayanan. The central districts include Trichy, Nagappatinam, and Karur where the AIADMK’s efforts to appease farmers by waiving ₹12,110-crore crop loans for 1.63 million farmers and announcing delta districts as a protected agriculture zone didn’t help the party. In the south, DMK’s campaign against police excesses in the Thoothukudi firing, in which 13 anti-Sterlite protestors died in May 2018, and the custodial deaths of the father-son duo last year seems to have worked. The DMK improved its vote percentage from 44.8% in the previous election to 68.9%. The big upset here was AIADMK’s rebel faction AMMK founder TTV Dhinakaran’s loss to sitting minister Kadambur Raju. “It was expected that the south will see a split because of caste votes. AMMK was expected to take away Mukkaluthur caste voters who would support VK Sasikala but it seems to have gone to the DMK,” said Narayanan. “Overall, the AIADMK has to introspect because except for its stronghold in the west, the ministers in other regions have lost by huge margins.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/stalin-rises-to-the-helm-but-aiadmk-retains-bastions-101620070330912.html
04-05-2021||India||For first time in 20 years, BJP makes mark down south||Chennai: The Bharatiya Janata Party has made some significant electoral gains down south, especially in Tamil Nadu and Puducherry, where its vote share has increased from previous elections. The party could also get some consolation in Kerala, where its vote-share did not go down much despite the Left Front alliance sweeping the polls. For the first time, the BJP, whose strong hold has always been the Hindi heartland, has made a mark in the southern states, where it had failed to expand its base despite several efforts. After a gap of 20 years, the BJP has won four seats in Tamil Nadu assembly elections, results of which were announced on Sunday. It also opened its account after two decades in neighbouring Puducherry, where it had no presence before the polls. Its three MLAs in the Union territory were all nominated members. The BJP won six seats in the UT and NDA is set to form the government in alliance with senior partner All Indian NR Congress (AINRC) in the National Democratic Alliance. AINRC met governor Tamilisai Soundarajan to stake claim to form the government. In Tamil Nadu, the BJP contested in only 20 seats in the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK)-led alliance, winning four of them. It won Tirunelveli, Nagercoil, Modakurichi seats and a nail-biting contest in Coimbatore South. The party got 2.62% of the total votes polled, which was two percentage points less than that of the Congress, which contested 25 seats in alliance with the MK Stalin-led Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK). The national party has been pulling all stops to make inroads into the Dravidian heartland, sensing an opportunity after the demise of Dravidian stalwarts and former chief ministers J Jayalalithaa in December 2016 and M Karunanidhi in August 2018. While it is evident that the Dravidian parties still hold sway in Tamil Nadu with the DMK winning a majority and AIADMK finishing with 66 seats, the BJP’s gains, despite small, has come as a shot in the arm for party leaders and workers, who now aim to build on these results for the 2026 state polls. “The wins have laid a solid foundation for the growth of our party,” said BJP’s Tamil Nadu election in-charge C T Ravi. The last time the BJP made gains in Tamil Nadu was in 2001, when it was in alliance with the DMK and had won four seats. To counter its image as a north-Indian Hindi party, the BJP revamped its state unit, which is headed by a Dalit, L Murugan. The party also held the Vetrivel yatra of Tamil deity Lord Muruga, who is worshipped widely by locals, in November 2020 in its attempt to consolidate Hindu votes. However, the yatra did not garner the expected response. During the election campaigns, Prime Minister Narendra Modi would start his address to the public by throwing up his hands and saying, “vetrivel” (victorious sear), to which the crowd would respond by saying “veeravel” (courageous spear). On the ground, the BJP also strengthened its booth committees, activating more than 48,000 of them. “Their pro-Hindu rhetoric worked to some extent,” political analyst Raveendran Duraisamy said, adding, “But it was the AIADMK that overall contributed to their wins, especially in Modakkurichi for C Saraswathi.” Saraswathi defeated former DMK minister Subbulakshmi Jegadeesan. On the specific wins, Duraisamy said BJP’s M R Gandhi surprised three-time DMK MLA N Suresh Rajan because of a Hindu consolidation while in Tirunelveli, former AIADMK leader Nainar Nagendran gave the BJP a win with the caste support of Mukkalathurs and Devendrakula Vellalars. These caste groups supported Modi after he accepted their long-standing demand to group seven sub-castes together to be known by their heritage name. Coimbatore South witnessed a seesaw battle with actor and Makkal Needhi Maiam chief Kamal Haasan leading through the day only to get defeated by Vanathi Srinivasan, who is the BJP’s national women’s wing president, by 1,540 votes. “It was her individual work. She has been working in the constituency for more than three years, which helped her reach the masses,” said Duraisamy. In Puducherry, which is currently under Governor’s rule, the National Democratic Alliance led by N Rangasamy’s AINRC is set to form the government in the 30-seat assembly. While the AINRC won 10, BJP six, their ally AIADMK drew a blank in the UT. The Congress, which had failed to prove a majority in the assembly resulting in the fall of the elected government in Puducherry in February, could only win two seats while its ally DMK secured six seats. From just one MLA in 2001 and three nominated members between 2016 and 2021, the BJP has come a long way in the UT. Besides anti-incumbency and Rangasamy’s enjoying a support base as former chief minister, the results also reflected the significance of the exodus of heavyweights like former minister A Namassivayam and A John Kumar from the Congress to the BJP. “BJP poached powerful individuals in Puducherry who helped them win,” said Duraisamy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/for-first-time-in-20-years-bjp-makes-mark-down-south-101620070210935.html
04-05-2021||India||After Kerala debacle, many demand Cong overhaul||Thiruvananthapuram: After shocking defeat in the assembly elections in Kerala knives are out in the Congress, with many leaders openly demanding complete overhaul of the organisation and corrective steps to stem the tide, people familiar with the developments said. The Congress-led United Democratic Front (UDF) managed to win only 41 out of 140 seats in the Kerala assembly elections, results of which were announced on Sunday. The ruling Communist Party of India (Marxist)-led Left Democratic Front swept the polls, winning 99 seats and breaking the four-decade-old jinx of alternating government in the state. Soon after the results were declared, leader of opposition Ramesh Chennithala and Kerala Pradesh Congress Committee president Mullapally Ramachandran reportedly informed the party high command about their intention to quit. While the HT cannot independently verify the veracity of the reports, it has learnt that the two leaders were waiting for permission from the high command. Many district Congress presidents have also offered to quit, people quoted earlier said. Alapuzha district Congress president M Liju, who lost in Ambalapuzha, has already resigned and Idukki and Kannur DCC presidents have also offered to quit. Many party workers took to the social media to vent their anger and sought immediate change of the state leadership, with a section strongly batting for Kannur strongman and member of Parliament K Sudhakaran to assume the PCC president’s post to lift the sagging morale of workers. They argued that only a strong leader could check the ruling CPI(M), adding that Sudhakaran is known for his acerbic tongue and strong reactions. Senior leader and former minister Thiruvanchur Radhakrishnan has also endorsed the name, saying Sudhakaran was able enough to steer the party out of trouble. “There was laxity after the big victory in parliament elections (winning 19 out of 20 Lok Sabha seats) and some of the leaders failed to gauge the Left front’s ability to manipulate things. It is a collective responsibility, but senior leaders will have to own it up,” senior Congress leader P T Thomas, who emerged victorious from a seat in Ernakulam, said on Monday. Another section of Congress workers blamed the party for introducing so many young candidates in such a short span. Out of 95 Congress candidates, more than 55% were new faces and the party termed it a “generational shift”. But only a couple of them made it in the Left surge and the party could win only 21 seats this time. Some workers even said that party’s national leader Rahul Gandhi, who campaigned extensively and had a big role in the selection of candidates, will have to share responsibility. He and his sister Priyanka Gandhi Vadra had campaigned extensively in the state. As an MP from Wayanad, Gandhi held many rallies, road shows and interactions in the state. Some of his videos like addressing students in a women’s college in Kochi and his sea voyage with fishermen in Kollam later turned viral. Meanwhile, some young party workers have sought a larger role for Thiruvananthapuram MP Shashi Tharoor, who is quite popular among youth. Tharoor campaigned extensively in the state this time and also prepared a “people’s manifesto”. “The party will have to undergo a major operation. It has to be built all over again bottom up. And many young leaders will have to come up. Otherwise, it will stagnate at this level and decline in its popular base,” said G Pramod Kumar, political analyst and former advisor of the United Nations Development Programme.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/after-kerala-debacle-many-demand-cong-overhaul-101620070150854.html
04-05-2021||India||‘Stressed’ B’luru police worried about additional IPL duties||Bengaluru: Ten matches of the ongoing Indian Premier League (IPL) are scheduled in Bengaluru between May 9 to May 22, and several officers in the Bengaluru police are not happy about the additional burden of providing security to the cricket league. With more than 700 policemen in isolation due to Covid and the police forces working overtime to enforce the lockdown, these officers feel setting aside more than 300 policemen for IPL duties would put pressure on the force. A senior police officer on the condition of anonymity said that even though no crowd is allowed during the matches, protection of the stadium and players will still require security personnel. “We will have to secure all entry and exit points of the stadium, conduct sanitization of the stadium and provide escort for players and other staff, apart from security at the hotels,” said the officer. Talking about the current deployment of the police in the city, an IPS officer said that while the normal duties such as manning a police station have come down, additional boots are required on the field. “We have to conduct patrols, man check posts, provide security to Covid centres and hospital. In fact, we have deployed home guards to make fill the gaps in the manpower,” the officer added. The top brass of Bengaluru police, however, said they will fulfil the commitment of providing security, which was decided before the second wave. “As a professional force we will provide adequate security,” said Kamal Pant, Bengaluru police commissioner. “Unless the government decides otherwise, we will provide enough men to ensure that the Indian Premier League goes without any security hassle,” he added. Talking about the security arrangements, Pant said that security will be provided at the hotels where the players say, an escort will be provided on the route of their travel and there will be deployment at the stadium. “Since there is no crowd, there will be only three categories of people. – players, support staff and organizers of the tournament. Only two gates will be left open because there is no crowd,” he added. When asked about the reservations from his subordinates, he said that police will abide by the government’s decision. A junior officer, however, added that as part of the security protocols ambulances will have to stationed at the stadium in the case of an emergency. “This is a time when we need all ambulances, we have for Covid patients. The contingency plans will also cater for oxygen supplies and other medical services for the players and others in case of an emergency during the tournament. Already there is news of some players catching the virus,” the officer detailed his concerns. The officer added that Bengaluru police had refused to provide security for IPL in 2009 after the police department was stretched because of the Lok Sabha elections. At the same time, some officers within the department argued that the IPL is a good move since people would stay at home to watch the games, even after the lockdown is lifted. On April 27, taking exception to the Indian Premier League being conducted at a time when the country is facing its worst Covid tragedy, Congress MLC Prakash K Rathod has sought the cancellation of the cricket tournament. In an open letter, the MLC has asked the State government to urge the Board for Cricket Control in India (BCCI) and the Karnataka State Cricket Association (KSCA) to cancel the games, and convert the Chinnaswamy stadium, located in the heart of the city, into a Covid Care Centre. “It is surprising that KSCA has been adamant on hosting the IPL games in Bengaluru. Has KSCA forgotten that Bengaluru is number one in Covid cases in India? Can KSCA’s Chinnaswamy stadium not be converted into a huge Covid centre instead?” he asked. When contacted a senior official of the Karnataka State Cricket Association (KSCA) said that the tournament is being held with permissions from the required authorities. “The union home ministry has granted security clearance for the tournament and the state government after deliberations have agreed to provide security. There are strict safety protocols being followed and most importantly the matches are not open to crowds, this reduces the burden on security considerably,” the official said on the condition of anonymity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/stressed-b-luru-police-worried-about-additional-ipl-duties-101620070090943.html
04-05-2021||India||Bypoll results can help revive Cong before 2023 polls: Experts||Bengaluru The Congress won one of the two Assembly seats and made significant gains in the Belagavi Lok Sabha constituency in the recently concluded bypolls, results of which were announced on Sunday. Though numerically the Congress emerged victorious on only one of the three bypolls in the state, but political analysts said the results might revive the party’s chances in the state, which will go to assembly elections in 2023. DK Shivakumar, the Karnataka Congress president, said the results showed that people were showing their confidence in the party. With just two years to go for the assembly polls, the Congress has an opportunity to wrest power in the state by capitalising on the internal bickering within the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the growing voices against chief minister BS Yediyurappa, analysts said. “If they (Congress) make their candidates’ choice strategically and carefully, they can fight the BJP,” A Narayana, political analyst and faculty at the Azim Premji University in Bengaluru said. Congress’s Basanagouda Turvihal won the Maski assembly bypoll, defeating BJP’s Pratap Patil by a margin of 30,606 votes, while the other assembly bypoll saw BJP’s Sharanu Salagar beat the Congress candidate, Mala B Narayanrao by 20,629 votes. In Belagavi Lok Sabha bypoll, BJP’s Mangal Suresh Angadi defeated Congress’ Satish Jarkiholi by a narrow margin of 5,240 votes. On the latter’s candidature for the Lok Sabha bypoll, Nayarayan said Satish Jarkiholi was a strong local face with influence over the district. Analysts also pointed out that while Jarkiholi lost the Belagavi bypoll, but the margin was a positive sign for the Congress, which had lost the seat to late Union minister Suresh Angadi of the BJP in 2019 by a margin of nearly 4 lakh votes. Analysts said the Congress has gained in Karnataka by decentralising power, leaving more decision-making powers with local units than with the high command. However, this has led to the creation of local chieftains like Siddaramaiah, who refuses to cede control over the party affairs to Shivakumar, the Congress president in the state, analysts said. They pointed out that another factor that was working in Congress’ favour was the gradual dilution of former chief minister HD Kumaraswamy-led Janata Dal (Secular) or JD(S). “We have seen the gradual dilution of the JD(S). They are increasingly getting marginalised and searching for a political identity for themselves. That gives the Congress greater credibility in terms of revivalism in Karnataka politics,” Vinod MJ, a Bengaluru-based political analyst, said. Analysts also said that the Congress’ decision to put Siddaramaiah and Shivakumar at the helm of affairs gives it a good chance for a revival, if the two could manage to put their differences aside. Another positive for the Congress was its performance in the recent local urban body elections, where it managed to win six out of the 10 ULBs across several districts, including pockets of Shivamogga, the home district of chief minister Yediyurappa. The results came as an embarrassment to the ruling BJP, which is yet to put its house in order despite being in power for two years in the state. With allegations of mismanagement of the Covid-19 pandemic situation, lack of performance, cash-crunch, running a parallel administration through his second son (BY Vijayendra) and simmering dissent, Yediyurappa has spent most of his time in office dousing one crisis after another. While the BJP shrugged away any chance of Congress’ revival, analysts said the party would do that at its own risk. “This is a kind of revivalism that the BJP cannot ignore,” Vinod MJ added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bypoll-results-can-help-revive-cong-before-2023-polls-experts-101620070030952.html
04-05-2021||India||Govt orders green corridor for oxygen tankers||Bengaluru: The Karnataka government on Monday ordered to provide green corridors for oxygen tankers and to conduct daily audits of oxygen supply, which will be made public every day. This is among the several decisions taken by the government on Monday after 24 people died in a hospital in Chamarajangar district and two hospitals ran short of oxygen supply in Bengaluru. On Monday evening, chief minister BS Yediyurappa held a meeting with oxygen manufacturers and suppliers in the state. Apart from offering green corridors, which provide is a special route to the vehicle by manually operating traffic signal to avoid red lights, the government announced several other directions. As per communication from the Chief Minister’s office, during the meeting, Yediyurappa has asked the oxygen manufacturers to reduce the time taken to re-fill the oxygen tankers. Directions were given to toll gates to avoid unnecessary delay, convert nitrogen and argon tankers available for supplying oxygen, utilize the services of LPG tanker drivers in case of emergency. In another order on Monday, the government has asked all oxygen re-filling agencies in a particular district and Bengaluru to furnish their total and full accounts of oxygen, every day. The reporting should include the receipts of the day, supply and balance oxygen stock. “All the oxygen re-filling agencies of a district & BBMP shall every day give a detailed and accurate account of their supply (expenditure) of the Oxygen to the hospitals and other establishments to whom the oxygen is supplied by them and the quantity that is supplied. The said break-up shall match the daily total supply (expenditure),” read a government order dated May 3. The order further added that the details collected from suppliers will be made public by respective authorities. “The districts and the BBMP shall nominate one Camp Officer, not below the rank of Tehsildar, for each Re-Filler Station falling in their jurisdiction. who shall camp at his/her assigned Re-Filling Station and oversee and ensure that medical oxygen supplies to indenting hospitals are smooth,” the order added. At the same time, The Clinical Expert Committee of Karnataka chaired by the Vice-Chancellor, RGUHS has recommended guidelines for minimizing wastage and rational use of oxygen in health care facilities in the state. “The rate of the consumption of oxygen by the hospitals treating COVID-19 patients has revealed that there is indiscriminate and wasteful use of oxygen in many hospitals. Optimal use of oxygen needs to be ensured both for better healthcare of the patient as well as the curtailment of wastage of oxygen as it is a scarce resource,” read a government order. The guidelines contain details like how to adjust oxygen use to the lowest permissible level along with other advisories. “These guidelines also lay down the responsibility of health team regarding judicial use and the responsibility of the hospital administrators in monitoring and audit of oxygen use. As per the guidelines, each health care facility shall designate an Oxygen Monitoring Team for each shift. Each facility shall also form an Oxygen Audit Committee and submit a report on the use of oxygen pre and post-audit to the Expert Committees constituted by Order No. HFW 276 ACS 2020, dated 29.07.2020.

The three claimed that the rogue cops extorted crores of rupees from them.Police officers who asked not to be named said DGP Pandey has entrusted the complaints to the state Crime Investigation Department (CID). Singh did not respond to phone calls and messages seeking comment.Cricket bookie Sonu Jalan, businessman Ketan Tanna and Munir Ahmed Pathan met DGP Pandey last month and filed their complaints against Singh.According to their complaints, reviewed by HT, the three say that under the instructions of Singh, who served as Thane CP between 2015 and 18, a former encounter specialist and a serving police inspector from the anti-extortion cell, would call upon businessmen on the pretext of enquiry and extort money by threatening to implicate them in false cases. The complainants have claimed that under Singh’s leadership these police officers allegedly extorted from those who received calls from gangster Ravi Pujari .Jalan, who was arrested by the Thane police in 2018 in a Maharashtra Control of Organised Crimes Act (MCOCA) case, has stated that Singh with the help of these corrupt officers manipulated complaints with the intention of extortion from innocent persons.Singh is already facing an FIR registered by an Akola police inspector BR Ghadge alleging that he was implicated in some cases after refusing to follow Singh’s instructions aimed at benefiting the accused in a criminal case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/another-letter-accuses-param-bir-singh-of-extortion-101620069850709.html
04-05-2021||India||24 dead in Karnataka hospital, kin allege oxygen shortage||The BS Yediyurappa-led Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government in Karnataka came under heavy criticism on Monday after 24 Covid-19 infected persons died in the span of a day allegedly due to shortage of oxygen in Chamarajanagar district, about 175 km from Bengaluru.The state government has been accused of not preparing adequately to deal with the second wave of infections and has now swung into action to contain the damage to its image. “Three people died due to shortage of oxygen between 12 and 3 am (on Monday morning),” said K Sudhakar, state health, family welfare and medical education minister. He did not specify how the others died.He added that there were 123 Covid patients in the district hospital, of which 14 were on ventilators, 36 on non invasive ventilation, 58 on Hyperbaric oxygen and 29 breathing with the help of oxygen cylinders.The government has sought a report on the incident within three days. “Strict action will be taken at the earliest...,” Yediyurappa said in a post on Twitter.Relatives and others were seen crying and cursing the government outside the hospital in Chamarajanagar, levelling allegations of dereliction of duty and that there were not enough doctors to tend to the critically ill. Several of them also alleged that the district was facing oxygen shortage.The incident has sparked off a blame game between the district administrations of Mysuru and Chamrajanagar, two neighbouring districts over delays in supply of oxygen. A section of the Chamarajanagar administration is alleging that Mysuru DC Rohini Sindhuri delayed the dispatch of oxygen as she retained most of it for use in her own district, which is one of the worst Covid-19 hit regions outside Bengaluru. Sindhuri could not be reached for comment.“Died or Killed? My heartfelt condolences to their families. How much more suffering before the ‘system’ wakes up?” Rahul Gandhi of the Congress posted on Twitter.The district in-charge minister of Chamrajanagar, Suresh Kumar, hinted that there was a shortage of oxygen in the district and that requests were made to fulfil them. ST Somashekar, the district in-charge minister of Mysuru said that the oxygen, which comes from Ballari was dispatched to Chamarajnagar on time.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/24-dead-in-k-taka-hospital-kin-allege-oxygen-shortage-101620069790783.html
04-05-2021||India||Scramble across states: SOS for oxygen rings out||New Delhi: Several state governments continued to send emergency messages to the Union government for medical oxygen as hospitals across states -- from Ranchi in Jharkhand to Alwar in Rajasthan to Rohtak in Haryana to Meerut in Uttar Pradesh -- reported shortages that were putting critical Covid-19 patients at risk, state and district officials said.The Union health ministry has increased allocation of several states in the past one week since the oxygen demand has spiked due to a rise in infections and hospitalisations, but some states said the enhanced supply was also not enough. They also reported the shortage of tankers and cylinders to store and transport the medical essential.In Meerut, Uttar Pradesh, angry family members of some patients went on rampage, damaging furniture and health monitors in Nutema hospital on Sunday after five Covid-infected patients died allegedly due to low oxygen pressure. “We have formed a committee to investigate the matter and action would be initiated on the findings of the committee,” said district magistrate K Balaji, adding that the administration was providing oxygen cylinders to hospitals.Dr Manisha Tyagi, secretary of the Meerut unit of the Indian Medical Association (IMA), said this was the third hospital in the past one week where family members got agitated after patients were denied admission due to heavy load in hospital, or death of patients due to alleged lack of oxygen. Last Friday, in Agra, family member of patients beat up hospital staff after oxygen supply got disrupted. Oxygen supply shortages were also reported from several other UP districts, such as Noida, Lucknow, Bareilly, Agra and Varanasi, officials said.In Haryana, there were reports of oxygen shortage from some hospitals in Gurugram, Rohtak, and Karna, but the districts did not officially report any shortage. The state quota for Haryana has been increased from 162 million tonnes (MT) per day to 257 MT, but the state government is demanding 300 MT every day. Chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar, however, said all districts were being provided oxygen as per their requirement. According to locals, patients in Rohtak were struggling to find oxygen and ICU beds at the Postgraduate Institute of Medical Sciences (PGIMS), and in private hospitals in Jhajjar, Sonepat, Hisar , Rewari, and other parts of the state. Neeraj Kumar, a resident of Kathura village in Sonepat, said he tried for three days to get an oxygen-supported bed for his father, a retired army personnel. “Despite all efforts, we did not get a bed in Rohtak, Jhajjar, and Sonepat. Finally, my father’s friends helped in getting a bed at army hospital, Ambala, where he is undergoing treatment,” he said. A functionary at PGIMS, who asked not to be named, said all the oxygen and ICU beds were occupied and were unable to admit new patients. In Bihar, the state government on Monday approved the Oxygen Production Policy 2021, which provides for financial assistance to establish oxygen manufacturing units as several hospitals reported shortage of the crucial gas. Bihar has been allotted 194 MT of medical oxygen every day, which was increased to 214 MT on May 2. Out of this, 34 MT is to be created from the Air Separation Units (ASU) in the state, and the rest from industrial units in neighbouring Jharkhand and West Bengal.At least seven district in Jharkhand informed the state government about an oxygen shortage. In Ranchi, some private hospitals stopped taking patients, according to district officials, and oxygen was also in short supply in Jamshedpur, where several hospitals stopped taking in new patients despite having vacant Covid beds.In Rajasthan, among the hospitals that reported shortage of oxygen were Sania hospital, the biggest private medical facility in Alwar. On Monday, the hospital put up a notice asking patients or their families to arrange for oxygen on their own since they did not receive their allocated supply. Behror resident Ved Prakash Gupta, whose brother Hitesh Gupta is admitted to the hospital, said the administration told them that there was no medical oxygen left, and they should take patients to other hospitals. Sania Hospital’s CEO, Dr. Tayyab Khan, said the hospital received 10 oxygen cylinders from the district administration on Monday, as against requirement of 150 every day. Behror MLA, Sanjay Sharma of the BJP, said they were trying to get oxygen for the hospital. Officials in Madhya Pradesh said the state requires about 700 MT oxygen but was getting about 564 MT. As a result, they added, they were unable to increase the number of oxygen beds in high Covid-influx cities such as Bhopal, Gwalior, Indore, Ujjain and Jabalpur. State health commissioner Akash Tripathi asked private hospitals to do a daily audit of oxygen consumption and inform the district administration about the shortage of oxygen at least six hours in advance so that necessary arrangements could be made. There were also reports of no or low oxygen from hospitals in Punjab, Jammu & Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand. Punjab chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh on Monday said more oxygen tankers would be available to the state by Tuesday to handle transporting of oxygen supplies from other states. Punjab has a 195 MT allocation from various plants in other states, but actual supply over the past seven days has been around 110-120 MT, which has also been erratic, the CM said during Covid review meeting.J&K LG Manoj Sinha on Sunday directed officials to do an oxygen audit in every hospital of the UT. The Himachal Pradesh government, meanwhile, has ordered installation plants in main hospitals of the state even though the state has been getting 62 MT of oxygen as against the demand of 22 MT, said HP health secretary Amitabh Awasthi, adding state was facing shortage of cylinders. Uttarakhand health secretary Amit Negi said six oxygen plants were operating in the state, and nine more will be set up soon.“7,200 mt was our last month production. We ramped up 25%_ upti 9,000MT. But demand is more, allocationis more than that. Demand is more than capacity. We meet it by dipping into our stocks. Cant ramp up too much more than that. Small plants in hospitals dont really help that much. A third option was to rationalise use of oxygen. We are having non stop meetings on allocation and will probably manage to take from stocks in our plants in eastern India. Earlier, Air liquide was giving 315 mt from its stocks. But with depleting stocks, can give 280mt tonnes only now. So 35 MT of supply has got depleted again and will impact some allocation’’ said a member of the empowered group.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/scramble-across-states-sos-for-oxygen-rings-out-101620069070635.html
04-05-2021||India||‘Logistics, not deficit’: What govt told courts on O2 crisis||Does India have enough oxygen? Does Delhi? Plaintive cries from hospital administrators and individuals, as well as reports of deaths of critically ill patients on account of lack of oxygen (most recently in Chamrajnagar, Karnataka) suggest the answer to the questions is “No”. Yet, the Union government has consistently maintained before constitutional courts that the country and Delhi both have enough oxygen and there is no deficit at all.There are three aspects to the question, though: production and stock; demand and supply; and logistics. HT tries to look at each on the basis of information from the Centre’s affidavits before the Supreme Court and the Delhi high court in public interest litigations .First , production and stock.The production capacity for liquid oxygen was 8,788 MT per day, the Centre said on April 28.In addition, as on that day, there was 19,871 metric ton (MT) of liquid medical oxygen available. That excluded the liquid oxygen with steel plants (major producers of the chemical), a further 16,000 MT of liquid oxygen as on 21 April . And finally, there is another 2850 MT of liquid oxygen with manufacturers not attached to the steel plants, taking the gross quantity of liquid oxygen available to in excess of 38,000 MT.Second, demand and supply.According to the Centre, from April 29, the projected demand for all states was 8707 MT per day. On April 28, while the production capacity was 8,788 MT per day, 7,479 MT of oxygen was supplied to various states. This is a contentious point, though. The Delhi government has insisted that it does not get as much oxygen as it needs. Delhi’s own estimate is that it needs 700 MT a day. The Centre’s allocation to it is 490 MT a day (increased to 700 MT a day from Tuesday, according to a Supreme Court order on Sunday). But the Delhi government has said it receives lesser oxygen -- it received 409 MT on Thursday, 312 MT on Friday, 454 MT on Saturday, and 448 MT on Sunday. Delhi also claimed last week in the high court that while other states were getting almost as much as they asked for, or even more in some cases, Delhi was the only one to get much lesser.That explains the cries for help, but there’s the third aspect as well.LogisticsThe major suppliers for both industrial and medical oxygen are steel plants in the public and private sectors, besides private entities. However, there are only a few states that are oxygen producing, such as Maharashtra, Rajasthan and Jharkhand; others need to ship their oxygen in.The Union government’s position before the courts is that its role was limited to procurement and allocation of medical oxygen to each state but that it is the state governments’ absolute responsibility to arrange transportation to pick up their allotted quantity from the supply point using cryogenic tankers.The ministry of home affairs constituted an Empowered Group-II (EG-II) as an inter-ministerial body to ensure availability of essential medical equipment and oxygen management, which has carried out a mapping exercise to connect sources of supplies with the demand of medical oxygen to the critically affected states.The requirement of oxygen for each state is ascertained on the basis of the doubling rate of active cases, which refers to the number of days in which Covid cases are likely to double.These projections change on a daily basis, explained the Centre through its affidavits. It added that a virtual central control room has also been created to monitor demand and supply of oxygen on a real time basis.According to the Centre, Delhi, Rajasthan, Punjab, Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand and Madhya Pradesh, faced challenges despite this allocation owing to logistical bottlenecks and incidents of local authorities disrupting supplies (or oxygen producing states not allowing supplies). But the biggest impediment, as per the Centre, remains the geographical location of the supply points. The high concentration of oxygen is in steel plants located on the eastern side of the country (Odisha, West Bengal) whereas the demand is mostly from the West (Maharashtra, Gujarat, Rajasthan), North (UP, Delhi, Haryana, Punjab) and central part of India (MP, Chhatisgarh). This has resulted in heavy pressure on the handful facilities in the North such as those in Panipat, Modinagar and Bhiwadi.Following the mapping exercise, the Centre said, a judicious mix of road, rail and air routes have been arranged. A supply point in Jharkhand’s Jamshedpur has been mapped to Delhi, UP, Haryana and Bihar while Bhilai in Chhatisgarh has been mapped to MP.Trains (Oxygen Express) are also being used to carry oxygen. Air routes are being used to carry empty containers to the supply points, as per the government’s affidavits. Liquid oxygen containers cannot be transported by air. However, in order to carry oxygen, the states must have the tankers of their own and only industrialised states such as Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat, Haryana, Jharkhand and West Bengal have them in sufficient quantity. Delhi has only 19 oxygen tankers, leading to a crisis as regards carrying the oxygen from the points of procurement.On April 30, the Central government submitted in the Supreme Court that the chief reason for shortage of oxygen in the capital was the inability of the Delhi government to lift the allocated quantity of oxygen from the supply point for want of enough tankers.But the top court did not find favour with this contention and told the Centre that lives of citizens cannot be put in jeopardy in the battle of shifting responsibility of supplying or off-taking of oxygen.The Centre has to submit its compliance by May 10 when the Supreme Court will hear the suo motu (on its own motion) case again.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/logistics-not-deficit-what-govt-told-courts-on-o2-crisis-101620068716286.html
04-05-2021||India||‘HCs must have freedom, can’t restrain media’, Supreme Court says to EC||The Supreme Court on Monday said it was not in favour of putting fetters on judges’ remarks or their reportage by the media, saying that high courts must get “complete freedom” to decide issues before them, and that the “media is a very important and powerful watchdog of the judicial processes”.A bench of justices Dhananjaya Y Chandrachud and MR Shah termed as “far-fetched” a plea by the Election Commission of India (ECI) before the Madras high court to restrain media from reporting oral observations of the judges that the poll body was singularly responsible for a second wave in the country and that its officials should probably be tried on murder charges for allowing political parties to hold massive rallies without following Covid-19 norms.“In today’s time, we cannot say that media won’t report contents of discussion in a court and only orders. Since the discussion is of equal public importance, we will put it on the same pedestal like our orders. There is a dialogue between the court and the lawyers and when they are reported, people get to know about the judicial process. The unfolding of the debate in the court of law is equally important and media has a duty to report. It is not only our judgements that are significant but the dialogue also is,” justice Chandrachud told senior advocate Rakesh Dwivedi, who appeared for the ECI.On April 26, the high court made the scathing remarks against ECI during a hearing a writ petition filed by Tamil Nadu transport minister MR Vijayabhaskar seeking a direction for safety measures and fairness during counting in Karur constituency from where he is contesting. “You are the only institution that is singularly responsible for the situation today...No action against political parties taking rallies despite court orders. Your election commission officials should be put up on murder charges probably,” the high court had observed.Asking for a gag on the media was not part of EC’s prayer before the Supreme Court. In the appeal before the top court, Dwivedi rued that the high court judges should use “temperate language” and not blame the ECI for something which was not within their domain.“We do not take over the governance during the election. We issue directions and guidelines that the states are bound to follow. But if those responsible for adhering to the Covid guidelines are the ones to breach it, we cannot be held responsible. Now there is a non-stop coverage of how EC officials should be charged of murder. We are not seeking any order against media but we want the judges to exercise restraint,” said the counsel.The bench responded that the EC’s concerns regarding the observations were taken into account and that a balance had to be struck. The bench said that it may not have used the words used by the Madras high court. It, however, pointed put that the plea before the high court to restrain the media was problematic.“What is happening in the court is also of concerns to the citizens. What is happening; whether there is an application of mind; the dialogue between the bar and the bench; how it fosters justice; these are all of concern for the citizens. Their reportage instills a sense of confidence among the public about what has transpired in the court and how the decision was made. It was too far-fetched on your part to ask a constitutional court to restrain media,” remarked the bench.Asking ECI to take the observations by the high court in the right spirit, justice Shah told Dwivedi: “Judges use harsh words sometime because of anguish; sometime out of frustration and sometime because of anger after seeing what has been happening around them. They are also human beings. It is also in the larger public interest what they said. And you can see the result. Your subsequent decisions improved the situation. You restricted election rally with more than 500 persons that you had not done earlier. Victory processions were prohibited too.”Dwivedi, however, maintained that it was not appropriate for the high court judges to say that a high constitutional body like the ECI should be charged with murder and that they had serious objections to it.The bench told ECI that the high courts were also a constitutional body and that the Supreme Court will not demoralise the high court judges by issuing any kind of restraint on their process of judicial determination.“We don’t want to demoralise the high courts. They are vital part of this institutions. They are the ultimate protector of fundamental rights because of their access to public. We have to protect the sanctity of high courts. Our chief justices and judges should feel free to have to a dialogue. We cannot restrain them. We also wish that media should report fully what is happening in a court. It brings a sense of accountability. Media reporting would also show that we are dispensing our duties fully,” said the bench.The court also took a grim view of the ECI’s petition before it against the high court’s observations, for it premised on the fact that the high court overlooked the constitutional stature of the poll body.“You say in your petition that you are a constitutional body and so, a court should not have said something. Parliament is a sovereign authority. But don’t we deal with the laws passed by them? By exercising our power to examine validity of a law, we don’t take upon the powers of the parliament. It won’t be a correct reading of the Constitution to say that because EC is a constitutional body, its power should not be questioned. You have taken an extreme position in saying that,” said justice Chandrachud.“Speaking for myself, I would not have used these words in the course of a discussion. But the issues raised in your special leave petition is much wider. We will have to pass a detailed order on the issues raised by you regarding your constitutional status. We will bring about a sense of balance in our order. You also tell your election commissioners that the intention of the high court was not to run anybody down. It was not to tarnish anybody’s image but to find out a way so that they can help public. Institutions have to be strong and vibrant for our democracy to survive,” the bench told Dwivedi.It reserved its order on the appeal by ECI, indicating that a judgment will be delivered later this week.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hcs-must-have-freedom-can-t-restrain-media-supreme-court-says-to-ec-101620066894965.html
04-05-2021||India||Govt says Covid-19 cases plateauing in some states; experts disagree||A senior health ministry official pointed to recent Covid-19 case data from across India to suggest that there are early signs of improvement in the number of daily cases, and a plateauing of cases in some parts of the country, but experts said it was far too premature to arrive at any such conclusions.“There is a relative signal of movement towards positive direction if trajectory of daily cases and deaths is analysed. On May 1 roughly about 400,000 new Covid-19 cases were reported from across the country, on May 2 it came down to 392,000 cases, and in past 24 hours (Sunday), we find 367,000 cases that shows there’s reduction in daily new cases to some extent cases,” said Lav Agarwal, joint secretary, Union health ministry, in the regular media briefing on Covid-19.To be sure, these numbers hide a significant dip in the number of tests conducted across the three days (around 400,000), and a corresponding increase in the positivity rate, suggesting there will likely be no let up in daily cases, at least not immediately.“We have found early signs of plateauing upon analyzing the Covid-19 data; in a state or two we can also say we have seen decrease in daily new cases. Among those states you find in Chhattisgarh that used to report 15,500 daily new cases, is now reporting around 14,900... Delhi, which used to get about 25,200 cases, now is getting 24,000 cases, hinting at early plateauing signs,” added Agarwal.He said this is also becoming evident in numbers from Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Jharkhand, Punjab, Telangana, Uttar Pradesh, and Uttarakhand.“But these are very early signals. There is a need for further analysis ; and related efforts to monitor it on a continued basis. Similarly, if we look at reported deaths 48 hours ago then we find 3,689 deaths, and in the past 24 hours, data shows 3,417 deaths have been reported.Experts say it is too early to even think of this as a trend.“You cannot establish a trend by looking at 48-72 hours data. This could be an aberration, and needs to sustain for a few weeks before something can be declared concretely,” said a senior public health expert, requesting anonymity.However, there also are states that are showing an upward trajectory of cases, according to Agarwal — Andhra Pradesh, Assam, Bihar, Chandigarh, Haryana, Karnataka, Kerala, and Himachal Pradesh etc.India’s active case load has also gone up, and is currently around 3.4 million, with 12 states reporting at least 100,000 active cases. Seven states have active cases between 50,000 and 100,000, and 17 have less than 50,000 active cases.A high positivity rate is a concern in many states, Agarwal said, with 22 states showing a positivity rate in excess of 15% . In nine states, the positivity rate is between 5% and 15%, and only five states currently report a positivity rate of 5% or lower. These numbers also clearly indicate that cases in the country will continue to rise for some time.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-says-covid-cases-plateauing-in-some-states-experts-disagree-101620066910097.html
04-05-2021||India||Reports claiming fresh vaccine orders not placed are incorrect, says Centre||The Centre on Monday denied allegations that the government has not placed any fresh orders for the Covid-19 vaccines for its nationwide immunisation programme, and pointed out that the suppliers credit extended to both the Serum Institute of India (SII) and Bharat Biotech in late April was against future supplies.“There have been some media reports alleging that the Centre has not placed any fresh order for Covid-19 vaccines. The news reports suggest that the last order placed with the two vaccine makers (100 million doses with SII and 20 million doses with Bharat Biotech) was in March 2021. These media reports are completely incorrect, and are not based on facts,” the Union health ministry said in a statement.It clarified that 100% advance of Rs.1,732.50 crore (after TDS Rs.1,699.50 crore) was released to Serum Institute of India (SII) on April 28, for 110 million doses of Covishield vaccine to be delivered in May, June and July. In addition, as on date, against the last (March) order of 100 million doses for supplies of Covishield, 87.5 million doses have been delivered till May 3, 2021.The ministry also said that 100% advance of Rs.787.50 crore (after TDS ₹772.50 crore) was released on April 28, to Bharat Biotech India Ltd (BBIL) for 50 million Covaxin doses to be delivered in May, June and July. As on date, against the last (March) order of 20 million doses for supplies of Covaxin vaccine, 8.8 million doses have been delivered till May 3, 2021.SII put out a tweet endorsing the health ministry’s statement. “...We have been working closely with the Government of India for the past year & thank it for its support. We remain committed to ramping up our vaccine production to save every life we can,” it read.“Vaccine manufacturing is a specialized process, it is therefore not possible to ramp up production overnight, SII CEO Adar Poonawalla said in a statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/reports-claiming-fresh-vaccine-orders-not-placed-are-incorrect-says-centre-101620040145582.html

This effort, in combination with Pfizer foundation funding that supports humanitarian organisations providing essential and life-saving equipment to India, such as ventilators, oxygen concentrators, and consumables, is our most comprehensive humanitarian relief response ever,” said Albert Bourla chairman and chief executive officer, Pfizer, in a statement.“Pfizer is aware that access to vaccines is critical to ending this pandemic. Unfortunately, our vaccine is not registered in India although our application was submitted months ago. We are currently discussing with the Indian government an expedited approval pathway to make our Pfizer-BioNTECH vaccine available for use in the country,” Bourla added.He said the effort -- he called it at attempt to mobilise the largest humanitarian relief effort in Pfizer’s history -- was being made because they were deeply concerned by the critical Covid situation in India. “…Pfizer colleagues at distribution centres in the US, Europe, and Asia are hard at work rushing shipments of Pfizer medicines that the government of India has identified as part of its Covid treatment protocol. We are donating these medicines to help make sure that every Covid patient in every public hospital... can have access to the Pfizer medicines they need free of charge...”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pfizer-donates-70-mn-medical-supplies-to-india-seeks-expedited-vaccine-approval-101620037681235.html
04-05-2021||Today's||Covid-19: When the courts step in||India is in the midst of an unprecedented medical crisis. Four weeks into the second wave of Covid-19, and a year after the pandemic first struck, it is clear that the State had no plan for an emergency of this nature.It is in this context that the Delhi High Court (HC) has been moved under Article 226 (extraordinary jurisdiction to protect personal liberty) of the Constitution seeking judicial interference by private entities and individual citizens. The petitions pertain to the production and allocation of medical oxygen and the urgent requirement of basic medical infrastructure such as beds and drugs.Subsequently, the Supreme Court (SC), under Article 32 (extraordinary jurisdiction to protect personal liberty), has taken suo motu cognisance of the pandemic.Two issues demand attention. First, is the suo motu petition being heard by SC an act of interference in the executive policy domain, specifically on the issue of vaccination? During the 2G spectrum litigation, SC held that the allocation of natural resources ought to be done through public auction. Subsequently, a Constitution Bench overruled this finding and held that the allocation of natural resources is a matter of economic policy, within the domain of the executive. It is, therefore, clear that the court cannot enforce a policy decision on the executive. But while acknowledging this principle, let us look at the current vaccine situation and SC’s order.There is, without a doubt, a major vaccine crisis. The Centre failed to anticipate the urgent requirement for vaccination. It engaged with only two companies, Serum Institute of India (SII) and Bharat Biotech. These companies today do not have the capacity to vaccinate India in a quick time. SII now is on record saying it did not know that the Centre expected a billion doses in a short period of time. The Centre failed to facilitate adequate manufacturing through existing entities, and did not make purchase orders in time to import a sufficient number of vaccine doses.To add to this, there is differential pricing for vaccines for states and the Centre. Several experts have argued that the Centre is best placed to procure vaccines. Some suggest that the money can be raised through a one-time cess while others, including Opposition parties, want the ₹35,000 crore vaccination budget used to inoculate the public for free. The apex court categorically asked the Centre for its policy for mass inoculation and medication, and framed some important questions/remarks. First, what is the premise on which the State has concluded that decentralised procurement of a scarce commodity in the current health crisis is the best policy towards rapid mass inoculation? Second, as the right to life (Article 21) is a fundamental guarantee under the Constitution and the current vaccine policy has a direct effect on this guarantee to life, has the Centre finalised its policy keeping in view the commitment to protecting public health?Third, has the socio-economic disparity between citizens been considered when shifting the burden of cost onto them? And fourth, why is the Centre, in this national emergency, not exercising powers under Section 92 and 100 of the Patents Act 1970, which would help various manufacturing companies augment the production of vaccines and drugs? The suo motu hearing isn’t adversarial or seeking adjudication between two contesting parties. What the court is doing is exercising its constitutional authority under Article 32 to fulfill its constitutional role of maintaining checks and balances within the framework of judicial review. This is significant since the executive’s decisions affecting the lives of a billion people have been opaque. SC is not seeking to take policy decisions, but is seeking public accountability and transparency on the executive’s policy decisions and its failure to act in time. This exercise of judicial review to maintain accountability is the institutional duty of a constitutional court and an essential facet of constitutional democracy. Second, should the Delhi HC have exercised judicial review and taken cognisance of petitions on questions of allocation and distribution of oxygen? When communications with the executive failed, private hospitals in the Capital approached HC seeking judicial interference in maintaining oxygen capacity.HC was bound by its duty to protect the right to life under Article 21. As the hearings continued, one saw HC being forced to facilitate the supply and allocation of oxygen between the Centre and the Delhi government. For almost a fortnight now, the court has been monitoring the oxygen situation on the ground. This is not because the court is eager to exercise its extraordinary constitutional responsibility for protecting the lives of people. It is because the federal cooperation expected between the Union and states has broken.The basic structure of the Constitution holds federalism as essential to upholding our constitutional democracy. Therefore, HC is not only ensuring administrative compliance, but also enforcing federal cohesion to ensure executive stability. Today, private entities and citizens are left with no option but to seek legal recourse for essential amenities in a pandemic.Let us not confuse this situation with busy body litigation or an act of judicial overreach. Those who have petitioned the court have locus standi to seek judicial remedy. They seek nothing less than the protection of human life. The judiciary, today, is being forced by citizens to step into a vacuum created by the executive, and thereby, fulfill its constitutional duty to do justice. And, this, by its very nature, unfortunately warrants judicial governance.Abhik Chimni is a Delhi-based advocate The views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/covid19-when-the-courts-step-in-101620131726967.html
04-05-2021||Today's||Voluntary licensing of Covaxin will boost vaccine production||The second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic continues unabated in India, with people scrambling for vaccines, medicines, and oxygen. The Supreme Court, hearing a suo motu case on the pandemic, asked the Centre why it wasn’t issuing compulsory licences (CLs) under the Indian Patent Act to boost the production of Covid-19 vaccines and related drugs. CL refers to granting a licence by the government to a third party to use the patent, without the consent of the patent holder, after paying a government-determined royalty to the patent owner. It is an important flexibility in patent law to address public health needs. As the pandemic set in last year, countries such as Canada and Chile introduced measures to accelerate the process of issuing CLs. However, the Indian government, inexplicably, has remained tight-lipped about making use of CLs in the pandemic.Notwithstanding the usefulness of CLs to produce medicines through reverse engineering and other products important for tackling Covid-19, it will not be prudent to put all eggs in CL basket. CLs may not be useful in the case of technologically advanced Covid-19 products such as vaccines. While a CL will enable overcoming the restrictions imposed by patent law, it will not solve the problem of lack of access to the know-how related to the manufacturing of vaccines. Issuing a CL does not impose a legal requirement on the vaccine inventors to transfer or share the know-how with anyone.Thus, especially for vaccines, India needs to explore other options such as voluntary licensing (VL) — the patent holder authorising a third party to manufacture and sell the patented product on mutually beneficial terms. The most obvious vaccine candidate for VL is Covaxin — India’s indigenously developed vaccine. Bharat Biotech and the Indian Council of Medical Research have jointly developed Covaxin. Given the involvement of public money, the intellectual property rights over Covaxin ought to be with the government. The government needs to urgently license the production of Covaxin to as many pharmaceutical companies as possible, not just in India but also abroad, by actively sharing the know-how. This will augment the production and supply of vaccines.Additionally, on the global stage, this will demonstrate India’s strong political will to increase the accessibility of Covid-19 vaccines. India has been proactive at the World Trade Organization (WTO) pushing for a temporary waiver of the Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) agreement for Covid-19 vaccines, therapeutics, and related technologies. The central idea behind the temporary TRIPS waiver is to ensure that intellectual property does not become a barrier to expeditious access to Covid-19 vaccines, drugs, and other therapeutics. Recently, India has taken some steps in this direction by giving permission to Haffkine Institute, a public sector company, and nudging Bharat Biotech to negotiate with Panacea Biotech, a private firm, to manufacture Covaxin. However, this is too little too late. India should have started the process of licensing and sharing the know-how of Covaxin months ago. Private manufacturers wouldn’t have come forward to ramp up facilities and manufacture Covaxin till its phase-three trial data established the vaccine’s efficacy. The government, like several developed countries, should have underwritten the risks faced by these companies by promising to buy the doses produced. This would have been a calculated gamble given the certainty of the second wave, even if its ferocity was unknown. Covaxin’s supply would have increased manifold. India should also persuade firms such as AstraZeneca, Pfizer and others to issue licences and transfer technology to more Indian pharmaceutical firms. If need be, the government should offer financial incentives to these firms enabling speedier production.India is known globally for the vigour of its pharmaceutical sector built over several decades. It would be extremely tragic if the government fails to channelise this prowess to save precious Indian lives.Prabhash Ranjan is a senior assistant professor at South Asian University’s faculty of legal studies The views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/voluntary-licensing-of-covaxin-will-boost-vaccine-production-101620130941033.html
04-05-2021||Editorials||2021-22 needs a new economic blueprint||It is now clear that the second Covid-19 wave will continue to inflict great destruction across India in the coming weeks, as it has done in the past month. It is also clear that unless this second wave can be tamed and infections brought under control, economic activity in the country will continue to shrink. There are localised restrictions in various states and cities in order to curb the spread of the disease. But alongside, there is a deep sense of fear among citizens — who, remember, are also the primary economic agents as producers and consumers. Till the health crisis is addressed, the fear won’t diminish, and till fear doesn’t diminish, the possibility of the resumption of any kind of normal economic life is dim.And that is what makes it incumbent on the State to step in with a new economic plan. Given how badly the first quarter has been hit, optimistic projections of economic recovery this year will not hold. Within a month of fiscal year 2021-22, it is also clear the Union budget numbers will not hold, tax revenues will dip, expenditure requirements will increase, pushing through contentious structural reforms will become more difficult (and may not even be advisable), and the State’s responsibility for welfare of the vulnerable will only increase. The central government must draw up a new economic blueprint for the year — this can retain a degree of flexibility given the fluidity of the situation, but it needs to be based on realistic goals, timelines and numbers. This will also allow the Union government to assess the urgent needs of the time — particularly income support to the poor, concessions to the middle class, and perhaps policy tweaks to help the private sector, especially micro, small and medium enterprises, survive and stay the course — and find the required resources for it.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/202122-needs-a-new-economic-blueprint-101620132441420.html
04-05-2021||Editorials||End the violence in Bengal, now||Ever since the Trinamool Congress (TMC) swept to victory in the West Bengal assembly elections, the state has witnessed unacceptable political violence, directed largely at workers of other parties in the state. In a rare instance of convergence, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), the Left and the Congress have all alleged that it is TMC workers who have vandalised their party offices and attacked party workers, with the BJP claiming that six of its workers have been killed. The TMC has rejected the allegations, but in light of the evidence available and the fact that it remains in power in the state (Mamata Banerjee will take over, for a third time, officially on Wednesday), the denial does not appear credible.Bengal has a history of political violence, going back to the Naxal movement in the 1960s and 1970s to the coercive party machinery of the Left during its 34-year old rule. This machinery was imported, almost whole-scale, by the TMC — and the party unleashed a high degree of violence, both explicit and implicit, once it came to power in 2011. The aim was to weaken rivals and send a message to supporters of other political formations that there would be a cost to challenging Ms Banerjee. This violence was most visible in the 2018 panchayat elections, and was among the reasons for the growth of the BJP in the state.The TMC won a legitimate mandate in the 2021 assembly polls — but clearly, its political victory has not altered the political culture of the party and the state. The triumph appears to have emboldened TMC workers to go after those who dared to challenge the party’s local hegemony. But the violence is not just an effort to seek revenge or teach the Opposition a lesson, but also an attempt to consolidate power on the ground to stifle all dissent and stamp on the right of citizens to exercise free political choice. The top leadership of the party is either complicit in this violence or is unwilling to stop it — but in any case, the buck stops with Ms Banerjee. Unless she cracks down on the violence immediately, West Bengal’s chief minister, irrespective of her election success, will lose her moral and democratic standing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/end-the-violence-in-bengal-now-101620132139095.html
