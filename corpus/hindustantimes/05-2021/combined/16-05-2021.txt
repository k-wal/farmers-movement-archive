Black fungus or mucormycosis is an uncommon opportunistic invasive fungal infection which occurs in immunosupressed patients. Covid-19 patients undergoing treatment with steroids are at heightened risk of mucormycosis. Dr Mishra said, “The eyes and brain of the man were infected with black fungus, and he was put on ventilator support soon after reaching here. Unfortunately, he died during treatment.” The city has at least 20 black fungus patients under treatment at different medical facilities, including King George’s Medical University where 13 patients are under treatment. Lohia institute also has three black fungus patients. Earlier, death of a suspected black fungus patient, a woman, had been reported in Lucknow. “We have four other black fungus cases of which two are being treated in OPD and two are admitted. Of the latter two, one has been operated to remove dead tissues,” said Dr Mishra. Experts said Covid patients with history of diabetes were particularly at risk. “Black fungus is a risk for those Covid patients who have a history of diabetes and are spending long time in hospital for recovery. Any other comorbidity is also a risk factor,” said Dr Suryakant, HoD, respiratory medicine, at the King George’s Medical University. Chief medical officer of Lucknow Dr Sanjay Bhatnagar did not respond despite repeated calls.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/52yrold-dies-of-black-fungus-infection-in-pvt-hospital-101621189267625.html

16-05-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra records 11,699 deaths, fatality rate of 1.58% in 15 days||Even though the daily Covid-19 cases have witnessed a steady drop over the past week, the state has logged 11,699 deaths in the first fortnight of May, recording a 1.58% case fatality rate (CFR) during the period.The state recorded 34,389 new Covid-19 cases and 974 deaths, second-highest single-day record, on Sunday. The case tally is now 5,378,452, while the death toll stands at 81,486.Against a total of 7,38,618 people infected between May 1 and 15 and 11,699 deaths reported during the period the CFR stands at 1.58 %. An average of 799 deaths took place daily, while 32 deaths were reported per hour during this period.The CFR in the first 15 days of April stood at 0.51%, as 4,225 deaths were reported against 826,799 infections reported in two weeks. The first fortnight of the last month saw average daily death of 281. The CFR is the number of deaths recorded during the period in proportion to the total cases in that period.According to Dr Tatyarao Lahane, director, Directorate of Medical Education and Research (DMER), the CFR will reduce in the next few days as the fatality curve always lags by three-four weeks behind the infection cases curve. “Most of these deaths are of patients who were admitted before two to three weeks. We will see the decrease of deaths in the coming days,” said Dr Lahane.Dr Ishwar Gilada, secretary-general, Organised Medicine Academic Guild, attributes the high CFR to the surge in rural pockets. “There are at least 12 districts in Maharashtra like Ahmednagar, Satara, Sangli and Beed where both new cases, as well as deaths, are increasing by the day. They tend to increase the CFR of the state. These districts suffer from two factors, a casual approach towards the virus and lack of medical facilities. Many people in rural parts do not wear masks, nor they practice social distancing. In addition, fewer tests are being conducted in these districts. The longer turnaround time for results of the tests lead to more infections and subsequently the high death rate,” said Gilada.Mumbai continued to log fewer cases by reporting 1,535 cases and 60 deaths. Pune city has recorded 1,359 new cases, while Nashik city saw 1,022 new cases. Aurangabad and Kolhapur city recorded 214 and 217 cases respectively.The total number of active patients in Maharashtra currently stands at 468,109. Pune tops with 82,397 active patients followed by Mumbai with 33,574 and Thane with 30,492 active patients. The total number of tests conducted in the last 24 hours were 264,587 with a positivity rate of 12.99%.In Solapur, there was a large procession at the funeral of a social worker throwing all social distancing norms at the wind.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-records-11-699-deaths-fatality-rate-of-1-58-in-15-days-101621189027471.html

After stalling the drive for two days, Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) is expected to resume it from Tuesday. Presently, Mumbai has only 50,000 vaccine doses in stock and is expecting more doses this week, according to civic authorities. The state government is expecting new stock of vaccines on Monday or Tuesday. The short supply of the shots has witnessed a drastic drop in the vaccination rate in the state. Maharashtra could vaccinate less than 200,000 people daily last week, and BMC has been vaccinating around 25,000 per day. On Saturday, Maharashtra vaccinated a total of 192,742 beneficiaries. In Mumbai, the drive has been suspended on Monday, for a day, given the warning issued by the Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) of heavy rainfall and gusty winds due to cyclone Tauktae, municipal commissioner Iqbal Singh Chahal said on Sunday. In a statement, Chahal said, “In view of the warning of high-intensity cyclone issued by IMD, the vaccination program in Mumbai for Monday (17th May) is cancelled.” The vaccination drive will resume in Mumbai on Tuesday. There are presently 260 vaccination centres across the city, of which 166 are operated by BMC, 74 are private and 20 are operated by the state or Central government. Chahal on Sunday also announced that walk-in vaccination will be allowed for beneficiaries above age 60 years who are getting their first dose but only for the Covishield vaccines. According to BMC, there are about 300,000 beneficiaries 60 years of age remaining to be given their first dose. BMC plans to complete this within a week. On Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday (May 18 to 20) beneficiaries in the 60 years and above age group taking their first dose of Covishield, those who are due for a second dose of Covaxin, and differently-abled beneficiaries will qualify for walk-in vaccinations. On these three days, only health and frontline workers can get their second dose of Covishield as many have completed 12 weeks since their first dose. On Thursday, Friday and Saturday vaccination will be allowed via online appointment through the Co-WIN app.According to the BMC data, so far 2,841,349 beneficiaries have been vaccinated in Mumbai, of which 2,121,573 have received their first dose and 719,776 administered second dose.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/vax-drive-to-resume-in-mumbai-from-tuesday-more-stock-expected-this-week-101621188968129.html

Rai, who runs a business in Kutch area of Gujarat, was in his village when he came to know that villagers were dumping bodies of suspected Covid -19 patients in the Ganga as they were unable to perform the last rites due to poverty. The issue was highlighted by the media. Photographs of bodies floating in the river were carried in both print and electronic media and environmentalists expressed concern over increase in Ganga pollution. “People from various parts of the country called me to know the facts. The dumping of bodies as well as floating corpses in the river seemed disgraceful,” Rai said. “I discussed with my associates and family members how to assist the poor people in cremating the bodies. We decided to launch a firewood bank on the nine ghats located near the river. We informed the district administration about the plan and after getting the nod we transported firewood from various parts of the districts, procured from the timber merchants. On May 14 the firewood bank was launched near the nine cremation grounds,” he said. The poor people visiting the ghats for cremation got wood free from the bank and volunteers were working round the clock, distributing the firewood and maintaining the stock at all the ghats. “Along with assisting the needy, we are also working to protect the Ganga from pollution, Rai said. An official said the district administration had launched an awareness campaign in the villages located near the Ganga, urging the people to not dump the bodies in the river. The flood company of Provincial Armed Constabulary (PAC) was regularly patrolling the river to check dumping of bodies. The administration had told the newly elected gram pradhans that if the villager has no money to perform the last rites of dead family member, the administration would assist them. The initiative of Sanjay Rai had helped the administration in reaching the rural masses and assisting them in cremation, he said. Rai has also launched Youth Rural Entrepreneur Foundation in his village to enlighten the farmers about new agriculture technology and marketing of products. “We are also assisting the youths in education, skill development and entrepreneurship,” Rai said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/ghazipur-man-launches-firewood-bank-to-help-cremate-bodies-101621188967526.html
16-05-2021||Mumbai||Majha Doctor: Family doctors key in fight against Covid, says Maharashtra CM||To seek cooperation from local doctors in the fight against Covid, chief minister Uddhav Thackeray and state-appointed task force of doctors, under its Majha Doctor initiative, interacted with more than 17,500 doctors across Maharashtra on Sunday. They guided the local doctors on various aspects, including treatment protocol, treating patient during home isolation or institutional quarantine, reasonable use of drugs and oxygen and treating mucormycosis, among others. In what was termed as a one-off attempt of interaction with the family doctors, the state leadership urged the doctors to manage patients taking treatment at home well. Thackeray said that as 75% patients do not show any symptoms for the virus, they are treated at home by their family doctors, which, in turn, increases their responsibility multi-fold. He said the late referral to hospitals makes it difficult to treat them, thus increasing the fatality rate. “If the patients are treated well in home isolation with appropriate management, the mortality rate can come down significantly,” said Thackeray. The webinar, Managing Covid-19 in Primary Care, was organised by OneMD and was attended by state task force members Dr Sanjay Oak, Dr Shashank Joshi and Dr Rahul Pandit; Director of Directorate of Medical Education and Research Dr TP Lahane and Dr Ashish Bhumkar. r“A family doctor plays an important role while treating a Covid-19 patient at home as he is monitoring his oxygen level, treating comorbidities and guiding him on medicines. The doctor needs to take a call on admitting the patient to the hospital at the appropriate time. Maintaining the sugar level during infection is also a major task before the family doctor. If this management is done properly, it may help reduce the fatalities,” said Thackeray. He also urged the family doctors to extend their services by serving at the nearest Covid care centres. “This will not only be a service to society, but will also give relief to patients as they are being treated by their own doctor. There is a challenge of keeping monsoon-related diseases such as dengue, malaria, leptospirosis in control amid the pandemic. I have directed the state machinery to increase rapid antigen testing so that such diseases can be contained,” he said. Doctors from the task force insisted on the reasonable use of drugs, including steroids and even oxygen. “Patients tend to avoid Covid-19 tests for obvious reasons, but there is no alternative to RT-PCR test. Six-minute test and breathlessness among patients could help doctors in early diagnosis of the infection. It has also been observed that CT scans are being done unnecessarily and their scores are given undue importance. Doctors should also treat oxygen as a drug, ensuring its rational use at clinics and primary health centres and hospitals,” said Dr Oak. Dr Oak said the task force has recommended treatment of Covid-19 patients with no symptoms at community halls at village level, instead of keeping them in home isolation. According to a statement by the CMO, they received more than 3,000 reactions from doctors and general public and was shared by over 1,000 people.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/majha-doctor-family-doctors-key-in-fight-against-covid-says-maharashtra-cm-101621188907451.html
16-05-2021||Mumbai||No coercive action to be taken against Daund hospital accused of over-charging till May 19: HC||The Bombay high court (HC) has restrained the authorities from shutting down a hospital in Daund, Pune which is a dedicated Covid care centre after receiving complaints of over-charging and having four Covid deaths in a single day. The shutdown order was passed on May 7 after the authorities conducted an inspection on receipt of the complaints and found that the centre had not been following stipulated operational norms. However, in light of the fact that 18 patients were still being treated in the centre and the authorities had not allowed the hospital to explain, the court restrained them from shutting the centre till the next hearing on May 19.The division bench of justice KK Tated and justice Abhay Ahuja, while hearing the petition filed by Mohan General and Multi-Specialty Hospital at Daund, Pune, was informed by advocate Dr Uday Warunjikar that the petition was challenging a May 7 cancellation of license order by the sub-divisional officer, Purandar taluka, Pune. The petition also challenged the direction by the sub-divisional officer to the hospital to refund the excess fees they had charged from patients who underwent Covid treatment at the facility.Dr Warunjikar informed the court that the 60-bed hospital had 12 intensive care units (ICU) units and 10 invasive and non-invasive ventilators. He submitted that the hospital was having all the modern amenities and also had the wherewithal to treat Covid patients and had also arranged for a sufficient supply of oxygen.The bench was informed by additional government pleader Kavita Solunke that after receiving numerous complaints from patients who received treatment at the hospital, the tehsildar inspected the hospital and its records and prepared a report. The report states that four Covid patients had died on April 27 due to lack of proper treatment and the hospital had not maintained proper records of patients. The report also pointed to the fact that the hospital had recovered ₹2.75 lakh from an insurance company for treating a patient whose actual bill was only ₹87,000.Solunke submitted that in light of the above it was clear that the hospital violated several provisions of the Bombay Nursing Home Registration Act, hence the show cause notice issued to the hospital asking it to respond in three days failing which its license would be cancelled and its registration would be suspended was valid. She also sought time to file an affidavit with regards to the report. Dr Warunjikar submitted that 18 patients were still receiving treatment at the hospital and if the hospital was not allowed to function it would have an adverse effect on the condition of the patients. He added that as the proper procedure was not followed as per the Act and the hospital did not have a chance to have its say, the implementation of the May 7 order should be stayed. After hearing the submissions, the bench directed the authorities to file their reply by May 18 and retrained them from taking any coercive action against the hospital till the next date of hearing on May 19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/no-coercive-action-to-be-taken-against-daund-hospital-accused-of-over-charging-till-may-19-hc-101621188908124.html

The civic body has also permitted to conduct training at the centres to carry out the vaccination. To vaccinate as many as people in Thane, the TMC has decided a policy to allow private establishments, industrial establishments and housing societies to hold vaccination drives. “As per the government guidelines, it is mandatory to register on Co-WIN portal for the vaccination for all the employees. While those who wish to start a vaccination centre, procurement of the vaccine is their responsibility. While the civic body will guide on the technical aspects to them,” said Sandeep Malvi, public relations officer, TMC. Meanwhile, the TMC has decided to purchase 5 lakh vaccine doses through a global tender. The decision was taken by the TMC commissioner Vipin Sharma, Thane guardian minister Eknath Shinde, and mayor Naresh Mhaske. “After increasing the beds, making provision for the oxygen and medicines, the civic body is now also looking forwards acquiring more vaccines.

16-05-2021||Mumbai||PIL seeking separate vaccine booking portal for Mumbai filed in HC||A public interest litigation (PIL) seeking a dedicated vaccination booking portal for Mumbai has been filed in the Bombay high court by an Andheri based teacher. The petition has claimed that the existing Co-WIN portal is not user-friendly as it does not have a fixed opening time, hence a fixed time for booking vaccination appointments should be made available for citizens, especially those in the age group of 18-44 years. The PIL has also sought a system to ensure that senior citizens are not made to return home without getting their jabs as centres have a tendency to administer available vaccines to walk-in citizens, even though time slots have been allotted.The PIL filed by Yogita Rajesh Vanzara points to the fact that the vaccine booking portal does not have a fixed schedule and timing for citizens to log on and book a slot for getting jabs at the vaccination centres as a result of which precious time of people in the age group of 18-44 years is wasted in keeping track of when the booking function on the portal gets activated.The PIL has also cited the erratic timing of the booking function becoming activated and stated, “Various centres show the availability of seats at midnight or thereafter and yet booked within seconds of the same being offered to the public.” To avoid this situation the petition has sought directions to the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) to open slots for booking vaccine at a pre-determined time with due intimation for a full week, instead of on daily basis.The PIL has also raised the issue of non-availability of vaccines for citizens who have got appointments for the jab especially senior citizens who have to return home without the jab as the centres that have walk-in facilities exhaust the vaccines. In light of this, the PIL has prayed for directions to administer the vaccine to walk-in citizens only after ensuring that people who have booked vaccines through the portal are given the vaccination.The petition also highlights the issue of citizens from economically backward finding it difficult to get vaccine bookings due to their technical ignorance or inaccessibility due to lack of a proper internet connection. The petition also points to the fact that the servers are unable to take load due to the large number of people trying to book vaccination slots.On the issue of centres not being senior citizen and disabled friendly, the PIL has sought directions to make the centres’ wheelchair friendly as well. The petition also complains of the portal deleting bookings after which the citizen is unable to secure another booking.In light of the above, the PIL has sought to set up a separate portal for Mumbai and to streamline the booking process by having fixed timing and providing information in real-time on the availability of vaccines at the centres. The PIL is expected to come up for hearing in due course.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/pil-seeking-separate-vaccine-booking-portal-for-mumbai-filed-in-hc-101621188787514.html

The airport saw around 125,000 RT-PCR tests since March 7 till the first few days of May. The total number of tests done at the airport till date stands to 345,000.From November 26, 2020 till last week, passengers travelling to Maharashtra from specific states, marked as “sensitive areas”, were required to have a negative RT-PCR report. However from Friday, the state government made negative RT-PCR test report, obtained within 48 hours before the time of entry into the state, mandatory for all arriving passengers. Considering the issues with delayed test reports, the state allowed air and rail travellers to de-board at their destinations in Maharashtra but asked them to get tested upon arrival.Due to the impact of the second wave that largely started around April, air traffic has fallen from around 650 movements per day to around 200-250 movements per day, sources from Mumbai airport had told HT earlier in the week.“Around 5.3 million passengers travelled to/from Mumbai airport between January and April 2020. However, the traffic fell when foreign countries imposed travel bans. Domestic traffic largely saw the impact from the first week of May,” said an airport source. Mumbai’s Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj International Airport (CSMIA) set up testing facilities in September 2020 and it was gradually extended to encompass arriving and departing passengers as well as non-passengers arriving at the airport. With the increase in demand for testing at the airport in the wake of various testing and quarantine regulations across borders, CSMIA then went ahead to introduce an express molecular technology developed by Abbott ID Now to provide test results in 13 minutes.“Since the launch of its testing facilities in September 2020, CSMIA has registered over 345,000 tests. The airport has established over 30 testing counters for international and domestic passengers. The testing centres include those equipped with molecular testing facilities which offer passengers the option to process their test results in 13 minutes post sample collection,” a senior airport official said.However, passengers getting tested after arrival are allowed to head to their destinations and the reports are emailed to the after a minimum of 24 hours.“As per the government resolution of Maharashtra government dated May 12, any passenger arriving from any part of India should bring negative RT-PCR report. Without a negative report, they are not allowed to board. Previously, passengers arriving from seven states were screened compulsorily...If passengers don’t have negative RT-PCR report, then the passengers were allowed to leave the airport after giving their swab samples for testing at the testing counters at the airport. The lab informs the concerned ward if a passenger is found positive and the respective ward monitors such a passenger,” said Devendra Kumar Jain, officer on special duty (OSD) in-charge of domestic and international operations, Mumbai civic body.“The system is developed and every passenger is tracked.

The police and PAC jawans have been asked to intensify patrolling in the riverine areas to stop this inhumane practice, in which families are reportedly abandoning the dead bodies for fear of Covid-19,” he said. The CM’s statement came in the light of media reports that several bodies of possible Covid victims were found in or near rivers in the state. On reports of exorbitant prices allegedly being charged by private hospitals from Covid patients, the chief minister asked the Gautam Budh Nagar administration to take stern actions against anyone found doing so. “The admin has also been asked to arrange separate hospitals for the free treatment of women and children. At the same time, the admin has been asked to take a tough stand in enforcing the Covid curfew as it is the only way to break the virus’ chain,” he said. Earlier, meeting with the MLAs and the MP of the district, the CM said that oxygen consumption at private hospitals will be audited. “The districts must have a Covid team on the lines of the state, which can keep a constant tab on the situation. Every vaccination centre should also have a call centre that can intimate the beneficiaries on time about their slots,” he said.The Bharatiya Janata Party MLA from Jewar, Dhitendra Singh, requested the CM to give priority to local residents in vaccination and hospitalisation. “It is really heart-breaking that even those, who had given their ancestral land for the construction of the hospitals, are running pillar to post,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/keep-tabs-on-riverine-areas-for-people-dumping-bodies-adityanath-tells-cops-101621188607392.html

16-05-2021||Mumbai||Cyclone Tauktae to pass Mumbai on Monday; IMD sounds orange alert||Cyclone Tauktae is expected to pass by Mumbai on Monday sometime during late morning to early afternoon, at a distance of about 380kms from the city’s coastline, officials in the India Meteorological Department (IMD) confirmed on Sunday. Wind speed between 55 and 70kmph (kilometre per hour) is expected to lash the city, along with heavy rainfall at isolated locations. Light to moderate rains commenced in the city on Sunday night with winds touching 30 to 35kmph speed and gusting up to 52kmph. The shower will increase by late night and may continue till Monday afternoon.The weather bureau’s initial yellow category storm warning for Mumbai for Sunday has been upgraded to orange category warning for Monday, indicating very likely chances of rough weather.“The weather system has slowed down a bit after initial forecasts suggested that it would cross Mumbai’s latitude on Sunday. It is now expected to cross the city sometime after 11.30am on Monday, though effects of the cyclone began to be felt on Saturday night itself when wind speeds in Mumbai touched as much as 40kmph. Showers and gusty winds may be felt on Sunday night,” said Jayanta Sarkar, scientist and head of IMD’s regional forecasting centre in Mumbai, on Sunday .Officials said heavy rainfall due to the cyclone would not pose a major problem to Mumbai’s civic infrastructure. “But citizens should be mindful of the weather when stepping out, especially along the coast, due to the strong winds,” said KS Hosalikar, senior scientist with IMD in Pune. “Some wind damage to property cannot be ruled out. Orange alert has also been sounded for Thane and Palghar districts, while Raigad is in the red category because the impact of the rain and winds might be felt more severely due to the district’s hilly topography.”With the slowing down of the weather system, temperatures in Mumbai remained high on Sunday, with a maximum daytime temperature of 36 degrees Celsius, down from a 10-year high for the month of May at 37.4 degrees Celsius the day prior. This was due to the dense cloud cover that has formed over the city and is acting as a heat trap. However, mercury is expected to dip to 31 degrees Celsius on Monday after heavy rains.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/cyclone-tauktae-to-pass-mumbai-on-monday-imd-sounds-orange-alert-101621187228534.html

16-05-2021||Noida||ILI/SARI cases show declining trend in Ghaziabad||Ghaziabad: The cases of influenza-like illness (ILI) and severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) have started witnessing a decline in the current month after such cases peaked in April this year, according to data of the district health department. Health officials said that the decline in ILI and SARI cases is a good sign as about 15-20% of such cases turn out positive for Covid-19. According to the health department data, there were about 41 cases of ILI/SARI in Ghaziabad in February which increased to 106 in March and further spiked to 3,249 in April when Covid-19 caseload was high in the district. However, during the first 15 days of May, only 570 such cases have come in so far. The ILI and SARI cases show Covid-19 symptoms like cough, cold, fever and respiratory issues and need to be tested and treated early to avoid any patient going into stages of aggravation. The officials said that the decline in ILI/SARI cases is a result of door-to-door surveys, surveillance and testing taken up by the health department teams. “We have 618 surveillance teams and 20 static centres where testing takes place to detect suspected cases. About 15-20% of both ILI and SARI cases generally turn into positive for Covid-19. So, early detection of ILI/SARI cases helps contain the spread of virus,” said Dr NK Gupta, chief medical officer, Ghaziabad. In September last year, of 6,093 Covid-19 cases in Ghaziabad, 2,531 patients had shown symptoms of ILI/SARI, showed the data. The figure was 1,319 of 4,174 Covid cases in October, while it was 1,089 of 4,198 Covid cases in November and 315 of total 1,238 Covid cases in December last year. “So, their (ILI/SARI cases) early testing and treatment is a must. We have also intensified surveillance and door-to-door surveys in rural areas to detect and test such cases. In urban areas, localities like Indirapuram, Vaishali, Vasundhara, Sahibabad and Raj Nagar have high number of ILI/SARI cases. The trend is, however, on a decline,” Gupta said. Experts said that they have also witnessed a decline in ILI/SARI cases in May. “About 80% cases coming in around mid-April were having ILI/SARI symptoms. We have observed that the rate of such patients coming in has declined to about 50-60% during past one week, and it is encouraging,” said Dr VB Jindal, former president of Indian Medical Association (Ghaziabad). “It is vital that anyone having ILI/SARI symptoms should get tested at the onset and isolate self, besides starting with treatment,” he added. Ghaziabad has witnessed a sudden spike in Covid-19 cases after April 15 this year. On April 15, the sample positivity rate was low at 2.8%, but it shot up to 8.84% on April 30 and further spiked to 19.3% on May 6. The official records indicated that it was 14.55% on May 15. Sample positivity rate refers to the number of samples testing positive per 100 samples tested. Sometimes patients take more than one test for confirmation and so, total positive samples can be higher than total positive cases, the officials said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/ilisari-cases-show-declining-trend-in-ghaziabad-101621183867293.html

The state government had announced that it will be releasing ₹50,000 per gram panchayat to set up isolation centres in villages but the residents of Mandholi village started their own isolation centre. Almost every family in the village, which has approximately 6,000 people, has been touched by the virus. The health department had collected samples of 60 people, of which eight were found positive in rapid tests. Mandeep Chaudhary, a postgraduate, who runs a coaching centre, said they had established a10-bedded isolation centre at KCM School this week.“We have four oxygen cylinders and five doctors are available for online consultation free of cost. We have equipment such as oximeters, thermometers, steam machines and blood pressure monitoring machines. Thirty-eight patients are admitted at the centre, which was set up with the help of donations,” he said. Chaudhary, who had started an ambulance service in the village in January, has purchased two more ambulances amid the second wave.“If patients’ condition worsens, they are taken to hospitals in Bhiwani or Hisar. The poor are ferried free of cost and well-to-do patients are also only charged for fuel. Our team has been delivering oxygen cylinders and medicines to patients’ door step. Only refilling charges are taken,” he said.The director of the private school, Jaibir Boora, said, “Most students in our school are from Mandholi Kalan and other neighbouring villages. Thus, in this hour of crisis, we offered our building as an isolation centre so that lives can be saved. School authorities in collaboration with the village youth are planning to increase the number of beds.” Chotu, a resident of the village said his mother was admitted to the isolation centre after her oxygen saturation levels dropped. “Now, my mother is fine and her saturation level is 97. This centre is very helpful for patients whose lungs are affected. If oxygen is provided to such patients, they can be shifted to hospitals,” he said.Devender Sheoran, a resident of Sidhanwa village, who had supplied 14 oxygen cylinders to those in need free of cost said they too were planning on setting up an isolation centre in their village on their own.” “ We have identified a school building and the isolation centre will be started in the next three to four days,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/amid-rising-virus-cases-bhiwani-villagers-set-up-their-own-isolation-centre-101621183688654.html
16-05-2021||Delhi||AAP leader behind 'PM Modi why did you send vaccines of our children' posters: Delhi Police||The Delhi Police on Sunday said Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leader Arvind Gautam was behind the posters criticising Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the reports of shortage in Covid-19 vaccination doses in the country that emerged in Mangolpuri area. This comes a day after the police arrested 25 peope for allegedly pasting these posters on walls across the city. Delhi police said AAP leader Gautam is absconding. "Police while patrolling to enforce lockdown announced by DDMA, created by GNCTD, noticed walls in several areas being defaced by pasting posters. Accused persons on questioning told an AAP member & President of Ward 47, Arvind Gautam was behind it in Mangolpuri. He is absconding," tweeted the Delhi Police, which comes under the Union Home Ministry.The police alleged that AAP leaders were involved in pasting the posters in other parts of the national capital as well.The police have registered 25 FIRs and arrested as many people for allegedly pasting the posters, reading "Modiji humare bachhon ki vaccine videsh kyun bhej diya (PM why did you send vaccines meant for our children to foreign countries)", in several parts of the city.Police registered the FIRs under sections of the Prevention of Defacement of Property Act. The number of first information reports (FIRs) and arrests could increase in the coming days as more posters reading “Modiji humare bachon ki vaccine videsh kyon bhej diya? (Why did Modi send vaccines meant for our children to foreign countries?)” are being found across the city, senior police officers privy to the development said.Since the legal sections mentioned in the FIRs were all bailable, a majority of those arrested till Saturday afternoon were released on bail from the concerned police stations itself. Those arrested after Saturday afternoon were likely to be released by late in the night after completing the legal formalities, the officers said.The police are trying to ascertain if all the posters were printed at one printing press and whether the order for the same was given by an individual or any political party. However, the initial investigations in most of the registered cases and interrogation of the arrested people have not yielded much of a result.A few of the arrested persons claimed that they were given money for pasting the posters. The police are now trying to identify the people who paid the money. Their questioning may lead to the key players behind the critical posters, the officers said.The first such posters, nearly 1,800 in number and not bearing any logo or mention of any political party or organisation, were found in east Delhi’s Kalyanpuri between Wednesday and Thursday, after which a case was registered and four persons were arrested. Their interrogation pointed towards the involvement of a local politician.“We are probing the role of the politician. Our investigation is still on. It’s too early to comment on any individual’s involvement,” said a police officer, who did not want to be identified.As similar posters were found in other parts of the city from Thursday onwards, more FIRs were registered. Till Saturday evening, the number of FIRs reached 25 in 13 different police districts.All the cases were registered under sections 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant) of the Indian Penal Code and other sections including section 3 of the Prevention of Defacement of Property Act across various districts.

They kept me stuck in their frivolous probe for hours while patients needed me urgently. The government is spending crores on ministers and politicians but has fixed ₹7,000 for common people. Do they know the cost of medicines and equipment?” Dr OP Anand, owner of 111 Save Life Hospital, was heard saying in the viral video.According to Dr Anand, the probe team wanted to investigate alleged exuberant service charges at his hospital. “They didn’t have any written order from the health minister. When I asked for the package fixed by the government, they couldn’t produce that. The government has not provided any such package to us detailing cost of medicines and processes involved in treating Covid-19 patients either. So, what will they probe?,” Dr Anand said. Seraikela-Kharsawan district civil surgeon in-charge Dr Barial Mardi, who led the probe team, said on Sunday that he reported the matter to the health minister and filed an FIR against Dr Anand and hospital management for not allowing them to investigate, misbehaving and threatening the probe team. “I am sending a detailed report to the health minister and further action will be taken as per the health department’s guidelines. I have also lodged a FIR against Dr Anand for obstructing government work, threatening us and violation of the Epidemic Act, DM Act and government orders,” Dr Mardi.The civil surgeon said the probe came after repeated complaints against 111 Save Life Hospital management for levying exuberant and arbitrary charges on Covid-19 patients despite the state government’s fixed rates for such patients being treated in private hospitals. “We sought details of patients, payments charged and received from them and the detailed bills therein after the health minister asked us to investigate the matter. But, Dr Anand didn’t show any documents. Moreover, he kept us waiting. We were also threatened and abused,” alleged Dr Mardi. Health minister urges Dr Anand to do dutyMeanwhile, health minister Banna Gupta refused to be dragged into the controversy and urged Dr Anand to focus and perform his “doctor’s’ duty”. “This is no time to get into any debate or war of words. We all are busy in fighting Covid-19 emergency and arranging facilities for the spiralling number of cases across the state. I believe in constructive work and not bothered about who is abusing me or threatening to beat me up,” said Gupta.The minister, however, said law will take its own course in the matter. “We have been receiving complaints of exuberant charges by 111 Save Life Hospital and Uma Mukti-speciality Hospital following which I directed probe. Suitable legal action will be taken against people found disobeying government orders,” said Gupta.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/jkhand-doc-threatens-to-thrash-state-health-minister-video-goes-viral-101621181647123.html
16-05-2021||Ranchi||Huge rush on govt portal leads to ‘slow’ e-pass generation||As the state entered the fourth week of lockdown on Sunday, additional lockdown restrictions were imposed with prohibition of inter and intrastate bus services and making e-pass mandatory for movement of all private vehicles. However, slow generation of e-passes on the state government’s portal resulted in a chaos-like situation in many parts of the state. According to officials, places, where internet speed was slow, witnessed the problem. Joint transport commissioner of state transport department, Ravi Shankar Vidyarthi, said, “The system is being rectified and the issue will be resolved very soon.”Samir Mahto, a resident of Ranchi’s Nagri area, claimed that he tried to open the website, epassjharkhand.nic.in for an hour in the morning but failed. “The government should have upgraded the system first before making e-pass mandatory,” he said.Many other users said they were unable to complete the entire procedure of e-pass generation due to slow system speed. An official in the Ranchi transport office, who requested to remain anonymous, blamed huge traffic on the website to be the reason behind the slow system.“We have received reports of people facing problems in e-pass generation from few places. The system is partially slow where the internet speed is weak, ” said the transport commissioner.He said more than 1.20 lakh e-passes were issued on Saturday. According to the transport department officials, around 70,000 more e-passes were issued till 4pm on Sunday.The state government extended the lockdown till May 27 morning. It also additional restrictions in bid to contain the spread of coronavirus infection. In a bid to ensure their strict implementation, adequate security personnel were deputed at all strategic locations in capital city Ranchi. Ranchi police also enhanced vehicle checking drive, and no vehicle was allowed to ply without the mandatory e-pass. People found violating the government order were booked under Disaster Management Act and Motor Vehicle Act in many parts of the state.During the lockdown, major city roads wore a deserted look. Few people were seen at vegetable markets and grocery shops.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ranchi-news/huge-rush-on-govt-portal-leads-to-slow-e-pass-generation-101621181587308.html
16-05-2021||Patna||Bihar: GA slams state govt over Covid-19 mismanagement||Leaders of the Grand Alliance (GA) on Sunday slammed the state government for alleged mismanagement of the Covid-19 pandemic, which complicated miseries of people owing to various crises, and urged the chief minister Nitish Kumar to have the say of legislators in using the local area development (LAD) fund to refurbish health infrastructure in their areas. Last month, the state government had allocated ₹2 crore out of the total ₹3 crore of the LAD fund of each legislator to the health department for management of the pandemic, which infected nearly 6.50 lakh people in its second wave. Legislators of the opposition parties were feeling handicapped to help the people during the pandemic as they were unable to provide monetary help to the distressed lots. The GA, which held a virtual meeting under the leadership of RJD leader Tejashwi Prasad Yadav on Sunday, issued a 15-point charter of demands, which also included the issuance of a status report on purchases of ambulances purchased from LAD fund MPs/MLAs in the last 15 years. They alleged that the government was indulging in tampering with data on pandemic instead of focussing its attention on ensuring proper care to the people under treatment. This is for the first time when leaders of the opposition parties, including those of the Congress and left parties, held a joint meeting to discuss the chaos and various crises the people are grappling with to access suitable medical facilities in the state. RJD senior Alok Mehta, who conducted the meeting, said that the GA wrote a letter to the CM asking him to provide a monthly allowance of ₹750 to those left jobless due to the pandemic and ration to those who don’t pay income tax. Yadav questioned the rationale behind allocating a major chunk of LAD fund to the health department without seeking the legislators’ consent and claimed that people of Bihar were suffering the most owing to the state government’s inefficiency and mishandling of the pandemic by a select group of bureaucrats. The opposition leaders alleged that the government had taken ₹50 lakh from each legislators’ quota in the name of improving health infrastructure last year. But we were completely unaware of what happened with the fund. They also demanded payment of ₹4lakh as exgratia to those who died waiting for the Covid test. The leaders also asked for increasing the number of RT-PCR test instead of less reliable tests like rapid antigen and TrueNat modes. They also sought to know the progress in setting up the expert committee, which they had suggested during a meeting with the governor. Arrangement of sufficient quantity of vaccine, the appointment of doctors and medical staff on an urgent basis and issuance of a white paper on the equipment procured under the PM Cares fund were among other demands. Meanwhile, Congress legislature party (CLP) leader Ajit Sharma also wrote a letter to the CM, asking him to arrange the purchase of one fully equipped ambulance in each district from the ₹2 crore discretionary quota fund, which the state government has already taken, to take care of covid-infected people of their respective areas. The Congress party has also proposed to set up a district-level task force of its office bearers to monitor the quality of medical facilities being offered to the covid-infected people in the government and private hospitals and pressurise the district administration and health officials to discharge their duties properly. Earlier on Saturday, Indian Youth Congress (IYC) chief Srinivas BV reviewed the functioning of the state Youth Congress volunteers, who are part of the SOSIYC, for extending help to the people suffering from the pandemic and their families by way of facilitating the availability of suitable beds in hospitals, arranging oxygen and necessary medicines and providing food to those under home isolation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/biharga-slams-state-govt-over-covid-19-mismanagement-101621181527284.html

Bihar inoculated 1,09,706 people against Covid-19 on Sunday as against 1,24,104 people on Saturday and 1,16,441 on Friday because of closure of many vaccination session sites. Meanwhile, Bihar health minister Mangal Pandey said 14,000 vials of Liposomal Amphotericin-B injection, a specific drug for treatment of cases of mucormycosis, were made available to the health department through the World Health Organisation. Some hospitals had earlier claimed that the injection was not available in the state and they had written to the state drug controller about it. Around 6,000 vials of injection from this stock were made available to different hospitals in the state. These include AIIMS-Patna (2000 vials), IGIMS, Patna Medical College Hospital, Nalanda Medical College Hospital, Jawaharlal Nehru Medical College Hospital, Bhagalpur (300 vials each), Darbhanga Medical College Hospital, Government Medical College Hospital, Bettiah,, Anugrah Narayan Magadh Medical College Hospital, Gaya, Vardhaman Institute of Medical Sciences, Pawapuri (200 each) and 1,600 vials to the Rajendra Memorial Research Institute of Medical Sciences (RMRIMS), Patna.

The teams were airlifted from Pune to Ahmedabad and Goa. Five other teams were deployed until Saturday - one in Goa and four in Mumbai. “Five teams of NDRF will shortly airlift from Pune technical airport to Ahmedabad, Gujarat amid Cyclone Tauktae,” read a statement from an NDRF official on Sunday.

16-05-2021||Pune||Unscientific pruning of tree branches by MSEDCL poses a risk in monsoon||A large number of trees felling incidents might be reported this year during monsoon, as the Maharashtra State Electricity Distribution Company Limited (MSEDCL) authorities have carried out pruning of tree branches and chopped off portion of trees in an unscientific manner, according to experts. Trees along the roads in Sinhagad, Bibwewadi, NIBM road, Salunke Vihar, Padmavati, Kothrud, Baner, Pashan, Ahmednagar Road, Bhavani peth and other suburbs were pruned, according to the mandatory advisory of MSEDCL authorities. The mandate was to prune the branches of those trees which have grown into electricity cables of high-tension supply lines and also the general electricity supply lines. But environmentalists and commuters have argued that balancing the weight of the trees has not been taken into consideration while carrying out the cutting exercise and the unscientific way of axing could lead to incidents of tree felling during monsoon. The MSEDCL advisory states that the branches and portion of trees which are threats to high tension cable wires are cut off in the month of May before the onset of monsoon season. There is a threat to life if trees fall onto the electricity supplying cables or there is a possibility of electricity supply breakdown. “However, the contractor appointed by the authorities seems to have pruned the branches and chopped off the portions in such a way that a major disaster is in the offing due to haphazard way of pruning the branches. There is a way to deal with tree cutting and the balance has to be maintained. One can see that the trees are bending towards the roadside as the branches from the other side have been cut in large number and weight imbalance has been created,” said environmentalist Madhusudan Kore. PMC garden superintendent Ashok Ghorpade said, “The tree branches are to be axed in the presence of the regional ward staffers of the PMC and there are directions to the effect. However, the branches are cut off indiscriminately without taking safety into consideration.” MSEDCL authorities maintained that a review of the tree cutting exercise would be undertaken and necessary steps will be initiated for citizens’ safety.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/unscientific-pruning-of-tree-branches-by-msedcl-poses-a-risk-in-monsoon-101621177207051.html

An entire river stretch flowing from Agarkarwadi, Rakshewadi, Patharwadi, until Kalus, which is a village one-km from the Bhima Askhed dam, is allegedly polluted with chemicals and sewage, creating a bluish tinge on the surface of the water. Foam has also filled the canal (odha) running through Chakan city.“My family is part of the farmer’s group in Kalus and I own 2.5 acres of farmland. Initially, this odha was a narrow one, but with expansion and population growth all the water flowing through reaches the Bhima river faster,” said Vicky Koutkar, a lawyer and farmer.Factories and manufacturers, in MIDC and the small scale industries set up along the Chakan nagar parishad area, are being blamed for releasing pollutants into the odha.“One can see a sticky, thick greenish hue on the top layer of the water near the dam, while every day, we see soapy bubbles and foam running through the odha,” added Koutkar.Nanasaheb Kamthe, CEO, Chakan nagar parishad, denied chemical waste was floating through the odha, but agreed that sewage water from residential areas is being released into the canal.“I am aware that sewage water from the Chakan area is flowing into the odha and we are working towards a solution. We already have a work order to build an underground drainage line for the entire Chakan city. Besides this, a sewage treatment plant is also in the pipeline. I have taken over six months ago and this nagar parishad is fairly new, formed in 2015; hence, we need time to plan and implement basic things,” said Kamthe.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/sewage-water-flowing-via-chakan-canal-directly-into-bhima-river-101621176726997.html

16-05-2021||Pune||Fire department responded to more tree falling incidents than fire in 2020||Due to concretisation of roads and development, tree falling incidents are increasing continuously in the city. According to the Pune fire department statistics, in the past two years, the department has responded to more tree felling incidents than cases of fire in the city. The fire department registered 1,269 incidents of tree falling against 975 fire incidents from January- December-2019. In 2020, the fire department recorded 1,152 tree falling incidents whereas they got calls of 699 fire incidents. Due to cyclone Tauktae, Pune city is also experiencing rain and strong winds. In the last two days, the fire department has registered more than 20 tree falling incidents across the city. According to fire department statistics, tree falling incidents are increasing from 2015 in the city. In 2017, a total of 1,201 tree falling incidents were reported. Not only environmentalists but also garden department officials allege that most of the trees that were standing on public land suffered damage or were lost due to negligence as the soil cover around these structures were lost to unscientific trimming or concretisation around them, forcing many to tilt during the rains and lose their stability. Excessive concretization, road digging Ashok Ghorpade, chief superintendent of PMC garden department said, “A major stretch of roads in the city along the internal roads owned by societies, have witnessed rampant concretisation over the last few years. In several areas, there is no soil left around the trunk of the tree. It is completely concertized thus stunting their growth. It does not get oxygen to grow, and it leads to plunge trees. Such trees will eventually collapse during the rains. Digging of roads for lying service lines or underground cables damages the roots of trees and uneven trimming of branches of trees is another reason trees fall in the city.” During former civic chief Mahesh Pathak’s time, the garden department had issued circulation to the road department which had mentioned details of concretisation near trees. The PMC road department is also not following instructions of the garden department. As per PMC road department officials, most of the corporators use their local ward development funds to concertise lanes and internal roads, more than ₹300 crore are spent on concretization of small roads. Demand of maintenance cell City based environmentalist Dr Sachin Punekar said, “The PMC has started rampant cement concretisation of internal roads or areas. It has completely stopped water percolation. Therefore, water is logging in the city and the tree’s holding capacity has gone down and they are falling down often in the city. The PMC garden department and tree authority should have to form a mechanism for tree maintenance. Trees are suffocating due to concretization. We cannot blame it on heavy rain. Trees are living entities. The PMC should have to diagnose tree falling phenomena as it is increasing in the city and work to minimise or stop it.” NGT order In 2014, the National Green Tribunal ordered in one of the hearings of Navi Mumbai based environmentalists that a three feet circumference around the trees must be kept free of any concretisation. This will help in the growth of the trees and will help retain their stability. VG Kulkarni, chief superintendent engineer of the road department, said, “It is not the major reason for tree falling, it may be one of the reasons for tree falling. Uneven chopping of tree branches also imbalance trees and they plunge during heavy rains. We are taking precautions to provide adequate space for trees to breathe and grow naturally.” PMC chief fire officer Prashant Ranpise said, “Due to the lack of soil around the trunk weakens the roots of trees and it falls down. Tree falling incidents have increased since the last few years in the city.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/fire-department-responded-to-more-tree-falling-incidents-than-fire-in-2020-101621176427073.html

These exams are for 50 marks with multiple-choice questions (MCQ) being conducted by the university’s own Edutech Foundation. For the second-semester exams, other methods of conducting the exams are being explored by the SPPU. “This important decision to explore the ways of conducting the exams for the second semester was taken at the SPPU’s board of examination meeting, held on Saturday. Discussions were held about the pattern and how to make it more transparent. The exam will be held online mode and registration will start soon,” said Mahesh Kakade, head of the SPPU examination and evaluation department. “Students demanded that the second-semester exams be held immediately, as most need to take further admissions for higher studies, and need the results for job opportunities,” he added. Meanwhile, the SPPU instructed all affiliated colleges to conduct practicals and internal tests before June 15, and to submit the marks by June 25, as the university cannot declare the results without practical and internal marks from the colleges.Shweta Karale, a Science student said, “Most students were demanding that both semesters be held together. Now, second-semester exams will go on till August and results will be declared after that. There are various courses for which students want to take admission and there process starts from June.” Law student Jay Adwani said, “It is good that SPPU is conducting back-to-back exams for both semesters.

16-05-2021||Other||Time to make laws dealing with hoarding, black marketing more strict||Even though the second wave of Covid-19 seems to have peaked, the numbers are still high and the downward journey is expected to be long. Besides, unlike the first wave, this time the virus is spreading rapidly in rural areas with poor health infrastructure. So the gap between demand and supply in terms of hospital beds, medicines, medical devices will continue to be wide, giving hoarders and black marketers ample opportunities to fish in troubled waters. The rural markets will also give all those rapacious gangs selling fake medicines and oxygen cylinders, a wide opening.Going by the huge haul of fake Remdesivir being ‘manufactured’ and sold in different parts of the country, including Delhi, Gujarat, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Karnataka and Maharashtra, the racket seems widespread. While the Gujarat variety, which was also supplied to consumers in Madhya Pradesh, resulting in the death of at least ten patients, contained glucose and salt, those seized in Nagpur had plain water. More recently, there are reports of cheap antibiotics being sold as Remdesivir in rural areas of Uttar Pradesh. There are also cases of fire extinguishers being sold as oxygen cylinders in different parts of the country. The need of the hour, therefore, is continuous and consistent action to curb not just black marketing of beds and essential medical supplies, but also sale of fake medicines and medical devices. And such action can no longer be limited to urban areas, but should extend to rural India. This requires all agencies enforcing different applicable laws such as the Indian Penal code, the Drugs and Cosmetics Act, the Essential Commodities Act, the Prevention of Blackmarketing and Maintenance of Supplies of Essential Commodities Act, the Legal Metrology (Packaged Commodities) Rules, the Epidemic Act and the Disaster management Act, to come together and set up an exclusive cell to deal with all covid related unfair practices. Besides their own investigations, these cells in each state should follow up on consumer complaints of overpricing and fake drugs provided through toll-free telephone and WhatsApp numbers .It is equally important to hand over the maximum punishment to those found guilty through summary trials and fast track courts set up exclusively for the purpose. While retired police personnel can be called back to take some load off the enforcement agencies, retired judges and even lawyers could adjudicate over these cases. Even though the laws provide for imprisonment (can go up to seven years under the Essential Commodities Act ) or fine or both for hoarders and blackmarketers, the quantum of fine prescribed under the Essential Commodities Act is too meagre and the Centre needs to provide for higher penalty through an ordinance.The financial penalties should be stiff enough to pay for the following: reimbursement of the extra amount collected from consumers, remunerations for the extra staff required for enforcement work and the running of the fast track courts and also contribution towards Covid relief work. Where it is possible to establish a direct link between hoarding and black marketing and loss of life, the financial penalty should also cover compensation to the victim’s family.Under the Drugs and Cosmetics Act, sale of spurious drugs likely to cause death or grievous hurt carry a sentence of ten years to life, besides fine of ₹10 lakhs or three times the value of the drugs seized. This fine also needs to be increased. The law provides for compensation to the victim or his family.In addition to jail term, those convicted should also be made to work in Covid wards for at least a fortnight, cleaning toilets and wardsLastly, adequate publicity should be given to each of these cases , particularly the severity of the punishment, so as to create the fear of the law in these Covid vultures. Today, these people are emboldened by the paralysis that seems to have gripped many governments. It’s time the governments showed that political will and determination to end the menace and instill confidence in the people that the state will protect them.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/time-to-make-laws-dealing-with-hoarding-black-marketing-more-strict-101621166406623.html

Hence, nobody except health care workers and frontline workers will be eligible for the second Covishield dose at present as vaccination for other categories had commenced on March 1."Due to this change, the civic body has decided to extend the walk-in (vaccination) facility for citizens above 60 years of age for the first Covishield dose during May 18- 20," he said.Last week, the BMC had announced that the citizens above 60 years of age, who are waiting for the second dose of Covishield vaccine, the beneficiaries yet to get the second dose of Covaxin and the disabled person can opt for walk-in vaccination from Monday to Wednesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/cyclone-tauktae-bmc-suspends-covid-19-vaccination-drive-in-mumbai-on-may-17-101621164665903.html

There is no one to perform his last rite. When I was told to do the job, I readily accepted it,” ward boy Rohit Bedia said.Following the Covid-19 guidelines, Bedia took the body from RIMS to Ghaghra Muktidham in Ranchi and performed the rituals, which are generally done by family members.Hospital authorities said the parents of the toddler said they were residents of Jamui in Bihar and had brought their two year old son to RIMS for treatment late at night on May 10. The kid was admitted at the paediatric ward of the hospital with a complaint of breathlessness.Dr Hirendra Birua, head of paediatrics surgery department of the hospital said the parents told the doctors that the boy had suddenly developed breathlessness and both of them were attending to the child when he was admitted at 12.15 am on May 11.“We thought something might have got stuck in the child’s windpipe. When his X-Ray was done, we found the kid was suffering from Pneumonia. By the afternoon, he was confirmed positive for the coronavirus. His parents suddenly went traceless after the Covid positive report came,” said Dr Birua.He added that the kid died at 3pm on May 11. “Hospital authorities tried to contact his parents on the numbers provided by them, but they could not be contacted despite repeated efforts,” he said.After the parents failed to respond for three days, the hospital authorities, with the permission of the Ranchi administration, requested Bedia to perform his last rites.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ranchi-news/ranchi-ward-boy-performs-last-rites-of-2-yr-old-covid-victim-deserted-by-parents-101621164907175.html
16-05-2021||Pune||Your Space: Scale up medical oxygen supplies||Prime Minister has recently lauded Maharashtra government’s efforts to check the spread of Covid-19 during the ongoing second wave. While the medical oxygen crisis is hitting the headlines after the shortage of beds and vaccine, should not the authorities take steps for hospitals to generate their own oxygen to meet the rising demand? Sugar factories should produce medical oxygenHospitals with independent oxygen manufacturing ability are the need of the hour. We need to invest around 20 per cent of budget in health infrastructure to mitigate the crisis. There is a need to train every youth of the country for Covid-19 management. Dedicated online and offline education is required for teachers and youth to fight against Covid-19 and related requirements. Why are we late when medical experts have observed that the second and third wave is expected? Spike in positive cases and deaths is reported across India. It seems that the health system is unable to handle the crisis and residents are apprehensive and confused about hospital treatment. Even the WHO says that they know much about the virus, and they are still learning.India is a country with huge population, expert medical professionals and big pharmaceutical companies, then why not a proper strategy is laid down at the national, state, district and local administration level? Medical oxygen is an indispensable medicine in the treatment of Covid-19. We have to ask for help from other countries. Why not all our sugar factories produce oxygen and supply across the country. Medical oxygen logistic and supply chain also matters. Dr Aftab Anwar ShaikhRamp up medical infra in district Each district collector has to manage adequate supply of medical oxygen, hospital beds, isolation wards for Covid-19 patients and a well-planned vaccination drive at a time when the country is struggling to meet the logistical challenges which a collapsing healthcare system of our state is being exposed every day. There is a need for the administration to have prepared a detailed plan to tackle the deadly second wave of coronavirus and put in place a contingency plan. The government had not anticipated that the cases could shoot up any moment and that an oxygen plant could come in handy if more people fall sick because of the disease. Without much ado, they should have set up oxygen plants. Money is a crucial requirement for setting up a robust healthcare system that needs many ambulances, ventilators, beds, oxygen plants, vaccines, medicines, trained medical staff, nurses and policy makers among others. The government must use a combination of resources, including district planning and development funds, state disaster relief funds, and mobilised the CSR units to meet the expenses for starting up oxygen plants. Efforts should be made to utilise medical resources and set up oxygen plants in the district. This is the best way to lead forward and become self-sufficient.Sanjay KumarSet up more oxygen plantsThe mechanism of setting up oxygen plants will further strengthen public health system and enable long-term systematic augmentation of its availability in a cost-effective manner. Adequate and uninterrupted supply of oxygen is an essential pre-requisite for managing moderate and severe cases of Covid -19, in addition to various other medical conditions where this need arises. Installation of PSA Oxygen Concentrator Plants in public health facilities is an important step to reduce the health facility’s dependence on the system of store and supply and to enable these facilities to have their own oxygen generation capacity. This will not only increase the total oxygen availability pool, but also facilitate providing of oxygen support in timely manner to patients in public health facilities. Ashlesha DetheTake proactive steps to ensure adequate supply of O2While talking about the medical oxygen availability in healthcare facilities across the country, the government must take various proactive steps to ensure adequate supply of medical oxygen. The government should believe in proactive and graded response to the pandemic to augment oxygen supply and we are in an extremely comfortable position when it comes to supply of medical oxygen. Various steps need to be taken for infrastructure augmentation, ensuring uninterrupted oxygen supply, monitoring and coordination with state governments and proactive interventions.Ashish BalgudeIn-house O2 generation facility mustThe basic aim behind establishing oxygen generation plants at government hospitals in the district headquarters is to further strengthen the public health system and ensure that each of these hospitals has a captive oxygen generation facility. Such an in-house captive oxygen generation facility would address the day-to-day medical oxygen needs of these hospitals and the district. In addition, the liquid medical oxygen (LMO) would serve as a “top up” to the captive oxygen generation. Such a system will go a long way in ensuring that government hospitals in districts do not face sudden disruption of oxygen supplies and have access to adequate uninterrupted oxygen supply to manage the Covid-19 patients and other patients needing such supportAnita BishtCentre has approved setting up of O2 plantsPrime Minister Narendra Modi has given direction of boosting availability of oxygen to hospitals, the PM CARES Fund has given in-principle approval for allocation of funds for installation of 551 dedicated Pressure Swing Adsorption (PSA) Medical Oxygen Generation Plants inside public health facilities in the country. The availability of Liquid Medical Oxygen has to be increased each day with contributions from private and public steel plants, industries, oxygen manufacturers as well as through prohibition of supply of oxygen for non-essential industries. The state government has to ensure that oxygen supply to various states happen in a smooth, unhindered manner and there is a need to fix responsibility with the local administration in cases of obstruction. We have to also explore various innovative ways to increase production and supply of oxygen. Various measures are being undertaken to rapidly increase the availability of cyrogenic tankers through conversion of nitrogen and argon tankers, import and airlifting of tankers as well as manufacturing them, but setting up oxygen plants is essential all district places.Judicious use of med oxygen vitalThe PM stressed on the need to ensure faster transportation of oxygen to states and it was discussed that railways is being used for rapid and non-stop long distance transport of tankers. The medical community also pointed out about the need for judicious use of oxygen and how an audit in some states has decreased oxygen demand without affecting the condition of patients to be done. Oxygen plants are the answer and judicious use of oxygen is the need of the time.Saleem Hakim||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/your-space-scale-up-medical-oxygen-supplies-101621162208794.html
16-05-2021||Pune||Curtain Call: The story of adapting for stage||I have written a few plays some years back, but I know I am not a writer. But at the same time, I would say that if I had some source material at hand, the process becomes relatively easy for me. Though it’s been a few years since I have written a play, I would like to talk about my personal process of adapting a story into a play. The first play that I adapted and directed was a short story named “Cycle” by a renowned writer in Marathi, Vyankatesh Madgulkar (I am about to narrate the gist of the entire story here, so in case you want to experience the story in its original form first, please refer to his book called “Jaambhlaache Diwas”). “Cycle” is about a school teacher in Pune who has promised a bicycle to his son if he secures the first rank in class. The son keeps securing it for three years and the teacher is still unable to afford it, making him feel extremely guilty. Finally, he buys a used cycle on a whim making his son extremely happy and reliving himself of the guilt. But the teacher finds out that one of his own students has died in a road accident while riding that same cycle and his happiness turns to fear. When he returns home that evening he finds his son absent and the cycle missing. His wife and two daughters are crying at a corner and he fears the worst! They are too afraid and distraught to tell him anything. But seeing his desperation, his wife finally breaks her silence and tells him the truth – their son has lost the cycle and has gone outside to search for it! The son returns home, unsuccessful in his attempt at retrieving it. He looks at his father, waiting for him to explode. But the teacher seems happy instead, leaving the entire family pleasantly confused! The descriptions of the teacher’s state of mind at various places were heart-wrenching. It had transported me to the world of the protagonist and I was so engrossed that by the end of it I felt this gush of warmth in my heart. The minute I heard it, I knew what the scenes were going to be. The overall scene outline wasn’t a challenge. The real challenge was getting the craft of conveying the emotions. During that period of time I was personally not fond of a narrator in a play. I used to find that format of writing extremely escapist. Of course, I do submit that it was my lack of experience back then. The plays which had a narrator who spoke directly with the audience, that I had read or seen by then, did not hold my interest. Since then, I have come across plays that have used that format really well. Anyway, so I had decided not to use this format. Then, the question arose – how to convey the information in the story which is written as the mental turmoil of the teacher? He doesn’t express his emotions to anyone in the story! So, I introduced new characters and new situations that would make the protagonist speak his mind. To give an example, in the first scene itself, when his son tells him that he has secured the first rank, the teacher gives him a chalk as a prize. Even the son accepts it gracefully and leaves. All this is witnessed by a school peon who notices to his surprise that the teacher doesn’t seem too happy about this. When he asks the teacher about it, he reluctantly confesses what his predicament is. It is the peon that encourages the teacher to just go and buy a bicycle and get done with it. This, I believe, is a catalyst for the next scene where he actually purchases it. He finally expresses it to someone and when that person, one who is economically weaker than him, tells him to go for it, really sets the ball rolling. When he learns about his deceased student, the teacher goes through a roller coaster of emotions about how fast youngsters ride their bikes and how can they be so careless and not worry about their parents. For these emotions to come out, we had a new situation wherein, when he is thinking about all this at a bus stop, a school-going kid falls from the cycle in front of him. This triggers the teacher and the emotions flow through words aimed at the student in front of him but the subtext really is different. One thing that I realised involuntarily after adapting this story in a play is that the most important thing is to envision and build the world the story is set in. The craft of writing and staging will follow when that choice is made. This helped me a lot when I adapted two more stories of extremely different genres — “Baapjanma” and “Dalan”. But more about that in the next segment. Nipun Dharmadhikari is a storyteller and looks forward to telling them on stage, in front of the camera or in person.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/curtain-call-the-story-of-adapting-for-stage-101621161967673.html

Bihar has a total of 8,387 gram panchayats spread in the rural areas.Ward level committees have also been told to report entry of outsiders in the villages to block level officers (BDOs) or medical officers while monitoring the health of high risk groups including villagers above 60 years of age, pregnant women, persons having serious ailments and children.The department is also taking daily updates from panchayats on distribution of masks, testing, and awareness about vaccination in the rural areas, where vaccine hesitancy is a serious issue, an official of the department said.“The ward implementation and management committee in each gram panchayat have been given specific roles and responsibilities to ensure the spread of Covid could be lessened in rural areas through fast tracking, isolation and proper medical care to affected persons. We are taking daily updates from all districts and panchayats about the Covid cases,” said additional chief secretary (ACS), panchayati raj department, Amrit Lal Meena.Meena said the ward members have also been assigned the task of house to house visits to track any suspected patients with the help of local administration. “The ward members have been asked to extend all help to families where Covid cases have been detected during the quarantine period and ensure that the affected persons are not neglected or left helpless,” the ACS said.Ward members have also been told to ensure strict compliance to Covid protocols including social distancing, wearing of masks and preventing large gatherings in rural areas.“The assemblage of people in social events in rural areas has come down after lockdown. We are trying to minimise it through coordination with ward members and trying to create awareness. Instructions have been issued that cases be filed against those flouting Covid protocols in villages, said another senior officer in the panchayati raj department, who didn’t wish to be identified.The official claimed several gram panchayats have done good work in the past few weeks by distributing masks, sanitising market places and creating awareness about the need for inoculation among the rural population.For instance, Brahampur Karman gram panchayat in Motipur block in Muzaffarpur has reported 94% mask distribution to listed households and 60% vaccination among residents above 45 years age group.

16-05-2021||Bangalore||Auto driver in Karnataka's Kalaburagi offers free service to Covid-19 patients||With the state of Karnataka emerging as the country's new COVID-19 hotspot, medical services and public health facilities have been stretched thin and people are struggling for access.Rapidly rising cases have resulted in the state government imposing a lockdown, making it harder for many without private vehicles to reach hospitals easily.Amid this turmoil, a young auto-rickshaw driver in Kalaburagi has started a free service for COVID-19 patients who are unable to book ambulances.While speaking to ANI, the driver - Akash Denur, said that he had dreamt of serving the country at the borders in the Army. Since that dream could not be realised, he decided to serve the people on the ground amid the pandemic."Due to the COVID-19 lockdown, there's a dearth of facilities, be it ambulance or autos. That is why I'm giving free services. I have been driving auto for four years. I had a dream to join the Army but it could not be fulfilled. So I am serving the people like this," Denur told ANI.He added, "I have been doing for the last few days. Those who need my services just give me a call, I reach their home and drop them to the hospital. The public is really suffering. This is the least I can do."Over the few two days, Karnataka overtook Maharashtra as the state with the highest number of active coronavirus cases (5,98,625) in the country, the Union Health Ministry informed.So far, 15,10,557 recoveries and 21,085 deaths have been reported in the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/auto-driver-in-karnataka-s-kalaburagi-offers-free-service-to-covid-19-patients-101621136429436.html

16-05-2021||Chandigarh||Punjab CM slams Yogi Adityanath over his Malerkotla tweet||Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh on Saturday slammed Yogi Adityanath over his inflammatory tweet on the declaration of Malerkotla as the 23rd district of Punjab, terming it as an attempt to incite communal hatred in the peaceful state as part of the Bharatiya Janata Party's (BJP) divisive policies.An official press release stated that contrasting the communal harmony in Punjab with the divisiveness being promoted by the Yogi Adiyanath government in Uttar Pradesh, Amarinder Singh asked the former to stay out of his state's affairs, which are in much better shape than those in UP under the divisive and destructive BJP government, which has been actively promoting communal discord in the state for the past over four years."What does he (Yogi Adityanath) know of Punjab's ethos or the history of Malerkotla, whose relationship with Sikhism and its Gurus was known to every Punjabi? And what does he understand of the Indian Constitution, which is being brazenly trampled every day by his own government in UP?" asked the Chief Minister, in a strong reaction to his UP counterpart's tweet, describing Malerkotla's new status as a "sign of the divisive policies of the Congress."Mocking the UP chief minister's comment, Amarinder Singh said that given Yogi Adityanath government's and BJP's track record of spreading communal hate, such a remark was utterly ridiculous, apart from being totally unwarranted and uncalled for. The whole world knows of the communally divisive policies of the BJP, and particularly the Yogi Adityanath government in UP, said the Chief Minister. Pointing to the spate of changes in names of various UP cities, including Mughal Sarai to Pandit Deen Dayal Upadhyay Nagar, Allahabad as Prayagraj, and Faizabad as Ayodhya, he dubbed it an attempt by the Yogi government to rewrite history, which the peace-loving people of India will never condone.Citing media reports, the CM recalled that UP was the first state in the country to approve `love jihad' laws, and Yogi Adiyanath's open hatred for Taj Mahal (which he sees as a legacy of the Mughals) has been the subject matter of criticism in the international press. In fact, the UP chief minister is reportedly the founder of Hindu Yuva Vahini, an organisation that was responsible for starting cow vigilantism, which led to lynching of Muslims in his own state, the Punjab Chief Minister further pointed out.It was obvious that the tweet of the UP government head on Malerkotla was nothing but a provocative gesture aimed at creating conflict among the communities living in perfect harmony in Punjab, said the Chief Minister. He termed it a conspiracy on the part of the BJP to spread disharmony in Punjab ahead of the Assembly elections, which are just months away. "But the UP chief minister seems to have forgotten that his own state is also going to the polls at the same time, and if the recent Panchayat poll results are any indication, the BJP is in for a complete and shocking rout," he quipped.Yogi Adityanath should focus his energies on saving his own state, where the Covid situation is spirally out of control, with bodies of the victims of the pandemic being found dumped in rivers, thus depriving them of even the dignity of a decent cremation/burial, said Amarinder Singh."A chief minister who cannot protect even the basic human rights of his state's people and allows them to be treated with such shocking disrespect has no moral right to continue in office, leave alone comment on the functioning of another state government," declared the Punjab Chief Minister in a press note.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/punjab-cm-slams-yogi-adityanath-over-his-malerkotla-tweet-101621127859305.html

16-05-2021||City||₹1,051 cr given to MCDs to pay staff: Sisodia||The Delhi government has disbursed ₹1,051 crore to the Capital’s three municipal corporations so that they can pay the salaries of employees engaged in Covid-19 management, deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia said on Saturday.The North Delhi Municipal Corporation confirmed the release of the amount but sought clarification if it was a special fund or money already due to them.Addressing a digital press conference on Saturday, Sisodia accused the east, south and north civic bodies of not paying salaries of employees regularly amid the pandemic.“It reflects very poorly on the MCDs if they are unable to even pay salaries to medical staff, doctors and nurses who are putting their lives on the line to save people in these unprecedented times. To cope and emerge from this pandemic, Delhi government has issued assistance of ₹1,051 crore to the three MCDs. The amount can effectively disburse salaries to employees who have not received it until now. The Delhi government hopes that MCDs will guarantee that this assistance is not used for any other activities, not diverted in any way, but used only to pay salaries of MCD employees involved in Covid-19 duty,” he said.Of the ₹1,051 crore, ₹366.9 crore will be given to the East Delhi Municipal Corporation (EDMC), ₹432.8 crore to the North MCD and ₹251.6 crore to the South Delhi Municipal Corporation.“Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal has ensured that despite the scarcity of resources Delhi is facing due to Covid-19, the state government will aid and support all dedicated frontline workers who are on Covid-19 duty, so that they are able to receive their salaries in a streamlined manner. We have to make sure that our frontline workers in the civic corporations are paid their due salaries on time, by any means,” he said.Confirming the release of the amount to the three civic bodies by the Delhi government, north Delhi mayor Jai Prakash, however, said on Saturday that the Delhi government should clarify if the allocated amount was the first-quarter fund due to the city corporations, or a special fund for the salaries of employees.“If it is the grant amount of the first quarter then why was it released after a delay of two months? The first quarter amount is released to all the three corporations in the month of April. I had written several letters to the chief minister to release the amount for the first quarter,” Prakash said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/rs-1-051-cr-given-to-mcds-to-pay-staffsisodia-101621115643506.html
16-05-2021||Delhi||Delhi sets rates for hearse vans for Covid-19 victims||The Delhi government has fixed the rates for booking hearse vans and related services for deceased Covid-19 patients, an order issued by the state disaster management authority on Saturday showed.“The rates of hearse van facility for deceased Covid-19 patients has been fixed at ₹1,300 per trip for initial 10 kilometres and ₹100 per kilometre thereafter. This will include the cost of transportation with a driver and one attendant wearing PPE kits,” stated the order issued by the Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA).The order further stated that the family members of the deceased will have to pay additional ₹700 to avail the “body wrapping” facility as per Covid protocols. “In case the services of an additional person is required by the family of the deceased patients to handle the body/wrapping etc, the charges would be ₹500, which includes charges of safety gear to be worn by the additional person. No extra charge for sanitisation will be charged by the vendor,” it said.Mortuary services for coronavirus patients are provided free of cost in private as well as government facilities, the order said.The order, which comes on the direction of the Delhi high court, is going to give a major relief to people as there were several cases of overcharging.The Delhi Police have arrested at least four hearse van drivers in the city for charging exorbitant amounts to transfer bodies from hospitals to crematoriums and burial grounds, including one who charged ₹14,000 for driving six kilometres from Mukherjee Nagar to Nigambodh Ghat on May 2.A committee, constituted under the chairmanship of the North Delhi Municipal Corporation commissioner, had recommended the rates for hearse/mortuary services to be provided to deceased coronavirus patients, the DDMA order said.Last week, the government also capped rates charged by private ambulance services.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-sets-rates-for-hearse-vans-for-covid-19-victims-101621115379302.html
16-05-2021||Delhi||Govt sets up O2 device banks for patients in home isolation||The Delhi government is setting up oxygen concentrator banks across the city to ensure Covid-19 patients being treated at home get access to oxygen therapy should they need it, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal said on Saturday.Addressing a digital press briefing, Kejriwal said, “It has been often observed that whenever a person gets infected with the virus, their oxygen levels drop suddenly. If they are given oxygen immediately, their health can be prevented from deteriorating further. If they do not get oxygen on time, things then tend to get worse. Therefore, it is imperative that Covid-19 patients get oxygen when they need,” he said.These banks will be set up in each district, Kejriwal added.A senior Delhi government official said each district will have at least 200 oxygen concentrators, to be given to patients on the advice of a doctor.If a Covid-19 patient is not enrolled for Delhi government’s home isolation programme, they may dial 1031 to get themselves enrolled, and avail oxygen concentrators from the bank.However, the district administration’s team of doctors will first ensure whether the person needs an oxygen concentrator or not. After their affirmation, the oxygen concentrator will be delivered to the patients’ home.“If patients under home isolation require oxygen, our team will ensure the concentrator reaches their home within two hours. A technician will also accompany the team and explain how the oxygen concentrator is to be used. Apart from this, several people in recovery too are often advised to take oxygen at home for a few days, and such patients too, can get concentrators from these banks,” Kejriwal said.Delhi government’s doctors will stay in touch with all those who are given oxygen concentrators from these banks.Once the patients recover, the oxygen concentrators will be taken back from them, sanitised, and handed to another patient for use, the government said in a statement.“Organisations such as OLA Foundation and GiveIndia are helping us deliver oxygen concentrators to every house. We are very grateful for their support,” it said.Atul Satija, GiveIndia’s CEO said, “Through this initiative, we will provide oxygen concentrators to those who are in home-isolation or in recovery right at their doorstep. We hope this will give easy access to patients in need and help combat the acute shortage of medical oxygen.”“Infections are reducing in Delhi slowly and steadily, and I hope they diminish completely and do not rise again. However, we are not going to become negligent. On Friday, we prepared 500 additional ICU beds, and 500 similar beds were prepared four days ago. Within 15 days, our doctors, engineers and workers have prepared 1,000 ICU beds,” Kejriwal said.Dr Nikhil Modi, senior consultant, respiratory critical care and sleep medicine, Indraprastha Apollo Hospitals in Delhi, said the establishment of a bank of oxygen concentrators is a good move to ensure supply for everyone.“I feel that this is an important step as many people are getting moderate to severe disease and are not able to get beds on time. A back-up of oxygen can go a long way in stabilising such patients and hence we will save many lives. But, it is a step taken a little late as cases are now settling and most people will now be able to get a bed in hospitals. It was needed a month earlier when people were facing shortage of oxygen,” Dr Modi said.Lockdown likely to be extendedThe Delhi government is also likely to extend the ongoing lockdown in the Capital by a week, said state officials aware of the matter.Kejriwal announced a lockdown on April 19 (after a weekend curfew on April 17 and 18),. The protocol has now been renewed several times and is currently scheduled to be in place till at least 10am on May 17. The order for the likely extension till May 24, will be issued on Sunday, officials said.The crisis stretched the city’s hospitals and triggered a severe shortage of medical oxygen that did not get resolved until at least May 5, when the Capital finally received over 700MT of oxygen stock in a day after a long-drawn battle between the state and the Centre, which also played out in the high court and the Supreme Court.Integrated centre for Covid-19 managementThe Delhi government on Saturday also opened an integrated common command and control centre (ICCC) for Covid-19 management.This centre has been opened at the already existing ICCC of the New Delhi Municipal Council (NDMC) at its headquarters - Palika Kendra, Parliament street.“The Delhi government has started an Integrated Command and Control Centre (ICCC). Data related to hospitals, oxygen, vaccination and other aspects of Covid management are collected, collated and analysed on a real-time basis. It will help us in making informed decisions,” Kejriwal said after launching the centre on Saturday along with deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia and senior government officials.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/govt-sets-up-o2-device-banks-for-patients-in-home-isolation-101621114942611.html
16-05-2021||Delhi||Delhi Covid-19 cases dip to 6,430, CM urges caution||Delhi on Saturday reported 6,430 fresh Covid-19 cases, and the positivity rate dipped to 11.32%, with chief minister Arvind Kejriwal saying that infections were “slowly and steadily” reducing in the national capital, where the health care system was overrun by spiralling cases amid a raging fourth wave of the pandemic.The Capital has been under a lockdown for about four weeks, a “last resort” measure taken by the Delhi government to arrest the alarming spread of the infectious disease, which led to hospitals being overburdened and medical supplies running short. While the current lockdown is supposed to end on May 17, there are indications that it could be extended.There were 337 more deaths due to Covid-19 on Saturday, according to the government’s health bulletin on data from the previous 24 hours.Saturday was the second consecutive day when Delhi recorded fewer than 10,000 cases in recent weeks. On Friday, the Capital recorded 8,506 cases, the lowest since April 10. The city conducted only 56,811 tests, according to Saturday’s bulletin, as compared to almost 70,400 tests conducted on average daily over the last seven days.Earlier in the day, Kejriwal said: “The virus is reducing in Delhi slowly and steadily, and I hope it diminishes completely and does not rise again. However, we are not going to become negligent in anyway.”At the peak of the positivity rate in the fourth wave, more than one in three people in Delhi who got tested were found to have the infection.Experts urged caution over the dip in the cases, saying that Delhi needed to keep its guard up until the burden on the health care system reduced and the positivity rate came under control.Dr Jugal Kishore, head of the department of community medicine at Safdarjung hospital, said: “Delhi has a large floating population, there are children, and there is the threat of new variants so spikes can happen. We need to keep following Covid-19-appropriate behaviour and the government should remain prepared to tackle a surge in cases.”The number of cumulative cases on Saturday stood at 1,387,411. Over 1.2 million patients have recovered from the infection, which began spreading in the country in March last year. Saturday’s cases were the lowest in 38 days since April 7, when the city reported 5,506 new cases.The number of cases of the viral infection spiralled in the city in recent weeks, reaching a high of 28,395 cases reported on April 20.Experts also warned that a third surge in infections could be in children. “If a third wave does come, children would be the most vulnerable as many adults have either had the infection or are being immunised. We need to prepare for management of cases in children; all the treatment protocols and SOPs will have to be made afresh,” said Dr Lalit Kant, former head of the department of epidemiology at the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR).Dr Anupam Sibal, a paediatric liver specialist and group medical director Apollo Hospitals, said: “…If we do have a third wave a few months down the line and a lot of adults are vaccinated, those below the age of 18 years will remain vulnerable and infections in that age group will become more common. So, even if a small percentage of them fall ill and need hospitalisation, given a large number of infections, the numbers will be significant. So, it stands to reason that we plan ahead.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-covid-19-cases-dip-to-6-430-cm-urges-caution-101621114437285.html

The money will deduce from the J&K Relief Fund.For the past many months, people associated with the tourism sector, which is one of the biggest trades in Kashmir, have been demanding a relief package, especially for those who make meagre earnings. Even big hoteliers and trade and travel agents have suffered heavy losses.As per the government notification, issued by deputy director, budget finance, the relief of ₹2,000 will be transferred to 4,444 shikarawalas, 1,370 tourist guides, 6,663 ponywalas, 2,150 dandiwalas/sledgewalas/palkiwalas for two months.“The relief will be transferred to only who are registered with the tourism department,” said an official.“The package doesn’t have anything for travel agents, house boats adventure sports operators, tourist transport operators and hotels as well. This package should have an amnesty for power and water bill related to tourism infrastructure,” said Dr Umar Nazir Tibet Baqal, member, TAAK travel agents association of Kashmir, and coordinator, IATA forum, Kashmir International Air Traffic Association.President KCCI, Shiekh Ashiq said that announcement of relief package is welcome but all the people who are daily earners in all sectors should be part of this package be it transport, vendors, small time shopkeepers, artisans and weavers registered with handicrafts department. “We hope the Lt Governor will increase the amount of financial assistance and free ration to all people who are below poverty line also,” he said.Tourism in Kashmir had a good beginning with the start of New Year but as the second wave of Covid-19 wracked havoc across the country, the tourist inflow suddenly started to dry up and most of the advance bookings got cancelled.According to people associated with trade, winter was very good but it now they are back to square one. With the start of summer in April many tourists from states like Gujarat and Maharashtra visited the Valley. The tourism had nosedived in Kashmir since August 5, 2019 when the special status of the erstwhile state was revoked and restrictions imposed on movement of people and communication shut for months. The situation was then further aggravated by the Covid-19 lockdown after mid-March 2020.“This year we were expecting a bumper tourism season which would break all past records. From December onwards I think more than 1.5 lakh tourists have visited the valley already. Unfortunately the second wave hit the region and the season is gone,” said officer bearer of a tour and trade association Kashmir.“The cancellation of bookings have affected all including Shikara wala, houseboat owner, hotelier, dhaba wala or even a Kashmir art dealer,” he said.Despite the surging Covid-19 numbers in Kashmir, the government had opened Tulip Garden on the banks of Dal Lake from March 25 which saw a huge inflow of tourists both locals and domestic travellers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/jk-announces-rs-2-94-crore-relief-package-for-tourism-sector-101621111265208.html

Health department organised a Covid-19 testing camp at Hemrajpur village, 10 km from the district headquarters, on Friday and only five people turned up. The village has two panchayats and a population of over 2,200. This happened despite personal requests by both the sarpanches and announcements from the gurdwara loudspeaker. Among the five people who got tested included the two sarpanches. According to the health department officials, the situation is similar in other villages of the district. “The camp was organised on the direction of Gurdaspur sub-divisional magistrate (SDM). Only three people turned up for testing,” said Kuldeep Singh, one of the two sarpanches of the village. Describing the reason behind the hesitancy among the villagers, Kuldeep said, “There is a misconception that if anyone is found to be positive, he or she will be shifted to hospital. Many of them believe the misguided propaganda on social media. It is despite our assurance that a separate hall has been spared in the village for treatment of the Covid-19 patients.” He said so far no one has died in his village due to the coronavirus. Gurdaspur civil surgeon Harbhajan Raj said, “It’s the same story everywhere. Our teams have been visiting various villages, but people are not showing up for the test.

16-05-2021||Chandigarh||Punjab and Haryana HC Bar withdraws resolution on boycott of CJ court||The Punjab and Haryana High Court Bar Association (PHHCBA) has withdrawn its May 7 resolution boycotting chief justice RS Jha’s court.In a statement on Saturday, the Bar body said that differences have been “ironed out” in a meeting between the chief justice (CJ) and Bar body members. The Bar association has also withdrawn its appeal from Bar Council of India (BCI) against the Bar Council of Punjab and Haryana’s (BCPH) decision to stay the resolution on the boycott, the Bar body said.It was on Friday last that PHHCBA had decided to boycott hearings before the chief justice and sought his transfer, a decision stayed by BCPH, a statutory body, within hours. Subsequently, PHHCBA had also moved BCI against the Bar Council decision, but got no relief. The BCI had said that it was not the “right time” for any agitation and more than livelihood the issue at hand is of safety.HC Bar had passed a resolution announcing boycott claiming that even urgent nature cases were not being taken up by the high court and accused the chief justice of non-cooperation. Their main contention was that out of 46 courts only 11 are functioning and cases were being listed with prior permission from the bench — called mentioning, due to which only a handful of cases are being listed. Subsequently, the high court administration had also allowed direct listing of petitions in some categories of cases. In February too, the Bar association had decided to boycott his court.Restore Nanda’s membership, says BCIIn another development, the BCI has asked the Bar association to restore the membership of Punjab advocate general Atul Nanda observing that “(he) has always played an exemplary and appreciable role”. His membership was revoked by the Bar association in a resolution in February for allegedly working against the interests of the lawyers. The decision was later stayed by the state Bar council.The BCI said that differences and dissatisfaction are bound to occur in every institution, but the matter should be reported to the state Bar council concerned, which will pitch in to resolve the matter. The February resolution of HC Bar had “no leg to stand on”, said the BCI adding, “The Bar association should desist from taking such reckless and irresponsible decisions.”The PHHCBA is a body of lawyers with around 4,000 members, who mainly practice in the high court. BCPH is a statutory body with over one lakh members in both the states and Chandigarh. The council regulates entry of lawyers into the legal profession including those practising in the high court.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/punjab-and-haryana-hc-bar-withdraws-resolution-on-boycott-of-cj-court-101621108513118.html

There are conflicting versions on whether or not the girl was infected with Covid as the family says the hospital told them that she was positive while the administration claims otherwise. Eleven-year-old Sonu died at Government Medical College, Amritsar, on May 9 and the video that appeared on Saturday is of May 10. Dalip Kumar, a migrant labourer from Odisha who lives in Ramnagar area of Jalandhar, told the media that his daughter developed fever around two months ago. Initially, he took her to a quack and when her condition didn’t improve, Dalip took her to Jalandhar civil hospital, from where she was referred to GMC, Amritsar. Dalip said they returned to Jalandhar from Amritsar on May 9 night and were verbally informed by the Amritsar hospital staff that Sonu was positive for coronavirus. On May 10, when Dalip informed his neighbours about the death of his daughter and sought help for her cremation, they refused to give a shoulder to the body up to the crematorium. Dalip then carried the body up to the crematorium on his shoulder, his son walking beside. Dalip said his neighbours did reach the crematorium but kept a distance throughout. Deputy commissioner Ghanshyam Thori said as per the inquiry conducted by the sub-divisional magistrate, the cause of the girl’s death was not Covid-19 as she was tested negative for the virus. “The girl was admitted to Jalandhar civil hospital from where she was referred to GMC Amritsar. An ambulance dropped the patient at Amritsar. After her death, an ambulance dropped the body at Jalandhar,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/man-carries-11-year-old-daughter-s-body-for-cremation-video-goes-viral-101621108510778.html

This drive was supposed to kick off on May 1, but an acute vaccine shortage resulted in the delay.“When I went to Nabha civil hospital to get my 69-year-old mother vaccinated, the medical staff told me they had run out of vaccines and that I should check for jab availability at the outreach camp at Government Ripudaman College,” said Chamkaur Singh, a local resident.However, when he reached the college, he was told that the vaccine was only available for the 18-44 age group.Another beneficiary Manpreet Singh said his parents had to return without jabs as the health staff asked them to come in mid-June, stating that the government was currently prioritising those below 45 years of age.Patiala civil surgeon Dr Satinder Singh said they were conducting fewer vaccination drives as they were receiving very limited stock of doses.“As many as 7,052 people were vaccinated on Saturday as the department received 5,600 doses under the state pool on Friday. Around 3,000 doses were received on Saturday, which will be divided among sub-divisional hospitals to carry the jab drives on Sunday,” said Dr Singh.He added that the outreach vaccination camps have been closed temporarily due to the shortage of vaccines.“Due to this, we have stopped giving jabs to people above 44 years of age and are concentrating on the priority group under the third phase of vaccination drive,” said the civil surgeon.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/45-group-left-in-lurch-as-patiala-stops-vaccine-drive-amid-jab-crunch-101621108446007.html

16-05-2021||Chandigarh||VB detects ‘shady deals’ involving Navjot Sidhu, wife, aides||At a time when former Punjab local bodies minister Navjot Singh Sidhu has been strenuously slamming chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh on a variety of issues, the Punjab Vigilance and Anti-Corruption Bureau has fast-tracked its investigation into some ‘shady deals’ involving the Sidhu couple and their close associates. The agency comes under the direct control of the chief minister.The focus of the vigilance bureau (VB) is on some controversial decisions taken during the tenure of Sidhu as local bodies minister when Sidhu’s wife and former MLA Navjot Kaur, Sidhu’s close friend and his OSD Bunny Sandhu, Navjot Kaur’s personal assistant Gaurav Vasudeva and clerk Rajiv Kumar allegedly colluded to favour certain firms. Even as these leads are not new with the VB as the agency was already zeroing in on them ever since Sidhu resigned from the Amarinder cabinet on July 14, 2019, after he was stripped off the local bodies portfolio and allotted power department. However, the agency learnt to have given a fresh push to probe the cases. The timing of the VB probe is being questioned as Sidhu is hitting out at the chief minister almost daily through social media on different issues. At least seven ministers from Amarinder cabinet have already sought action against Sidhu for his outbursts. As per officials privy to the probe, earlier the focus of the probe was limited to certain “deals” done during Sidhu’s tenure as minister in Zirakpur and Nayagaon, but now more instances have been identified where financial favours were allegedly given by the Sidhus to their near and dear ones. On Saturday, Amritsar SSP (VB) Parampal Singh met his superiors in Chandigarh and submitted a detailed report on some “murky deals”. The SSP during his probe had found more than five shady deals, a senior VB official involved in the probe said. The findings involve allotment of a booth for peanuts to Navjit Kaur (wife of Navjot Kaur’s PA Gaurav Vasudeva), discrepancies in allotment of advertisement tenders to a company owned by Vasudeva and flooring tender given again to yet another firm owned by Vasudeva. ‘Navjot Kaur paid ₹1 cr to Zirakpur’s realtor’ According to findings of the bureau accessed by Hindustan Times, the VB probe has established Navjot Kaur paid ₹1 crore to a Zirakpur-based realtor Gagandeep Singh alias Prince. Two payments were made to Prince by her through two SBI cheques for ₹50 lakh each on March 12, 2019, one cheque in Gagandeep’s name and another in his company’s, found the VB probe. “Prince has told the VB that Navjot Kaur wanted to buy a house and payments were made in advance. However, no such written document about the purchase or any booking was found during the probe. It appears that the sum was collected to float a company,” a top VB functionary said. “Gagandeep, in connivance with Vasudeva and Rajiv Kumar (a clerk in health department who is an associate of Navjot Kaur since her tenure as parliamentary secretary), got approved the site plan without depositing the required fee and plan,” the probe found. The probe found that they got G-8 receipts through Zirakpur executive officer Manbir Singh Gill by submitting cheques, which were never sent to the bank for collection and the site plan was approved. The VB probe in this case found that ₹4 crore was pending against Gagandeep’s firm, still he was given all clearances. “Gagandeep in his statement to VB has said that he used to pay Rajiv Kumar ₹25,000 for approval to each residential plan and ₹50,000 for each commercial plan. Kumar collected ₹3,42,500 from Gagandeep,” the probe found. The VB officials claim when Sidhu was the minister, Navjot Kaur had visited Gagandeep’s office in Zirakpur where the latter had also called senior officials to show his proximity to her. The VB has also done analysis of call details and found 100 calls made by Rajiv Kumar to various Zirakpur MC officials, Gagandeep, Bunny and Vasudeva and Navjot Kaur during the period when these files were approved. ‘Bunny managed mega projects as OSD to Sidhu’ The VB probe claims that Bunny Sandhu allegedly was instrumental in getting CLU files cleared after striking deals with the contractors and builders. “In one such case, Punjab and Haryana High Court had passed an order that the areas of the Nada and Karoran villages be included in the MC limit of Nayagaon. The Nayagaon MC challenged the decision in the Supreme Court and the high court decision was stayed. Bunny influenced then Nayagaon MC executive officer to get a resolution passed in the House to withdraw the petition from the Supreme Court,” claims the VB. The agency claims Bunny was active on behalf of the minister in connivance with WWICS director Davinder Singh Sandhu for developing a big chunk of land in Nadda and Karoran villages. Since the VB hasn’t registered any FIR even after claiming such gross irregularities, the conduct of the agency is under cloud. Navjot Sidhu, his wife and Bunny couldn’t be contacted for a comment despite repeated attempts. Navjot Kaur did not reply to text messages either. After reports about the probe, Sidhu tagged chief minister a tweet, saying: ‘Most Welcome…Please do your best @Captain_Amarinder’.“If Sidhus have done wrong why state government waited for two years. I am amazed to see that the vigilance has not carried a single probe into sand, transport and other deals done during Badals’ rule but is so quick on Sidhus,” said Jalandhar Cantt Congress MLA Pargat Singh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/vb-detects-shady-deals-involving-navjot-sidhu-wife-aides-101621108266215.html

We will observe it as black day,” Rajewal said.The government has not heard the farmers demands to repeal the three farm laws and “with increasing prices of fertilisers, diesel and petrol, the farming business is not possible”, the farmer leader said. Hundreds of farmers have been camping at Delhi’s borders since November 2020 demanding that the Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, Farmers’ (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020 and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020 be rolled back and a new law made to guarantee minimum support price for crops.However, the government, which has held multiple rounds of formal dialogue with the protestors, has maintained that the laws are pro-farmer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/farmers-union-to-observe-may-26-as-black-day-marking-6-months-of-protest-101621108204957.html

A major part of the process has been completed amid lockdown.The cooperative sugar mill was set up in Faridkot in 1988 over nearly 50 acres. A total 135 acres were acquired for the mill, and farmers of Faridkot, Moga, Ferozepur and Muktsar districts used to bring sugarcane to the facility. After it turned into a loss-making unit, the mill was closed in 2006.On June 11, 2014, the state cabinet headed by the then chief minister Parkash Singh Badal had put its stamp on the closure of the sugar mill. A contract was granted to a Ferozepur-based company cutting 2,057 trees.Bikramjit Singh Shergill, additional chief administrator, Bathinda Development Authority (BDA), said the land of sugar mill at Faridkot has been transferred to PUDA under the state government policy of optimum utilisation of the lands. “This area will be developed accordingly once we get the possession. The clearing of the land is being done by the department of cooperation after taking all the necessary approvals,” he added. Bhogpur sugar mill general manager Arun Kumar Arora said: “The department of cooperation has started the work of clearing the land after which it will be handed over to PUDA and all the machinery of Faridkot sugar mill will be shifted to Bhogpur. We have taken all the necessary approvals from forest department for the cutting of trees,” he added.AAP MLA from Kotkapura Kultar Singh Sandhwan along with supporters reached the spot and protested against the axing of the trees. He said that the government had sold trees for just ₹67 lakh. “This naturally developed mini-jungle is home to many species, including peacock, so this process must be stopped. At these desperate times, the state government is destroying natural source of oxygen. We will start an agitation if cutting of tree did not stop by the government,” he said. After strong protest by residents and leaders of political parties, deputy commissioner Vimal Kumar Setia ordered to stop the cutting of trees. “I have directed the police to investigate the matter and stop the cutting of trees for now. I have called meeting of the officials concerned to probe the matter,” he added.Members of a non-governmental organisation, Naroa Punjab Manch, have written to National Green Tribunal and Chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh demanding to stop cutting of fully grown trees.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/pudas-housing-project-over-1-000-trees-axed-in-faridkot-residents-fume-101621107965128.html
16-05-2021||Chandigarh||Former Akal Takht jathedar Giani Joginder Singh Vedanti dead||Former Akal Takht jathedar Giani Joginder Singh Vedanti died of a heat attack in Amritsar on Saturday night. He was 80. According to a spokesperson of the Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC), Vedanti was admitted to Guru Ram Das Hospital in Amritsar at around 8pm where he breathed his last. Vedanti, who served as jathedar of the highest temporal seat of Sikhs from 2000 to 2008, was well-versed in Gurbani grammar. He also served for a long time as the head granthi of the Golden Temple. During his tenure Vedanti had taken several landmark decisions. In 2003, the former jathedar had approved the Nanakshahi calendar, prepared by Canada-based Sikh scholar Pal Singh Purewal. He had also declared Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale a martyr 19 years after Operation Bluestar. He was also the first jathedar who declared to commemorate the death anniversaries of the Sikh militants. Soon after becoming the jathedar, Vedanti had revoked the decision of his predecessor Giani Pooran Singh to excommunicate Jagir Kaur (the then president of the SGPC). He also remained in the thick of controversy over his reported tough stand against the Dera Sacha Sauda, offering support to militants and his opposition to political interference in the SGPC affairs. Citing “political pressure” and “bad health”, Vedanti had quit his post in August 2008. Later, he himself made it public that he was ousted forcibly when he inadvertently praised former Prime Minister Dr Manmohan Singh. In her condolence message, SGPC chief Jagir Kaur said Vedanti was a great leader of the Panth.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/former-akal-takht-jathedar-giani-joginder-singh-vedanti-dead-101621107905026.html

16-05-2021||Chandigarh||Amarinder slams Yogi’s ‘inflammatory’ tweet over making Malerkotla as dist||Punjab chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh on Saturday slammed his Uttar Pradesh counterpart Yogi Adityanath over his “inflammatory” tweet on the declaration of Malerkotla as the 23rd district of Punjab, terming it an attempt to incite communal hatred in the peaceful state as a part of the BJP’s divisive policies.In a Tweet in Hindi on Saturday, Adityanath said: “Any differentiation in the name of any religion or creed is opposed to the basic principles of the Constitution. At this time, formation of Malerkotla (as a district) is an example of divisive policy of the Congress.”The UP chief minister’s tweet came a day after Amarinder announced the only Muslim majority town in Punjab to be the state’s 23rd district on the occasion of Eid.Contrasting the communal harmony in Punjab with the “divisiveness” being promoted by the Yogi Adityanath government in Uttar Pradesh, Amarinnder asked the former to stay out of his state’s affairs as they are in much better shape than those in UP. “What does he (Yogi Adityanath) know of Punjab’s ethos or the history of Malerkotla, whose relationship with Sikhism and its Gurus was known to every Punjabi? And what does he understand of the Constitution, which is being brazenly trampled every day by his own government in UP?” asked Amarinder. Mocking the UP chief minister’s comment, Amarinder said given the Yogi Adityanath government and the BJP’s track record of spreading “communal hate”, such a remark was utterly ridiculous, apart from being totally unwarranted and uncalled for. The whole world knows of the communally divisive policies of the BJP, and particularly the Yogi Adityanath government in UP, said Amarinder.Pointing to the “spate of changes in names” of various UP cities, including Mughal Sarai to Pandit Deen Dayal Upadhyay Nagar, Allahabad as Prayagraj and Faizabad as Ayodhya, he dubbed it an “attempt by the Yogi government to rewrite history”, which the peace-loving people of India will never condone.Citing media reports, Amarinder recalled that UP was the first state in the country to approve “love jihad” laws, and Yogi Adityanath’s open hatred for Taj Mahal (which he sees as a legacy of the Mughals) has been the subject matter of criticism in international press.In fact, the UP chief minister is reportedly the founder of Hindu Yuva Vahini, an organisation that was responsible for starting cow vigilantism, which led to lynching of Muslims in his own state, the Punjab CM said. Meanwhile, Sangrur BJP chief Randeep Deol also opposed carving out of Malerkotla district out of Sangrur. “With this announcement, the government has made Sangrur a small district. This is against Constitution. India is a secular country and to divide the society for political benefit is not right,” said Deol.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/amarinder-slams-yogi-s-inflammatory-tweet-over-making-malerkotla-as-dist-101621107606388.html

The move comes after the new vaccination policy of the central government, which came into effect on May 1, allowing states and the private hospitals to directly procure 50% of India-made vaccines from the makers. According to the Punjab health department, at least eight private hospitals across the state have already approached manufacturers, including the Serum Institute of India and Bharat Biotech, to place purchase orders for Covishield and Covaxin vaccines.At present, only two private hospitals chains in Punjab — Max Super Specialty Hospital, and Fortis Hospital, both in Mohali — have procured vaccines and are administering it to beneficiaries, including people in the age group of 18-44 years, who are yet to get jabs at government facilities. Though the government has started vaccination in this age group, it is initially administering doses to kin of industrial and health workers. Of the 30 lakh Covishield vaccines ordered by the Punjab government for the 18-44 age group, the state has so far received only 1 lakh doses.“Many private hospitals in Punjab have shown their interest in joining the government in the inoculation drive. Eight private hospitals have already started talks with the vaccine manufacturers and they will soon place the order. Due to vaccine shortage, private hospitals may get the vaccine stock a bit late,” said Dr Rajesh Bhaskar, state nodal officer for Covid-19, adding that due to non-availability of vaccine in private hospitals, the state’s vaccination drive has been hampered amid the second wave of pandemic.Dr Bhaskar further said: “Though the vaccine in private hospitals is paid as compared to free inoculation in government centres, people are coming forward to avail the facility. In the past week, private hospitals (Max hospital and Fortis hospital) have administered the first dose to 4,512 beneficiaries and second dose to 371 beneficiaries and the numbers will improve with more private hospitals joining the drive.” Punjab chief secretary Vini Mahajan has also urged people to book vaccination appointments at the two private hospitals. “Max and Fortis hospitals have procured vaccines and have begun vaccinating 18-44 age group beneficiaries. Max is charging ₹900 for Covishield and Fortis ₹1,250 for Covaxin (per dose). Please register on CoWin Portal to book a slot at these hospitals,” she tweeted.“Since the manufacturers are unable to supply vaccines demanded by the state governments in large quantities, not many private hospitals are trying to procure the stock. The eight private hospitals, which are trying to buy vaccines, have not got any confirmation from the companies yet. Also, placing a purchase order requires a huge investment and not many people will agree to take a single dose at such a high price. More private hospitals will make efforts to procure vaccines once easily available,” said the director of an Amritsar-based private hospital.“Some 15 private hospitals are willing to join the drive but due to vaccine shortage, not many of them tried to place orders as of now. Our association is also trying to buy vaccines to join the government’s efforts in containing the Covid-19 spread,” said president, Indian Medical Association, Punjab, Dr KD Singh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/vaccine-shortage-punjab-s-pvt-hospitals-in-talks-with-makers-to-procure-doses-101621107425392.html

Multiple internal and external injuries on her body also revealed that she was beaten up and tortured. Continuing their probe on Saturday, police questioned the family’s domestic help, who revealed that Aarti and her husband, Harmesh Arora, 50, had strained relations and for the past few days, arguments had become common at their Atam Nagar house in Model Town.Aarti’s brother Rajan Kundra, who had contacted the police after her neighbour saw her family dragging her body into a car, had stated in his complaint that his sister was being mistreated by her husband, son, daughter and daughter-in-law. His brother-in-law had been beating her up and also not allowed her any food for two days. Kundra had met his sister on May 13 and asked her to accompany him for her safety, but she had told him to pick her up the next day so she could pack her luggage. But, before he could return to his sister, she was murdered, he alleged.After Aarti’s neighbours alerted him, he had also asked his two male cousins to rush to her house, while he drove to the hospital. At the house, his cousins found that Harmesh had fled and his son, daughter and daughter-in-law had taken Aarti to hospital, claiming she had attempted suicide by hanging. She was declared brought dead there.“Harmesh has been apprehended, while his son Lovish Arora, 26, daughter Ritika Arora, 20, and daughter-in-law Saina, alias Lovisha Arora, are at large. They are all facing a case of murder and will be nabbed soon,” said inspector Inderjt Singh, station house officer (SHO), Model Town police station, adding that they will get a detailed autopsy report of the victim on Monday.All for property?Aarti was the whole-time director of the family’s factory, Arora Alloys, located in Phase 7, Focal Point, according to her brother Rajat Kundra, who lives in Ludhiana at Karnail Singh Nagar.In his police complaint, Kundra had shared that Aarti’s husband Harmesh was the factory’s managing director, while their elder son, Parmesh Arora, who is settled abroad, is the director.Aarti also ran a boutique, Aarti Embellishments, in Atam Nagar.

Fadnavis said that the pandemic situation in Maharashtra is the worst and that her party should not indulge in politics or create a negative atmosphere and must instead play the role of a constructive Opposition in the Centre, like his Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is doing in the state. The four-page letter by Fadnavis comes following Gandhi’s suggestions to Prime Minister (PM) Narendra Modi over the handling of the second wave of Covid-19 in the country. Fadnavis said that though questions have been raised on the Central government’s handling of the outbreak, one cannot ignore the situation in Maharashtra either. “As on May 13 (Thursday), of the total cases in the country, 22% came from Maharashtra. The state still contributes to nearly 31% of the fatalities in the country. If we talk about the active cases in the country, 14% are from Maharashtra… you would agree that if the situation in Maharashtra improves faster, then the load on the nation’s machinery would reduce,” Fadnavis wrote. The former chief minister further said that though Maharashtra is not ruled by BJP, the Centre has stood with the state and provided it with the maximum help in terms relief and other equipment. Fadnavis also alleged that the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government has reduced testing in Mumbai, even as rapid antigen tests form a considerable chunk of the total tests conducted. “The deaths due to Covid-19 are hidden. While other districts in the state account to 0.8% of deaths in the ‘deaths due to other reason’ category, Mumbai has 40% deaths... In 2020, 9,603 deaths had been hidden,” Fadnavis alleged. He added, “MVA government has left the fate of the backward regions such as Marathwada, Vidarbha and north Maharashtra to God. No help is being rendered here. In rural areas, neither beds nor treatment are available in hospitals. People have to struggle for Remdesivir and oxygen.” Responding to the allegations, Maharashtra Congress president Nana Patole in a statement said that the letter is an attempt to deviate attention from the failure of the Centre. Patole added that Fadnavis should show the “courage to write a letter to Modi, who has turned the country into a cremation ground”. On Fadnavis’s allegation on Mumbai, Patole said that the Centre and the Niti Aayog have praised the ‘Mumbai model’. He asked if the Centre and Niti Aayog are lying. State Congress spokesperson Sachin Sawant said, “This party [BJP] cannot think beyond political opportunism and power, and is completely unconcerned about the plight of people.” “The party of superspreaders, including PM and HM (home minister) are blaming every other person for the crisis that their government failed to handle,” he added, referring to the campaigning for Assembly elections in West Bengal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/cant-ignore-covid-19-situation-in-maharashtra-fadnavis-write-to-sonia-gandhi-101621106824412.html

Earlier this week, Raut – who heads the ST cell of the Congress – met chief minister (CM) Uddhav Thackeray to express his objections over the scrapping of the promotions. On Friday, Raut warned of a state-wide agitation to put pressure on the government to withdraw the decision. Raut could also have the backing of two of his cabinet colleagues from Congress, tribal development minister KC Padvi and education minister Varsha Gaikwad, over the issue. The state had on May 7 issued a government resolution (GR) scrapping the promotions—a decision that could lead to tension in the wake of the Supreme Court’s judgment to scrap the Maratha reservation in education and government jobs. Though it is being alleged by community members that the decision to scrap the promotion was a move to pacify the Maratha community, state government officials said it was based on a decision by the Bombay high court. Meanwhile, Bharatiya Janata Party-backed legislator and Shiv Sangram party leader Vinayak Mete on Saturday announced that a section of the Maratha community will hold an agitation in Beed on June 5. His outfit had planned an agitation against the government’s alleged failure to secure the Maratha quota in the Supreme Court on May 16, but had to postpone it after the state extended the lockdown restrictions to contain Covid-19 till June 1. Mete claimed that the extension was the state government’s tactic to curb the protests by the community. He claimed that his outfit will stage the agitation even if the government extends lockdown beyond June 1.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/rollback-of-33-quota-in-promotions-could-lead-to-stir-maharashtra-minister-101621106704363.html

The committee is expected to submit its recommendations in a week because in this Covid-19 situation conducting the physical examination is a difficult task, an official said.The vice-chancellors in the committee are prof Alok Kumar Rai, vice-chancellor of Lucknow University, prof Vinay Kumar Pathak, vice-chancellor of Chhatrapati Sahuji Maharaj University, Kanpur and prof Krishna Pal Singh, vice-chancellor of Jyotiba Phule Rohilkhand University in Bareilly, according to a letter issued by Abdul Samad, special secretary, UP government.“It is a critical situation. Last year students were promoted without exams under special circumstances. This year the situation is even worse. We had to work out a solution,” said Prof Vinay Kumar Pathak.Lucknow University vice-chancellor prof Alok Rai had already sent a letter to the government to allow to promote students without examinations. He said, “The three-member committee will discuss and try to reach out at a consensus on how to promote students.”University Grants Commission had recently stated that it had requested the universities to keep the offline examinations in abeyance during May 2021. The UGC in the notice released on May 6, had requested the higher education institutions to keep the offline examinations in abeyance during May 2021 to avoid physical gathering at the campuses and also to provide much-needed relief to the students, faculty, and the staff who are presently occupied in fighting Covid-19 in one way or the other.Last year also the state government had formed a panel headed by Chaudhary Charan Singh University (Meerut) vice-chancellor prof NK Taneja to recommend promoting students to the next semester without exams.After a committee of four vice-chancellors recommended the cancellation of annual examinations in universities across the state given a spike in Covid-19 cases in Uttar Pradesh, deputy chief minister Dinesh Sharma said a final decision on the issue will be taken by the state government.Finally, in July it was decided that in Uttar Pradesh Universities, the students of final year or final semester for undergraduate and postgraduate courses were asked to appear in the final examinations, while the first and second-year students of undergraduate level and first-year students of postgraduate level were promoted to next class without exams, on basis of internal assessments as per the UGC guidelines.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/up-govt-forms-3-member-panel-of-vc-s-for-recommendation-for-promoting-students-without-exam-101621106584360.html

The bodies were buried at less than two-to-three-foot depth. This has heightened the fear that these corpses would be washed away once the river rises. A unit of the State Disaster Response Force (SDRF), one platoon of Provincial Armed Constabulary (PAC) and jawans from river police would patrol the rivers on boats in these districts. Kanpur police commissioner Aseem Arun said the arrangement would be made in several districts. In Kanpur, a team would ensure that bodies were not immersed or buried along the river, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/iitk-to-study-impact-of-immersion-of-bodies-101621106524358.html

Acting on separate petitions filed by the accused – Dr Bhakti Mehare and Dr Ankita Khandelwal – the division bench of justice KK Tated and justice NR Borkar restrained MMC from proceeding ahead with the inquiry till June 11, when their petitions will come up for further hearing. Dr Mehare and Dr Khandelwal moved HC challenging the inquiry initiated by MMC against them last November on the basis of a complaint lodged by Dr Tadvi’s mother Zubeda. They contended that the MMC has initiated the inquiry on the same set of charges for which they are facing prosecution. They claimed that if they are forced to disclose their defence in the inquiry, their defence in the criminal cases will be prejudiced, and therefore urged HC to stay the disciplinary proceedings till the conclusion of their trials. HC found force in the submissions and temporarily stayed the inquiry observing, “Bare reading of the notice of charges dated 04.11.2020 prima facie shows that the respondents started departmental inquiry against the petitioner on the basis of the criminal case.” Dr Tadvi, a second-year postgraduate student of Topiwala National Medical College – which is attached to the state-run KEM Hospital – died by suicide on May 22, 2019, inside her hostel room in the hospital premises. She had left behind a suicide note, blaming her three seniors – Dr Mehare, Dr Khandelwal and Dr Hema Ahuja – for compelling her to take the drastic step by harassing her over her caste and the fact that she had secured admission for the post-graduate course through quota earmarked for her category. A week after the death, the police arrested all the three doctors on charges of making casteist slurs and driving Dr Tadvi to end her life. The trio were booked under sections 306 (abetment to suicide) and 201 (destruction of evidence) of the Indian Penal Code and section 3(2) (v) of the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act. The trio were released on bail by HC on August 9, 2019.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/dr-payal-tadvi-suicide-hc-stays-maharashtra-medical-council-s-inquiry-against-2-accused-101621106524898.html

The victims have been identified as Milind Parche, 12, and his grandmother Savitri, 60, who lived on the first floor; Haresh Dotwal, 43, his wife Sandhya, 40, and daughter Aishwarya, 23, who lived in a single terrace flat above the fourth floor. The incident took place around 1.30pm when the ceiling of fourth floor fell on the floors below. As per UMC, eight families lived in the building at the time of the incident, with the ground floor housing shops. As soon as the portion collapsed, residents rushed out of the structure. “I lived with my wife on the fourth floor. I was watching TV when I heard loud noises thrice one after another. My wife and I rushed out of the building through the staircase, which is behind the structure,” said a resident, Devidas Bachwani, 61. A team of Ulhasnagar Municipal Corporation’s (UMC) fire brigade with three fire tenders reached the spot and initiated the rescue operations to pull out those trapped inside the building. Around 10 people were evacuated from the building. The team managed to evacuate some of the residents after breaking the grilles of their windows. “A portion of the roof of the hall on the fourth floor collapsed. Our fire brigade team managed to rescue 10 persons, out of which two are admitted to Central Hospital with minor injuries, while others were released after treatment,” said UMC commissioner Raja Dayanidhi. Meanwhile, the rescue operations for the five people trapped inside the debris was initiated by the Thane disaster response force (TDRF) around 5.15pm. Thirty minutes later, Milind was pulled out from the debris. A team of National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) also reached the spot around 6.40 pm and joined the rescue operations. The other four victims were also pulled out from the debris. They were rushed to Central Hospital, where they were declared dead. The rescue operations were called off around 10 pm after the last body was removed from the debris. NDRF’s deputy commandant Ashish Kumar said, “As the slabs on the centre of the building had collapsed, we had to be very careful during the rescue operation, as we still had to find one body that was missing. The remaining portions of the slabs were hanging due to which we had to do the work slowly.” According to UMC records, the building was constructed in 1994 (27 years old) and is not in the list of dangerous structures. However, Ganesh Shimpi, assistant commissioner ward committee 1, UMC, said, “The terrace flat which the building had above the fourth floor is illegal. We will inquire on this angle and take necessary action.” Bachwani claimed that he had been complaining about the dilapidated state of the building to UMC and the local police since the past three years. “A year ago, my son and his wife left the house saying they didn’t want to live in danger. I have been complaining about the state of the building since three years but nobody cared about it. A year ago, the building had developed cracks on the backside. People have now died due to negligence,” said Bachwani. In August 2013, a structure, Mahak Apartments collapsed, leaving around 200 homeless. As residents took to protests, the state government asked the civic body chief to regularise illegal structures and redevelop the dangerous ones. Though UMC had begun the process, it has now come to a standstill. “The civic body has already started serving notices to dangerous buildings. The owners are asked to conduct structural audits. From June, the civic body will be taking action against those buildings that are in the dangerous structures’ list,” added Dayanidhi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/five-killed-10-injured-after-slab-of-building-collapses-at-thane-district-s-ulhasnagar-101621106464409.html

Till the last week, one could easily find this injection in most of the prominent drug stores in Lucknow, but on Saturday, Liposomal Amphotericin B injection was not available even in a single drug store across the city. It was out of stock even in the government drug store operating from the chief medical officer’s (CMO) office. “Our CMO store does not have this injection,” said Dr Anup Srivastava, nodal office, CMO drug store. The doctors say that the Black Fungus infection (Mucormycosis) could be life-threatening if not treated timely. After the recent crisis of Remdesivir injection in Lucknow and the rest of the state, the shortage of Liposomal Amphotericin B injection is a new challenge before the state government. The Pharma industry is also grappling to tackle this new crisis. “Till the other day, everything was fine. There was no shortage of Liposomal Amphotericin B injection. In the last three days all of a sudden the demand for this injection increased manifold and the drug went out of stock from all medical stores across the state,” said a senior official of Bharat Serums and Vaccines Limited, company which manufacture the injection, pleading anonymity. “The state government will have to distribute this injection like Remdesivir through the Red Cross or any other sources to check the crisis and prevent its black marketing,” added the official. It was after the Red Cross society started distributing Remdesivir injection from its office that its crisis ended in Lucknow. “We are providing Remdesivir injection to everyone whoever is approaching us. After fulfilling all formalities, including doctor’s prescription and patient’s aadhar card, injection is being provided to patient’s kin,” said Gaurav Maheshwari of Red Cross, Lucknow. According to doctors, the maximum retail price of the Liposomal Amphotericin B injection is around ₹7000. The number of doses per patient varies from four-six injections per day depending on the patient’s weight. The complete course of the drug varies from 10 to 21 days depending on the patient’s condition. Dr Usha Dubey, whose father Suresh Prasad Dubey is undergoing treatment at the Vivekanand Hospital, Lucknow, has developed the Black Fungus infection after he was admitted to the hospital’s ICU for treatment of Covid-19. Dr Usha had to come down to Lucknow from Varanasi, where her husband lives, to attend her ailing father. “For the last two days, we have been desperately searching for the Liposomal Amphotericin B injection. Right from Bihar to Uttar Pradesh, the injection is not available anywhere,” said Dr Usha. “Alternate injections available in the market are also hard to find and they have a side effect on patient’s kidney,” she added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/now-life-saving-injection-to-treat-black-fungus-out-of-stock-in-lucknow-101621106465019.html

16-05-2021||Chandigarh||Chandigarh to conduct oxygen audit at govt hospitals too||The UT administration will now carry out oxygen audits at government hospitals and mini Covid centres in the city too. In view of the rising demand for oxygen and reports of misuse, the administration had earlier started the audit at all private hospitals being provided oxygen from Chandigarh’s centrally allocated quota of 20 metric tons (MT). This quota is also being utilised to cater to Government Medical College and Hospital, Sector 32; Government Multi-Speciality Hospital, Sector 16; and the dedicated Covid hospital in Sector 48. Yashpal Garg, UT nodal officer for oxygen supplies, said: “We have now decided to include government hospitals and mini-Covid centres under the ambit of audit, so that there is no wastage of oxygen. Our team will visit them and collate information.” Garg chaired a meeting on Saturday to discuss proper oxygen usage and ways to avoid fatalities caused by its insufficient supply. It was decided that while increasing hospital beds, especially in ICUs, oxygen supply and maintenance of its pressure need to be taken into account carefully. The officials said that there should be proper system for deicing vaporisers and bypasses will have to be provided, so that they can be used alternatively to avoid any untoward incident, due to possible choking. Staff deployed on oxygen supply related duty should be provided gasman kits immediately. All oxygen points must be checked by technicians to ensure there is no leakage and are properly closed after use.The team will visit the three government hospitals over the next few days to educate and sensitise the staff about optimum utilisation of oxygen and avoiding wastage. The team also presented its observation regarding oxygen management at the government hospitals. For example, at GMCH, apart from the oxygen generated by the recently-installed pressure swing absorption (PSA) plant, the daily consumption of liquid oxygen is more than 10 MT per day. Presently, there are 130 D-type cylinders and more are being shifted from the Sector-48 hospital, which will increase the number to around 200. In case of delay in supply of liquid oxygen, the manifold along with PSA plant, may be sufficient for about eight hours. Similarly, at the Sector-48 hospital, in case of delay, there is sufficient oxygen for about 24 hours, and at GMSH, it is sufficient for eight hours.Meanwhile, till 7pm on Saturday, 12 online applications were received from residents seeking access to medical oxygen at their homes. Of these, 11 were approved. The lone application that was rejected did not have a doctor’s prescription.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarh-to-conduct-oxygen-audit-at-govt-hospitals-too-101621105624962.html
16-05-2021||Chandigarh||Ten days on, no ICU bed still available in Punjab’s Mohali||It’s been 10 days and all intensive care unit (ICU) beds remain occupied across all hospitals in Mohali, forcing patients to move to other districts. The district has been hit hard by the pandemic’s second wave, which has claimed more than 150 lives in just a fortnight this month, while around 14,000 people have tested positive for it.There are 395 ICU beds dedicated to Covid-19 patients at various private hospitals in Mohali district, while there is none at any of the government facilities. While all are occupied for the past 10 days, even oxygen beds are nearing saturation, with just 79 available, according to the data released on Saturday evening.There are around 30 big private hospitals in the district, which has emerged as a medical tourism hub, but all are finding it difficult to meet the surge as patients are pouring in from other parts of the region as well.Meanwhile, the civil hospital in Phase 6, which is the government’s lone Covid facility in the district and was upgraded from 60 to 120 oxygen beds — is treating as many as 135 patients, with even two patients occupying one bed, it is learnt.Civil surgeon Dr Adarsh Pal Kaur said: “The second wave is witnessing more complications among patients, with a large proportion needing critical care or oxygen support. We are left with no bed for such patients in any government hospital, and they are being referred to Rajindra Hospital in Patiala or PGIMER in Chandigarh.”Deputy commissioner Girish Dayalan said: “We have already told private hospitals that they should not deny admission to any patient requiring critical care and accommodated them on oxygen beds till the next discharge from the ICU, subject to the approval of the patient’s kin.”The district administration has also directed subdivisional magistrates and doctors posted at subdivisional level to redress issues faced in Covid management. The DC has approved mortuary fridges at subdivisional hospitals Covid deaths occurring late at night besides allowing hiring of three funeral vans each to facilitate families of patients in the time of distress.Chandigarh to get 20 more ventilatorsHospitals in Chandigarh and Panchkula are also struggling, with only 15 and seven ventilators available, respectively, on Saturday evening.In Chandigarh, there are 178 beds with ventilators, of which 146 are at government facilities, including the PGIMER, and 32 at private hospitals. In some respite, the Centre allocated 20 more ventilators to Chandigarh on Saturday. UT adviser Manoj Parida said it would help the city tremendously in treating critical patients and save lives. Meanwhile, only 288 oxygen beds of the total 1,324 were available in the city.In the neighbouring Panchkula district, 315 of 349 oxygen beds were occupied and 113 of 120 ICU beds were occupied.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ten-days-on-no-icu-bed-atill-available-in-punjab-s-mohali-101621105565661.html

16-05-2021||Chandigarh||Chandigarh administration plans to ease lockdown restrictions||The Chandigarh administration is planning some relaxations in the lockdown currently in force in the city. It has been more than two weeks since the administration imposed the lockdown to break the chain of Covid-19 infection. With cases rising sharply in the past month and a half, the authorities had first imposed a night curfew, followed by a weekend curfew and then a weeklong curfew, which was further extended.For now, the daytime restrictions imposed from 5pm on May 4 are to continue till 5am on May 18. The administration is expected to take a fresh call during the review meeting on May 17.Even though the number of cases being reported daily is on a decline, the weekly positivity rate is still very high at around 25% and has not seen any significant dip since the lockdown was first imposed. “We will study the effectiveness of the lockdown as well as the necessity to continue with it. If the lockdown is not completely withdrawn, we will consider allowing opening of non-essential shops for a couple of days. The other option is to allow the odd-even formula for opening shops,” said a senior UT official, wishing to remain anonymous.The final decision on relaxations and lockdown will be taken in the review meeting to be chaired by the UT administrator on Monday, said the official, adding that the withdrawal of the weekend restrictions and night curfew will not be up for discussion as yet. The administration has come under mounting pressure from the business community, who want it to allow reopening of non-essential shops. Trader associations, such as Chandigarh Beopar Mandal, have made a number of representations, seeking some relaxations in the lockdown. Their contention is that the lockdown is leading to a loss of livelihood.Centre wants strict curbs to continueMeanwhile, the central government has advised states and UTs with over 10% positivity rate to continue with “stringent containments” even if they are witnessing a declining trend in the pandemic.According to weekly data shared by the health ministry, Chandigarh’s positivity rate is the ninth worst among states and UTs and has dropped down just slightly from 26.7% (May 1-7) to 25.7% (May 8-14).At a press briefing on Saturday, joint secretary Lav Agarwal said that there are 24 states and UTs with over 15% positivity rate and only three under 5%.Stating that stringent containment is the key to manage spread of infection, Agarwal said: “According to the Government of India, wherever there is over 10% positivity rate, there is an urgent need to work on intensive action and local containment. A comprehensive approach is needed.”Agarwal said that even in states where a decline or plateau trend is noticed, their containment activities should continue as it is, so that cases decline further and this trend continues. 28 more micro-containment zones declaredMeanwhile, the Chandigarh administration on Saturday declared 28 micro-containment zones in the city. District magistrate Mandip Singh Brar said regular screening and monitoring of the areas will continue and frequent sanitisation will be conducted. Residents have been advised to strictly maintain social distancing norms, wear masks and follow hand hygiene. The affected areas are spread across Sectors 19, 20, 29, 33, 37, 41, 44, 45, 46, 48, 51 and 63, besides Dadumajra Colony, Maloya, Daria, Ram Darbar, Mauli Jagran and Manimajra.The administration had announced curbs in 30 areas on Thursday and 23 areas on Friday, taking the total to 81 in three days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarh-administration-plans-to-ease-lockdown-restrictions-101621104786220.html
16-05-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai to see heavy rain on Sunday as result of Cyclone Tauktae||A low-pressure zone over the Arabian Sea, which began to form on Thursday morning, is expected to intensify into the first cyclonic storm of the year for India’s west coast. Named Cyclone Tauktae, the weather system is expected to bring heavy rains to parts of Mumbai and Thane districts on Sunday, as it will pass by the Konkan region at a distance of 300 to 500km from the coast.The cyclone was named by Myanmar. Tauktae means gecko in Burmese.The India Meteorological Department (IMD) placed Mumbai and Thane under yellow category storm warning, indicating very likely chances of “heavy rain at isolated places”, for one day. Districts towards the southern leg of Konkan and Madhya Maharashtra (including Ratnagiri, Sindhudurg, Kolhapur, Sangli and Satara) have been placed under an orange category alert, indicating more severe weather, on Saturday and Sunday.“The influence of the storm in Maharashtra is likely to subside after May 17 (Monday) as it would travel northwestwards towards Gujarat around May 18,” said an official with IMD’s regional forecasting centre in Mumbai. The official added the storm will not meet directly with the coast in Maharashtra, and that it may also delay the arrival of the monsoon along India’s west coast by a few days. However, they did not specify the exact influence it is likely to have on monsoons in Mumbai.“Cyclone Tauktae is likely to become the first severe cyclonic storm in 17 years to travel so close to the coast of Kerala, Karnataka, Goa & Maharashtra. As per the IMD Cyclone e-atlas, not a single severe cyclonic storm managed to do so after May 2004,” Akshay Deoras, a meteorologist at the University of Reading, tweeted earlier this week. Deoras also said that in Maharashtra, most of the storm’s impact is expected along the Konkan coast in the form of wind damages to trees and weak structures. He said, “People must remain vigil and try to remain at a safe distance from hoardings, power lines, and trees.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-to-see-heavy-rains-on-sunday-as-result-of-cyclone-tauktae-101621017962698.html
16-05-2021||Mumbai||Cyclone Tauktae: BMC readies plan to shift patients from BKC Jumbo facility||As gusty winds and rain is expected in Mumbai on Saturday and Sunday in the wake of Cyclone Tauktae which is forming over the Arabian Sea, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) on Friday said it is ready for disaster response, if needed.BMC has made all necessary arrangements in case the need arises to shift Covid-19 patients from the Bandra-Kurla Complex (BKC) jumbo facility. Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner in charge of BMC’s public health department, said, “There are not more than 300 patients at the BKC jumbo facility. We have put in place a plan to shift them if the need arises.”Over the past two days, BMC stopped admitting Covid patients at BKC jumbo facility in anticipation of the cyclone, Kakani said. “So, not many patients are there at present. We have vacant beds at Nesco jumbo facility in Goregaon and at SevenHills Hospital in Andheri, where patients can be moved. Ambulances with oxygen, doctors, ICU beds are all on stand-by,” Kakani added.In a statement on Friday, BMC said, “All dangerous trees around jumbo facilities have been pruned. 384 such trees were pruned. At these centres, required manpower has been made available along with equipment and vehicles, keeping in view the fact that there is a possibility of falling trees or branches in case of strong winds.”All waterlogging spots are equipped with dewatering pumps, the statement said.BMC has activated temporary shelters in all 24 wards, and citizens living along coastal Mumbai have been alerted, the statement said.Considering the possibility of strong winds and rains, the Mumbai Fire Brigade has been directed to deploy flood rescue squads at all six beaches in BMC limits. In addition, instructions have been given to keep Mumbai Police’s mobile vans operational at these places. Citizens are not allowed near these beaches, BMC said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/cyclone-tauktae-bmc-readies-plan-to-shift-patients-from-bkc-jumbo-facility-if-needed-101621017900540.html
16-05-2021||Other||Cyclone Tauktae building in Arabian Sea has Pune on yellow alert for rain, winds||PUNE Pune received light rain on Friday, a possible foretaste of what is to come in the next few days, based on the fact that as per the India Meteorological Department (IMD) forecast, this is the third consecutive year a cyclonic storm is hovering over the Arabian Sea close to the Indian coast. Pune, on Friday, reported 0.9 millimetres of rainfall in Shivajinagar and traces of rain at Lohegaon and Pashan. IMD has issued a forecast of moderate rain for Pune city (15.6mm – 64.4 mm) on May 15 and May 16, with isolated heavy (64.5mm-115.5mm) rainfall likely in the ghat areas. Thunder, lightning and gusty winds (30-40 kmph) are also likely on May 15 and May 16. “We have issued a yellow alert which means that citizens and authorities have to be alert. There may be a partial reduction in visibility, and slippery roads during periods of intense rain spell in some areas. There can also be a major disruption of traffic flow. Moderate water logging in low-lying areas adjacent to river banks is also possible, with a possibility of trees falling/uprooting on May 15 and May 16,” said Anupam Kashyapi, IMD. He further added that there is a possibility of minor landslides in the elevated hilly areas near Pune on May 15 and May 16. Cyclone watch In 2019, Cyclone Vayu moved parallel to the coast and then later weakened just before landfall in Gujarat. In 2020, Nisarga hit Maharashtra in May. And this year, a low-pressure area has a depression and later is forecast develop into Cyclone Tauktae in the Arabian Sea. Dr Mrutyunjay Mohapatra, director general of Meteorology, IMD, said that the forecast as of now is that the cyclone will travel towards Gujarat. “The exact path and intensity will get clearer in the next 24 hours. We have issued a high alert in Gujarat. In Maharashtra the impact will be only of strong winds and rainfall,” said Mohapatra. As of Friday, the low pressure area over Lakshadweep and adjoining southeast Arabian Sea has moved east-north-eastwards, and concentrated into a depression. “It is very likely to intensify into a deep depression during the next 12 hours (Friday evening) and into a cyclonic storm during the subsequent 12 hours (May 15 morning). It is very likely to reach near the Gujarat coast by May 18 morning,” said IMD officials. Vineet Singh, researcher at the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology (IITM), who is currently studying cyclones, said, “It is related to the wind pattern in the mid- to upper-atmosphere, say at a height of five to 10km, which governs a cyclone track in general.” “In the last 40 years, for the first time, four consecutive years (2018, 2019, 2020 and 2021) will have a cyclone in the Arabian Sea, in the pre-monsoon season. If this cyclone hits Gujarat with the least cyclonic storm strength, then for the first time since 1980, a cyclone will hit Gujarat in May, with strength of wind speed at least 65kmph as per data by the weather department,” said Singh. Pre-monsoon cyclones near the Indian west coast 2019: Cyclone Vayu moved parallel to the coast and then later weakened just before landfall in Gujarat. 2020: Nisarga hit Maharashtra in May. 2021: Cyclone Tauktae, a low pressure area has concentrated into a depression and later will develop a cyclone. It is likely to move towards Gujarat. Source: IMD Monsoon over Kerala likely on May 31 As per IMD, this year, the onset of the southwest monsoon over Kerala is likely to be on May 31. IMD said it is difficult to say when the monsoon will reach Maharashtra. Conditions will get clear after the dissipation of the cyclonic storm currently over the Arabian Sea, said officials.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/cyclone-tauktae-building-in-arabian-sea-has-pune-on-yellow-alert-for-rain-winds-101621001159105.html
16-05-2021||Chandigarh||Chandigarh Police foil man’s bid to courier 10kg cocaine to Australia||In their biggest narcotic seizure ever, the Chandigarh Police on Thursday recovered 10.24kg cocaine from a 36-year-old Chennai man, who was preparing to courier it to Australia.The cocaine, packed in two cartons of crockery boxes, was discovered by the employees at Excel Worldwide Courier Agency in Industrial Area, Phase 2, who further alerted the police.After the accused, Ashfaq Rahman, reached the courier company with the parcel request, the firm’s employees sought his identification card. But, he presented an ID bearing the name “Amanjeet”, which made them suspicious and they summoned the police.As cops arrived at the scene and asked Rahman to open the sealed boxes, he panicked and fled, but was apprehended at the police beatbox near the courier company’s office.“Inside each crockery box were seven wooden trays, which were sealed with plywood. The trays were making a hollow sound, so these were opened and cocaine wrapped in plastic packaging was found,” said UT senior superintendent of police (SSP) Kuldeep Singh Chahal.Investigators said Rahman had been staying at the Satsang Bhawan in Sector 26 for about a week. He had confessed to collecting the consignment from the Chandigarh Railway Station during this period. He had also come to the city a month ago to conduct a recce to execute the plan.However, police officials privy to the matter said, it was likely that Rahman was only a carrier. A Class 10 dropout, Rahman had claimed that he was paid ₹1 lakh to ship the contraband through crockery boxes.Police have contacted their counterparts in Chennai to look into his criminal history. The accused has been booked under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act at the Sector 31 police station. He will be presented in court on Friday, when police will seek his remand to investigate the involvement of other people in what they suspect could be a drug racket.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarh-police-foil-man-s-bid-to-courier-10kg-cocaine-to-australia-101620934792842.html
16-05-2021||World||India condemns all violence in Israel, Gaza; supports 'just Palestinian cause'||Amid escalating tensions between Israel and Palestinian militants, India on Sunday strongly condemned all acts of violence, including “indiscriminate rocket firings” from Gaza and the “retaliatory strikes”. During an open debate on the Middle East situation, Ambassador T S Tirumurti, India’s Permanent Representative to the UN, told the United Nations Security Council that the ongoing violence has caused immense suffering and resulted in deaths, including of women and children.“We urge both sides to show extreme restraint, desist from actions that exacerbate tensions, and refrain from attempts to unilaterally change the existing status quo, including in East Jerusalem and its neighbourhood,” Tirumurti told the Security Council.Indian also paid homage to her national, Soumya Santosh, living in Israel who was killed in a rocket attack by Hamas, the Palestinian militant group. The mortal remains of the 30-year-old woman were brought to her native place in Kerala on Saturday. The UN ambassador said that India “deeply mourn[s] her demise” along with all civilians who have lost their lives in the “current cycle of violence, provocation, incitement, and destruction.”Also Read | Ready to help Israel, Palestinians if they seek a ceasefire: US ambassador to UNTirumurti further called for resuming direct dialogue and creating conducive conditions for it, emphasising that immediate de-escalation is the need of the hour. He reiterated that India supports the just cause of Palestinians and a two-State solution. “Jerusalem has a special place in the hearts of millions of Indians, who visit the city every year. The Old City also houses the Al Zawiyya Al Hindiyya - The Indian Hospice, which is a historic place associated with a great Indian Sufi saint Baba Farid. India has restored this Indian Hospice,” he added.The situation in the region has quickly deteriorated as the fresh spate of violence on Sunday killed 40 Palestinians, the worst death toll since the unrest broke out. The United Nations has warned that the fighting could plunge the region into an "uncontainable" crisis. While opening the Security Council session, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres voiced alarm at the rise of extremist Jewish movements to push Palestinians out of Jerusalem."In Israel, violence by vigilante-style groups and mobs has added a further horrendous dimension to an already deteriorating crisis," Guterres said."Leaders on all sides have a responsibility to curb inflammatory rhetoric and calm the rising tensions," he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/india-condemns-all-violence-in-israel-gaza-supports-just-palestinian-cause-101621186766056.html

Linda Thomas-Greenfield told the 15-member council. "Because we believe Israelis and Palestinians equally have a right to live in safety and security."As the Security Council held its first public meeting - after two private briefings last week - Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel's campaign in Hamas Islamist-run Gaza was continuing at "full force".Washington - a strong ally of Israel - has been isolated at the United Nations over its objection to a public statement by the Security Council on the worst violence between Israel and the Palestinians in years because it worries it could harm behind-the-scenes diplomacy."We call upon the U.S. to shoulder its responsibilities, take a just position, and together with most of the international community support the Security Council in easing the situation," said Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi, who chaired Sunday's meeting because China is president for May.U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said the United Nations is "actively engaging all sides toward an immediate ceasefire" and called on them "to allow mediation efforts to intensify and succeed."'TAKE ACTION NOW'The truce efforts by Egypt, Qatar and the United Nations have so far offered no sign of progress. The United States sent an envoy to the region and President Joe Biden spoke with Netanyahu and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas on Saturday."In all these engagements with Israeli officials, the Palestinian Authority, and all regional partners, the United States has made clear that we are prepared to lend our support and good offices should the parties seek a ceasefire," Thomas-Greenfield said.Egyptian Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukry told the Security Council that "concessions must be made as a price to be paid for peace so as to spare people from paying the heavy price of war."The death toll in Gaza jumped to 188 overnight, including 55 children, amid an intensive Israeli air and artillery barrage since the fighting erupted last Monday. Ten people have been killed in Israel, including two children, in thousands of rocket attacks by Hamas and other militant groups."Each time Israel hears a foreign leader speak of its right to defend itself it is further emboldened to continue murdering entire families in their sleep," Palestinian Foreign Minister Riyad al-Malki told the Security Council.Israel's U.N. Ambassador Gilad Erdan said Israel's response to indiscriminate attacks by Hamas strictly adhered to international law and that the country was taking "unparalleled steps to prevent civilian casualties.""Israel uses its missiles to protect its children.

16-05-2021||World||'Perfectly legitimate target': Netanyahu on Gaza tower housing media outlets||Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Sunday renewed his claim that a Gaza building leveled by an Israeli airstrike housed a Hamas office as well as American and Middle East news organizations, but gave no evidence.Netanyahu spoke to CBS’s Face the Nation about ongoing violence between Israeli forces and the armed Palestinian group Hamas, and about Saturday’s airstrike that leveled the building housing Gaza offices of the Associated Press and Al Jazeera news organizations. “It’s a perfectly legitimate target,” he said.Asked if he had provided any evidence of Hamas presence in the building in a call later Saturday with President Joe Biden, Netanyahu said, “We pass it through our intelligence people.”Netanyahu gave no time frame for when Israel would be ready to halt its side of the fighting after nearly a week of Israeli airstrikes and Hamas rocket barrages. “We hope that it doesn’t continue very long, but we were attacked by Hamas,” he said.Asked about reports that Hamas had agreed to an Egypt-brokered cease-fire but Israel had not, he said, “That’s not what I know."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/perfectly-legitimate-target-netanyahu-on-gaza-tower-housing-media-outlets-101621181492957.html
16-05-2021||World||'War will go on': Netanyahu warns, says Israel military campaign will take time as 42 killed in Gaza||Israeli airstrikes on Gaza City flattened three buildings and killed at least 42 people Sunday, medics said, as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu signaled the fourth war between Israel and Palestinians in Gaza would rage on despite international efforts to broker a cease-fire.In a televised address, Netanyahu said Sunday evening the attacks were continuing at “full-force” and will “take time.“ Israel “wants to levy a heavy price” from Gaza’s militant Hamas rulers, he said, flanked by his defense minister and political rival, Defense Minister Benny Gantz, in a show of unity.The Israeli air assault early Sunday was the deadliest single attack since heavy fighting broke out between Israel and Hamas nearly a week ago, marking the worst fighting here since the devastating 2014 war in Gaza.The airstrikes hit a major downtown street of residential buildings and storefronts over the course of five minutes after midnight, destroying two adjacent buildings and one about 50 yards (meters) down the road.At one point, a rescuer shouted, “Can you hear me?” into a hole in the rubble. “Are you OK?” Minutes later, first responders pulled a survivor out and carried him off on an orange stretcher. The Gaza Health Ministry said 16 women and 10 children were among those killed, with more than 50 people wounded, and rescue efforts are still underway.Earlier, the Israeli military said it destroyed the home of Gaza’s top Hamas leader, Yahiyeh Sinwar, in a separate strike in the southern town of Khan Younis. It was the third such attack in the last two days on the homes of senior Hamas leaders, who have gone underground.Israel appears to have stepped up strikes in recent days to inflict as much damage as possible on Hamas as international mediators work to end the fighting and stave off an Israeli ground invasion of the territory. But targeting the group’s leaders could hinder those efforts. A U.S. diplomat is in the region to try to de-escalate tensions, and the U.N. Security Council is set to meet Sunday.In its airstrikes, Israel has leveled a number of Gaza City’s tallest office and residential buildings, alleging they contain Hamas military infrastructure. Among them was the building housing The Associated Press office and those of other media outlets.The latest outbreak of violence began in east Jerusalem last month, when Palestinian protests and clashes with police broke out in response to Israeli police tactics during Ramadan and the threatened eviction of dozens of Palestinian families by Jewish settlers. A focal point of clashes was the Al-Aqsa Mosque, a frequent flashpoint that is located on a hilltop compound that is revered by both Muslims and Jews.Hamas fired rockets toward Jerusalem late Monday, triggering the Israeli assault on impoverished Gaza, which is home to more than 2 million Palestinians and has been under an Israeli and Egyptian blockade since Hamas seized power from rival Palestinian forces in 2007.At least 188 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza, including 55 children and 33 women, with 1,230 people wounded. Eight people in Israel have been killed, including a 5-year-old boy and a soldier.Speaking alongside Netanyahu on Sunday, Israel’s military chief, Lt. Gen. Aviv Kohavi, said Hamas did not anticipate Israel’s overwhelming response to its rocket fire. “Hamas made a serious and grave mistake and didn’t read us properly.”The turmoil has also spilled over elsewhere, fueling protests in the occupied West Bank and stoking violence within Israel between its Jewish and Arab citizens, with clashes and vigilante attacks on people and property. The violence also sparked pro-Palestinian protests in cities across Europe and the United States, with French police firing tear gas and water cannons at demonstrators in Paris.The military said Sunday it struck Sinwar’s home and that of his brother Muhammad, another senior Hamas member. On Saturday it destroyed the home of Khalil al-Hayeh, a senior figure in Hamas’ political branch.Hamas’ upper echelon has gone into hiding in Gaza, and it is unlikely any were at home at the time of the strikes. Hamas’ top leader, Ismail Haniyeh, divides his time between Turkey and Qatar, both of which provide political support to the group.Hamas and the Islamic Jihad militant group have acknowledged 20 fighters killed since the fighting broke out Monday. Israel says the real number is far higher and has released the names and photos of two dozen alleged operatives it says were “eliminated.”An Egyptian diplomat said Israel’s targeting of Hamas political leaders would complicate cease-fire efforts. The diplomat, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the closed-door negotiations, said Cairo is working to broker an end to the fighting, as are other international actors.The Egyptian diplomat said the destruction of Hamas’ rocket capabilities would require a ground invasion that would “inflame the whole region.” Egypt, which made peace with Israel decades ago, has threatened to “suspend” cooperation in various fields, the official said, without elaborating.Meanwhile, the Biden administration has affirmed its support for Israel while working to de-escalate the crisis. American diplomat Hady Amr met with Gantz, the Israeli defense minister, who thanked the U.S. for its support. Gantz said Israel “takes every precaution to strike at military targets only and avoid harming civilians, while its civilians are the targets of indiscriminate attack.”Hamas and other militant groups have fired some 2,900 rockets into Israel. The military said 450 of the rockets had fallen short or misfired, while Israeli air defenses intercepted 1,150.The interception rate appeared to have significantly dropped since the start of the conflict, when Israel said 90% were intercepted. The military did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Israel has meanwhile carried out hundreds of airstrikes across Gaza.On Saturday, Israel bombed the 12-story al-Jalaa Building, where the office of The Associated Press was located. The building also housed the TV network Al-Jazeera and other media outlets, along with several floors of apartments.“The campaign will continue as long as it is required,” Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said. He alleged that Hamas military intelligence was operating inside the building.Israel routinely cites a Hamas presence as a reason for targeting certain locations in airstrikes, including residential buildings. The military also has accused the militant group of using journalists as human shields, but provided no evidence to back up the claims.The AP has operated from the building for 15 years, including through three previous wars between Israel and Hamas.

It must stop immediately," Guterres said as he opened a Security Council session delayed by Israel's ally the United States, calling the violence that has killed nearly 200 people over the past week "utterly appalling.""It has the potential to unleash an uncontainable security and humanitarian crisis and to further foster extremism, not only in the occupied Palestinian territory and Israel, but in the region as a whole," he said.Guterres condemned the fresh violence on Sunday which killed 40 Palestinians, the worst death toll since the unrest broke out."This senseless cycle of bloodshed, terror and destruction must stop immediately," Guterres said.He also renewed criticism of an Israeli strike on Saturday that destroyed the Gaza offices of two major news outlets, Al-Jazeera and the Associated Press."Journalists must be allowed to work free of fear and harassment. The destruction of media offices in Gaza is extremely concerning," Guterres said.Also Read | Around 3,000 rockets fired towards Israel from Gaza, army claimsIsrael launched its air offensive after Hamas, the Islamist militant movement that controls Gaza, began firing rockets in response to the Jewish state's moves in Jerusalem."Rockets and mortars on one side and aerial and artillery bombardments on the other must stop. I appeal to all parties to heed this call," Guterres said.He also voiced alarm at the rise of extremist Jewish movements whose push to expel Palestinians out of Jerusalem helped trigger the crisis."In Israel, violence by vigilante-style groups and mobs has added a further horrendous dimension to an already deteriorating crisis," Guterres said."Leaders on all sides have a responsibility to curb inflammatory rhetoric and calm the rising tensions."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/un-chief-warns-of-uncontainable-crisis-amid-deadly-israel-gaza-violence-101621175511346.html

A surge testing and stepped-up vaccination effort was being conducted in the northern England areas hardest hit by that variant.Health Secretary Matt Hancock said the variant, formally known as B.1.617.2, is more transmissible than the U.K.’s main strain and “it is likely it will become the dominant variant.”“This isn’t over yet,” Hancock told the BBC on Sunday. “The virus has just gained a bit of pace and we’ve therefore all got to be that bit much more careful and cautious.”On Monday, people in England will be able to eat a restaurant meal indoors, drink inside a pub, go to a museum, hug friends and visit one another’s homes for the first time in months. A ban on overseas holidays is also being lifted, with travel now possible to a short list of countries with low infection rates. Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland are following similar but slightly different reopening paths.Patrick Dardis, chief executive of brewery and pub chain Young’s, said the indoor opening — which follows the reopening of outdoor patios and beer gardens last month — is “a big step back on to the path to normality.”“The weather has been pretty dire, and people are hardy, but we really needed this next step to come,” he said.But hospitality and entertainment venues say they won't be able to make money until they can open at full capacity. That's due to happen June 21, the date set by the government for lifting its remaining COVID-19 restrictions, including social distancing and mask-wearing rules.Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said if the new variant causes a big surge in cases, it could scupper that plan.Britain has recorded almost 128,000 coronavirus deaths, the highest reported toll in Europe. But new infections have plummeted to an average of around 2,000 a day, compared with nearly 70,000 a day during the winter peak, and deaths have fallen to single figures a day.Almost 70% of British adults have received a first dose of a coronavirus vaccine, and more than 37% have had both doses.Health officials, backed by the army, are carrying out surge testing in Bolton and Blackburn in northwest England, where cases of the new variant are clustered, and pop-up vaccination sites have been set up to speed the inoculation drive. Across the country, the government is shortening the gap between doses for people over 50 from 12 to eight weeks in a bid to give them more protection.Hancock said scientists had a “high degree of confidence” that current vaccines work against the Indian-identified variant.Critics of Britain's Conservative government say lax border rules allowed the new variant to enter the country. They accuse the government of delaying a ban on visitors from India, which is experiencing a devastating coronavirus outbreak, because it is seeking a trade deal with the vast country.India was added to the U.K.’s high-risk “red list” on April 23, weeks after neighbors Pakistan and Bangladesh.“We shouldn’t be in this situation,” said opposition Labour Party lawmaker Yvette Cooper. “This was not inevitable.”The government denies that its health policies were influenced by political or trade considerations.Mark Walport, a member of the government’s Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies, said Britain was at a “perilous moment,” and people should be cautious with their new freedoms.“My advice is that just because you can do something doesn’t necessarily mean you should,” he told Sky News. “As far as possible, socialize outside, maintain social distancing. If you’re going to hug, hug cautiously.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-readies-for-major-reopening-as-new-virus-variant-from-india-sparks-worry-101621165045705.html
16-05-2021||World||Islamic nations hold emergency summit on Israel-Gaza attacks||The 57-nation Organization of Islamic Cooperation opened an emergency meeting Sunday over the heavy fighting between Israel and the Gaza Strip’s militant Hamas rulers, the first major move among Mideast nations still grappling with how to address the conflict.While the Arab League and organizations like the Saudi-based OIC have maintained their view that the Palestinians should have their own independent state, Israel recently has reached recognition deals with several of its members. That, as well as the concerns of some nations over Hamas, has seen a somewhat-muted response to the attacks as opposed to the full-throated response of decades past.Palestinian Foreign Minister Riad Malki of the Palestinian Authority, which administers autonomous enclaves in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, decried what he called Israel's “cowardly attacks” at the start of the meeting.“We need to tell Allah that we will resist to the last day,” he said. “We are facing a long-term occupation. that’s the base of the problem. Crimes are committed against the Palestinians without consequences.”However, Malki's Palestinian Authority has no control over Hamas and the Gaza Strip, where the militants seized power in 2007.Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu took a similarly hard line.“Israel alone is responsible for the recent escalation in East Jerusalem, the West Bank and Gaza,” Cavusoglu said. "Our warnings to Israel last week went unheeded.”Also Read | Israeli airstrikes kill 26 in downtown Gaza City in deadliest single attack, say medicsAcross the Arabian Peninsula and Persian Gulf states, reactions to the fighting have been mixed. In Qatar, home to the Al-Jazeera satellite network, hundreds turned out late Saturday night to listen to a speech by Hamas’ top leader Ismail Haniyeh. He now splits his time between Turkey and Qatar, both of which back Hamas, as does Iran.“The resistance will not give in,” Haniyeh vowed as bodyguards stood behind him. He added that “resistance is the shortest road to Jerusalem” and that Palestinians will not accept anything less than a Palestinian state with Jerusalem as its capital.Kuwait's parliament speaker reportedly spoke with Haniyeh on Saturday, as did Qatar's foreign minister. So too did Gen. Esmail Ghaani, the head of the expeditionary Quds Forces of Iran's paramilitary Revolutionary Guard.Watch | Israel destroys media house building in Gaza; pro-Palestinian protests in ParisThen there are Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates, two Gulf Arab states that reached recognition deals with Israel last year in the waning months of the Trump administration. Those nations, as well as Saudi Arabia, have reiterated their support of Palestinians obtaining their own independent state. However, government-linked media in those nations haven't been covering the current flare-up of violence nonstop like other networks in the region.There are murmurs of dissent though. In the island nation of Bahrain, civil society groups signed a letter urging the kingdom to expel the Israeli ambassador over the violence. In the UAE, where political parties and protests are illegal, Palestinians in the workforces of Abu Dhabi and Dubai have expressed their anger quietly, worried about losing their residency permit. Some Emiratis also have expressed concerns.“The region’s only democracy," tweeted the Emirati writer and political analyst Sultan Sooud Al Qassemi in writing about Israel's strike on a Gaza building that housed the offices of The Associated Press and Al-Jazeera.Cavusoglu, the Turkish foreign minister, criticized OIC members who reached recognition deals with Israel.“There are a few who have lost their moral compass and voiced support for Israel,” he said. “If there are half-hearted statements within our own family, how could we criticize others who (don't) take our words seriously?"Hussein Ibish, a senior scholar at the Washington-based Arab Gulf States Institute, said most Gulf Arab leaders fear Hamas' rocket fire as "cynical, dangerous, unnecessarily provocative and endangering Israelis and Palestinians in Gaza alike.” That takes the pressure off those Gulf leaders to respond, unlike in other confrontations involving the Al-Aqsa mosque, Islam's third-holiest site in Jerusalem, or when Israeli settlers force Arab families out of their homes, he said.“There won’t be much sympathy for what is widely viewed in the Gulf as Israel’s heavy-handed and disproportionate retaliation," Ibish wrote, "but it will be much easier for Gulf leaders and many citizens to regard the exchange as a tragic conflagration at the expense of ordinary people brought about by two leaderships over which they have neither control nor responsibility.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/islamic-nations-hold-emergency-summit-on-israel-gaza-attacks-101621164016193.html

16-05-2021||World||UK defends putting India on travel ‘red list’ two weeks after Pakistan. Hancock explains||UK health secretary Matt Hancock on Sunday defended the timing of the travel ban on India amid concerns that the coronavirus variant first identified in the subcontinent could likely become the dominant variant in Britain. Hancock told Sky News that variant B.1.617.2 was notified as a variant under investigation after the government had already put India on the travel “red list”.“The decision to put India on the red list was taken because of the high positivity rate of people coming from India and looking at the epi-curve in India,” he said.The UK government has been facing criticism, especially from the Opposition parties, for not banning travel from India when its neighbours, Pakistan and Bangladesh, were put on the red list. Pakistan and Bangladesh were added to the travel ban list on April 2 and the implementation came into effect on April 9, when India was reporting more than 100,000 Covid-19 cases per day and witnessing an exponential surge. The United Kingdom placed India on the red list on April 19 and the travel ban came into effect from April 23.Also Read | UK red list caused chaos at Pakistan airports.

The steep increase in cases of the India variant in the UK was NOT inevitable. Why did PM not put India on the red list 2 weeks earlier when Pakistan and Bangladesh were added to red list?

16-05-2021||World||Israeli airstrikes kill 26 in downtown Gaza City in deadliest single attack, say medics||Israeli airstrikes on Gaza City flattened three buildings and killed at least 26 people Sunday, medics said, making it the deadliest single attack since heavy fighting broke out between Israel and the territory's militant Hamas rulers nearly a week ago.The Gaza Health Ministry said 10 women and eight children were among those killed, with another 50 people wounded in the attack. Rescuers raced to pull survivors and bodies from the rubble.Earlier, the Israeli military said it destroyed the home of Gaza’s top Hamas leader in a separate strike in the southern town of Khan Younis. It was the third such attack in the last two days on the homes of senior Hamas leaders.Israel appears to have stepped up strikes in recent days to inflict as much damage as possible on Hamas as international mediators try to broker a cease-fire. But targeting senior Hamas leaders could hinder those efforts. A U.S. diplomat is in the region to try to de-escalate tensions, and the U.N. Security Council is set to meet Sunday.The military said it struck the homes of Yehiyeh Sinwar, the most senior Hamas leader inside the territory, and his brother Muhammad, another senior Hamas member. On Saturday it destroyed the home of Khalil al-Hayeh, a senior figure in Hamas’ political branch.Watch | Israel destroys media house building in Gaza; pro-Palestinian protests in ParisHamas’ upper echelon has gone into hiding in Gaza, and it is unlikely any were at home at the time of the strikes. Hamas’ top leader, Ismail Haniyeh, divides his time between Turkey and Qatar, both of which provide political support to the group.Hamas and the Islamic Jihad militant group have acknowledged 20 fighters killed since the fighting broke out Monday. Israel says the real number is far higher and has released the names and photos of two dozen alleged operatives it says were “eliminated.”An Egyptian diplomat said Israel’s targeting of Hamas political leaders would complicate cease-fire efforts. The diplomat, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the closed-door negotiations, said Cairo is working to broker an end to the fighting. A U.S. diplomat has also been dispatched to the region and the U.N. Security Council is set to meet Sunday.The Egyptian diplomat said the destruction of Hamas’ rocket capabilities would require a ground invasion that would “inflame the whole region.” Egypt, which made peace with Israel decades ago, has threatened to “suspend” cooperation in various fields, the official said, without elaborating.The latest outbreak of violence began in east Jerusalem earlier this month, when Palestinians protested attempts by settlers to forcibly evict a number of Palestinian families from their homes and Israeli police measures at Al-Aqsa Mosque, a frequent flashpoint located on a mount in the Old City revered by Muslims and Jews.Hamas fired rockets toward Jerusalem late Monday, triggering the Israeli assault on Gaza.The turmoil has also spilled over elsewhere, fueling protests in the occupied West Bank and stoking violence within Israel between its Jewish and Arab citizens, with clashes and vigilante attacks on people and property.At least 174 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza, including 47 children and 29 women, with more than 1,200 wounded. Eight Israelis have been killed, including a 5-year-old boy and a soldier.Hamas and other militant groups have fired some 2,900 rockets into Israel. The military said 450 of the rockets had fallen short or misfired, while Israeli air defenses intercepted 1,150.The interception rate appeared to have significantly dropped since the start of the conflict, when Israel said 90% were intercepted. The military did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Israel has meanwhile carried out hundreds of airstrikes across the impoverished and blockaded territory, which is home to more than 2 million Palestinians, and brought down a number of high-rise buildings, including one that housed The Associated Press’ Gaza office.Rescuers raced to pull survivors from the rubble after the strikes on Gaza City early Sunday. Among those killed was Dr. Ayman Abu Auf, a doctor at the nearby Shifa hospital, the Health Ministry said.There was no immediate comment from the Israeli military on the strikes.Since the conflict began, Israel has leveled a number of Gaza City’s tallest office and residential buildings, alleging they house Hamas military infrastructure. On Saturday, it turned to the 12-story al-Jalaa Building, where the offices of the AP, the TV network Al-Jazeera and other media outlets are located, along with several floors of apartments.“The campaign will continue as long as it is required,” Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a televised speech Saturday. He alleged that Hamas military intelligence was operating inside the building.Israel routinely cites a Hamas presence as a reason for targeting certain locations in airstrikes, including residential buildings. The military also has accused the militant group of using journalists as human shields, but provided no evidence to back up the claims.The AP has operated from the building for 15 years, including through three previous wars between Israel and Hamas. During those conflicts as well as the current one, the news agency’s cameras from its top floor office and roof terrace offered 24-hour live shots as militants’ rockets arched toward Israel and Israeli airstrikes hammered the city and its surroundings.“We have had no indication Hamas was in the building or active in the building,” AP President and CEO Gary Pruitt said in a statement. “This is something we actively check to the best of our ability.

AP staffers and other occupants evacuated safely. Soon after, three missiles hit the building and destroyed it, bringing it crashing down in a giant cloud of dust.“The world will know less about what is happening in Gaza because of what happened today,” Pruitt said. “We are shocked and horrified that the Israeli military would target and destroy the building housing AP’s bureau and other news organizations in Gaza.”He said the AP was seeking information from the Israeli government and was engaged with the U.S. State Department to learn more.U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken later spoke by phone with Pruitt, offering his support for independent journalists and media organizations, and the White House said it had communicated directly with Israel to urge safety for journalists.The Biden administration has affirmed its support for Israel while working to de-escalate the crisis.

They renewed their commitment to finding a peaceful end to the war and called for an early start to talks that have been stalled, he said.The U.S. has been pressing for accelerated talks as it withdraws the last of its 2,500-3,500 soldiers and NATO its remaining 7,000 allied forces.Even as the Taliban and government signed on to the cease-fire, which was declared to mark the Islamic holiday of Eid-al-Fitr, violence continued unabated in Afghanistan. A bombing Friday in a mosque north of the capital killed 12 worshippers, including the prayer leader. Another 15 people were wounded. The Taliban denied involvement and blamed the government intelligence agency.In a statement Sunday, the IS affiliate took responsibility for the mosque attack, saying its fighters planted an explosive device in “a worship place for disbelievers Sufis,” killing the “apostate Imam,” or prayer leader. The statement claimed 40 worshipers were wounded.The IS also claimed it blew up several electrical grid stations over the weekend. That left the capital Kabul in the dark for much of the three-day holiday that followed the Muslim fasting month of Ramadan.In posts on its affiliated websites, IS claimed additional attacks over the last two weeks that destroyed 13 electrical grid stations in several provinces. The stations bring imported power from the Central Asian countries of Uzbekistan and Tajikistan.The attacks have left nine provinces including Kabul with disrupted power supplies, said Sanger Niazai, a government spokesman. There was also concern that local warlords, demanding protection money from the government to safeguard stations in areas they control, may have been behind some of the destruction.At least one local warlord was arrested last year after demanding protection money.The seemingly unstoppable violence in Afghanistan has residents and regional countries fearful the final withdrawal of U.S. and NATO soldiers could lead to further chaos. Washington said it wants its last soldier out of Afghanistan by Sept. 11 at the latest, but the withdrawal is progressing quickly and a Western official familiar with the exit said it is likely to be completed by early July. He spoke on condition of anonymity because details of the withdrawal are not being made public.On Saturday, China's Foreign Minister Wang Yi expressed concern about the rapid withdrawal of U.S. and NATO forces in a phone call with Pakistan Foreign Minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi.Wang called the withdrawal hasty and warmed it would “severely” impact the Afghan peace process and negatively affect regional stability, He called on the United Nations to play a greater role.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/3day-afghanistan-cease-fire-ends-amid-calls-for-fresh-peace-talks-101621151895365.html
16-05-2021||World||Taming Covid-19 variants: Canadian, US researchers working on new antiviral drug||Canadian and American researchers have claimed to have developed an antiviral drug that they say is the “most potent” yet in countering the Covid-19 virus’s variants of concern (VOCs).The drug called N-0385 “blocks the Sars-CoV-2 virus from entering human cells through its favoured cell gateways”, according to a release from Vancouver-based University of British Columbia (UBC).A preprint version of the study on the new drug has been uploaded on website of the journal BioRXiv.François Jean, a project lead and professor at UBC’s department of microbiology and immunology, said the researchers reported “a novel and highly potent small-molecule drug called N-0385 that acts as the most effective entry inhibitor to date”.He said the researchers demonstrated that the new drug is “broadly protective against infection and mortality in mice, and believe N-0385 has potential as a viable early treatment option against emerging Sars-CoV-2 VOCs”.The effect of the drug was studied on the B.117 and B.1.351 variants that were first detected in the UK and South Africa, respectively. Jean told HT over email that his team is ready to test the drug against other VOCs, including “P.1, [first] identified in Brazil, and B.1.617.2 and other sub-clades [first] identified in India”.Explaining the mechanism of the drug, Jean said it blocks “TMPRSS2, an enzyme responsible for cutting and priming the viral spike protein so that it can attach and fuse with the host cell’s membrane, and release the virus’s genetic material”.That “cutting” of the viral spike protein is “important for the fusion step between the virions (virus particles) and the host cell’s membrane. The fusion event permits the release of the virus’s genetic material into the targeted cells”, Jean elaborated. He believes the drug will also work against the coronavirus variant first detected in India, saying, “We speculate that the efficacy of N-0385 against B.1.617.2 would not be readily compromised, since no mutations in the TMPRSS2 cleavage site have been reported for B.1.617.2.”Jean said that “viable treatments for VOCs are urgently needed as they carry mutations in the virus spike protein that allow them to spread more easily, and cause more serious illness. VOCs may also be more resistant to antibodies produced by vaccines”.Multiple institutes were associated in developing the drug, including researchers at Universite de Sherbrooke in Quebec and US-based Cornell University.While VOCs have contributed to the ongoing coronavirus crisis in India, they now “represent a majority of Covid-19 cases in Canada”, according to a statement from Canada’s Chief Public Health Officer, Theresa Tam. She said as of May 14, the B.1.617 variant, including three currently defined sub-lineages, have been identified in nine provinces and territories.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taming-covid-19-variants-canadian-us-researchers-working-on-new-antiviral-drug-101621146066790.html

It said at least five defenders of the town had been killed in clashes and at least 10 others wounded.None of these details could be independently verified, but a Myanmar state television broadcast Saturday night reported that fighting was going on, and acknowledged the town's defenders have been putting up stiff resistance against the army.“The military's use of weapons of war against civilians, including this week in Mindat, is a further demonstration of the depths the regime will sink to to hold onto power,” the British Embassy said on Twitter. “We call on the military to cease violence against civilians.”The US Embassy said it was “aware of increasing violence in Mindat, including reports of the military shooting civilians,” and urged that evidence of atrocities be sent to UN investigators.Detailed tallies compiled by several different watchdog groups say government security forces have killed upwards of 750 protesters and bystanders as they have tried to suppress opposition to the military's seizure of power.In April, security forces were accused of killing more than 80 people in one day to destroy street barricades that militants had set up as strongholds in the city of Bago.In many or most cases, police and soldiers were trying to break up peaceful protests, though as they increased the use of lethal force, some protesters fought back in self-defense. In recent weeks there has been an upsurge in small bombings in many cities, mostly causing little damage and few casualties.The junta says the death toll is less than 300, and the use of force was justified to quash what it calls riots.Mindat's resisters are only lightly armed, mostly with a traditional type of single-shot hunting rifle, but the territory around the town is mountainous and wooded, favouring defenders over attackers.The report on state television MRTV listed past attacks on government forces and installations, most recently on Thursday, when it claimed a force of about 100 blocked security forces from entering the town, destroying one vehicle and leaving an unspecified number of security forces dead and missing.In a later attack, it said, an even bigger force was said to have launched an attack from the city on security forces patrolling nearby, destroying six vehicles and causing an unspecified number of government casualties.The opposition government earlier this month announced a plan to unify groups such as the Chinland Defence Force into a national “People's Defence Force,” which would serve as a precursor to a “Federal Union Army” of democratic forces including ethnic minorities.Khin Ma Ma Myo, deputy defense minister of the shadow government, said one of the duties of the People's Defense Force is to protect the resistance movement from military attacks and violence instigated by the junta.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/myanmar-troops-attack-western-town-that-resisted-coup-101621140485674.html

16-05-2021||World||Saudis to host meeting of Muslim nations' FMs on Sunday||Saudi Arabia has called for foreign ministers of the world's largest body of Muslim nations to hold a meeting Sunday. The gathering is to discuss Israeli acts of violence against Palestinians and the Israeli police's use of force against protesters at Al-Aqsa mosque in Jerusalem.The kingdom will host the virtual summit, gathering ministers of the 57-nation Organization of Islamic Cooperation “to discuss the Israeli aggression in the Palestinian territory,” particularly acts of violence in the vicinity of Al-Aqsa Mosque, the body said Saturday.The Saudi-headquartered OIC includes countries Iran, Turkey, Indonesia and a range of Muslim majority nations.The sanctity of Al-Aqsa mosque, one of Islam's holiest sites, is a sensitive and emotive issue for Muslims around the world. The OIC was formed 51 years ago in response to a Jewish extremist arson attack on the Al-Aqsa Mosque in east Jerusalem.The hilltop on which the mosque stands is also sacred to Jews, who revere it as the Temple Mount because it was the site of the biblical temples. Some Jews and evangelical Christians support building a new Jewish temple on the site, an idea that Muslims find alarming because they fear it would lead to the mosque being partitioned or demolished.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/saudis-to-host-meeting-of-muslim-nations-fms-on-sunday-101621127448441.html

16-05-2021||World||Israel bombs Hamas Gaza chief's home as fighting enters 7th day||Israel bombed the home of Hamas' chief in Gaza early on Sunday and the Islamist group fired rocket barrages at Tel Aviv as hostilities stretched into a seventh day with no sign of abating.At least three Palestinians were killed in Israeli air strikes across the coastal enclave, health officials said, and many were injured as the sounds of heavy bombardment roared through the night.Israelis dashed for bomb shelters as sirens warning of incoming rocket fire blared in Tel Aviv and its suburbs. Around 10 people were injured while running for shelters, medics said.At least 148 have been killed in Gaza since the violence began on Monday, including 41 children, health officials said. Israel has reported 10 dead, including two children.Envoys from the United States, United Nations and Egypt were working to restore calm but have yet to show any signs of progress. The U.N. Security Council was due to meet later on Sunday to discuss the worst outbreak of Israeli-Palestinian violence in years.Both Israel and Hamas have insisted they would continue their cross-border fire, a day after Israel destroyed a 12-storey building in Gaza City that had housed the U.S. Associated Press and Qatar-based Al Jazeera media operations.The Israel military said the al-Jala building was a legitimate military target, containing Hamas military offices, and that it had given warnings to civilians to get out of the building before the attack.The AP condemned the attack, and asked Israel to put forward evidence. "We have had no indication Hamas was in the building or active in the building," the news organisation said in a statement.In what it called a reprisal for Israel's destruction of the al-Jala building, Hamas fired rockets at Tel Aviv and towns in southern Israel early on Sunday.Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said late on Saturday that Israel was "still in the midst of this operation, it is still not over and this operation will continue as long as necessary."In a burst of air strikes early on Sunday, Israel targeted the home of Yehya Al-Sinwar, who since 2017 has headed the political and military wings of Hamas in Gaza, the group's TV station said.AL-AQSAHamas began its rocket assault on Monday after weeks of tensions over a court case to evict several Palestinian families in East Jerusalem, and in retaliation for Israeli police clashes with Palestinians near the city's Al-Aqsa Mosque, Islam's third holiest site, during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan.Speaking to crowds of protesters in the Qatari capital of Doha, Hamas chief Ismail Haniyeh said late on Saturday that the underlying cause of the hostilities was Jerusalem."The Zionists thought ... they could demolish Al-Aqsa mosque. They thought they could displace our people in Sheikh Jarrah," said Haniyeh."I say to Netanyahu: do not play with fire," he continued, amid cheers from the crowd. "The title of this battle today, the title of the war, and the title of the intifada, is Jerusalem, Jerusalem, Jerusalem," using the Arabic word for 'uprising'.Hamas, Islamic Jihad and other militant groups have fired around 2,300 rockets from Gaza since Monday, the Israeli military said on Saturday. It said about 1,000 were intercepted by missile defences and 380 fell into the Gaza Strip.Israel has launched more than 1,000 air and artillery strikes into the densely populated coastal strip, saying they were aimed at Hamas and other militant targets.WAR CRIMESEarlier this week, the International Criminal Court's chief prosecutor, Fatou Bensouda, told Reuters the court was "monitoring very closely" the latest escalation of hostilities, amid an investigation now under way into alleged war crimes in earlier bouts of the conflict.Netanyahu accused Hamas of "committing a double war crime" by targeting civilians, and using Palestinian civilians as "human shields."U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres reminded "all sides that any indiscriminate targeting of civilian and media structures violates international law and must be avoided at all costs," U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric said in a statement on Saturday.There has been a flurry of U.S. diplomacy in recent days to try to quell the violence.President Joe Biden's envoy, Hady Amr, arrived in Israel on Friday for talks. Biden spoke with both Netanyahu and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas late on Saturday, and updated them on U.S. diplomatic efforts, the White House said.But any mediation is complicated by the fact that the United States and most western powers do not talk to Hamas, which they regard as a terrorist organisation. And Abbas, whose power base is in the occupied West Bank, exerts little influence over Hamas in Gaza.In Israel, the conflict has been accompanied by violence amongst the country's mixed communities of Jews and Arabs, with synagogues attacked and Arab-owned shops vandalised.There has also been an upsurge in deadly clashes in the occupied West Bank. At least 12 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli troops in the occupied West Bank since Friday, most of them during clashes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/israel-bombs-hamas-gaza-chief-s-home-as-fighting-enters-7th-day-101621121757181.html
16-05-2021||World||Media demand Israel explain destruction of news offices||News organizations demanded an explanation for an Israeli airstrike that targeted and destroyed a Gaza City building housing the offices of The Associated Press, broadcaster Al-Jazeera and other media outlets.AP journalists and other tenants were safely evacuated from the 12-story al-Jalaa tower after the Israeli military warned of an imminent strike on Saturday. Three heavy missiles hit the building within the hour, disrupting coverage of the ongoing conflict between militant group Hamas and Israel. At least 145 people in Gaza and eight in Israel have been killed since the fighting erupted on Monday night.“The world will know less about what is happening in Gaza because of what happened today,” AP President and CEO Gary Pruitt said. He said the American news agency was seeking information from the Israeli government and engaging with the US State Department to learn more.Mostefa Souag, acting director-general of Al Jazeera Media Network, called the strike a “war crime” and a “clear act” to stop journalists from reporting on the conflict. Kuwait state television also had office space in the now-collapsed Gaza City building.“The targeting of news organizations is completely unacceptable, even during an armed conflict. It represents a gross violation of human rights and internationally agreed norms,” Barbara Trionfi, the executive director of the International Press Institute, said.In a standard Israeli response, the military said that Hamas was operating inside the building, and it accused the militant group of using journalists as human shields. But it provided no evidence to back up the claims.Israeli military spokesman Lt. Col. Jonathan Conricus claimed that Hamas used the building for a military intelligence office and weapons development. He said “a highly advanced technological tool” that the militant group used in the fighting was “within or on the building."But Conricus said he could not provide evidence to back up the claims without “compromising” intelligence efforts. He added, however: “I think it's a legitimate request to see more information, and I will try to provide it.”Some press freedom advocates said the strike raised suspicions that Israel was trying to hinder coverage of the conflict. The New York-based Committee to Protect Journalists demanded Israel “provide a detailed and documented justification” for the strike.“This latest attack on a building long known by Israel to house international media raises the specter that the Israel Defense Forces is deliberately targeting media facilities in order to disrupt coverage of the human suffering in Gaza,” the group's executive director, Joel Simon, said in a statement.The bombing followed media consternation over an Israeli military statement that prompted some news organizations, including The Wall Street Journal, to erroneously report early Friday that Israel had launched a ground invasion of Gaza.Israeli military commentators said the media had been used in a ruse to lure Hamas militants into a deadly trap. Conricus denied that the military engaged in a deliberate deception when it tweeted falsely Friday that ground forces were engaging in Gaza, calling it “an honest mistake.”The AP, based on its analysis of the army's statement, phone calls to military officials and on the ground reporting in Gaza, concluded there was no ground incursion and did not report there was one.The strike on a building known to have the offices of international media outlets came as a shock to reporters who had felt relatively protected there.“Now, one can understand the feeling of the people whose homes have been destroyed by such kind of air attacks,” Al-Jazeera producer Safwat al-Kahlout, who was at the bureau in Gaza when the evacuation warning came, told the broadcaster Saturday. “It's really difficult to wake up one day and then you realize that your office is not there with all the career experiences, memories that you've had.”For 15 years, AP's top floor offices and roof terrace on the now-destroyed building had provided a prime location for covering fighting in Gaza. The news agency's camera offered 24-hour live shots this week as Hamas rockets arched toward Israel and Israeli airstrikes hammered the city.Just a day before the bombing, AP correspondent Fares Akram wrote in a personal story that the AP office was the only place in Gaza were he felt “somewhat safe.”“The Israeli military has the coordinates of the high-rise, so it's less likely a bomb will bring it crashing down,” Akram wrote.The next day, Akram tweeted about running from the building and watching its destruction from afar.PEN America, an organization promoting literature and freedom of speech, said Saturday that the only reason the world knows about the ongoing fighting between Gaza's Hamas rulers and Israel is due to the “tireless, indefatigable work of journalists, risking their lives to inform the world.”“The resulting destruction will hobble the ability of professional journalists to do their work documenting a fraught, complex conflict at a critical time,” the organization said.

16-05-2021||World||Air strikes to continue as long as necessary, says Netanyahu as conflict rages||Israel pounded Gaza with air strikes into the early hours of Sunday, destroying a tower block that housed news media organisations, while Palestinian militants fired rocket salvoes at Tel Aviv.The hostilities showed no sign of letting up as they entered a seventh day, with Palestinians saying at least 145 people have been killed since the conflict began on Monday, including 41 children. Israel has reported 10 dead, including two children.The 12-storey block in Gaza City brought down by Israeli air strikes housed the U.S. Associated Press and Qatar-based Al Jazeera media operations.The Israel military said it was a legitimate military target, containing Hamas military offices, and that it had given warnings to civilians to get out of the building before the attack.The strike was condemned by Al Jazeera and the AP, which asked the Israelis to put forward evidence."AP's bureau has been in this building for 15 years. We have had no indication Hamas was in the building or active in the building," the news organisation said. "We would never knowingly put our journalists at risk."The United States told Israel "that ensuring the safety and security of journalists and independent media is a paramount responsibility," White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said.U.S. President Joe Biden later spoke to both Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas in an effort to restore calm.But both Israel and Hamas insisted they would pursue their campaigns, leaving no end to the hostilities in sight despite a U.N. Security Council meeting scheduled for Sunday to discuss the worse outbreak of Israel-Palestinian violence in years."The party that bears the guilt for this confrontation is not us, it's those attacking us," Netanyahu said in a televised speech."We are still in the midst of this operation, it is still not over and this operation will continue as long as necessary."Netanyahu said Israel's air and artillery barrage had eliminated dozens of Hamas militants and taken out "hundreds" of the Islamist militant group's sites including missile launchers and a vast tunnel network.AL-AQSAHamas began its rocket assault on Monday after weeks of tensions over a court case to evict several Palestinian families in East Jerusalem, and in retaliation for Israeli police clashes with Palestinians near the city's Al-Aqsa Mosque, Islam's third holiest site, during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan.Speaking to crowds of protesters in the Qatari capital of Doha, Hamas chief Ismail Haniyeh said on Saturday the fighting was primarily about Jerusalem."The Zionists thought ... they could demolish Al-Aqsa mosque.

It said about 1,000 were intercepted by missile defences and 380 fell into the Gaza Strip.Israel has launched more than 1,000 air and artillery strikes into the densely populated coastal strip, saying they were aimed at Hamas and other militant targets.The bombardments have sent columns of smoke above Gaza City and lit up the enclave's night sky.Earlier this week the International Criminal Court's chief prosecutor, Fatou Bensouda, told Reuters the court was "monitoring very closely" the latest escalation of hostilities, amid an investigation now under way into alleged war crimes in earlier bouts of the conflict.Netanyahu accused Hamas of "committing a double war crime" by targeting civilians, and using Palestinian civilians as "human shields."The New York-based rights group Human Rights Watch said on Saturday it had "serious concerns that the attacks caused disproportionate destruction of civilian property" in Gaza.FAILED DIPLOMACYBiden's envoy, Hady Amr, arrived in Israel on Friday, before a meeting on Sunday of the U.N. Security Council.But diplomacy has so far failed to quell the worst escalation in fighting between Israel and Palestinians since 2014.The White House said Biden updated Netanyahu on "high-level" contacts with regional partners to restore calm, and raised concerns about the safety of journalists.Biden also spoke with Abbas, for the first time since the U.S. leader took office in January.But diplomatic efforts are complicated by the fact the United States and most western powers do not talk to Hamas, which they regard as a terrorist organisation. And Abbas, whose power base is in the occupied West Bank, exerts little influence over Hamas in Gaza.In Israel, the conflict has been accompanied by violence among the country's mixed communities of Jews and Arabs. Synagogues have been attacked, Arab-owned shops vandalised and street fights have broken out. Israel's president has warned of civil war.There has also been an upsurge in deadly clashes in the occupied West Bank.An Israeli soldier shot at a Palestinian motorist who tried to run over soldiers at a military checkpoint late on Saturday, the military said. Palestinian health officials said the motorist had been killed.

16-05-2021||World||UK races to test, vaccinate as B.1.167 variant spreads||Britain deployed public health officials, supported by the army, to distribute coronavirus tests door-to-door in two northern England towns on Saturday in an effort to contain a fast-spreading variant that threatens plans to lift all lockdown restrictions next month.Cases of a strain first detected in India have more than doubled in a week, defying a sharp nationwide downward trend in infections won by months of restrictions and a rapid vaccination campaign.The government’s Scientific Group for Emergencies (SAGE) says the variant detected in India, formally known as B.1.617.2, could be up to 50% more transmissible than one first recorded in southeast England last year that is now the UK’s dominant strain. But they say there is a high level of uncertainty about the exact figure.“If the virus is significantly more transmissible, we are likely to face some hard choices,” Prime Minister Boris Johnson said on Friday. “I have to level with you that this could be a serious disruption to our progress.”He said the next stage of lockdown-easing measures would take place as planned on Monday, but warned the variant might delay plans to lift all restrictions, including social distancing and face-covering rules, on June 21.More than two-thirds of British adults have received the first dose of a coronavirus vaccine, and 37% have had both doses.The government is shortening the gap between doses for people over 50 from 12 to eight weeks in a bid to give them more protection.Meanwhile, Germany’s health agency has reclassified Britain as a coronavirus “risk area” over concerns about the spread of the variant detected in India, but travellers will still be able to avoid quarantine under updated rules.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-races-to-test-vaccinate-as-b-1-167-variant-spreads-101621113512148.html
16-05-2021||World||Israeli strike flattens foreign media offices||Israel pounded Gaza on Saturday, destroying a tower block that housed news media organisations, while Palestinian rocket salvoes hit Tel Aviv with no sign of an end to almost a week of fighting. Palestinians say at least 140 people, including 39 children, have been killed in Gaza since the conflict erupted on Monday. Israel has reported 10 dead, including two children.Israel’s military brought down a 12-storey block in Gaza City that housed the Associated Press and Qatar-based Al Jazeera media operations, as well as other offices and apartments.Israel gave advance warning of the strike so it could be evacuated. The Israeli military said later the building was a legitimate military target because it contained military assets of Hamas, the Islamist group that runs Gaza.The strike was condemned by the AP and Al Jazeera. The United States told Israel “that ensuring the safety and security of journalists and independent media is a paramount responsibility,” White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said.Biden holds talks with Netanyahu, AbbasIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told US President Joe Biden in a phone call that Israel is doing everything to avoid harming non-combatants in its fighting with Hamas and other groups in Gaza.Netanyahu said proof of this was that during recent Israeli strikes on multi-storey towers “in which terrorist targets were attacked by the IDF (military), the non-combatants were evacuated”, a summary of the phone call released by Netanyahu’s office said.Biden also spoke directly with Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas on Saturday, Abbas’ office said, the first time the two leaders have spoken since Biden took office in January.Diplomacy has so far failed to quell the worst escalation in fighting between Israel and Palestinians since 2014. In Tel Aviv, residents fled for cover amid wailing sirens as Hamas militants fired barrages of rockets. One hit a residential block in the Ramat Gan suburb, killing a 50-year old man, medics said.The group said the salvoes responded to overnight strikes on Gaza’s Beach refugee camp, where a woman and four of her children were killed when her house was hit. Five others died, medics said. Israel said it targeted an apartment used by Hamas.Thousands rally to mark 1948 war ‘catastrophe’Palestinians, who each year on May 15 mark the 73rd anniversary of the “Nakba” or Catastrophe Day, their displacement in the 1948-49 war that accompanied the creation of the modern state of Israel, clashed with police across the occupied West Bank on Saturday. Medics reported 29 Palestinians injured, 17 of them by live fire.In London, several thousand protesters carrying placards reading “Stop Bombing Gaza” and chanting “Free Palestine” converged on Marble Arch, near the British capital’s Hyde Park, to march towards the Israeli embassy. Hundreds of demonstrators gathered in the Iraqi capital of Baghdad, and southern provinces of Babylon, Dhi Qar, Diwanieh and Basrato stand in solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza and Jerusalem.

China has contended the Dalai Lama’s successor should be chosen by picking lots from a golden urn in Lhasa and must get the approval of the Chinese government but this has been debunked by the current Dalai Lama, who turns 86 in July.“The successor to the Dalai Lama is chosen through a Tibetan Buddhist concept and it’s a deeply religious matter, and the Dalai Lama alone is responsible for his reincarnation,” Tsering said ahead of his formal swearing in later this month.Noting that the Chinese government can have no say in this matter, he added: “If the Chinese Communist leaders are so interested in this issue, then they should learn Buddhism first. Only then they can involve themselves in this matter.”“If they don’t even believe in religion, how can they get involved in religious matters?”The question of the Dalai Lama’s successor depends on “individual choices” and the current Dalai Lama will have the final say, Tsering said. “He will decide, he is the final authority.”The Biden administration recently made it clear that the Chinese government should have no role in the succession process of the Dalai Lama, and Tsering noted that his election had been acknowledged by the US state department.Experts say India and the US have largely similar positions on the Dalai Lama’s succession.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/no-role-for-china-in-choosing-dalai-lama-s-successor-says-new-head-of-tibetan-govtinexile-101621084564186.html
16-05-2021||India||Western coast on edge as cyclone intensifies||Heavy rain, high tidal waves and winds gusting up to 140-165 kmph swept past India’s western coast as the severe cyclonic storm Tauktae hurled towards Gujarat’s coast, gaining intensity and causing extensive damage in coastal areas of three other states on its way.At least six people – two in Goa and four in Karnataka – died in rain-related incidents and dozens more were injured on Sunday, state officials said.Hundreds of houses were damaged due to rain and water-logging, trees uprooted and electricity supply disrupted in parts of Kerala, Karnataka and Goa – which bore the brunt of the storm’s intensity on Sunday. Maharashtra and Gujarat, next in the storm’s path, also stepped up efforts to prepare for possible impact.“Tauktae will intensify further while on its track and cross the Gujarat coast with a speed of 155 to 165kmph gusting to 185kmph. We are not expecting it to become a super cyclone but it is a big and intense system,” said Sunitha Devi, incharge of cyclones at the India Meteorological Department (IMD).Hundreds of people were evacuated from coastal regions across the states, which are also burdened by the Covid-19 pandemic.Around a hundred teams of the National Disaster Rescue Force (NDRF), teams of the Indian Army, Navy and Coast Guard along with ships and aircraft have been deployed for rescue and relief operations.Weather scientists on Sunday warned that Cyclone Tauktae – which has been categorised as a “very severe” cyclonic storm – is gaining intensity and is likely to make landfall on Gujarat’s coast with wind speeds up to 155-185kmph by Tuesday afternoon.According to IMD, large-scale destruction is expected over Porbandar, Amreli, Junagarh, Gir, Somnath, Botad, Bhavnagar and coastal areas of Ahmedabad in Gujarat.The cyclone, which began as a low pressure area over Lakshadweep and southeast Arabian sea earlier, turned into a depression and evolved into a cyclone moving towards the north on Saturday. “Tauktae intensified by 65kmph in the last 24 hours, fuelled by heat and energy from the ocean,” Roxy Mathew Koll, a climate scientist at the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology, said on Sunday.Union home minister Amit Shah on Sunday held a meeting with chief ministers of Gujarat, Maharashtra and the administrator of Daman and Diu, and Dadra Nagar Haveli to review preparedness before the cyclone makes its presence felt higher up along the western coast.At the meeting, Shah directed the state governments to ensure there is adequate power back-up in all facilities that are dealing with Covid-19 patients. The minister also asked the Maharashtra and Gujarat governments to keep a plan ready for buffer stock of medical-grade oxygen for at least two days in case of any disruption in supply.“A 24x7 control room is functioning in MHA, which can be contacted at any time for any assistance by the States. Indian Coast Guard, the Navy, Army and Air Force units have also been put on standby and surveillance aircraft and helicopters are carrying out aerial sorties,” Shah said, according to a statement.Four deaths were reported from Karnataka’s Uttara Kannada, Udupi, Chikkamagaluru and Shivamogga districts in cyclone-related incidents on Saturday.In Kerala, where thunderstorms began on Friday night, there was widespread water-logging and the state government sounded an alert after water levels rose in several dams across the state.Strong winds and heavy rain lashed parts of Goa on Sunday morning, killing two people in related accidents along with snapping electricity supply and uprooting trees.“Two people lost their lives – a woman, in her 30s, died after a coconut tree fell on her in north Goa’s Mapusa and a scooter passenger in Marcel (also in north Goa) succumbed to injuries after being hit by an electric pole,” chief minister Pramod Sawant said at a press briefing in Panaji on Sunday.Power supply in a majority of areas in Goa was disrupted as hundreds of electric poles were uprooted due to the high-speed winds, state power minister Nilesh Cabral told PTI.“Many high tension 33 KV feeders are down due to the falling of trees. Even the 220 KV lines bringing power to Goa from neighbouring Maharashtra have been damaged,” he said.“Our force has been working since last night to clear the roads and remove trees which have fallen on the power lines,” said Ashok Menon, director of the fire and emergency services in the state.In Karnataka, more than 98 villages in seven districts -- including Uttara Kannada, Dakshina Kannada, Kodagu and Hassan – reported widespread damage after heavy rains, State Disaster Management Authority officials said.Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray on Saturday sounded an alert for Mumbai and the four coastal districts of Palghar, Raigad, Ratnagiri and Sindhudurg. The authorities also said that the people living near the coast were shifted to temporary relief shelters.In Gujarat, where the cyclone is now heading, the government mobilised the authorities on Sunday to shift around 150,000 people out of low-lying areas and deployed over 50 NDRF and SDRF teams. “With the cyclone likely to affect power supply, hospitals treating Covid-19 patients have been asked to ensure power back-up. Arrangements have also been made to ensure uninterrupted generation of medical oxygen in the eight manufacturing units and buffer stock is also created,” chief minister Vijay Rupani told reporters in Gandhinagar.Maharashtra CM Thackeray assured the Union home minister at the meeting on Sunday that measures to ensure Covid-19 patients are not affected by the cyclone had been put in place.However, the cyclone appears to have hit the vaccination drive across the affected states. Officials in Karnataka, Gujarat and Goa said vaccinations against Covid-19 were suspended in multiple areas on Sunday.Experts have warned that natural disasters the world over are becoming more frequent and deadlier as a by-product of global warming.“With cyclone Tauktae, this will be the fourth consecutive year of pre-monsoon cyclone over the Arabian Sea. This is also the third consecutive year when a cyclone has come very close to the west coast of India. Sea Surface Temperatures in Arabian sea have increased rapidly during the past century and this has led to an increase in the frequency and intensity of cyclones in the Arabian Sea…global warming has presented us with new challenges such as rapid intensification of cyclones, which need to be closely monitored at higher resolution and accuracy using on-site platforms such as buoys and moorings. Improving the Indian Ocean Observing System (IndOOS) and incorporating the global warming signals in the weather models can help us tackle the challenges of intense cyclones in the future,” Koll said on Sunday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/western-coast-on-edge-as-cyclone-intensifies-101621187930875.html

Details of the patients were awaited, he added. Of the new Covid-19 infections reported on Saturday, Patna topped with 1,103 cases, followed by Gaya 381, Samastipur 331, East Champaran 297, Begusarai 270, Madhubani 267, Supaul 240, and Araria 236, among other districts. Bihar’s test positivity ratio (TPR), which is the people testing positive for the virus out of the total tested, had declined to 6.7% on May 15, the lowest this month. Bihar’s TPR was 15.6% when it went in for a 10-day lockdown on May 5. The state’s lockdown has since been extended to May 25. The average growth rate of Covid-19 infection between May 8 and 15 also slid to 1.5%. Bihar inoculated 1,09,706 people against Covid-19 on Sunday as against 1,24,104 people on Saturday and 1,16,441 on Friday because of closure of many vaccination session sites. Bihar health minister Mangal Pandey said 14,000 vials of Liposomal Amphotericin-B injection, a specific drug for treatment of cases of mucormycosis, were made available to the health department through the World Health Organisation. Some hospitals had earlier claimed that the injection was not available in the state and they had written to the state drug controller about it. Around 6,000 vials of injection from this stock were made available to different hospitals in the state. These include AIIMS-Patna (2000 vials), IGIMS, Patna Medical College Hospital, Nalanda Medical College Hospital, Jawaharlal Nehru Medical College Hospital, Bhagalpur (300 vials each), Darbhanga Medical College Hospital, Government Medical College Hospital, Bettiah,, Anugrah Narayan Magadh Medical College Hospital, Gaya, Vardhaman Institute of Medical Sciences, Pawapuri (200 each) and 1,600 vials to the Rajendra Memorial Research Institute of Medical Sciences (RMRIMS), Patna. Pandey said that injections for patients admitted at private facilities would be stored at the RMRIMS. Around 24 cases of black fungus, associated with Covid-19, have so far been reported in the state. He also said that 37,430 doses of Remdesivir, for treatment of coronavirus patients, had been made available to various district hospitals while 50,321 doses were available in Patna.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/2-more-black-fungus-cases-detected-covid-19-cases-dip-in-bihar-101621187228046.html

16-05-2021||India||500 Kerala nurses stranded in UAE after agents lure them with jobs||Nearly 500 nurses from Kerala who were promised high salaries and other perks were reportedly stranded in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) after recruiting agents allegedly cheated them. Some of them have returned but others are still stranded and they said they were forced to work as home nurses and masseurs in parlours. One of them, Reen Rajan (30) said she applied for the job after she came across an advertisement in leading newspapers that UAE was recruiting nurses on urgent basis in view of the pandemic situation and Keralites would be given preference. She said she had to cough up ₹2.30 lakh to the agent and later she was granted a visit visa. When asked about this, she said, the agent had told her that a work visa would be granted once they reach the UAE. “We were kept in dingy rooms for about a month. Some of them have returned after they got to know they were cheated. We had been recruited by a Kochi-based agency ‘Take Off” two months back. Now these agents are saying we can work in care homes and massage parlours,” said Reena Rajan, who quit her job with a private hospital in Kollam to take up the new assignment. She said she had sent a letter to chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan narrating her plight and had also taken up the issue with her legislator K B Ganesh Kumar. Her brother Rijo Rajan, who works in Kollam said, after he came to know about his sister’s plight he made inquiries about the agency and found that its proprietor Firoze Khan was allegedly involved in another case of cheating and was in jail for some time. He said after his release he closed his agency “Keydot” and started a fresh one “Take Off” to cheat gullible aspirants. Most of the stranded nurses said they paid between ₹2-4 lakh to get the visa. “Some of us have taken a loan to pay up. They know our precarious financial situation and so they are forcing us to do odd jobs. We were promised a pay packet of ₹one lakh and accommodation and they showed us some videos of nurses recruited by them. We were asked not to disclose it to anyone as recruitment of nurses was only permitted through government-approved agencies in the state,” another nurse Susan Saji said. Some of them said they had applied after they were told that there were enough vacancies and many hospitals needed nurses urgently due to the pandemic situation. To contain the exploitation of such job aspirants, earlier both the Union and state governments had constituted special agencies for their recruitment--- in Kerala nurses are recruited through the Overseas Development and Employment Promotion Consultants Ltd and Non-Residents Keralites Affairs. When contacted the CM’s office said it is yet to know about their complaint. Despite such approved agencies, many aspirants approach such dubious agents and get cheated. Last year, the Kerala police had busted a gang that recruited models to the middle-east countries and later force to become escorts and gold carriers. Once land up in foreign countries, these gang members seize passport and other documents and helpless will be forced to toe their diktats.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/500-kerala-nurses-stranded-in-uae-after-agents-lure-them-with-jobs-101621185008002.html

There has been a rise in such misinformation in the state of Haryana."The letter stated that there have been incidences in Haryana wherein the farmer groups are also getting agitated over the myth of linking the Covid-19 pandemic with 5G services.Several farmers from Punjab, Haryana and western Uttar Pradesh have been sitting on three borders near Delhi for about six months demanding repeal of the new three farm laws.The Association said, "We would like to state that such misinformation or rumors being spread are baseless, and there is no evidence or fact to suggest that there is any harmful effect of the 5G services with relation to Covid-19."The letter has also quoted the World Health Organization's (WHO) statement saying that "viruses cannot travel on radio waves or mobile networks. Covid-19 is spreading in various countries which do not have 5G networks."COAI has also requested the chief secretary to instruct the district authorities to safeguard telecom infrastructure and related assets and take tough action against miscreants spreading such misinformation.In Uttar Pradesh also, such rumours were being spread, following which the UP Police headquarters wrote a letter to all the commissioners of the state, issuing instructions to them to take strict action against those spreading rumours. After this, such rumours in UP have decreased, the COAI said.Recently, following such rumours, the Department of Telecommunications (DoT) in its statement said these messages are false.It stated that the public is informed that there is no connection between 5G technology and the outbreak of Covid-19. And, public is urged not to be misguided by the false information and rumours being spread in this matter, the statement added.The DoT also clarified that testing of the 5G network has not even started anywhere in India.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/telecom-operators-urge-haryana-govt-to-curb-rumours-linking-covid-spread-to-5g-101621183169355.html

According to the Cyclone Warning Division of the IMD, by May 18 the wind speed is expected to increase to 150-160 km per hour, gusting up to 175 km per hour.An estimated 1.5 lakh people are being shifted from low-lying coastal areas in Gujarat while 54 teams of the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) and State Disaster Response Force (SDRF) have been deployed in the state.Maharashtra too was bracing for the storm as the Met department predicted heavy to very heavy rains at isolated places in north Konkan, Mumbai, Thane and Palghar and extremely heavy rainfall in Raigad on Monday.The water level in many dams across Kerala showed a rising trend after heavy rains in the catchment areas, prompting authorities to sound an alert.Four deaths were reported from Karnataka’s Uttara Kannada, Udupi, Chikkamagaluru and Shivamogga districts and two in Goa in cyclone-related incidents.Gusty winds and heavy rains started lashing several parts of Goa since Saturday night disrupting power supply in a large part of the state.Chief Minister Pramod Sawant said the major impact of the cyclonic winds was felt in Bardez taluka in North Goa district and Mormugao in South Goa.He said there was power disruption for some time at the Goa Medical College and Hospital (GMCH), where Covid-19 patients are undergoing treatment, but it did not affect the functioning."Hundreds of houses suffered major damage due to the cyclonic winds. Some highways were blocked at several points after trees got uprooted. However, the roads were cleared by the disaster management teams," Sawant said.The power supply was disrupted as electric poles were uprooted due to the high-speed winds, state Power Minister Nilesh Cabral told PTI."Many high tension 33 KV feeders are down due to the falling of trees. Even the 220 KV lines bringing power to Goa from neighbouring Maharashtra have been damaged," he said.The electricity department deployed its full force for the restoration work, but it was getting hampered due to the strong winds, he said.In Karnataka, over 70 villages in seven districts including Dakshina Kannada, Kodagu and Hassan have been affected by the cyclone, the Karnataka State Disaster Management Authority officials said.The highest rainfall of 385 mm was recorded at Nada Station in Kundapura taluk of Udupi district, which was the worst affected, and 15 stations recorded more than 200 mm of rainfall in the district.Officials said nearly a dozen relief camps are functioning in the state.

According to the state government, at least nine districts have been severely affected by sea incursion.The Thrissur district administration said spillway shutters of the Peringalkuthu dam will be opened if the water level crosses the permitted limit of 419.41 metres. In a statement, the administration has urged the people living on the banks of Chalakudy river to be cautious.Shutters of Malankara dam in Idukki district will be opened on Sunday, as the water level has increased, the district authorities said.Families living in coastal areas and low-lying areas of the state have been shifted to relief camps.Indian Navy deployed its diving and quick reaction teams in the coastal village of Chellanam in Ernakulam district, which was heavily hit by tidal waves. The teams, braving harsh weather conditions, undertook rescue and rehabilitation of people who were trapped in houses.High tidal waves have also lashed Kaipamangalam, Chavakkad and Kodungallur in Thrissur, Pallithura in Thiruvananthapuram, Thrikkannapuzha in Alappuzha and Beypore and Koyilandy in Kozhikode districts.The cyclone, which is the first this year, has added to the woes of the states which are already grappling with the devastating third wave of Covid.IMD Director General M Mohapatra said the cyclone has seen a rapid intensification.The gradual intensification stages are cyclonic storm, severe cyclonic storm, very severe cyclonic storm, extremely severe storm and super cyclonic storm.The National Crisis Management Committee (NCMC) headed by Cabinet Secretary Rajiv Gauba met on Sunday in the national capital, where the top bureaucrat of the country directed agencies to ensure "uninterrupted" functioning of the Covid hospitals in the states affected by Cyclone Tauktae and secure "zero loss" of lives.Home Minister Amit Shah reviewed the preparedness for Cyclone Tauktae in Gujarat, Maharashtra and the Union territories of Daman and Diu and Dadra and Nagar Havel and "specifically" stressed that all health facilities, including those for Covid-19 treatment, falling in the affected areas should be secured along with the patients.Shah also advised them to ensure adequate stocks of all essential medicines and supplies in the hospitals, keeping in view a likely disruption in the movement of vehicles, a statement issued by the Union home ministry said.Prime Minister Narendra Modi had on Saturday reviewed the preparedness of states, central ministries and agencies concerned to deal with the situation arising out of Cyclone Tauktae.Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray said an alert has been sounded in coastal districts of the state and the administration is prepared to ensure uninterrupted electricity and oxygen supply in Covid-19 hospitals.The IMD said Tauktae would cross Gujarat’s coast between Porbandar and Mahuva in Bhavnagar district by early Tuesday morning and tidal waves are likely to inundate several coastal districts during the landfall."The very severe cyclonic storm Tauktae over the east-central Arabian Sea moved nearly northwards with a speed of about 11 kmph during the past six hours," it said."It is very likely to intensify during the next 24 hours. It is very likely to move north-northwestwards and reach the Gujarat coast in the evening hours of May 17 and cross the state coast between Porbandar and Mahuva in Bhavnagar district around May 18 early morning," the IMD said.With the cyclone intensifying, the wind speed along and off Gujarat coasts in Porbandar, Junagadh, Gir Somnath and Amreli districts will reach 150-160 kmph gusting to 175 kmph by Tuesday morning.It will reach a speed of 120-150 kmph gusting to 165 kmph over Devbhoomi Dwarka, Jamnagar, Bhavnagar districts during the same period, the IMD said."Gale winds with speed reaching 70-80 kmph gusting to 90 kmph are likely to prevail along and off Valsad, Navsari, Surat, Bharuch, southern parts of Ahmedabad, and Anand districts, as well as Dadra, Nagar Haveli, Daman (Union Territories) from May 17 midnight till Tuesday morning," it said.The sea conditions will become "very rough to high" along and off the south Gujarat coast from Monday morning, and "very high to phenomenal" from Monday midnight.A tidal wave of about 3 metres, 1-2.5 metres above the astronomical tide, is likely to inundate several coastal areas of the state during the time of the landfall, it said.Heavy to very heavy rainfall in isolated places was likely over Saurashtra and Kutch and Diu on Monday, and extremely heavy rainfall at isolated places on Tuesday, according to IMD.The Indian Coast Guard said on Sunday evening hat all fishing boats have reached their harbours in Maharashtra and Gujarat."With the cyclone likely to affect power supply, hospitals treating Covid-19 patients have been asked to ensure power back-up. Arrangements have also been made to ensure uninterrupted generation of medical oxygen in the eight manufacturing units and buffer stock has also been created," Chief Minister Vijay Rupani told reporters after attending a cyclone review meeting in Gandhingar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cyclone-tauktae-intensifies-6-dead-gujarat-braces-for-impact-101621181807736.html

The second batch of Sputnik V, containing 60,000 vaccine doses, arrived in Hyderabad on Sunday. The first consignment of 1.50 lakh doses arrived in India on May 1.Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh on Sunday asked government officials to explore whether Sputnik V can be procured as used for the inoculation of people between the age group of 18 and 44 years.While the imported doses are likely to be available in the coming week, Dr Reddy's Laboratories will be manufacturing the vaccine soon — tentatively from July.According to the agreement between Dr Reddy's Laboratories and the Russian Direct Investment Fund, the Indian company is expecting 36 million doses from Russia in several tranches. According to the health ministry's estimate, 15.6 crore doses of the Sputnik vaccine will be available in India between August and December 2021.Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Saturday said his government has written to Dr Reddy's Laboratories asking by what time it will be able to supply 67 lakh doses to the Capital.Sputnik V is the third vaccine approved to be administered and sold in India, after Serum Institute's Covishield and Bharat Biotech's Covaxin.The vaccine has recently been soft-launched in India, as Dr Reddy's administered the first jab on May 14. This vaccine uses two different vectors for the two shots and its efficacy, according to the Lancet, is 91.6 per cent.The vaccine is presently priced at ₹995.4 per dose, including GST, which makes it cheaper than Covaxin for private hospitals. Bharat Biotech's Covaxin is priced at ₹1,200 for private hospitals. Sputnik V doses that will be produced in the country may cost less, Dr Reddy's has said.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhi-punjab-looking-forward-to-sputnik-v-amid-covid-19-vaccine-shortage-101621178523740.html

16-05-2021||India||First batch of DRDO's anti-Covid drug 2-DG to be released tomorrow||The first batch of drug 2-deoxy-D-glucose drug to treat Covid-19 patients, developed by the Defence Research and Development Organisation in collaboration with Hyderabad's dr Reddy's Limited, will be launched on May 17, marking a landmark in India's fight against the Covid-19 pandemic. Defence minister Rajnath Singh and health minister Dr Harsh Vardhan will release the first batch of the drug.Early this month, the drug, which is a glucose analogue, was cleared by the Drug Controller General of India for emergency use as an adjunct therapy for Covid-19 patients. The results of clinical trials, which were conducted in several states, showed that this 2-DG molecule helps in faster recovery of hospitalised patients and also reduces oxygen dependence. A higher proportion of patients treated with 2-DG showed RT-PCR negative conversion in COVID patients, the government said.Covid-19 hospitals, oxygen generation, 2-DG drug: How DRDO has pitched in to tackle second wavePreparation for developing a drug meant for Covid-19 treatment began in April 2020, during the first wave of the pandemic, when DRDO scientists conducted laboratory experiments with the help of the Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology, Hyderabad and found that this molecule works effectively against the SARS-CoV-2 virus and inhibits the viral growth.Between May to October 2020, phase 2 trials were conducted and the drug was found to be safe in Covid-19 patients. The second phase trial was conducted in two parts on 110 patients — first in six hospitals and the second in 11 hospitals.The third phase clinical trial was conducted on 220 patients between December 2020 and March 2021 at 27 Covid hospitals in Delhi, Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal, Gujarat, Rajasthan, Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu.In the trials, patients treated with this drug recovered around 2.5 days earlier than those under standard treatment. A significantly higher proportion of patients improved symptomatically and became free from supplemental oxygen dependence (42% vs 31%) by day 3 in comparison to SoC, indicating an early relief from Oxygen therapy/dependence, the government said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/first-batch-of-drdo-s-anti-covid-drug-2-dg-to-be-released-tomorrow-101621172353471.html

16-05-2021||India||Three Bengal BJP legislators detained, traders held for flouting lockdown||Three Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) legislators were detained in Siliguri town and a few people were held in several districts for violating restrictions imposed on shops and commercial establishments as a 15-day partial lockdown began successfully in Bengal on Sunday. Streets across the state wore a deserted look. Three newly-elected BJP lawmakers from north Bengal, Sankhar Ghosh from Siliguri, Sikha Chatterjee from Dabgram-Fulbari and Anandamoy Burman from Matigara-Naxalbari, were detained by the police when they started a sit-in demonstration at Hafdar Hashmi Chowk in Siliguri demanding better handling of healthcare facilities in the wake of a sharp spike in Coronavirus infections in the region. “The three legislators were detained because there is a ban on political assembly. They were released later,” an officer from Siliguri police station said on condition of anonymity. Former Trinamool Congress (TMC) minister Gautam Deb, who has been made administrator of the Siliguri Municipal Corporation following his defeat at Dabgram-Fulbari, said, “The BJP MLAs acted irresponsibly only to be in the news.” Police detained several people in other parts of Bengal for violating lockdown restrictions. Some people were arrested as well. Although there is a ban on all modes of transport, including local trains, buses and Kolkata Metro, many people were caught driving personal vehicles. Some grocery stores were shut down by the authorities in Kolkata, East Burdwan, East Midnapore, North 24 Parganas (a district with high infection rate), Purulia and Hooghly districts as the owners were found to be operating beyond the stipulated time of 7 to 10 am. Two employees of a gymnasium at Srirampore in Hooghly district were detained for letting a few members enter through the back door. The Bengal government on Saturday said sweetmeat shops can operate from 10 am to 5 pm. Owners of four shops that opened before time were arrested at Dantan in East Midnapore. At Park Circus in Kolkata, a milk van was detained for carrying some migrant labourers. The passengers told the police that they were trying to reach Howrah station to catch a Bihar-bound train. Flights and inter-state trains have been exempted from the lockdown.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/three-bengal-bjp-legislators-detained-traders-held-for-flouting-lockdown-101621169467314.html

The company formally commenced production of medical oxygen on Thursday and the very next day, the facility in Tuticorin, about 600kms from here, suffered a jolt in operations after developing a 'technical snag'. In a statement shared on the micro-blogging site on Sunday, Sterlite Copper said, "efforts to resume production at our oxygen plant are progressing". "Today, an expert team from the Indian Space Research Organisation arrived at the premises to support our ongoing efforts and collaborate with our technical team." The expert team has suggested some measures to fix the snag and resume production of oxygen. "This has helped fastrack the repair process for which we are thankful to the local administration, which was instrumental in facilitating this cooperative effort to recommence our oxygen production," Vedanta said. The facility, on May 13, began producing medical oxygen to meet the demand for the life-saving gas following a surge in Covid cases in the state. The first set of oxygen tankers have been dispatched to the beneficiaries. The Sterlite copper smelter plant was accorded approval by the then AIADMK government on April 26 at an all-party meeting to produce medical oxygen at its facility for a period of four months at the facility in Tuticorin. The unit was sealed by the state government in May 2018, days after 13 agitators who were part of a protest against the company over environmental concerns, were killed in police firing during a violent anti-Sterlite stir in the southern district.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/isro-team-at-sterlite-copper-plant-to-help-fix-snag-affecting-oxygen-production-101621166836977.html

While Bharat Biotech itself is ramping up the production, the Centre has created additional ways to boost the production as it has already entered into agreements with three public sector undertakings that will get the technology from Bharat Biotech and will manufacture the vaccines at their own facilities. Talks are on with several others, the Centre has recently said.3 PSUs will produce one crore doses each every monthHyderabad's Indian Immunologicals Limited, Uttar Pradesh's Bharat Immunologicals and Biologicals Corporation and Mumbai's Haffkine Institute for Training will start producing Covaxin. "Our teams went and assessed the situation. Agreements were signed, they were explained about the technology. It is because of these efforts that arrangements have been formalised. A lot of thinking, efforts and arrangements have gone into this," Niti Aayog (health) member VK Paul said on Saturday.2 firms, Gujarat institute to scale up Covaxin productionPrivate firms are also welcome, the government has said. Even Serum Institute, the manufacturer of Covishield, and the world's biggest vaccine maker is also welcome to take up manufacturing of Covaxin.Gujarat firm will also produce CovaxinThe Gujarat government, along with Hester Biosciences and OmniBRx, has approached the Centre expressing interest in getting the technology from Bharat Biotech. If everything works, 20 million doses of Covaxin are estimated to be produced from Gujarat. "A triparty consortium has been formed with the Government of Gujarat as the lead partner, to explore the prospects of manufacturing the Covid vaccine through technology from Bharat Biotech," Hester Biosciences CEO and MD Rajiv Gandhi said in a statement, as quoted by news agency PTI.Bharat Biotech getting a new facility in KarnatakaKarnataka will soon have a manufacturing plant of Bharat Biotech's Covaxin in Maluru industrial area, near Kolara district, which is 80 km from Bengaluru. Construction works have already started, the state government said.Why many labs can't produce CovaxinCovaxin production deals with live inactivated virus.

Professor Abu Qamar, 75, the former dean of the Faculty of Medicine in the Jawaharlal Nehru Medical College and Hospital died here on Sunday of Covid-19 after battling it for nearly three weeks, JNMC Principal Shahid Ali Siddiqui said. Prof Qamar died two days after AMU’s former proctor, Prof Nasim Beg, 76, died in a New Delhi hospital where he was shifted to and admitted after his condition worsened here, his family members said. At least 38 AMU teachers, including 21 serving ones, have died of Covid or Covid-like symptoms in the last one month, triggering doubts if any new deadly strain of the virus has been in circulation on the AMU campus. These doubts also prompted the varsity’s JNMC authorities to send Covid-19 samples from the AMU campus and its neighbouring Civil Lines area for genome sequencing to the CSIR-Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology in New Delhi. No new strain of coronavirus has been detected in samples sent for genome sequencing to the CSIR in New Delhi, said a senior JNMC official, in a relief to the hospital’s beleaguered staff who have been on the edge following a large number of deaths of the serving and retired AMU employees. Prof Haris Manzoor Khan, the head of the JNMC’s Department of Microbiology and the principal investigator of the AMU’s Viral Research and Diagnostic Laboratory, said out of the 20 samples sent to CSIR for genome sequencing, 18 (90 percent) had B.1.617.2 lineage referred to as the double mutation variant, first identified in Maharashtra on October 5, 2020. It is a subtype of B.1.617 variant which is the main virus circulating in the second wave of Covid-19 in Uttar Pradesh, he added. The WHO has described it as a “Variant of Concern” because of its higher transmissibility and reduced neutralization from pre-existing antibodies, he said. B.1.617 has a higher growth rate than other circulating variants suggesting a potentially increased rate of transmission.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-new-virus-strain-behind-spate-of-covid-19-deaths-in-amu-says-official-101621167381987.html

Health experts say many cases are going undetected in the state's villages, home to the bulk of its people.In the memo, Singh said a lack of funds for materials such as firewood for cremation, religious beliefs in some communities, and families abandoning victims for fear of the disease were among the likely reasons for the surge in dumping.He asked village-level officials to ensure no corpses were thrown into water and said the state government would pay poor families 5,000 rupees ($68) each to cremate or bury the bodies of the dead.The state has also asked police to patrol rivers to stop the practice.India has been officially reporting about 4,000 daily deaths from the disease for nearly two weeks, but health experts say the toll is probably much higher because of factors such as poor testing in rural areas.The jump in deaths has led to backlogs at crematoriums in many places and multiplied the cost of last rites.On Saturday, Uttar Pradesh spokesman Navneet Sehgal denied media reports that as many as 2,000 corpses of possible virus victims had been pulled from rivers in the state and neighbouring Bihar in recent days."We keep recovering 10 to 20 bodies every now and then," Sehgal told Reuters, adding that some riverside villages did not cremate their dead due to Hindu traditions during some periods of religious significance.Bihar officials did not respond to requests for comment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bodies-of-covid-19-victims-among-those-dumped-in-ganga-river-govt-101621165753886.html

16-05-2021||India||Bodies found buried in sand on banks of Ganga in UP's Prayagraj||More bodies were found buried in the sand on the banks of the Ganga in Uttar Pradesh's Prayagraj district.The discovery has caused panic among people living in nearby areas.Scores of decomposing bodies laid uncovered in the Sangam area."For the last 2-3 months, people have been burying their dead here. Sand covering the bodies is blown away by strong winds, exposing the decomposing bodies. Predatory birds and dogs feast gather and feast on the remains. The government should make arrangements for proper burials," a local, Dina Yadav told ANI.Others have expressed concerns that the corpses will spread more diseases."The government should be more careful, especially during this pandemic, as this can spread more diseases to people and worsen the situation. People are helpless. Many are poor and do not have the resources for a proper burial. The government should see to this as well," said Sanjay Srivastava, another nearby resident.Despite repeated attempts, district officials have refused to comment on the matter.Locals have also voiced concerns that the sanctity of the holy river is being compromised, as devotees have stopped taking holy baths due to the foul smell that has worsened over the days."At least 400-500 bodies have been buried here. This is a sacred place where people used to come to take holy baths. People no longer like to come here. The government should ensure that this matter is taken care of," said Kunwar Jeet Tivar.Similar scenes were witnessed in UP's Unnao district, after which a team of the local police carried out an inquiry to find more bodies.In the last week, Ghazipur and Bihar's Buxar too have seen grim incidents of bloated, decomposing bodies floating in the river. Many washed up on the shores while some were pulled up by stray dogs.While it remains unconfirmed if the bodies in Prayagaraj are of COVID-19 patients, nearby residents have said such scenes have never been witnessed before and only started with the second COVID wave."We have never seen such a sight near the river Ganga before. There are thousands of bodies here. The government should follow 'Swachh Bharat' and maintain cleanliness in the area," said Sanjay Srivastav.As per the union health ministry, there are currently 1,93,815 active COVID-19 cases in Uttar Pradesh. A total of 13,85,855 patients have recovered so far and 16,957 deaths have been reported since the beginning of the pandemic.According to the district administration, 165 fresh cases, 521 recoveries and nine deaths were reported in Prayagraj on Saturday.

16-05-2021||India||Delhi extends lockdown by a week even as cases dip to 6K. Kejriwal explains why||After witnessing record Covid-19 cases close to 30,000 last month, the national capital has decided to strictly follow the lockdown strategy till the cases come down to permit regular function of Delhi. Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Sunday extended the ongoing lockdown by another week which will now end at 5am on May 24, stating that the recovery made cannot be lost by rushing to open the national capital for people.The gains made so far in fighting Covid-19 cannot be lost suddenly due to any relaxations now, Kejriwal said.With the positivity rate shooting past the 30 per cent-mark, Delhi went into lockdown on April 20 in a bid as the CM warned that the fourth wave in the city-state is dangerous and people will have to stay indoors to save lives.The positivity rate in Delhi rose to its highest (35%) on April 26 but has gradually come down in the last 21 days.Also read: Covaxin effective against coronavirus strains found in India, UKExplaining the reason behind extending the lockdown, Kejriwal said the number of Covid-19 cases is decreasing in Delhi and recovery has increased but "we do not want to lose this gain, therefore, lockdown is extended".In the past 24 hours, Kejriwal said Delhi has reported around 6,500 cases and the positivity rate has come down to 10% from 11%.According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the positivity rate needs to come down below 5% for the outbreak to be considered under control.The CM said that the signs of recovery can be seen in Delhi's Covid-19 case trajectory. "I hope in the next week, there will be greater recovery. As far as I can understand, Delhi is slowly coming back on track. The lockdown is to continue as it is, no concessions will be given."Addressing the concerns of vaccine shortage in Delhi, CM said that the AAP-led government has written both to the Centre and the two companies to provide the vaccine.However, there is no indication of the vaccine being given to us, Kejriwal said.The coronavirus cases in the national capital were recorded to be around 6,500 for the second day in a row, indicating that Delhi may have arrested to some degree the "fourth wave" of the coronavirus outbreak.Also read: Shiv Sena accuses Modi government of Covid-19 mismanagementThe lockdown imposed on April 19 has been extended for the fourth time till May 24 morning.

16-05-2021||India||Shiv Sena accuses Modi government of Covid-19 mismanagement||Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut has accused the BJP-led Central and Uttar Pradesh governments of mismanaging the Covid-19 crisis while citing instances of behaviour encouraging ‘superstition’ instead of a scientific approach to deal with the pandemic.Sena MP Sanjay Raut alleged in his weekly column Rokthok, in party mouthpiece Saamana, that while citizens were unable to give a decent cremation to their dear ones and were disposing of the bodies in Ganga river, the ruling party indulged in religious slogans and superstition.“In Varanasi, the dead bodies have piled up and there is no place to cremate them. We are seeing hundreds of bodies floating in the river which were found in Bihar. In Ayodhya, the Prime Minister conducted the Bhoomi Pujan for the Ram Mandir a few months ago, but now Covid-19 has caused huge havoc there. There is a shortage of oxygen, medicines, hospitals and vaccines and all that the state government in Uttar Pradesh is doing is sloganeering ‘Jai Shri Ram’. This may provide oxygen to a political party but not for the hassled people,” said Raut.Hundreds of bodies of suspected Covid-19 victims have been found floating mostly in river Ganga over the past few days in Uttar Pradesh and Bihar. The Bihar government has claimed that the bodies were carried downstream from Uttar Pradesh. The National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) has issued a notice to both states and the Supreme Court has been requested to order a probe into the matter.“A state minister is asking citizens to perform Yagna so that Covid-19 can be destroyed which is shocking. Some are advocating applying cow dung while others are consuming cow urine to fight Covid-19. What more can happen when our own prime minister is advocating fighting the Covid-19 virus by clapping and banging the utensils,” Raut said.BJP leader and Madhya Pradesh culture minister Usha Thakur was in news recently for suggesting the Hindu ritual could help prevent the third wave of Covid-19 and some people were seen smearing themselves with cow dung and urine in Ahmedabad in the belief that it could boost immunity against Covid-19.Raut said the Modi government was more focussed on providing security to their newly elected legislators in West Bengal than containing the virus.“...It was the duty of the state government, and Mamata Banerjee should have been given the chance but this was not done. The whole motive was to keep their MLAs in check through this mechanism so that they don’t defect back to Mamata,” Raut said.As per the latest data released on Saturday, Karnataka has reported the highest daily new cases at 41,664 followed by Maharashtra with 34,848 cases and Tamil Nadu with 33,658 new cases. Uttar Pradesh reported 12,547 fresh Covid-19 cases taking the total case count to over 1.6 million, while Maharashtra’s Covid count stands at 5,344,063 or over 5.3 million.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/shiv-sena-accuses-modi-government-of-covid-19-mismanagement-101621161727154.html

In the first batch, 10,000 doses of this medicine will be launched. In the last year, medical experts deliberated on the effectiveness of several drugs including Hydroxychloroquine, Remdesivir, Ivermectin. But 2-DG is the first one to be termed as an anti-Covid drug. The apex drug controller of the country has allowed this drug for emergency use among Covid-19 patients.Here is all we need to know about this drug:Manufacturers: The drug has been developed by the Defence Research and Development Organisation's laboratory Institute of Nuclear Medicine and Allied Sciences. Hyderabad-based Dr Reddy's Laboratories has been a partner and it is manufacturing the drug for public use.How will the drug work?The drug is a repurposed drug as the 2-DG molecule is meant for treating tumour, cancer cells. This is a glucose analogue, which looks like glucose but is not. A virus that is multiplying fast in the body needs glucose for energy. Thus, the virus will take this glucose analogue and will get arrested. The drug will then stop the virus from multiplying.How will it treat Covid-19 patients with oxygen level dropping?Director of the Institute of Nuclear Medicine and Allied Sciences, Dr Anil Mishra, has explained in an interview to All India Radio that the oxygen demand increases as the virus is multiplying fast in the body. Once that process is stopped, the oxygen crisis will also be addressed.Will this drug work on variants of the virus?Dr Mishra has said that the way the drug functions is supposed to arrest any variant as a multiplying virus, irrespective of variant, will need food and thus will get trapped by the drug.Recently approved anti-COVID oral drug 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2-DG), developed by @DRDO_India, will help patients recover faster!

16-05-2021||India||Rajeev Satav remembered fondly, Maharashtra leaders say his death a ‘great loss’||Maharashtra Congress leaders have described parliamentarian Rajeev Satav’s death as a major setback to the party’s state unit while expressing shock at the demise of the young leader, who was elected to the Rajya Sabha just a year ago. Satav died owing to secondary pneumonia with multiple-organ dysfunction syndrome on Sunday morning, a news agency quoted Pune’s Jehangir Hospital authorities as saying.Former chief minister and state revenue minister Ashok Chavan said Satav’s death was saddening. “We have lost a talented leader who had [a] great future. He had carved a niche at national level after starting his political career at district level. He was [the] pride of Maharashtra and had created curiosity about his leadership across the nation. His passing is a great loss for Maharashtra and especially for Marathwada,” he said. Satav was admitted to Jehangir Hospital on April 23 with acute respiratory distress syndrome and severe Covid-19 pneumonia and tested negative for the infection on May 9, hospital authorities said. However, due to complications, he was put on ventilator support a few days ago and breathed his last this morning.Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar said Rajeev Satav was known as a young, dynamic and scholastic leader. “The sad demise of the Congress Working Committee’s convenor is shocking,” Pawar tweeted in Marathi. Maharashtra governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari called Satav a leader known for his “leadership qualities and organisational abilities”. “Death has snatched away a promising leader with great potential,” he said. Maharashtra’s deputy chief minister and NCP leader Ajit Pawar said Satav had friends in all political parties. “Very close confidante and a friend to former Congress president Rahul Gandhi, Rajeev shared cordial, friendly relations with leaders from other parties. He was a decent face in Indian politics. We have lost a good-natured person,” he said. Earlier today, Rahul Gandhi said he was “very sad” at the loss of his “friend Rajeev Satav”. “He was a leader with huge potential who embodied the ideals of the Congress. It’s a big loss for us all,” Gandhi had tweeted. His sister and Congress general secretary in charge of eastern Uttar Pradesh, Priyanka Gandhi, described him as “one of our brightest colleagues” and said he was “clean of heart, sincere, deeply committed”.Leader of opposition in the legislative assembly Devendra Fadnavis said, “Rajeev Satav’s passing is shocking and saddening. We have lost a young, promising and studious leader in him. I pray to [the] almighty to give all [the] strength to his family to face the loss.” Satav was a legislator from Hingoli district and won the Lok Sabha election in 2014 when Congress could win only two seats in Maharashtra. He, however, chose not to contest the 2019 Lok Sabha elections citing his responsibility in Gujarat, where he was looking into organisational matters and election management of the party. He was later elected to Rajya Sabha.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rajeev-satav-remembered-fondly-maharashtra-leaders-say-his-death-a-great-loss-101621148826776.html
16-05-2021||India||Centre releases Covid-19 guidelines for rural areas, focus on surveillance, screening||The Centre on Sunday released new guidelines in the wake of the spread of coronavirus disease (Covid-19) in rural areas. The government said that a gradual ingress is now being seen in peri-urban, rural and tribal areas as well.Releasing the guidelines, the ministry of health and family welfare said that there is a need to enable communities, strengthen primary level healthcare infrastructure at all levels to intensify Covid-19 response in these areas while continuing to provide other essential health services.The health ministry guidelines said that in every village, active surveillance should be done for influenza-like illness/severe acute respiratory infections(ILI/SARI) periodically by ASHA with help of Village Health Sanitation and Nutrition Committee (VHSNC).It also asked the community health officer (CHO) the determine the seriousness of the infection by teleconsultation and recommend cases with comorbidities and low oxygen saturation to higher centres. It also said that the CHOs should be trained in performing rapid antigen testing (RAT) and the kits should be made at all public health facilities."These patients should be counselled to isolate themselves till test results are available. Those asymptomatic but having history of high-risk exposure to COVID patients (exposure of more than 15 mins without a mask within 6 feet distance) should be advised quarantine and tested as per ICMR protocol," the ministry further said in the guidelines.The guidelines also talk on focusing on contact tracing as per Integrated Disease Surveillance Programme’s (IDSP) guidelines, adding that those testing positive should be allowed to quarantine at home by following the protocols issued by the ministry.Also Read: Bihar enrols ward committees to check Corona in rural areas, says it’s helpingStressing on the need to monitor oxygen saturation levels, the ministry directed the VHSNC to mobilise resources through local PRI to make provisions for these equipment. Thermometers and pulse oximeters can be given the families in the rural areas on loan and follow-up visits should be undertaken by frontline worker/volunteers/teacher following required infection prevention practices."A home isolation kit shall be provided to all such cases which should include required medicines such as Paracetamol 500 mg, Tab. Ivermectin, cough syrup, multivitamins (as prescribed by the treating doctor) besides a detailed pamphlet indicating the precautions to be taken, medication details, monitoring proforma for patient condition during the home isolation, contact details in case of any major symptoms or deterioration of health condition and the discharge criteria," the ministry said in the guidelines.The guidelines come a day after Prime Minister Narendra Modi, chairing a high-level meeting on the Covid-19 situation, directed government officials to make a distribution plan for oxygen supply to rural areas and scale up health infrastructure to manage the disease burden in those regions.The Prime Minister asked officials to focus on testing, including door-to-door testing and assist health care workers in rural areas, the Prime Minister’s Office said in a statement.During the first wave, urban areas contributed a majority of new infections in India every month for five months from March 2020 to July 2020, before rural areas started contributing more new cases. In the second wave, which began in February this year, this took just two months as rural areas began contributing more cases April onwards.Experts say the impact of the outbreak could be even deadlier in rural areas, where health care infrastructure is traditionally weaker and fewer medical facilities are available. About 73% of the country’s population also resides in rural districts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-released-covid-19-guidelines-for-rural-areas-to-check-its-spread-101621146135876.html

16-05-2021||India||India's power consumption up nearly 19% in first fortnight of May from last year||New Delhi, May 16 (PTI) Power consumption in the country grew by around 19 per cent in the first fortnight of May to 51.67 billion units (BU) over the same period last year, showing recovery in industrial and commercial demand of electricity, according to the power ministry data.Power consumption in the first fortnight of May 2020 was 43.55 BU. The power consumption in the entire month of May last year was 102.08 BU.Also Read | India's power consumption up nearly 25% in first week of May from last yearDuring the first fortnight of May this year (from May 1 to 14), peak power demand met or the highest supply in a day touched the highest level of 168.78 GW (on May 6, 2021) and recorded growth of over 15 per cent over 146.54 GW (peak met) recorded in the same period in 2020 (on May 13, 2020).The power consumption in April grew nearly 40 per cent to 118.08 BU. Power consumption in April 2020 had dropped to 84.55 BU from 110.11 BU in the same month in 2019, mainly because of fewer economic activities following the imposition of lockdown by the government in the last week of March 2020 to contain the spread of deadly COVID-19.The power consumption also fell in May 2020 to 102.08 BU from 120.02 BU in May 2019.Similarly, peak power demand met or the highest power supply in a day also slumped to 132.73 GW in April last year from 176.81 GW in the same month in 2019, showing the impact of lockdown on economic activities.The fewer economic activities also resulted in a fall of peak power demand in May 2020 to 166.22 GW from 182.53 GW in May 2019.Taking to PTI, Davinder Sandhu, Advisor Primus Partners said, "Energy is derived demand, and with onset of summer and the productive pre-monsoon cycle of the Indian economy, an uptick is always expected."Sandhu who is also a former Advisor at World Bank said, "Both energy demand and supply have risen by 25-40 per cent over March-May 2021, with thermal PLFs (plant load factor or capacity utilisation) rising to 75 per cent and more, after many quarters. This is aided by the opening of the economy in Q1 (January-March 2021), with rising economic output as well as sharp uptick in exports."The second wave of lockdowns will certainly impact economic activity, and in turn, energy demand. The larger than usual increase in part is attributed to lower base, and as well as to the pent up demand being executed now, he added.After a gap of six months, power consumption had recorded a 4.6 per cent year-on-year growth in September 2020 and 11.6 per cent in October 2020.In November 2020, the power consumption growth slowed to 3.12 per cent, mainly due to the early onset of winters. In December 2020, power consumption grew by 4.5 per cent while it was up 4.4 per cent in January 2021.Power consumption in February this year recorded at 103.25 BU compared to 103.81 BU last year. But 2020 was a leap year. In March this year, the power consumption grew nearly 22 per cent to 120.63 BU compared to 98.95 BU in the same month of 2020.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/indias-power-consumption-up-nearly-19-in-first-fortnight-of-may-from-last-year-101621143725116.html

16-05-2021||India||Covid-19 cases decline in last 7 days, govt focus on states with high caseload||The Centre has said that the number of cases have plateaued and decreased in the last week. It also highlighted that the positivity rate has gone below 20 per cent.At a media briefing by the Union health ministry on Saturday, joint secretary Lav Agarwal said that the positivity rate - proportion of samples that return positive for Covid-19 - dipped from 21.9% last week to 19.8% in the May 8-14 period. A dropping positivity rate is indicative of slowing of the spread of infection.Government figures show that the number of active cases, which were touching 40 lakh, has now gone down to around 36-37 lakh. The health ministry officials called it a "big achievement" due to more recoveries and the case fatality rate remaining stable.For the fourth time in the last five days, India's daily Covid-19 recoveries outnumbered new cases on Saturday. The national recovery rate stands at 83.83 per cent.Major reasons for the drop in cases of Covid-19 are the strict curbs announced by various states governments and inoculation of more people in the ongoing vaccination drive. Joint secretary Lav Agarwal said that a total of 18.04 crore vaccine doses have been administered so far in the country. This includes 13.74 crore people above the age of 45 years, 1.62 crore healthcare workers, 2.25 crore frontline workers and 42.59 lakh people between the age of 18-44 years who have received their first dose.The government is now focussing on those states which have high number of active cases.

The oxygen generators include 19 bought by three-four Indian firms including an IT major, which dipped into their corporate social responsibility funds to buy the high-capacity oxygen generators.Officials coordinating foreign assistance and import of medical equipment from abroad said the oxygen generators - 17 will come from Novair’s manufacturing facility north of Paris and another 2 from its Italian plant - will be dispatched on 17 May. Each plant has the capacity to generate 24,000 litres of oxygen per hour.Five more oxygen generators will be picked up from France by the Indian Air Force’s C-17 Globemaster III, the heavy-lift transport aircraft that can carry a payload of 77 tonnes, on 21 May. There is a plan by the army to fly in another five generators from Paris but the schedule hasn’t been finalised yet, an official said.Also Read | 'Vaccinated or not': Government's scientific advisor has 3 tips against Covid-19In addition, an official said, India had also managed to get a commitment for 420 metric tonnes of zeolite from another French firm Arkema.

16-05-2021||India||India to have 51.6 crore Covid-19 vaccine doses by July: Harsh Vardhan||The number of vaccine doses administered in India will reach 51.6 crore by the end of July, Union Health Minister Harsh Vardhan said on Saturday.India has so far administered over 18 crore jabs to eligible beneficiaries.Vardhan, during his discussion with the health ministers of Uttar Pradesh, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh and Andhra Pradesh, said vaccine production was being ramped up to cater to the increased demand."Production of vaccines is being steadily ramped up to cater to increased demand while vaccines that are being produced now continue to be equitably apportioned and swiftly sent to States/Union Territories."We will have 51.6 crore vaccine doses by the end of July including the 18 crore doses already administered. Sputnik has been approved. This along with the slated approval of the new vaccine of Zydus Cadila, Serum Institute of India- Novavax vaccine, Bharat Biotech's nasal vaccine and the Genova mRNA vaccine will push the availability of COVID vaccines to 216 crore doses in the August-December period,” he said.During his interaction with the state health ministers and principal secretaries/additional chief secretaries of the four states in the presence of Ashwini Kumar Choubey, Union Minister of State for Health and Family Welfare, Vardhan highlighted the challenges faced by the states.He said that Gujarat has displayed a gradual increase in the positivity rate since April and the recovery rate stands at 79 per cent, which is lower than the national average.He noted that nearly 100 per cent ICU beds in Ahmedabad, Vadodara and Mehsana and 97 per cent and 96 per cent of oxygen beds in Ahmedabad and Vadodara, respectively, stood occupied indicating saturation.Andhra Pradesh has had an increasing positivity rate since early April and the weekly growth rate was as high as 30.3 per cent, he said, adding that Chittoor, East Godavari, Guntur, Srikakulam, Visakhapatnam were flagged as districts of concern in the state.Uttar Pradesh saw an exponential growth in cases in a six-week period (5,500 to 31,000 cases and two per cent to 14 per cent positivity rate) with Lucknow and Meerut having more than 14,000 active cases with all categories of bed showing more than 90 per cent occupancy.In Madhya Pradesh, 10 districts have more than 20 per cent positivity with over one lakh active cases all over the state. Indore, Bhopal, Gwalior and Jabalpur were flagged as districts of concern, the minister said.During the meeting, Uttar Pradesh and Gujarat were cautioned for having a high proportion of deaths in the age group 18-45 years.Vardhan also expressed a strong view that the present plateauing of Covid cases should not be taken as a sign for complacency but as a breathing space to expand, revamp and improve health infrastructure.State health administrators were advised to increase ICU and oxygen-supported beds, undertake oxygen audits, take stock of availability of medicines in the states and strengthen their medical workforce.Dr Sujeet K Singh, Director, National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC), presented the epidemiological findings and a granular analysis of the Covid trajectory in the states.He suggested continuing focus on the health infrastructure in small cities as people from nearby towns and villages would rush there in case of surge.He also urged the states to keep a tab on the variants of Covid through the INSACOG consortium.States were advised to ensure complete utilisation of available vaccination slots for 45 age-group/healthcare workers/frontline workers with awareness campaigns for conveying the importance of completing the second dose of vaccine.It was reiterated that States need to focus on reduction of vaccine wastage as that will be factored in subsequent allocations to that State.States were advised to constitute a 2/3-member team at State level on the lines of the dedicated team at Union Health Ministry to regularly coordinate with manufacturers for timely supplies of vaccine through 'Other than Govt. of India channel' and also to coordinate with private hospitals for their procurement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-to-have-51-6-crore-vaccine-doses-by-july-harsh-vardhan-101621128661244.html

16-05-2021||India||Gujarat Covid-19 deaths underreported: Chidambaram||The Congress on Saturday accused the Bharatiya Janata Party government in Gujarat of underreporting Covid-19 deaths in the state, calling it a “grave misdeed apart from being a national shame and a national tragedy”.Addressing a virtual press conference, former Union finance minister P Chidambaram highlighted a report published in a Gujarati newspaper, Dhaivy Bhaskar. “During the period March 1, 2021 to May 10, 2021, the government of Gujarat has officially admitted to only 4,218 Covid-related deaths, while death certificates issued are about 123,000 against 58,000 certificates that were issued during the same period last year. This can’t be an annual natural increase but can only be attributed to a pandemic,” he said, asserting that the Congress has independently verified the figures and all of it was supported by the thousands of unidentified bodies found floating in Ganga river or buried along its banks.State home minister Pradipsinh Jadeja has dismissed the newspaper report as “mischievous”.Chidambaram also accused the BJP-led central government of ‘bluffing with people of India’ by suppressing the true number of new Covid infections in the country.“The Government of India and the Government of Gujarat owe an explanation to the people of India,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/gujarat-covid-19-deaths-underreported-chidambaram-101621124470057.html

16-05-2021||India||Ex-IAS officer booked for spreading misinformation: Police||A former IAS officer has been booked for spreading misinformation by tweeting a seven-year-old photograph of dead bodies floating in the Ganga in Unnao and claiming them to be recent ones spotted in the river in Ballia, police said on Saturday.Police said the 1982-batch, UP-cadre officer Surya Pratap Singh was booked on May 13 after he tweeted an Unnao picture of 2014 vintage, claiming that bodies being seen in them were spotted a day earlier in the Ganga in Ballia district.Earlier, officials said, a total of 52 bodies found floating in the Ganga in Ballia district on Tuesday were retrieved and were disposed of after proper last rites.In an FIR lodged at the Unnao Kotwali police station, the retired IAS officer Singh has also been accused of claiming on social media that 67 bodies were buried on the Unnao riverbank using JCB and without performing any last rites. Kotwali police station’s SHO Dinesh Chandra Mishra said the case against Singh was lodged on May 13 on complaints by several city residents. The former outspoken officer had been booked on May 13 after he tweeted the picture of floating bodies and wrote in Hindi, “Tairati laashon aur ukharhtee saanso kaa UP model (The UP model of floating bodies and gasping breaths)." SHO Mishra said the case against Singh has been booked under various sections of the Indian Penal Code, the Information Technology Act, the Disaster Management Act and the UP Public Health and Epidemic Diseases Control Ordinance, 2020. Quoting from the FIR lodged against the former IAS officer, Mishra said the case against Singh was registered on the complaint by various Unnao residents. He said the residents also accused Singh of falsely claiming on social media that 67 bodies were buried on the riverbank using JCB and without performing their last rites, in an insult to the Hindu religion. The SHO said the people also accused the former IAS officer of observing on social media that it was the Yogi model of the governance in Uttar Pradesh where the living ones fail to get the treatment and the dead ones their last rites. “Due to this tweet, the atmosphere of the district became tense. In the probe, the tweet was found to be misleading with old pictures of Unnao linked to Ballia,” Mishra said. About the authenticity of the floating bodies tweeted by Singh, Mishra said on being contacted, the Social Media Cell of the Unnao Police found that the photograph tweeted by Singh dated back to January 13, 2014, in which around 100 bodies were seen floating on the Ganga in Unnao's Pariyar Ghat. Mishra said the IAS officer, by tweeting an old picture of dead bodies floating in the Ganga in Unnao and claiming them to be those spotted in Ballia, has deliberately created a feeling of animosity among people belonging to different religions. Reacting to the registration of the criminal case against him, Singh, in a fresh tweet asked, "Were no bodies floating in Unnao? Will the truth change after registering a case against me?"||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/exias-officer-booked-for-spreading-misinformation-police-101621116887932.html
16-05-2021||India||Man held for duping covid-19 patient’s family on pretext of remdesivir sale||A 23-year-old daily wage worker has been arrested for allegedly cheating a Delhi-based Covid-19 patient’s family of ₹20,000 on the pretext of delivering remdesivir injections, police said on Saturday.The suspect, Sudhir Kumar Yadav, was arrested from his hometown in Uttar Pradesh’s Sitapur on Thursday. Police said he worked as a labourer in Lucknow but was unemployed following the imposition of the lockdown.Police said Yadav’s friend persuaded him to dupe people looking for life-saving medicines and injections. Police are on the lookout for his accomplices.Deputy commissioner of police (southeast) R P Meena said a woman, Pooja Gupta, filed a complaint alleging that a person cheated her of ₹20,000 for getting six remdesivir injections for her sister-in-law, a critical Covid-19 patient.“Gupta found a supplier’s number on a WhatsApp group and contacted the person, who demanded ₹9,000 for each injection and tricked her into paying ₹20,000 as a token amount. After the money was transferred, the person gave Gupta the contact number of a delivery boy. However, after dilly-dallying for two days, the cellphones of both the persons were switched off,” said DCP Meena.A case was registered on Gupta’s complaint, following which Yadav was arrested. Police said he was using a fake name “Sunny” to contact and con Gupta.In another case, a 29-year-old man was arrested from Dwarka’s Sector 23 on Friday for his alleged involvement in black-marketing of oxygen cylinders. Four cylinders were recovered from his car. “The arrest was made following information that a man was involved in hoarding and black marketing of oxygen cylinders. The suspect, identified as Mohit, was arrested with four cylinders kept in his car,” said DCP (Dwarka) Santosh Kumar Meena.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/man-held-for-duping-covid-19-patient-s-family-on-pretext-of-remdesivir-sale-101621115798398.html
16-05-2021||India||Govt reaches out to Dr Reddy’s for Sputnik V doses||With its Covaxin supply almost exhausted, the Delhi government has reached out to Dr Reddy’s Laboratories (DRL), seeking 6.7 million doses of Sputnik V vaccine, to increase the pace of the inoculation drive in the city.“Vaccination is very necessary. The experience of those from the UK and USA tells that if vaccination is carried out on a massive level, then the effects of coronavirus can be curtailed. We are seeing that the central government is also trying its best and the state governments are also trying their best. We have contacted Dr Reddy’s for the Sputnik vaccine. We have written to them but have not received a complete response as to how many vaccines they can provide. We have asked for 67 lakh doses of Covishield, 67 lakh of Covaxin, and a similar amount for Sputnik V,” said chief minister Arvind Kejriwal.While a first batch of 150,000 Sputnik V doses was imported from Russia by the firm earlier this month, DRL officials had said that commercial shipments are expected to begin only later.Days after closing several centres where Covaxin was being administered to people between the ages of 18 and 44 in Delhi, the Capital was left with just over 5,600 doses of the vaccine at some centres on Saturday morning. “For those between the ages of 18 and 44 years, the Covaxin stock in Delhi is almost over. There are a few hundred doses left with some of the centres which are being used up. Most of the Covaxin centres have been closed,” said AAP MLA Atishi.Going by the vaccination bulletin released on Saturday, the government‘s Covishield stock may last about eight days for the 18-44 age group. The government also received a consignment of 173,760 Covishield doses, earmarked for those above the age of 45, health care, and frontline workers, from the Centre on Saturday, said Atishi.As per the bulletin, the available Covishield doses for these groups will last around six days and Covaxin for three days at the current pace of vaccination.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-reaches-out-to-dr-reddy-s-for-sputnik-v-doses-101621115250777.html
16-05-2021||India||PM stresses localised containment, testing in high-level Covid-19 review meeting||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday chaired a high-level meeting to review the Covid-19 situation in the country, directing government officials to make a distribution plan for oxygen supply to rural areas and scale up health infrastructure to manage the disease burden in those regions.The Prime Minister asked officials to focus on testing, including door-to-door testing and assist health care workers in rural areas, the Prime Minister’s Office said in a statement. He also stressed that local containment efforts were the “need of the hour”, especially in states where the test-positivity rate – an indication of the spread of the virus within a population – is high.“PM asked for augmentation of healthcare resources in rural areas to focus on door-to-door testing and surveillance. He also spoke about empowering ASHA & Anganwadi workers with all necessary tools,” the statement said.PM Modi’s directions are significant, given that the deadly second wave of infections in the country appears to have affected rural hinterland faster than it did during the first outbreak last year.As reported by HT on May 8, during the first wave, urban areas contributed a majority of new infections in India every month for five months from March 2020 to July 2020, before rural areas started contributing more new cases. In the second wave, which began in February, this took just two months as rural areas began contributing more cases April onwards.Experts say the impact of the outbreak could be even deadlier in rural areas, where health care infrastructure is traditionally weaker and fewer medical facilities are available. About 73% of the country’s population also resides in rural districts.“The Prime Minister directed that a distribution plan for ensuring oxygen supply in rural areas should be worked out, including provision of Oxygen Concentrators,” the statement said.The PM’s meeting was also held just weeks after the national capital plunged into a health care crisis over the supply of oxygen, which is crucial in the treatment of Covid-19 patients. Starting April 22 until the first week of May, hospitals across New Delhi repeatedly made distress calls over dwindling stocks of oxygen, and dozens of patients died as some facilities waited for supplies to be replenished.The situation in the Capital has now eased but other states are facing a similar issue. At least 75 Covid-19 patients died at a premier hospital in Goa after fluctuation in the supply of medical oxygen this week.At the meeting that was attended by Niti Aayog member VK Paul, cabinet secretary Rajeev Gauba among other officials, PM Modi also instructed officials to ramp up testing with both RT-PCR and rapid tests, specifically focusing on Covid-19 hot spots. According to the statement, the PM was informed that testing figures have gone up from 5 million per week in early March to around 13 million/week presently.Separately, the statement said the Prime Minister “took serious note of some reports about ventilators lying unutilised” and ordered an immediate audit of installation and operation of the life-saving machines that were provided by the central government to states in recent weeks.The PM’s response likely refers to the spat between the Centre and the Congress-led Punjab government after the Union health ministry dismissed reports suggesting that ventilators given to a hospital in Punjab’s Faridkot were lying unused because of technical glitches. The Union health ministry said earlier this month that the reports of faulty ventilators were “unfounded”.Training for properly operating ventilators should be provided to health care workers if necessary, PM Modi added.The Prime Minister also appeared to address concerns regarding allegations of states undercounting cases and deaths linked to the viral illness. He “encouraged” governments to report Covid-19 numbers “transparently without any pressure of high numbers showing adversely on their efforts”.The move came a day after the Opposition Congress in Gujarat demanded an inquiry into a local media report that said around 61,000 deaths had not been counted in the state’s official toll of Covid-19 victims. The Bharatiya Janata Party-led state government has denied the allegations.Officials on Saturday gave a detailed presentation on state- and district-level situation of Covid-19 testing, oxygen availability and health care infrastructure. They further briefed the Prime Minister about the slowdown of the second wave of infections and said that daily new cases across the country had reduced from over 400,000 a day.On average, India has been adding XX new cases per day this week, as compared to XXX cases/day last week.The PMO said the road map for future vaccine availability was also discussed, with Modi directing officials to work closely with states to fasten the pace of inoculations.In recent days, vaccination centres across several states such as Maharashtra and Delhi said they halted inoculations due to a scarcity of vaccine doses. Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal also appealed to the Centre this week not to leave it only to the state governments to procure doses from international vaccine makers for the 18-44 age group.Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Saturday attacked the central government over its Covid-19 strategy and said that its “disastrous vaccine strategy” will ensure a devastating third wave. “It can’t be repeated enough-India needs a proper vaccine strategy!” he wrote.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-stresses-localised-containment-testing-in-high-level-covid-19-review-meeting-101621113955210.html
16-05-2021||India||Court dismisses Tahir Hussain’s bail plea in two Delhi riots cases||A Delhi court on Saturday dismissed the bail plea of suspended AAP councillor Tahir Hussain in connection with two cases related to the Delhi riots in February 2020, saying that “it is prima facie apparent that he used his muscle power and political clout to act as a kingpin in planning, instigating and fanning the flames of communal conflagration”.Additional sessions judge Vinod Yadav noted that Hussain used “rioters as ‘human weapons’, who on his instigation could have killed anybody”. “…at this stage, I find that there is enough material on record to presume that the applicant (Hussain) was very well present at the spot of crime and was exhorting the rioters of a particular community and as such, he did not use his hands and fists, but rioters as ‘human weapons’, who on his instigation could have killed anybody. In fact, it would not be wrong here to say that the applicant by his instigation to the rioters acted as a cannon fodder for them to wreak havoc upon the persons of majority community (sic),” it noted.In its 34-page order, the judge noted that the allegations against the accused are “extremely grave in nature”.While Delhi Police’s Special Cell has charged Hussain for rioting, murder and inciting rioters and named him as accused in 11 FIRs, on Saturday, the court was hearing two cases related to gunshot wounds sustained by two persons during the riots.The court said that even if there were no direct acts of violence attributable to Hussain, he cannot shy away from his liability under the provisions of the sections invoked against him, particularly on account of the fact that his house/building became the hub for the “rioters and rabble rousers to unleash the worst communal riots since partition in Delhi”.“He permitted his big house... to be used by rioters to play havoc upon persons of other communities. He indulged in terror funding and collection of means of rioting and thereafter, under a conspiracy hatched at local level, used seduced persons as ‘human weapons’,” he added.“It is also evident that the participants of the larger conspiracy had collected huge amounts (terror funding) through hawala and other illegal means...and ultimately the smaller conspiracy at local level were given effect to (sic),” the order read.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/court-dismisses-tahir-hussain-s-bail-plea-in-two-delhi-riots-cases-101621111291441.html
16-05-2021||India||25 held for posters critical of PM Modi||Continuing their action against people putting up posters critical of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the Delhi Police on Saturday said they arrested 25 in as many cases registered at different police stations across the city even as they were trying to ascertain the key players behind the posters.Police registered the FIRs under sections of the Prevention of Defacement of Property Act. The number of first information reports (FIRs) and arrests could increase in the coming days as more posters reading “Modiji humare bachon ki vaccine videsh kyon bhej diya? (Why did Modi send vaccines meant for our children to foreign countries?)” are being found across the city, senior police officers privy to the development said.Since the legal sections mentioned in the FIRs were all bailable, a majority of those arrested till Saturday afternoon were released on bail from the concerned police stations itself. Those arrested after Saturday afternoon were likely to be released by late in the night after completing the legal formalities, the officers said.The police are trying to ascertain if all the posters were printed at one printing press and whether the order for the same was given by an individual or any political party. However, the initial investigations in most of the registered cases and interrogation of the arrested people have not yielded much of a result.A few of the arrested persons claimed that they were given money for pasting the posters. The police are now trying to identify the people who paid the money. Their questioning may lead to the key players behind the critical posters, the officers said.The first such posters, nearly 1,800 in number and not bearing any logo or mention of any political party or organisation, were found in east Delhi’s Kalyanpuri between Wednesday and Thursday, after which a case was registered and four persons were arrested. Their interrogation pointed towards the involvement of a local politician.“We are probing the role of the politician. Our investigation is still on. It’s too early to comment on any individual’s involvement,” said a police officer, who did not want to be identified.As similar posters were found in other parts of the city from Thursday onwards, more FIRs were registered. Till Saturday evening, the number of FIRs reached 25 in 13 different police districts.All the cases were registered under sections 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant) of the Indian Penal Code and other sections including section 3 of the Prevention of Defacement of Property Act across various districts. In total, 25 people were arrested till Saturday evening.As per details obtained from the police, except New Delhi and outer-north, all other 13 districts registered between one and four cases each. In four cases registered by the north-west district, two people were arrested while the outer, west and north-east districts filed three cases each.Two cases each were registered in the south, central and Rohini districts while the remaining six districts – Shahdara, Dwarka, North, south-East, south-west, and east – registered one case each. West district police made five arrests, while in the east and central districts, four people each were arrested.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/25-held-for-posters-critical-of-pm-modi-101621109330775.html

This cyclonic storm comes at a time when India is battling a raging second wave of Covid-19 pandemic, which has infected 24,679,650 and killed 270,259 people, so far.According to the India Meteorological Department, the cyclonic storm is very likely to intensify further into a “very severe cyclonic storm” and move north-northwestwards and cross Gujarat coast between Porbandar and Naliya around May 18.The Met department has recommended a total suspension of fishing operations in Gujarat and other states on the west coast. It has also asked for regulation of rail and road traffic and advised people to stay indoors.In view of the warning, Gujarat has geared up adequately to ensure there is no casualty and set up a control room, chief minister Vijay Rupani said even as a central advisory predicted damage to thatched houses, roads, power and communication lines in the Saurashtra region.In Delhi, Prime Minister Narendra Modi held a review meeting on preparedness in the face of the cyclone. He instructed officials to ensure maintenance of essential services like power, telecommunications, health and drinking water.The weather department has also predicted rainfall of varying intensity, from light and moderate to extremely heavy, due to the impact of cyclone in Lakshadweep Islands, Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Konkan and Goa, Gujarat and West Rajasthan. Red and orange alerts have been sounded in various parts.More than 50 teams of the National Disaster Response Force are on duty in five states - Kerala, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Gujarat and Maharashtra.While Kerala is not in the predicted path of the cyclone, the state government said it is prepared as heavy rains, strong winds and strong sea gusts are expected till Sunday. The state has reported two deaths due to the torrential rains. In Tamil Nadu, more than 300 people have been relocated from disaster-prone areas to relief camps in Thiruvananthapuram.The storm could also bring gusty winds and showers to Mumbai. “In a prep meeting regarding Cyclone Tauktae, CM Uddhav Balasaheb Thackeray instructed the District Administration, Divisional Commissioners & District Collectors to be vigilant & well equipped in coastal areas, especially of Palghar, Raigad, Ratnagiri & Sindhudurg (sic),” read a tweet by the office of Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/states-brace-as-cyclone-nears-with-strong-winds-heavy-rain-101621106336100.html

Volunteers from a range of backgrounds, including software industry, films, police department and others, have been providing all kinds of support to people in Bengaluru, which has become one of the most impacted cities in the country during the second wave of infections. The efforts of volunteers and frontline workers, both organised and individuals, included dissemination of information, supply of food and other essentials and even helping ferry the large number of migrants who left Bengaluru back to their home states fearing the uncertainty. Actor working as an ambulance driver At a time when cases are increasing exponentially, Kannada actor Arjun Gowda put on a new hat, not in reel but real life, working as an ambulance driver to help Covid-19 patients in Bengaluru. He has started also started ‘Project Smile Trust’ that aims to reach out to those who are stuck without any help during the pandemic. “We want to ensure that we help out anyone in need irrespective of where they come from or what religion they practice. I’m also ready to travel across town for help. I plan on continuing with this help for the next couple of months as the current situation is quite bad and I want to do my bit to people in whatever little way that I can,” he said. A senior cop who hasn’t touched his new-born Anuchet MN, deputy commissioner of police, central, became a father soon after the second wave of Covid hit the city. Responsible for one of the busiest regions of the city, Anuchet has been on duty to ensure enforcement of lockdown, arrange essential services and most importantly, ensure the men serving in his division were safe. But, amid all these, he still hasn’t been able to hold his newborn so far. “Because I’m out in the field, I see my child only from a distance. I use a different room and have little physical interaction with family. It is tough, but that is what every policeman is going through. We are out on the streets, and we are highly susceptible to the virus. But this is what we signed up for,” he said. A transwoman lending helping hand Veena, a transsexual woman is a familiar face in Okalipuram area in Bengaluru. At a time when the pandemic is wreaking havoc, she visits from house to house, checking on people and providing food to those in need. In the second week of April, when she realised there was an increase in the number of deaths in her locality, she took onto herself to ensure that people were tested. Last week, when the Indira canteens began demanding Aadhaar cards for providing free food, she led an agitation outside one of the canteens. “In such a situation, it is the poor who suffer the most. I initially started helping the transgender community in my area, because I know what they go through. Over a period of time, people started seeing my work and came to me for help. Once the Covid started, I started using my contacts to get free food for people who had lost their job. I have goodwill with people, something that I now use to spread awareness about vaccination and testing,” Veena said. Scaling aide work with tech Sneha Vachhaney, who has created a platform for home chefs providing food for those in need, is a key link in the food distribution in the city. “In the initial days, I was cooking around 50 meals a day to distribute around the area I lived in. Soon, I realised that there was a large demand for meals for those who are in quarantine. Then we put out a call for home chefs and so far around 200 of them have responded,” she said. Sneha, who comes from a corporate background, said soon she realised that just cooking meals won’t be enough and her expertise could be used for scaling this process. “With help of my friends, we have created a platform where home chefs can join, and this process is streamlined. We also contacted food delivery companies like Swiggy and Dunzo for our deliveries as the numbers increased,” she said, adding that Bengaluru’s tech background came to help after all. An ambulance that never stops For 12-year-old Daniel, helping his father in hospital was all he knew, and which later became his profession, something that has now become one of the most sought-after services during the pandemic. “My father used to conduct post-mortem in Bowring hospital. I used to go with him after it in the hearse van to conduct last rites on unknown and unclaimed dead bodies,” Daniel said. Now 33, Daniel drives an ambulance that has ferried hundreds over the last 12 years and several more since the outbreak of the pandemic. Daniel and his two brothers, Kumar and Stalin, are among the hundreds of ambulance drivers who have looked beyond individual and their family’s safety and tirelessly worked during the last year of the pandemic, which has impacted thousands in Bengaluru, Karnataka, India and globally. A recruiter who helps bury bodies Tanveer Ahmed, a recruiter by profession, is among a select group of volunteers in Bengaluru who have helped conduct the last rites of people whose families are in dire need of help during the pandemic. Ahmed, a 45-year-old father of four, is part of Mercy Angel’s, a volunteer-driven organisation that has helped in providing relief like food distribution, helping distressed and Covid- 19 infected families find medicine, hospital beds and oxygen as well as helping with last rites. The team helped with the last rites of the first-ever casualty in Bengaluru on March 23 last year and has since teamed up with the BBMP as one of the most experienced and adept groups to carry out Covid-related relief work. Ahmed starts his day at 5.30am and goes on till around 8 pm. “Since last year, we must have helped with the last rites of over 1,500 persons. There are days when we handle up to 20-25 deaths,” Ahmed said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/as-cases-surge-good-samaritans-lend-a-helping-hand-in-bengaluru-101621105264328.html
16-05-2021||India||Health dept to take over Bengaluru Covid fight from civic body: Govt||Bengaluru: The Karnataka State Covid Task Force has proposed to hand over Covid management in Bengaluru to the department of health and family welfare – so far handled by Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike – announcing major changes in Karnataka’s fight against the pandemic.“To make this a reality, certain technical issues need to be studied. A committee will be constituted to look into this and will be asked to submit the study report in the next meeting of the task force,” read a statement from the office of the deputy chief minister and Covid Task Force head, CN Ashwatha Narayan, on Saturday. The decisions come as Karnataka reported 3,500 Covid-related deaths between May 7 and 13, the highest in a week since the outbreak of the pandemic, an analysis of the health department data shows. The death toll in the second week of May was more than twice that of the first week. The state has reported more than 5,000 deaths this month, of which Bengaluru alone accounts for 2,700. The state reported 41,664 new cases on Saturday, taking the active caseload to 6,05,494. Bengaluru accounted for 13,402 new infections, taking its active cases to 3,66,791. As many as 349 fatalities were reported across Karnataka, which took the state’s toll to 21,434. Bengaluru’s toll due to Covid-19 jumped to 9,340, with 94 deaths being reported on Saturday, according to the state health department. The task force also decided not to allow home isolation in rural areas and slums of urban areas. All cases from those places will be admitted to Covid care centres (CCCs). “In rural areas, Covid care centres will be established at public health centre level. Rapid antigen test needs to be done at the doorstep in hot spots. In rural areas, arrangements for isolation and treatment shall be made in places, such as hostels. District commissioners will be entrusted this responsibility,” Narayan told reporters in Bengaluru. There are 207 community health centres of 30 beds each in the state. All the 30 beds in each of these centres will be converted into oxygenated beds. Out of these, 5 ICU beds and 5 HDU (high dependency unit) beds will be made available. In taluk hospital, 50 ICU beds will be made available. It was also decided to set up 100 ICU beds in district centres where medical colleges do not exist, the statement added. A 100-bed secondary hospital will be set up in each assembly constituency of Bengaluru and one tertiary care hospital for every 4 constituencies, the task force said. It was decided that in every district hospital, 100 ICU beds will be made available on a permanent basis. For this, required infrastructure and manpower need to be provided and all district hospitals should have oxygen-generating units. It was also decided that no one will be given the second dose of Covishield vaccine without finishing a mandatory 12 weeks. “With regard to administering vaccine for 18-44 age group, a new App needs to be developed and this will be interfaced with Cowin App and later the vaccination schedule will be prepared to take into account the availability of vaccines,” read the statement. Vaccination will be given outside hospitals in places, such as school grounds, and for each bed in government hospitals ₹10 will be given to facilitate timely disposal of waste. The task force has also approved ₹843 crore for calling a global tender for vaccines. “To study the changes in the genetics of viruses, it was decided to set up genome labs in six places in the state. Four will be from medical colleges and two will be from the health department,” said the statement from the deputy CM’s office. The government has also approved procurement of medicines and other consumables required for the next 90 days in a phased manner at ₹260 crore. At present, about 400 cases of Black Fungal are estimated per week and there is a shortage of the required drug. The Centre will be asked to provide 20,000 vials of the drug. The state will also set up oxygen bottling plants. “These will be set up in nine districts that do not have this facility. Oxygen generators of 200-300 litre per minute will be set up in community health centres. All the beds will be oxygenated in all taluk hospitals. To facilitate this, oxygen generators of 500-600 litre per minute capacity will be set up,” the statement said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/health-dept-to-take-over-bengaluru-covid-fight-from-civic-body-govt-101621104904290.html
16-05-2021||India||Deaths not linked to oxygen: Goa hospital dean||The dean of Goa Medical College and Hospital said on Saturday that the deaths that occurred in the hospital over the last five days were not necessarily linked to dropping oxygen levels.Dr Shivanand Bandekar said his hospital is a tertiary care centre where all referred cases come and where criticality is high. “Most of the patients die because of Covid pneumonia where oxygen is part of the treatment. So, we cannot directly say this (disruption in oxygen supply) is the reason why they have died, because if you see their CT severity score, they were all more than 20 (very severe),” Bandekar said. “But how do we prove that the interruption has caused (the deaths) ... you are trying to correlate ... last night eight patients died between 2am and 6am (when there was no reported drop in the oxygen supply).”The dean tried to explain how difficult the situation is, but also claimed that the hospital has risen to the challenge. “If you see the criticality of patients, I have 160 patients right now who are on ventilator, that’s why the consumption is more. The sudden spike had also brought a lot of surprises to us. We are trying to make that whole thing meet (ensure supply meets demand). We got concentrators in no time, we got cylinders, beds within no time and we are the centre where we cannot refuse any case,” Bandekar said, urging people to look at the “whole story”.The hospital made news for the wrong reasons after oxygen levels dropped for six consecutive nights, allegedly resulting in 75 deaths over four days. The matter went to the High Court of Bombay at Goa where the state government declared on Friday that logistical issues, not supply shortage, had resulted in the drop in oxygen.The health department has now claimed that with a new oxygen tank donated by a private player, the issue has been “sorted”. State health secretary Ravi Dhawan informed on Saturday that a cryogenic tank having the capacity of 20,000 litres of oxygen has been installed at the hospital, which will make the present system of supplying oxygen through trolleys redundant. “The supply of oxygen to this tank will be directly from the manufacturer M/s Praxair — the tank belongs to them. We should see a continuous supply of liquid medical oxygen through this tank as is done in all major hospitals anywhere,” Dhawan added.The hospital said it has also shifted more than 350 patients to a newly commissioned block that already has a tank installed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/deaths-not-linked-to-oxygen-goa-hospital-dean-101621104665363.html

But as soon as the situation normalises, the yatra will be started.”He also informed that the portals of Kedarnath and Badrinath shrines would open on May 17 and May 18 respectively after which the portals of all the four shrines under Char Dham would be opened.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/gangotri-portals-open-amid-strict-covid-19-protocols-101621104664863.html
16-05-2021||India||West Bengal enters lockdown mode as Covid-19 cases surge||The West Bengal government imposed several restrictions for the next 15 days beginning Sunday, entering a near-lockdown phase, to combat the spread of Covid-19 in the state. While all public transport – trains, buses and Kolkata Metro -- have been shut down, government and private offices closed, markets and retail shops selling grocery have been allowed to remain open from 7 am till 10 am, and emergency services have also been permitted. All outdoor activities at night including movement of people and vehicles between 9 pm and 5 am have been prohibited, except for health services, law and order and essential commodities. “Madhyamik (class X board exams) and Higher Secondary (Class XII board exams) scheduled in June this year are also being postponed. No exams would be held in June as schools and colleges are closed. Notification for the new schedule would be issued in due time,” said a senior state government official. Schools, colleges and universities have already been shut in the state since April 20. Sweetmeat shops have been allowed to remain open from 10 am to 5 pm, jewellery shops may remain open from 12 noon to 3 pm. E-commerce and home delivery of all commodities have been allowed. Earlier this month, the state government had shut down local trains, while allowing buses, trams and Kolkata Metro to run with 50% capacity. Government and private organisations were allowed to run with half the workforce. RT-PCR negative test reports have been made mandatory for anyone trying to enter Bengal.The daily count of Covid-19 cases has shot up exponentially in West Bengal since March this year. Experts have blamed it on the rampant violations of Covid-19 protocols at the countless election rallies held in the run-up to the assembly elections that ended on April 29. On May 13, the state registered 20,846 new cases up from 812 fresh cases reported on March 27, when the eight phase assembly polls began. The state now has 131,792 active cases. At least 136 people have died in the last 24 hours, according to official data. Movement of private vehicles, taxis and auto-rickshaws will be prohibited except to and from hospitals, vaccination centres, diagnostic centres and the airportOperations in tea gardens have been allowed with 50% strength, jute mills have been allowed to run with 30% strength. Marriage functions have been allowed but with a cap of 50 people, while funeral rituals may be held with a maximum of 20 people. Chief minister Mamata Banerjee, who assumed charge for the third consecutive time on May 5, had ruled out imposing a total lockdown. Banerjee’s younger brother Ashim Banerjee died on Saturday morning after being detected with Covid-19 last month. He was admitted at a private hospital in Kolkata. Balram Bhargava, head of the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), had said in a recent interview that lockdown restrictions should remain in place in all districts where the rate of infection is above 10% of those tested. Union health minister Harsh Vardhan had flagged the issue that some districts in the state were registering 40% positivity rate for the Covid-19 infection.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/west-bengal-enters-lockdown-mode-as-covid-19-cases-surge-101621104304913.html
16-05-2021||India||IIT-Kanpur to study impact of immersion of bodies on soil, water||Indian Institute of Technology (IIT)-Kanpur (IIT-K) is set to undertake a study to assess the adverse impact of immersion of bodies in rivers and their burial on river banks on soil and water, said Prof Vinod Tare, advisor to the National Mission for Clean Ganga (NMCG).The development comes in the backdrop of mass graves being discovered on the banks of the Ganga in Rae Bareli, Unnao, Kanpur, Fatehpur and Kannauj, and fears about possible contamination of water and soil if the bodies were those of Covid-19 patients.“We are going to study the impact of immersion of bodies and their burial on water and soil,” Prof Tare said, adding that the issue has been discussed at the NMCG level.“Immersing a Covid body in the Ganga would wash the virus, but it won’t be destroyed; you need different agents such as heat and others to destroy (it),” said Prof Tare, who is with the institute’s environmental science department and has been part of all top panels formed to rejuvenate the Ganga.Seeking a complete ban on immersion and burial on the riverbed, he said immersion was wrong from the religious point of view as well. The government should make arrangements in order to prevent the immersion of bodies, he said.All districts, especially the big ones, receive drinking water drawn from the Ganga and vegetable cultivation also takes place on the riverbed.Tare has issued an appeal for the people not to dump the bodies in the river or bury them close to it.Many graves have been found in Unnao, Kanpur and Kannauj in the last few days. The bodies were buried at less than two-to-three-foot depth. This has heightened the fear that these corpses would be washed away once the river rises.A unit of the State Disaster Response Force (SDRF), one platoon of Provincial Armed Constabulary (PAC) and jawans from river police would patrol the rivers on boats in these districts. Kanpur police commissioner Aseem Arun said the arrangement would be made in several districts. In Kanpur, a team would ensure that bodies were not immersed or buried along the river, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/iitkanpur-to-study-impact-of-immersion-of-bodies-on-soil-water-101621104004310.html
16-05-2021||India||CID names two Telugu TV channels in FIR; HC rejects MP’s bail plea||The Andhra Pradesh Police on Saturday named two Telugu television channels as co-accused in the sedition case filed a day ago against Kanumuri Raghurama Krishnam Raju, the rebel parliamentarian of the ruling YSR Congress Party.Raju was arrested by the state Crime Investigation Department (CID) from his residence in Hyderabad on Friday evening. His lawyers immediately moved a bail petition in the Andhra Pradesh high court, which rejected it on Saturday and asked him to move the lower court first.On Saturday evening, CID authorities produced Raju before the Sixth Metropolitan Magistrate Court in Guntur dealing with CID cases. The court remanded Raju to 14-day judicial custody late in the evening. It, however, said the MP should be sent to the hospital because of his health condition and that he should not be sent to jail, till his health condition improves.Raju, who represents Narasapuram Lok Sabha constituency in West Godavari district, was booked under Section 124-A (sedition) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC), for alleged comments against the Jagan Mohan Reddy government, damaging its reputation and inciting hatred among the people.The CID has also invoked Section 153 (b) (making comments causing communal disharmony or affecting national integration) and Section 505 (making statements with public mischief) against the MP.In the FIR, which was disclosed to the media on Saturday, the CID named two Telugu television channels – TV5 and ABN Andhra Jyothy, as co-accused in the case.The CID said the two media houses had conspired with Raju against the state government. “The two channels, by allowing pre-meditates and organised slots in their bulletins, have clearly shown that there was a meeting of minds of Raju with the heads of these media channels and all of them together conspired against the government,” the CID said in the FIR.“Raju did not restrict himself to fair criticism of the government, but made every attempt to create hatred, contempt disaffection towards the government with his words and visual postures provoking his followers to take up violence. They are seditious in nature,” the investigating agency said.The CID has charged Raju and the two channels with hatching a well-orchestrated conspiracy to create disaffection and to being contempt and hatred against the government. “They also instigated disharmony in public by creating a feeling of hatred on the grounds of caste and religion,” the FIR said.While the CID has arrested Raju, it has not taken any action against the media channels so far. Representatives of the two channels – TV5 and ABN Andhra Jyothy – refused to comment on the FIR.In his bail petition before the high court, Raju said he had been targeted for filing a case seeking the cancellation of the bail granted to the chief minister, who was involved in 11 cases registered by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) and also in money laundering cases.He sought bail pleading that he had undergone heart surgery four months back. However, the high court rejected his plea and asked him to first approach the lower court for bail.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sedition-case-cid-names-two-telugu-tv-channels-in-fir-hc-rejects-mp-s-bail-plea-101621103944235.html
16-05-2021||India||Bengal governor visits Nandigram, says ‘never heard of such violence’||Kolkata West Bengal governor Jagdeep Dhankhar turned emotional and could be seen wiping tears after meeting some of the alleged victims of post-poll violence at Nandigram in East Midnapore.The governor’s visit to one of the most high-profile assembly constituencies, where a tough electoral battle was fought between chief minister Mamata Banerjee and her protégé-turned-adversary Suvendu Adhikari, triggered a political slugfest between the ruling TMC and the BJP.“Unimaginable post poll violence @MamataOfficial Terrified people with difficulty and fear @WBPolice and reprisals at hands of ruling party workers narrate indescribable woes of horror. Appeal CM to take urgent steps to restore their confidence in the worst post poll violence,” Dhankhar tweeted.Dhankhar alleged that the violence was being sponsored, organised and condoned by the state.The governor visited some of the victims’ villages, sometimes by battery-driven rickshaw and sometimes on a motorcycle. He interacted with the villagers and some women could be seen wailing before him. Dhankhar could also be seen wiping his eyes more than once.“The state is passing through a very severe crisis of Covid-19 and unprecedented post-poll violence that is retributive and targeted. I never heard of such violence. I would appeal to the chief minister. It is high time that she took note of it. We are sitting on a volcano,” he said while adding that thousands of people had to abandon their homes in West Bengal and take shelter outside the state.On Friday, Dhankhar visited Assam’s Dhubri district and interacted with people who fled from their homes in Bengal following post-poll violence allegedly perpetrated by Trinamool Congress workers.“The governor interacted with the affected people for nearly an hour and inquired about their condition. At present we have 176 people at Ranpagli (relief camp) and nearly 30 more at another camp in the district. While some have returned to Bengal, these people are afraid to go back as their houses had been allegedly burnt. We are providing them food and other basic necessities. They can stay in Assam as long as they desire. If they wish to go back we will facilitate their return,” Anand Mishra, superintendent of police of Dhubri, said on Friday.The ruling TMC however said that the governor’s visit was motivated as he only visited the houses of BJP workers.“He (Dhankhar) has demeaned the governor’s chair by giving a call for change ahead of the assembly elections. The BJP lost because the people discarded them. Now he is moving around like an unsatisfied spirit and trying to disturb the peace,” said Kunal Ghosh, TMC spokesperson.The TMC supremo’s chief election agent at Nandigram Sk Sufiyan alleged that the helipad where the governor’s chopper landed was built by the BJP during the elections. The governor went to Nandigram in a BSF (Border Security Force) chopper.While the BSF refused to comment, senior police officials said that the helipad was already there and was built during the elections.“At least 24 BJP workers and supporters have been killed so far in poll-related violence. The BJP’s state headquarters have received more than 17,000 complaints from its workers and supporters of TMC’s torture and atrocities. BJP workers are not being able to return home as they are scared. Fresh violence was triggered in the villages where a team of the ministry of home affairs visited to take stock of the violence. The state should take care of the homeless people,” said Samik Bhattacharya, BJP spokesperson in West Bengal.He said the governor cried because he could not take the pain. “Anyone who sees such pain would cry,” Bhattacharya said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bengal-governor-visits-nandigram-says-never-heard-of-such-violence-101621103884274.html
16-05-2021||India||Gujarat rejects report on Covid-19 deaths, calls it bid to create fear||Twenty-four hours after a leading Gujarati daily reported that the government agencies gave away over 120,000 death certificates between March 1 and May 10, the state government issued a statement that the media was “creating wrong fears in the minds of people” and sensationalising the issue.Minister of state for home Pradipsinh Jadeja said at a press conference on Saturday morning, a day after the report by Divya Bhaskar, that it was “mischievous” to connect the number of deaths on the basis of death certificates with the Covid-19 pandemic.An official press statement by the minister in English stated: “When there is a death of a person in the family, death certificate is required for the bank insurance, LIC and other services. In such circumstances, we have developed an online process so that family members can obtain certificates at home easily. Death certificates are issued for various reasons, so we can not ignore the possibility of more than one registration for a person sometimes. Therefore, there can be a difference in the figure of death certificates issued and the number of deaths. As death is a serious matter and involves many rituals, it is possible that people might not register it at the same time. The time of death, registration and issuing of certificate are three different aspects. All these 3 things combined together to show death figures and analysis in the print media report is totally inappropriate.”Jadeja asserted, “When the number of cases is coming down, when the recovery rate is improving, the media should not create fears and panic among the people with such misleading reporting. Seeing the number of death certificates together with Covid-19 deaths is not presenting the right picture.”The minister, however, did not refute the report about the number of death certificates. Divya Bhaskar reported that from March 1 to May 10 the state issued 120,000 death certificates, while the number was 58,000 during the corresponding period in 2020. As against this, the officially admitted Covid-19 deaths (between March 1 and May 10 this year) were 4,218 in Gujarat.The state government has also not given an estimate on the annual average number of deaths in Gujarat during normal years.In response to the government’s denial, Divya Bhaskar’s Gujarat editor Devendra Bhatnagar tweeted in Hindi: “We have given the source of our data. Tell us on what basis you are refuting us. Please add the bodies cremated, those reaching the cemeteries, the homage advertisements in the newspapers and bodies brought out in ambulances in hospitals, you will get the truth of the death certificate numbers.”“The government! You will not tell the truth even now? These death numbers are from March to May 2021. If you can, make public the morbid and comorbid Covid-19 death numbers. The high court has also stated this,” Bhatnagar said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/guj-rejects-report-on-covid-19-deaths-calls-it-bid-to-create-fear-101621103524839.html
16-05-2021||India||2 firms, Gujarat institute to scale up Covaxin production||To ramp up the manufacturing of Covaxin, Bharat Biotech will transfer technology to two Ahmedabad-based companies and a state-run biotechnology research institute in Gandhinagar. A statement to this effect released by the department of biotechnology (under the Union ministry of science & technology) on Saturday informed that “technology transfer agreements have been finalised with all manufacturers”.Two of the manufacturers are Hester Biosciences, an animal healthcare company, and OmniBRx, a biotech company. The third, Gujarat Biotechnology Research Centre, is an institute under the state’s department of science and technology. Together, they are likely to add a production capacity of 20 million doses per month.The Centre had last month announced financial support to Bharat Biotech as well as three public sector undertakings to increase vaccine production to 100 million doses per month by September. A grant of ₹65 crore was given to Bharat Biotech’s new Bangalore facility to repurpose it for vaccine production. Another ₹65 crore was given to PSU Haffkine Biopharmaceutical Corporation in Mumbai to manufacture 20 million doses a month, ₹60 crore to Indian Immunologicals Limited-Hyderabad, and ₹30 crore to Bharat Immunologicals and Biologicals Limited in Bulandshahr to produce up to 15 million doses a month.Last week, top government advisor, Dr V K Paul of NITI Aayog, had said that the Centre and Bharat Biotech are willing to invite other companies to produce the vaccine. This was amid growing calls from experts to transfer the technology of the indigenously developed vaccine, the rights to which are jointly owned by Indian Council of Medical Research.But Paul insisted that Saturday’s announcement wasn’t influenced by the growing clamour for technology transfer even though some people have tried to make that connection. “Complex technologies cannot be transferred like this. It takes about 70 to 75 days for the vaccine to be manufactured. Bharat Biotech along with the government have transferred technology to the three PSUs. This is the outcome of those efforts,” Paul said at a health ministry briefing on Saturday.He added, “We have been trying to do this and we will keep assessing where else it can be manufactured, including other private players. This is not a vaccine that can be made in any laboratory. It deals with live virus and can only be done at Bio-Safety Level 3 labs so that it is not released in public.”India will need one and a half billion vaccine doses to inoculate its adult population. For this, it will have to rapidly enhance supply even as the second wave of the pandemic rages.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/2-firms-guj-institute-to-scale-up-covaxin-production-101621103524250.html
16-05-2021||India||Govt, people misread pandemic after first wave of Covid: RSS chief||Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) chief Mohan Bhagwat said on Saturday that both the government and the people misread the situation after the first wave of the coronavirus pandemic, which resulted in complacency leading to the present situation. The country now needs to face the problem with a positive frame of mind and people should help in whatever capacity they can, he said.Urging people not to give up, Bhagwat said just as Britain did not lose courage during World War II and withstood adverse conditions to emerge victorious, India should not lose hope and must view the pandemic as a challenge to be overcome.To underscore the need to face the challenge with a positive frame of mind, he referred to an inscription on former British premier Winston Churchill’s seat that read: “Please understand there is no depression in this house and we are not interested in the possibilities of defeat. They do not exist.”Delivering a lecture online, Bhagwat said, “Some people have died… they should not have died this way, untimely. But those who have passed away are in a way free and they don’t have to face it anymore… but we have to. We have to keep ourselves and our people safe and therefore we don’t need negationism. We can’t say nothing has happened, everything is alright. We are not saying that. Situation is hard and saddening, but while accepting that we are not going to allow ourselves to feel negative,” he said.The lecture is part of a “positivity unlimited” series that the RSS has initiated with an aim to help people overcome difficulties during the second wave of the pandemic that has ravaged the country. There has been severe criticism of the government for failing to prepare for the second wave and for deficiencies in meeting the demand for health care. Both the RSS and its political arm, the Bharatiya Janata Party, are pushing to shift the popular narrative towards “positivity and a proactive approach”.“If we get tired and give up, then we will be like the rat who gives up in front of a snake. We cannot let this happen. There is as much hope as there is unhappiness. In such a situation many wrongdoings happen, but a lot of people are doing good deeds, they are helping people in whatever capacity they can,” he said.Amid criticism that the government dropped the ball on Covid management, Bhagwat said now that scientists have cautioned about a third wave, arrangements should be made so that the country is well prepared.Urging people not to feel depressed or disillusioned, Bhagwat said hearing about the situation being bad every day should not demoralise us. He said the focus should be on helping people find beds in hospitals, oxygen and the other things needed. He also spoke about ensuing that students do not miss out on acquiring knowledge.“We have to worry about those who depend on daily wages, we should ensure that they do not go hungry. We should look around us and see what the problems are and help those in need,” he said, adding that the country will also need to start making arrangements to see how we can face up to the economic problems that will arise.“The challenge will test our good qualities...It is an exam of our patience. Success is not final, failure is not fatal. The courage to continue is the only thing that matters. We have to have the courage to continue,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-people-misread-pandemic-after-first-wave-of-covid-rss-chief-101621103404325.html
16-05-2021||India||Govt says Covid-19 situation stabilising but flags cases of black fungus||The overall Covid-19 situation in the country appears to be stabilising, the Union government said on Saturday, but experts also warned that secondary infections such as mucormycosis or “black fungus” were adding to the country’s mortality rate.Niti Aayog member Dr VK Paul said that to control the spread of the rare fungal infection, people must control their blood sugar levels, maintain hygiene, and doctors must prescribe steroids with caution. “Some states are reporting 400 to 500 cases; we do not know the burden of the disease yet. This is an emerging problem and ICMR (Indian Council of Medical Research) has started collecting data. We have also asked states to keep an eye on it,” he said.Black fungus cases went up 2.5 times last year between September and December across 16 centres in the country, according to Dr Arunaloke Chakrabarti, head of the department of microbiology at Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education & Research, Chandigarh. He is part of the Fungal Infection Study Forum and is one of the members who drafted the government advisory on mucormycosis.India’s Covid-19 positivity rate – proportion of samples that return positive – dipped from 21.9% last week to 19.8%, said Union health ministry’s joint secretary Lav Agarwal during the health ministry briefing on Saturday. A dropping positivity rate is indicative of slowing of the spread of infection, but experts urged caution.An increase in cases was seen in Tamil Nadu, which was a “cause of concern,” Agarwal said. Currently, 11 states have over 100,000 active cases, eight states have 50,000 to 100,000 active cases, and 17 have fewer than 50,000 cases, according to data shared by the official.Dr Randeep Guleria, director of the All India Institute of Medical Sciences, who was present at the briefing, said that there was a need to ensure good infection control practices in hospitals as there was an increase in secondary infections such as Covid-associated mucormycosis.Click here for complete Covid-19 coverageThere are at least 23 people with the infection currently admitted to AIIMS, of whom 20 are still positive for Covid-19, Dr Guleria said.Mucormycosis, also known as black fungus, has been seen among those who have uncontrolled diabetes, whose immunity is compromised or those who are given excessive steroids or immune-modulating drugs such as tocilizumab.According to doctors, if left untreated, it may kill 80% of those infected. If not detected early, it affects the orbit of the eye and the mouth, resulting in people losing their vision or jaw during debridement — the process of removing dead tissue from an infection or wound.“Covid-19 itself is a risk factor for the infection as it leads to the reduction in lymphocytes (white blood cells, one of body’s main immune cells), this increases the risk of opportunistic infections. There was a similar increase in fungal infections seen during the SARS outbreak too. The second risk factor is uncontrolled diabetes and the third is misuse of steroids (which suppress the immune system),” said Dr Guleria.He added: “Studies have shown that steroid given in those who have mild disease and are not on oxygen leads to more morbidity and mortality because of secondary infections.” The expert urged diabetics to keep their sugar levels in check and those who have been treated with steroids to monitor their blood sugar levels.He added that high doses of steroids were not required for the treatment of Covid-19 patients. “Mild to moderate dose is good and only for five to 10 days. Longer use of steroids also leads to poor control of blood sugar and increases the chances of fungal infections.”Other than the focus on the fungal infection, Paul also said that the country “managed” to deal with four million active cases, the case fatality ration (CFR) – the proportion of people who die among those who test positive – “remained stable”, and the improvement was faster than the previous wave.He said that a “narrative” was being created that the technology transfer for Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin happened because “certain people” said it should be done a few weeks ago.“There is a narrative that the tie-ups for Covaxin is being done after some people said it a few weeks ago. That is not the case. Complex technologies cannot be transferred like this. It takes about 70 to 75 days for the vaccine to be manufactured. Bharat Biotech along with the government has transferred technology to the three PSUs. This is the outcome of those efforts,” he said.He also said that the second “narrative” was that the duration between two Covishield shots was being increased to 12-16 weeks due to vaccine shortage. He said everyone should trust the experts in the National Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation (NTAGI), which had taken the decision based on data coming out of the UK, where the duration had been extended.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-says-covid-19-situation-stabilising-101621103346140.html
16-05-2021||India||Tauktae may intensify into ‘very severe cyclonic storm’, says IMD||The next 12 to 15 hours might see Cyclone Tauktae (pronounced Tau’te) become a “very severe cyclonic storm” with wind speeds reaching up to 145 km/hr, officials at the India Meteorological Department said on Saturday. They also mapped its likely trajectory and estimated it to move north-northwestwards and cross the Gujarat coast between Porbandar and Naliya around afternoon or evening of May 18.Sunitha Devi, who studies cyclones at IMD, said she spotted some similarities between the current cyclone and the one that hit Gujarat in 1998. Tauktae was a depression until Friday, when it intensified very rapidly into a cyclone — all due to various favourable atmospheric and oceanic conditions, said Devi.Independent experts have noticed cyclones intensifying over the Arabian Sea more frequently in recent years and say this is due to global warming pushing sea surface temperatures up. “Rapid warming has made the relatively cooler Arabian Sea (compared to the Bay of Bengal) a warm pool region that can actively support cyclone formation,” said Roxy Mathew Koll, a climate scientist at the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology. “Climate projections indicate that the Arabian Sea will continue to warm under increased carbon emissions, resulting in more intense cyclones in the future.”OP Sreejith, scientist and head, Climate Monitoring and Prediction Group at IMD Pune, said there were two more cyclones in the past with similar tracks. One blew from May 13 to 19 in 1933, the other between May 20 and 21 in 1975. The memory of Cyclone Amphan wreaking havoc in West Bengal last year is only too recent. So, Tauktae has worried the agencies, more so because there is already a pandemic raging, which could likely complicate evacuation and relief efforts.Before making landfall on May 18, the cyclone will move alongside the coastline, triggering very heavy rain at several places, experts indicated. “We are most worried about flash floods that it can trigger, creating devastation in places that are already battling Covid. Pre-emptive measures such as evacuations need to be adopted with great care, adhering to Covid protocols,” said Anshu Sharma, co-founder, Sustainable Environment and Ecological Development Society.He added that the authorities are bracing for impact. “We are ramping up support to local communities to interpret the warnings in their own hyperlocal contexts, and to take appropriate action. We are also pre-positioning our supply lines to extend relief support if required anywhere,” said Sharma.The sea will be choppy from May 15 until May 18 with phenomenal waves (up to 14 metres high) and wind speeds (up to 64 knots) along the coast of Kerala, Maharashtra, Goa, Karnataka, and Gujarat, with Gujarat likely to be the worst-hit. Met has warned that tidal waves of up to 3-metre height are likely to inundate coastal areas of Morbi, Kutch, Devbhoomi Dwarka, Jamnagar, Porbandar, Junagadh, Gir Somnath, Amreli, Bhavnagar and other coastal districts of Gujarat.Then there is rain to contend with. Kerala and Karnataka are likely to receive very heavy rain on May 16, with coastal and ghat areas of Karnataka getting extremely heavy rain (over 20 cm). Konkan, Goa and adjoining ghat areas might also get very heavy rain on May 16 and 17.Light to moderate rain is likely to occur in coastal districts of Saurashtra from May 16 afternoon, while heavy to very heavy rain might occur at isolated places in Junagadh and Gir Somnath districts on May 17. Over 20 cm rainfall might also occur at isolated places in Porbandar, Devbhoomi Dwarka, Jamnagar and Kutch districts on May 18. Parts of West Rajasthan are also likely to receive light to heavy rain on May 18 and 19.Already, gale winds with speeds up to 95 km/hr are blowing over east-central Arabian Sea and adjoining southeast Arabian Sea and Lakshadweep areas. From May 16 morning, this might go up to 145 km/hr.Squalls of up to 70 km/hr are hitting Karnataka, south Maharashtra, and Goa coasts; on May 16, Maharashtra and Goa coasts will see squalls of up to 80 km/hr.Squalls with speeds of up to 60 km/hr are likely over south Gujarat, Daman and Diu coasts on May 17, which, by May 18, will turn into gale winds of up to 175 km/hr. Off the Saurashtra and Kutch coasts (Devbhoomi Dwarka and Porbandar), gale winds of up to 165 km/hr will blow on May 18 morning, hitting Junagadh and Jamnagar districts too. Extensive damage is expected in these areas and in Amreli, Rajkot and Morbi districts.The Met department wants a total suspension of fishing operations in Gujarat and other states on the west coast. It has also asked for regulation of rail and road traffic and advised people to stay indoors.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tauktae-may-intensify-into-very-severe-cyclonic-storm-says-imd-101621103345606.html
16-05-2021||India||Aadhaar not must for treatment, vaccine: UIDAI||No one shall be denied vaccines, medicines, hospitalisation or treatment for want of Aadhaar number, the Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI), the statutory authority that issues 12-digit unique identification numbers called “Aadhaar” to Indian residents, said on Saturday.“Aadhaar should not be misused as an excuse for denial of any essential service. There is a well established exception handling mechanism (EHM) for Aadhaar and it should be followed to ensure delivery of benefits and services in the absence of Aadhaar. If a resident does not possess Aadhaar for some or the other reason, s/he must not be denied essential services as per Aadhaar Act,” the authority said in a statement.UIDAI issued the statement after a section of media reported that vaccination and few other essential services such as hospitalisation were being denied to residents for want of Aadhaar.An identification (ID) document is, however, required for getting Covid-19 vaccines. According to the Aarogya Setu app, people can register themselves for vaccination by using one of the seven IDs – Aadhaar number, driving licence, permanent account number (PAN), passport, pension passbook, NPR smart card and voter ID.In the pandemic situation, no one shall be denied any service or benefit in want of Aadhaar number, the statement said. “If one does not have Aadhaar or if Aadhaar online verification is not successful due to some reason, the concerned agency or department has to provide the service as per Section 7 of Aadhaar Act, 2016 and the Cabinet Secretariat OM dated 19th Dec 2017,” it said.While Section 7 ensures that there is no exclusion and no denial of essential services, the Cabinet Secretariat in 2017 clarified that the use of alternative means of identification is allowed for extending benefits and essential services to such Indian residents who do not posses Aadhaar or whose Aadhaar authentication is not successful.UIDAI said Aadhaar is meant to bring transparency and accountability in public service deliveries through effective use of technology, but there are exceptions. It said in case of any such denial, the matter should be brought to the knowledge of the higher authorities of concerned department.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/aadhaar-not-must-for-treatment-vaccine-uidai-101621103164197.html
16-05-2021||India||GST Council meet on May 28, tax waivers on medicines on agenda||The Goods and Services Tax (GST) Council will meet for the first time in seven months on May 28 to discuss key issues such as compensation to states and tax waivers on various medicines, medical devices, and health services amid the second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic, two officials said on Saturday.The office of finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Saturday tweeted the date and timing of the meeting. The move came after several states, including Punjab and West Bengal, raised the issue of an inordinate delay in convening the meeting, the officials aware of the developments said on condition of anonymity.“Smt @nsitharaman will chair the 43rd GST Council meeting via video conferencing at 11 AM in New Delhi on 28th May 2021. The meeting will be attended by MOS Shri @ianuragthakur besides Finance Ministers of States & UTs and Senior officers from Union Government & States,” a tweet from the finance minister’s office said.The GST Council is required to meet once in every quarter. Its meetings are convened by the finance ministry as the council is chaired by the Union finance minister. Finance ministers of states and Union Territories (UTs) are members of the council, the apex federal body on indirect tax matters.The last time the council met was on October 5, 2020 (the 42nd meeting) to resolve the issue of compensating states for their revenue shortfall in 2020-21. That meeting was extended to next week on October 12 for finalising a centralised borrowing mechanism to meet the revenue shortfall. After that, the council did not meet.Earlier this week, West Bengal finance minister Amit Mitra wrote to Sitharaman, asking her to convene the GST Council meeting immediately as states were expecting an alarming shortfall in GST compensation revenue because of the Covid-19 pandemic. “As per GoI [Government of India] projection, the shortfall was expected to be to the tune of ₹1,56,164 crores in 2021-22 without taking into consideration the impact of Covid Wave-2,” Mitra said in the letter to the finance minister. HT reported on the letter on May 14.Last week, Punjab finance minister Manpreet Singh Badal asked the Union finance minister to urgently convene a meeting of the council for a “serious mid-term correction” on tax issues. In his letter Badal said: “...failure to hold any constructive consultation with states for so long in such critical times makes me wonder whether Centre has usurped all the powers of states putting the spirit of cooperative federalism...”Besides full compensation to states, many members want GST waivers on several critical items necessary for people at the time of the pandemic, including vaccines, key medicines and health care services. These matters could be discussed at the council meet, the officials mentioned above said.Ranjeet Mahtani, partner at consultancy firm Dhruva Advisors, said the council needs to resolve other pressing issues such as inverted duty structure on certain products. “This has lingered as an issue for some time now,” he said. According to him, there is a need to rationalise GST rates and reduce the number of tax slabs by merging the 12% and 18% slabs into one revenue-neutral rate. He said compensation is also a key issue for states.At the time of introducing the new indirect tax regime in July 2017, the GST law assured states a 14% increase in their annual revenue for five years (up to 2022), and assured them that their revenue shortfall would be made good through the compensation cess levied on luxury goods and sin products such as liquor, cigarettes, aerated water, automobiles, coal and tobacco.The issue of compensating states for their revenue losses due to a 68-day lockdown and because of the first wave of Covid-19 came up in the previous fiscal year, when GST revenues plunged and there was a gap of over ₹1.10 lakh crore in the collection of compensation cess. The matter was resolved after the Centre agreed to raise back-to-back loans on behalf of states and compensated them for their shortfall in revenue. It was decided that the loan would be repaid from the compensation cess revenue collected in the future.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/gst-council-meet-on-may-28-tax-waivers-on-medicines-on-agenda-101621103104257.html

The high-level meeting was attended by officials from the states, central ministries, and agencies concerned to deal with the situation arising out of the approaching cyclonic storm. Union home minister Amit Shah was also present.Also Read: India closely monitoring Cyclone Tauktae, no decision yet on shutting airportsWhile reviewing preparations over Cyclone Tauktae, Prime Minister Modi called for ensuring maintenance of all essential services such as power, telecommunications, health, and drinking water and their immediate restoration in the event of damages caused to them, according to a government state.Issuing an alert over Cyclone Tauktae, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) announced earlier this day that a deep depression over the Arabian Sea had intensified into the cyclonic storm was currently centered over Lakshadweep island. Tauktae (pronounced Tau’Te) is predicted to intensify further into a 'very severe cyclonic storm’ by Monday, with windspeed ranging between 150kmph and 160kmph. It is very likely to move north-northwestwards and cross the Gujarat coast between Porbandar and Naliya around 18th May afternoon/evening.Also Read: As Tauktae approaches west coast, know more about the storm and how to track itThe Union ministry of home affairs (MHA), under the direct supervision of Amit Shah, is reviewing the Cyclone Tauktae situation 24x7 and is in constant touch with the state governments and central agencies concerned, it was said. The home ministry has already released the first instalment of the state disaster relief fund (SDRF) in advance to all states, the press note read. NDRF has also pre-positioned 42 teams which are equipped with boats, tree-cutters, and telecom equipment in six states and has kept 26 teams on standby, it read.Prime Minister Modi said that concerned officials must ensure special preparedness on Covid-19 management in hospitals, vaccine cold chain and other medical facilities on power back up and storage of essential medicines and to plan for unhindered movement of oxygen tankers. He also said that special care needs to be taken to ensure that there is the least possible disruption in oxygen supply from Jamnagar and spoke about the need to involve the local community in timely sensitisation and relief measures, the prime minister's office (PMO) said.The India Meteorological Department (IMD) said at the meeting that Cyclone Tauktae is expected to touch the Gujarat coast between Porbandar and Naliya around May 18 afternoon or evening with a wind speed ranging up to 175 kmph.Cyclone Tauktae is likely to cause heavy rainfall in the coastal districts of Gujarat, including extremely heavy falls in Junagadh and Gir Somnath and heavy to very heavy rain at a few places in the districts of Saurashtra, Kutch and Diu, namely Gir Somnath, Diu, Junagadh, Porbandar, Devbhoomi Dwarka, Amreli, Rajkot, Jamnagar.The IMD also warned of storm surge of about two-three metre above astronomical tide to inundate coastal areas of Morbi, Kutch, Devbhoomi Dwarka and Jamnagar districts and one-two metre along Porbandar, Junagarh, Diu, Gir Somnath, Amreli, Bhavnagar and 0.5 to one metre over the remaining coastal districts of Gujarat, the statement said.

16-05-2021||India||Cyclone Tauktae likely to intensify into ‘very severe storm’, to cross Gujarat coast on May 18||Cyclone Tauktae (pronounced as Tau’Te) is likely to intensify into a ‘very severe cyclonic storm’ in the next 12 to 15 hours with a wind speed of 120 to 130 kmph gusting to 145 kmph, according to the India Meteorological Department.It is also expected to move north north-westwards and cross the Gujarat coast between Porbandar and Naliya as a very severe cyclonic storm around May 18 afternoon or evening.Tauktae intensified very rapidly from a depression to a cyclone on Friday. “The cyclone track is very similar to the 1998 Gujarat cyclone except that storm had crossed Kandla. We noticed rapid intensification of Tauktae because of various favourable atmospheric and oceanic parameters,” said Sunitha Devi, in charge, cyclones at IMD.Independent experts said rapid intensification of cyclones over Arabian Sea is linked to a marked rise in sea surface temperatures due to climate change. “The frequency and intensity of cyclones in the Arabian Sea have increased in recent years. This is because of the rapid warming that has made the relatively cooler Arabian Sea (compared to the Bay of Bengal) a warm pool region that can actively support cyclone formation. Climate projections indicate that Arabian Sea will continue warming under increased carbon emissions, resulting in more intense cyclones in the future,” said Roxy Mathew Koll, a climate scientist at the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology on Saturday.There were two more cyclones in the past with similar tracks according to OP Sreejith, scientist and head, Climate Monitoring and Prediction Group (CMPG) at IMD Pune. One in 1933 between May 13 to 19 and another in 1975 between May 20 to 21. The 1998 Gujarat cyclone had killed over 4,000 people.“Conditions are extremely favourable for its (Tauktae’s) rapid intensification. Ocean heat potential is above normal; sea surface temperatures are 1-2 degree C above normal… We should be prepared,” Sunitha Devi had said on Thursday when a low pressure area had formed over the Arabian Sea.Agencies are facing multiple challenges of maintaining Covid-19 protocol, evacuation efforts during a pandemic and the risks from Tauktae itself. Last year, super cyclonic storm Amphan had formed in the pre-monsoon season and crossed the West Bengal coast over Sundarbans on May 20. It claimed over 90 lives and about 4,000 livestock mainly in West Bengal. According to WMO, Amphan is estimated to be the costliest tropical cyclone on record in the North Indian Ocean with economic losses of approximately US$14 billion.“Cyclone Tauktae has arrived at an already critical time when Covid-19 cases are very high, and communities are struggling in most of our western coastal states. As the cyclone moves alongside the entire coastline, it will trigger very heavy rainfall in a number of places, till it finally hits land in Gujarat on May 18, as per current forecasts. While cyclones carry an image of strong winds, we are most worried about flash floods that it can trigger, creating devastation in places already battling Covid-19. Pre-emptive moves such as evacuations need to be carried out with great care, adhering to Covid-19 protocols such as social distancing and masking. We are ramping up our support to local communities to interpret the warnings in their own hyper-local contexts, and to take appropriate action. We are also pre-positioning our supply lines to extend relief support if required anywhere,” said Anshu Sharma, Co-founder, Sustainable Environment and Ecological Development Society.Sea condition over east-central Arabian Sea will be high to very high (9-14 metres wave height/38-63 wind speed in kts) on May 15 and very high to phenomenal (14 metres wave height /64 wind speed in kts) on May 16 and over northeast Arabian Sea on May 17 and 18.Sea conditions will be rough to very rough over Comorin area and along and off Kerala coast on May 15 and 16; very rough to high over east central Arabian Sea along and off Karnataka coast and Maharashtra – Goa coasts on both days. It is very likely to be very rough to high over northeast Arabian Sea along and off south Gujarat coast from May 17 morning and very high to phenomenal on May 18.Tidal wave of about 2-3 m above astronomical tide is likely to inundate coastal areas of Morbi, Kutch, Devbhoomi Dwarka and Jamnagar districts and 1-2 meters along Porbandar, Junagarh, Gir Somnath, Amreli, Bhavnagar and 0.5 to 1m over the remaining coastal districts of Gujarat, IMD has warned.There is likely to be heavy to very heavy rain over Kerala and Karnataka on May 16 and extremely heavy rain (over 20 cm) over coastal and ghat areas of Karnataka. Heavy to very heavy rain is also likely over Konkan, Goa, adjoining ghat areas on May 16 and 17.Light to moderate rainfall at many places is likely to commence over coastal districts of Saurashtra from May 16 afternoon, at many places with heavy to very heavy rainfall at isolated places over Saurashtra and Kutch and extremely heavy rainfall at isolated places over Junagarh and Gir Somnath districts on May 17 with extremely heavy rainfall (over 20 cm) at isolated places (Porbandar, Devbhoomi Dwarka, Jamnagar and Kutch districts) on May 18. Parts of West Rajasthan are also likely to record light to moderate rainfall at many places with heavy to very heavy rainfall at isolated places on May 18 and 19.Gale wind speed reaching 75–85 kmph gusting to 95 kmph is prevailing over east-central Arabian Sea and adjoining southeast Arabian Sea and Lakshadweep area.

16-05-2021||India||Officials fret as Malana villagers refuse vaccine citing deity’s diktat||For two months, health care workers have been trekking 7km every alternate day of the week to reach the remote villages of Malana in Kullu district of Himachal Pradesh. Their aim: to take the Covid-19 vaccines to a remote corner of the country -- to the villages nestled in the Himalayas at an altitude of around 9,900 feet.But their efforts have been in vain.Not a single person in the two villages in Malana, with around 2,000 residents, has been inoculated yet. Health care workers say villagers, who believe they are the descendents of Greek king Alexander, repeatedly refused to get the jab because it is against their beliefs.The residents of Malana have followed their traditions for centuries now. Most decisions are taken by their own local governing bodies, but the local deity -- Jamdagni Rishi or Jamlu Devta -- has the final say.“I’ve been trying to convince the villagers, but they refuse citing the deity’s diktat. In 2015, it took me three months to convince mothers to get their children vaccinated (for newborns). But this time, not a single person in the village has come forward for vaccination and my attempts to convince them have proven futile,” said 35-year-old Nirmala Devi, an accredited social health activist (ASHA) who has been working in the Kullu district for several years and has been walking up from the nearest bus station in Jari to Malana for weeks now.Villagers in the area refused to comment on the matter.“Himachalis have faith in mystical powers of deities. The deity culture is a part of our daily life but at the same time the safety of people is of importance. Residents are reluctant to get inoculated but I’ll try to persuade them again,” Kullu legislator Sunder Thakur said on Friday.Panchayat secretary Tek Chand, too, said he has been trying to convince the villagers to get vaccinated since the government launched the drive for senior citizens in the first phase. But “they have immense faith in the deity and it’s difficult to convince them. I have tried to educate panchayat representatives during our meetings, but in vain,” he said.“The final decision will be taken by the village parliament. Its meeting is to be held shortly (next week). I’m trying to persuade residents too,” said panchayat pradhan Raju Ram.The Malana panchayat comprises two villages of Saura Behad and Dhara Behad and has a total population of 2,041 in 475 households, comprising 1,039 men and 1,002 women. The main occupation of villagers is sheep rearing and agriculture.LOCKED DOWNIndia’s second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic crept up to several regions that were previously unaffected, but Malana’s relative isolation has kept it from seeing a full-blown outbreak since the beginning of the pandemic.Early last year, the two villages banned more than 20 guest houses in their vicinity from operating. According to them, the local deity, Jamdagni Rishi or Jamlu Devta, had prohibited the entry of outsiders after the Covid-19 outbreak.The village also closed entry to outsiders a week before the first nationwide lockdown was enforced on March 25, and although the self-imposed restrictions have eased now, there are no tourists who visit.“We deputed people to guard the trails leading to our villages to restrict entry of tourist, we had eased them but now no outsiders visit the village,” Bhagi Rama, a Malana resident, said.So far, Malana has not recorded any Covid-19 case and death linked to the illness.NOT JUST MALANAIt’s not Malana alone, the vaccination drive in the entire Kullu district has been slower than other districts. Around 135,077 doses of the vaccine have been administered in Kullu so far, lagging behind Kangra’s 464,172, Mandi’s 352,285 and Shimla’s 278,041.Till Saturday evening, Himachal Pradesh administered a total of 2.2 million doses of the vaccine.Vaccination for the 18-44 age group is yet to begin, and will start only on Monday.“We are analysing the progress of vaccination in the state. Where people are reluctant, we will seek the help of motivators,” said Dr Gopal Berry, deputy mission director of the National Rural Health Mission.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/not-one-resident-in-hp-s-remote-malana-village-has-taken-vaccine-101621076463814.html

16-05-2021||India||Kerala braces to meet threat of Cyclone Tauktae||Heavy rains triggered by impending Cyclone Tauktae battered many parts of the Kerala and more than 15,000 people living in low-lying areas and coastal villages were shifted to temporary camps on Friday, the Kerala Disaster Management Authority said.After the India Meteorological Department’s warning that the cyclone is gathering high velocity and strength, a red alert was declared in five districts-- Thiruvananthapuram, Kollam, Alappuzha, Pathanamitta and Ernakulam. As the sea turned turbulent many coastal villages bore the brunt and several houses were damaged in Thiruvananthapuram, Kochi and Alappuzha. A 19-year-old youth was drowned in a swollen river in Mukkam in Kozhikode district.The whole state has been on high alert and nine teams of the National Disaster Response Force have been deployed in affected areas. Kerala has also sought the help of three armed forces. Some areas have received 40 mm rain in the last 24 hours.“We are facing a peculiar situation. In the midst of the fight against the Covid-19 pandemic, the cyclonic threat is posing an additional burden on us but we will overcome it,” said chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan adding the state is prepared to meet the fresh challenge posed by the cyclone. He said the army, air force and navy units were ready to help the state in case of an emergency.Reeling under the impact of Covid-19, it is a double whammy for many villages. In Kochi’s Chellanam where the test positivity rate is more than 50 per cent, high tides damaged at least fifty houses. Many people were reluctant to leave their homes fearing they would be infected. “We are literally between the devil and the deep sea. A perennial sea erosion area we have been seeking a strong sea wall for many years,” said resident Antony Sebastian who lost his three-roomed house.Overworked officials have set up separate relief camps for Covid-19 positive patients and health workers have been deputed to monitor their health condition. Authorities swung into action after the warning and opened many relief camps in coastal districts. Some of the rivers in Thiruvananthapuram and Kochi have filled to the brim due to the heavy downpour. The state had witnessed a massive flood in 2018 that claimed 400 lives.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-braces-to-meet-threat-of-cyclone-tauktae-101621015081701.html

16-05-2021||India||Low pressure area over Arabian Sea may turn into cyclone Tauktae on Sunday||The low pressure area over Lakshadweep and adjoining southeast Arabian sea is now lying as a well marked low pressure area over the same region. It is very likely to concentrate into a depression during the next 24 hours and intensify further into a cyclonic storm, Tauktae in the subsequent 24 hours. It is then likely to intensify further and move north-northwestwards towards Gujarat and adjoining Pakistan coasts and reach near Gujarat coast around May 18 evening. “We cannot rule out intensification similar to Super Cyclone Amphan. At present, it is difficult to say which category of intensification the cyclone will reach. But conditions are extremely favourable for its rapid intensification. Ocean heat potential is above normal; sea surface temperatures are 1-2 degrees C above normal and Madden Julian Oscillation (MJO) is also favouring rapid intensification. We should be prepared,” Sunitha Devi, in-charge of cyclones at India Meteorological Department had said on Thursday.Also Read | Major township project in Great Nicobar to impact turtle nesting sites, coralsUnder its influence, heavy to very heavy rainfall is likely at a few places over Lakshadweep during May 13 to 16 with isolated extremely heavy rain on May 13 and 14; heavy to very heavy rainfall is likely at a few places over Kerala during May 13 to 16 with extremely heavy falls (more than 20 cm) at isolated places on May 14 to 15; heavy to very heavy rainfall at isolated places over Tamil Nadu is very likely on May 14 to 16, with extremely heavy falls at isolated places on May 15; heavy to very heavy rainfall at a few places is likely over Coastal and adjoining ghat districts of Karnataka during May 14-17 with extremely heavy fall at isolated places on May 15.A Western Disturbance as a trough (area of low pressure) is affecting the western Himalayan region and a cyclonic circulation is lying over central parts of south Uttar Pradesh and neighbourhood and another cyclonic circulation lying over central Pakistan. Under the influence of these systems, fairly widespread to widespread rainfall with isolated thunderstorm or lightning or gusty winds and hailstorm is very likely over western Himalayan region and scattered to fairly widespread rainfall with isolated thunderstorm or lightning or gusty winds is likely over plains of northwest India during the next 24 hours. Heavy rainfall is also likely over Uttarakhand and Himachal Pradesh during the next 24 hours.Under the influence of an east-west trough from the cyclonic circulation over southeast Madhya Pradesh and neighbourhood to Assam across Jharkhand and Gangetic West Bengal, fairly widespread rainfall or thunderstorm activity is very likely to continue over northeastern states and West Bengal and Sikkim and isolated to scattered rain or thundershower is likely over rest parts of east India during the next two days. No heat wave is likely over any part of the country during the next 5 days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/low-pressure-area-over-arabian-sea-may-turn-into-cyclone-tauktae-on-sunday-101620961737275.html
16-05-2021||India||Cyclone Tauktae: Red alert in 3 Kerala districts ahead of impending storm||Struggling with the massive surge in Covid-19 cases, there seems to be more trouble in store for Kerala after the India Meteorological Department (IMD) issued a red alert for three districts-- Thiruvananthapuram, Kollam and Pathanamthitta-- for Friday in view of the intensifying cyclonic storm Tauktae over the Arabian Sea.The IMD has also issued a red alert in five other districts for Saturday-- Malappuram, Kozhikode, Wayanad, Kannur and Kasaragod. Located near Lakshadweep, the low pressure will move in a north-westerly direction gaining enough speed by Sunday, the regional met office said. Following the IMD’s announcement Kerala has opened control rooms and asked people living in coastal areas to keep strict vigil. A red alert means heavy rainfall with more than 24 mm of downpour in 24 hours. Many areas in south Kerala have been witnessing heavy rainfall and strong winds since morning and high tide has been reported in several coastal areas. The Kerala Disaster Management Authority has also advised people to remain indoors and take enough safeguard against lightning, thunder, strong winds and heavy downpour. Many low-lying areas in Thiruvananthapuram have been submerged due to incessant rain, revenue authorities said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cyclone-tauktae-red-alert-in-3-kerala-districts-ahead-of-impending-storm-101620920872194.html
16-05-2021||Today's||Covid-19: The everyday tragedy in Indian cities, towns and villages||It is an ominous sound that I have come to dread — the ring of the mobile. So when my childhood friend, who is Covid-19 positive, called to tell me that his wife had succumbed to the virus after three days in the hospital, my heart sank. While trying to come to grips with this dreadful news, my friend said, “Shekhar, I need one last help from you today. Make arrangements for her cremation. One has to wait for at least 12 hours to get a space for the pyre here.” I never dreamt I would have to undertake such a painful task. However, despite my best efforts, it took us ages to send her on her final journey.Religious beliefs suggest that a cremation at Kashi’s Manikarnika Ghat ensures salvation for the departed soul. A few days ago, the situation had become so dire there that grieving relatives were begging workers to take the bodies of their loved ones and cremate them whenever possible. Their only request was that traditions should be observed. But they were lucky in finding a place, for, in Uttar Pradesh (UP) and Bihar, dozens of bodies have been found floating down the Ganges and Karmanasha rivers. They were all Indians, entitled to proper last rites, according to both the law and tradition, but due to the chaos all around, people were forced to surrender their dead to the rivers against the tenets of Hinduism.The administration buried some of them using excavators. These are also being used to remove thousands of kilos of ashes from the cremation ghat at Kashi. Among the dead were those who believed in the fiery speeches and powerful slogans of the leaders they voted for. In their moment of need, these leaders were nowhere to be found. Covid-19 did not kill these people, they died from a lack of oxygen and medicines.In my four-decade-long career as a journalist, I have never dwelt on death so much. Now, I don’t know when I will stop because death has become an overwhelming part of our daily lives. Why have we come to such a pass? The fault lies with our elected representatives. Living in their exclusive, sanitised havens, protected from the public by massive security, they are busy dwelling on how to win the next election rather than making significant welfare policies and programmes which will benefit the people who elected them. Did they know the second wave was coming? Of course, they did, but their priorities were different. No one party or politician is to blame. During polls, all of them hard-sell their slogans of vikas (development), vikalp (alternatives) and sushashan (good governance), with a dash of regional pride thrown in. Instead of making arrangements when there was a lull after the first wave, they did nothing, and instead tried their best to suppress the voices of those who raised the alarm. They ignored the cries of those pleading for help. Instead, in several places, the State turned against those trying to turn the spotlight on the impending disaster by filing cases against them. In the end, the courts had to step in.By giving the green light for the elections in five states and the panchayat polls in UP, the Election Commission (EC) jeopardised the lives of millions. This led the Madras High Court to ask EC why it should not be prosecuted for murder. The poll panel took great umbrage to this. What it should have done is apologise for its monumental lapses and put in place arrangements for future polls to ensure that people are never put at such risk again. But why stop at EC? Those who come around at election time with their tall promises to lure voters have failed us. They did not fulfil their end of the bargain. The pandemic will end sooner or later. But there is nothing to suggest that our so-called leaders will mend their ways. If they could not do it when faced with the onslaught of this lethal virus, they never will.Shashi Shekhar is editor-in-chief, Hindustan The views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/covid19-the-everyday-tragedy-in-indian-cities-towns-and-villages-101621167968487.html
16-05-2021||Editorials||The climate crisis and cyclones||A severe cyclonic storm, Tauktae, intensified on Saturday night into a “very severe cyclonic storm” over the east central Arabian Sea, and affected the Kerala, Goa, Karnataka and Maharashtra coastline over the weekend. According to the India Meteorological Department, it is “very likely to intensify further” during the next 12 hours, and may cross the Gujarat coast on Tuesday.While Tauktae is the first cyclone to hit India this year, climate scientists at the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology (IITM) have warned that the Arabian Sea is fast becoming a “cyclone hotbed”. Earlier, the Bay of Bengal used to have more cyclones because the sea surface temperature remains consistently above 28 degree Celsius, while the Arabian Sea area remained a degree or two cooler. But sea surface temperatures in the Arabian Sea have increased rapidly during the past century due to the climate crisis. Now, temperatures are often above the “warm pool threshold”, which supports the formation of intense cyclones. According to IITM, widespread extreme rainfall events (above 150 mm/day) have also increased threefold, thanks to the Arabian Sea’s warming. In reply to a Parliament question in March, the government confirmed that studies show an increasing trend of cyclonic storms over the Arabian Sea, based on data between 1965 and 2020.The warming of oceans means cyclones are now intensifying rapidly. While scientists need more investments in monitoring technology to track cyclones, state governments will now have much less time to take measures for evacuation, and, therefore, must bolster their cyclone preparedness plans now. But that is not happening. Reports suggest that the pace of the National Cyclone Risk Mitigation Project, which aims at reducing the vulnerability of coastal states, is very slow in the western parts of the country. Phase II of the project was approved in 2015 and was to be completed in 2020 for Goa, Gujarat, Karnataka, and Maharashtra. But data shows early warning systems and multi-purpose cyclone shelters are yet to be completed in many of these states. Another analysis of extreme weather events in the past 50 years has revealed that though tropical cyclones were the least frequent event, they caused 28.6% of the mortalities, second only to floods responsible for maximum human deaths. The only way to limit such casualties is to understand climate science, warnings, and be cyclone-ready; there is simply no other option.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/the-climate-crisis-and-cyclones-101621167547861.html
16-05-2021||Editorials||Covid-19: Don’t clamp down on criticism||Last week, Delhi Police arrested 25 people in 13 police stations for putting up posters critical of the Prime Minister and the Centre’s Covid-19 vaccination policy. Nearly 1,800 posters — which read “Modiji humare bachon ki vaccine videsh kyon bhej diya? (Why did Modi send vaccines meant for our children to foreign countries?) — were found in several districts in the capital. All the cases were registered under sections 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant) of the Indian Penal Code and other sections, including section 3 of the Prevention of Defacement of Property Act. A majority of those arrested were released on bail by Sunday. The police are trying to ascertain if the posters were printed at one press, and whether the order for the posters was given by an individual or any political party. Some news reports have alleged some opposition leaders were behind the posters.The Centre’s Covid-19 approach has become a major political faultline. However, this case isn’t about the merits of a critique of a government policy (in fact, this newspaper believes that, in principle, vaccine maitri was a good initiative); or what is an acceptable form of the critique; or who facilitated and encouraged it. It is about the constitutional right of every citizen to have a political view on an issue of national importance and propagate that view as a citizen or a member of a party.A full and free debate, including political narratives and counter-narratives, on Covid-19 will also ensure accountability, enable citizens to articulate and aggregate differences democratically, and provide the system with feedback. From political inputs to public sentiment to expert views, the State needs all the help it can get, and should see a distinct viewpoint as helpful. A clampdown on discussion and debate — even if in the form of political posters — is both wrong and unwise.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/covid19-don-t-clamp-down-on-criticism-101621167192264.html
