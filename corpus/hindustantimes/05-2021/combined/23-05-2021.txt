23-05-2021||Mumbai||‘Study in India’: The slogan for foreign university aspirants||With the travel restrictions amid the Covid-19 pandemic and uncertainty, students are dropping their plans to study abroad altogether, making India their top choice instead. For example, Renuka Bankar from Sangli had plans of pursuing a PhD at the University of Colorado, after completing her Masters in Science in Virology from the National Institute of Virology in Pune last year. After clearing a series of interviews, she began her application process, when the first lockdown was announced in March last year. Without wanting to waste any time, she soon took the National Eligibility Test (NET) for admissions to Indian institutes. Since then, Bankar has been working as a Junior Research Fellow for a Covid-19-related project at the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Bombay. “This is a project-based work that will extend for a few more months. After that I will start applying for PhD in an institute in India,” she said, adding that her plans of going abroad have been cancelled. Like Bankar, many are making India their top choice. “One of the biggest advantages of going to a foreign university is that we get to interact with people from all over the world. Studying online is not the same. Most of us pursuing research do not have a lot of time to wait around, so it makes sense to get admitted to an Indian institute of repute,” said another research scholar, from IIT Bombay, on condition of anonymity. For admission to PhD seats as Junior Research Fellows (JRF) at various institutes in the country, candidates must qualify the NET exam, which is held in June and December every year. However, with the lockdown, the June 2020 session was postponed and held in December last year. The December 2020 session was held this month. According to Anjan Ray, head, Human Resource Development Group-CSIR, which conducts the NET exams, the pandemic has only accelerated the existing phenomena of more researchers choosing India over foreign countries. In 2016, the June session saw applications from 1.57 lakh candidates for JRF positions at institutes affiliated to both CSIR and University Grants Commission (UGC). This dropped to 1.63 lakh in 2017, 1.55 lakh in 2018, 1.53 lakh in 2019. However, in 2020, the June session received 1.71 lakh applications, of which 2,247 qualified for CSIR JRF and 1,638 for UGC JRF. “As a conservative estimate, we have usually seen that half or one-third of those who qualify apply for jobs or PhD in India. A majority of the rest are expected to go abroad,” Ray explained. He said that over the past few years, however, this number has come down. For instance, in 2017, a total of 2,920 candidates applied for PhD in India. In 2018 and 2019, 1,601 and 1,127 candidates applied, respectively. However, those who qualified in 2018 and 2019 are still eligible to apply as results are valid for three years. “This means more people are expected to apply. This can be attributed to the fact that India is not able to retain more talent through a good fellowship programme. Another reason could be that many Indian senior researchers, working abroad, are returning and are now available as PhD guides to more students,” said Ray, adding that this is a gain for Indian academia.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/study-in-india-the-slogan-for-foreign-university-aspirants-101621794543716.html
23-05-2021||Chandigarh||Covid shadow over bike sharing project in Chandigarh||The second Covid-19 wave has put into question the continuation of the popular public bicycle sharing system in the city.On one hand the Cycle4change challenge, under which the public bicycle sharing was launched in October last year, will be ending on May 31. And at the same time, the launch of the first phase of the Chandigarh Smart City Limited (CSCL) public bicycle sharing system (PBSS) project has been delayed by at least two months. The first phase was to be launched in May.Currently, 225 bicycles, including more than 100 pedal-assisted e-Bikes, can be rented from 25 docking stations spread across the city. The stations include prominent locations such as Rock Garden, High Court, Sukhna Lake, PGIMER, Sector 17, Sector 22, Sector 34, Sector 35, and Sector 43.Cycles likely to be unavailable after May 31Chief general manager of CSCL, NP Sharma, said, “We have written to the company managing cycles under the Cycle4Change challenge to stop charging people from June 1 onwards as the challenge ends on May 31. We are awaiting their response on whether the cycles will be available after May 31 or not.”If the company says no to offering free cycles, there would be none available for public use. Users are charged at ₹10 for an hour and ₹5 for half an hour.On the delayed start of the CSCL’s project, Sharma said, “We have given two months (May and June) deadline extension to the private firm implementing the public bicycle sharing system in the city.” He attributed the delay in the implementation of the first phase to issues related to the pandemic, particularly, the lockdown.Project to be developed over 4 phasesUnder the CSCL’s project, 5,000 bicycles will be provided in the city along with a network of 617 docking stations spread throughout the city giving last mile connectivity to the users. The size of the project will make it India’s largest and densest public bike sharing network.The project will be developed in four phases of 1,250 cycles and 155 docking stations each, with the availability of pedal-assisted e-bikes with charging facility.All bicycles will be GPS-enabled and will be monitored from a command-and-control centre with 24X7 helpline facility for users. The PBSS project is being implemented and operated by the concessionaire M/s Smart Bike Tech Private Limited, Hyderabad, for a period of 10 years on a public-private partnership (PPP) basis.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/covid-shadow-over-bike-sharing-project-in-chandigarh-101621794365629.html

A complaint was lodged in the medical college police station and search was underway to trace the patient. Dr Gyanendra Kumar, principal of LLRM Medical College, said that the patient Surendra,60 was brought to the Medical College from the district hospital on Saturday by a ward boy. Dr Gyanendra said that the patient was physically challenged. As per the ward boy, the patient had no caretaker, so his contact number was noted in his file, he said. Dr Gyanendra said at around 3 pm on Sunday, doctors and nurses on round in the Covid ward noticed that the patient was missing. The staff searched for him but in vain. Following this, the police were informed. “The patient is still missing and efforts are underway to locate him”, said SP (city) Vineet Bhatnagar. To recall, recently the medical college was recently in controversy for a missing Covid patient and received criticism from Allahabad high court. A Covid patient was admitted to the medical college Covid ward on April 21. The staff kept on updating his daughter about his health status till the morning of May 3 and in the evening she was told that no such patient was admitted to the ward. It was later discovered that the patient had the day after his admission.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/covid-patient-escapes-from-llrm-medical-college-101621794123707.html

(wear a face mask or risk your life).The 40-year-old prisoner, who is serving a ten-year jail term, along with his six-member team, runs the prison radio station started by Tinka Tinka Foundation in February this year.He was among the 21 inmates selected from three jails in the state to be trained as radio jockeys (RJs) by Dr Vartika Nanda, founder of the foundation and head of journalism department, Lady Shri Ram College, New Delhi.“Before being imprisoned, singing was among his hobbies. He couldn’t get a platform to do it before, but the jail radio has helped shaped his new identity,” an official statement read.Jail superintendent Lakhbir Singh Brar said this will help boost the morale of other inmates.The radio broadcast happens for an hour daily and issues like health, law and order, education are given priority, the jailer said.Established in 1872, Ambala Central Jail is among the historical jails of the country.

The company has only laid the main 12-km gas pipeline on Airport Road, some parts of Industrial Area Phases 7 and 8-B, and in Sectors 67 and 68.Even in April 2018, the Punjab government notified the policy for providing PNG connections to households, but the project got delayed.A senior officer of the company said, “The Government of India allotted the gas pipeline work in 2014 and we applied for digging permission in 2016. However, it was approved only last year. Currently, the company is focusing on commercial areas instead of domestic. The work has been stopped completely now and I believe it will take another three years for the project to complete.”He added that initially, the firm’s plan was to start the work in Phase 10 and 11, but the main pipeline was laid only in the housing societies of Sectors 67 and 68.When contacted, Mohali MC commissioner Kamal Kumar Garg said, “We have already given digging permission to the company. Why is it delaying the work now?”In Zirakpur, the company has laid a 3-km pipeline on VIP Road, but the permission to connect the main pipeline with households is still awaited.According to the project, the gas pipeline would be laid underground across the city leading to houses, just like water or electricity connections. Meters would be installed to measure the usage.The company has already covered most of the southern sectors in Chandigarh and will start the work in Sector 20 and Manimajra.PNG is around 20% cheaper than LPG supplied in cylinders, but the slow progress in laying underground pipes has been a major stumbling block and eluding customers from cheaper fuel.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/five-years-on-piped-gas-remains-a-pipe-dream-for-mohali-residents-101621793824626.html

23-05-2021||Noida||Noida: Residential bodies collaborate with hospitals for vaccinations||Noida residents’ welfare associations (RWAs) are collaborating with hospitals to help vaccinate people on their premises.With the district suffering a vaccine shortage and the vaccination drive having expanded to all adults, residents have been finding it tough to book their slots.“We are creating a database for the 18-44 age group from several societies in Greater Noida West. We already have almost 2,000 entries. Once we have the necessary information, we will share it with the Noida-based Fortis hospital Sector 62 and provide logistical support in organising camps in societies. We plan to start the camps by next week,” said Abhishek Kumar, president, Noida Extension Flat Owners Welfare Association.He said each resident will be charged ₹1050 for the shot and the camp will may be held next week.Residents will have to register on the Co-Win portal, submit it to their RWA that will then forward it to the hospital, said Kumar.Fortis did not respond to request for comment.In another plan, those who are at least 45 years old and in need of their second vaccine shot can opt for an on-spot registration at another Noida hospital. People will need to share the Co-Win registration number that they had got for the first shot.“The hospital will offer 50 doses on a first-come, first-serve basis. The usual private centre charges have to be paid and the beneficiaries have to carry their Aadhaar card with them,” said Rajiva Singh, president, Noida Federation of Apartment Owners Association.Societies are also working on registering and scheduling appointments for their staff.“We have volunteers who are now registering the staff of the society (Stellar Kings Court, sector 50) like domestic helps, drivers, housekeeping staff, etc. The staff has been asked to bring their IDs to help with this. Once we have more vaccine availability, we hope to get them all inoculated as soon as possible,” said Singh.“No administrative or health department permission is required for setting up vaccination camps. Hospitals and residential bodies can collaborate and organise drives,” said Gautam Budh Nagar’s chief medical officer, Deepak Ohri.“Health ministry guidelines are very clear for vaccination sites and if the requisite conditions are met, such camps by residential bodies are encouraged,” said district maigistrate Suhas LY.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/noida-residential-bodies-collaborate-with-hospitals-for-vaccinations-101621793284906.html
23-05-2021||Noida||Noida: Over 6K in rural areas registered for Covid-19 vaccination via common service centres||NOIDA: More than 6,000 people in the age group of 45 years and above in rural areas of Gautam Budh Nagar have registered themselves for Covid-19 vaccination with the help of different common service centres (CSCs) in the district in the past two days, officials said on Sunday. Recently, the state government decided to start registrations for vaccination at CSCs – also known as Jan Suvidha Kendras – in the districts across the state to help people in rural parts register on the Co-Win app for vaccination. According to the officials, the staff of CSCs in GB Nagar have started door-to-door visits to help the people register for the vaccination and their details are being shared with the district vaccination department to provide a vaccination centre in their vicinity. The process of registering for vaccination through CSCs started on Friday in the district.The GB Nagar district magistrate, Suhas LY, said that about 350 CSCs across the district will assist people in registering on the app and eventually, provide the facility of vaccination. “To increase the pace of vaccination in rural areas, we have already roped in the CSCs to help people in rural areas in registration on the Co-Win app. The service will be provided for free,” he said. The DM also said these centres have provided access to the internet to a variety of persons who may not be adept at using it. “Since the CSCs and their infrastructure have always been widely and effectively used in rural areas for various purposes, it (use of CSCs) will yield positive results for vaccination in rural areas too. The vaccination booths can be community health centres, primary health centres, schools, panchayat buildings or any public place – which have waiting, vaccination and observation rooms,” Suhas said. Meanwhile, Pankaj Sharma, in-charge of CSCs in GB Nagar, said that unlike testing, people in rural areas are very much enthusiastic about their registration for inoculation. “We’ve started the registration process on the basis of Aadhaar number since Friday and only in first two days, nearly 6,300 people have been registered through different CSCs in the district. We hope that by the end of this month, over 50,000 people in rural areas will be registered in the district,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/noida-over-6k-in-rural-areas-registered-for-covid-19-vaccination-via-common-service-centres-101621793283674.html
23-05-2021||Noida||Two held for black marketing of black fungus drug||Noida: Two men were nabbed by the Noida police on Saturday night from Sector 62 for allegedly black marketing Amphotericin B, a key medicine for treatment of black fungus infection.The suspects were identified as Anurag Kumar and Ankit Bhatt, residents of Delhi and Noida Sector 122, respectively. Kumar worked as a supervisor at a store of a pharmacy chain, police said.“Anurag was using the medicine available at the store as well as at other pharmacies of the chain to sell in the black market,” said Rajneesh Verma, assistant commissioner of police (ACP), zone 1.According to police officials, the suspects would contact relatives of patients in need of the drug through social media. Amphotericin B injections are in high demand as the cases of black fungus have gone up recently in the National Capital Region. “The market cost of the medicine starts from ₹2,000 to ₹3,500 and the suspects were selling the injection for as high as ₹16,000,” said the ACP.The officials said that the suspects would give one or two injections at normal prices but then increase the rates exponentially. The suspects would also target people in need of the drug near hospitals, the officials said, adding that the duo was trying to sell the medicine near a private hospital in Sector 62 when they were caught. Police recovered two injections of Amphotericin B from the suspects. “They have deleted most customer chats from their phones. But we were still able to retrieve a few. Many photos of the medicine were also found. We also found photos of Remdesivir from Bhatt’s phone. They may be black marketing other medicines as well. But that is under investigation,” said Verma.The suspects were booked at Sector 58 police station for cheating (Section 420 of the Indian Penal Code) and relevant sections of the Epidemic Act and the Disaster Management Act, police said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/two-held-for-black-marketing-of-black-fungus-drug-101621793284312.html
23-05-2021||Noida||After black fungus, cases of white fungus surface in Ghaziabad||Ghaziabad: As many as seven recovered Covid patients have been diagnosed with invasive aspergillosis, commonly known as white fungus, so far in Ghaziabad.According to the health department, while cases of white fungus are new, as many as 41 patients of mucormycosis or black fungus are being treated in the district as of now. However, at least three patients in the district have developed both the fungal infections, doctors said.The Harsh ENT Hospital in Raj Nagar has a total of 26 such patients – seven are patients of white fungus while the rest are black fungus patients. Doctors at the hospital said that white fungus in the patients was confirmed on the basis of histopathology reports.“Invasive aspergillosis or white fungus or is a post-Covid complication in which the infection goes to the lungs and causes pneumonia, while black fungus takes a different route and goes to the sinus, eyes and further to the brain. Three of our 26 patients have developed both the fungi. These infections develop in the post-Covid stage in patients, after 15-30 days (of testing negative),” said Dr BP Tyagi, senior ENT surgeon, who is treating the patients.Invasive aspergillosis is a rapidly progressive, often fatal infection that occurs in patients who are severely immunosuppressed. In this case, doctors said, most patients are those who have recovered from Covid who had low immunity because of steroidal drugs they were administered to fight the coronavirus disease. “These are mostly found in diabetic patients. While black fungus can be operated upon and taken out from the eyes and sinus, the white fungus has only one mode of treatment – through injections as – parts of the lungs cannot be taken out. While patients are administered Amphotericin injections, those suffering from white fungus are also given posaconazole injections and tablets, in addition. All seven patients suffering white fungus have mild to moderate symptoms,” Dr Tyagi added.Eleven of the mild to moderate symptoms of black fungus and getting treatment through the OPD and staying in home isolation, the doctor added.Doctors at Max Hospital, Vaishali said that they have 13 patients getting treatment for black fungus and two of these are likely to be discharged Monday. “Of these, a couple of patients have mild mucormycosis while others have sino-orbital-cerebral mucormycosis, where eyes and brain are involved. In a couple of cases, enucleation (removal of eye) was needed. There is another patient who would need mandibular (lower jaw) reconstruction, like the one needed in cancer patients. Two patients, who had mild symptoms are to be discharged after successful endoscopic treatment,” said Dr Sharad Joshi, principal consultant, department of pulmonology at Max Hospital, Vaishali.The district’s chief medical officer, Dr NK Gupta, said that the 41 patients in Ghaziabad getting treatment for these fungal infections include those from outside the district as well.“The drug posaconazole is effective in cases of white fungus, and is easily available. It has been seen that such infections have developed in Covid-recovered patients. We have directed hospitals to ensure proper hygiene and proper cleaning of equipment, including oxygen pipelines,” Dr Gupta said.“For cases of black fungus which require the drug amphotericin b, we have asked hospitals to refer patients to higher centres,” the CMO.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/after-black-fungus-cases-of-white-fungus-surface-in-ghaziabad-101621793223609.html

The local police called the couple to the police station and arranged for their marriage in the presence of only a handful of close family members, late on Saturday night. The parents of Kamlesh Verma, 23 and Kranti Verma, 22, got the shock of their lives when their relatives caused a ruckus during the marriage function of their wards in a village under Ramchandra Mission police station. The altercation took place after an argument between a couple of drunk relatives and escalated to a point that the ongoing marriage was stopped. “The groom and some of his friends returned home after the altercation while his father and the bride’s father reached the police station to lodge complaints against each other’s relatives,” said station house officer (SHO) of Ramkrishna Mission police station Sanjay Kumar, “After speaking to them, I realised that the marriage was being cancelled over an argument between some drunk relatives. I tried to help the couple and their family and offered to arrange the marriage if they agreed.” Realising their fault, the parents of the couple agreed to go ahead with the marriage. “We realised our mistake and agreed to get the children married. However, it was decided that the marriage would be held at some other place because returning to the village of the bride could lead to an altercation again,” said Ram Krishna Verma, father of the groom. The SHO then offered to arrange the marriage in a small temple on the police station premises. The family members asked the groom to reach the police station and a police team escorted the bride to the police station from her home along with some family members and the priest. “The police personnel at the police station helped to make some space in the temple where the priest performed the rituals at around 2 am. Around 20 people, including the family members and police personnel, participated in the marriage and gave their blessings to the newly-weds,” said the SHO. Senior police officials of the district, including the superintendent of police of Shahjahanpur, appreciated the quick thinking of the SHO.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/couples-marriage-called-off-after-altercation-cops-help-them-tie-the-knot-101621793163588.html
23-05-2021||Chandigarh||Lockdown likely to continue in Chandigarh||The Covid-19 lockdown will continue in Chandigarh, though a few relaxations are likely, according to a highly placed source in the administration.The final decision will be taken during the review meeting on Monday. The weekly lockdown, which has been extended twice since first being imposed on May 4, is to come to at end at 5am on Tuesday.“Both Punjab and Haryana have opted to extend the lockdown till this month end. Chandigarh will follow the same pattern,” said a senior UT official, who didn’t want to be named.The lockdown was imposed in the two neighbouring states on May 3. While Punjab extended it till May 31 last week, the Haryana government followed suit on Sunday. In the fresh orders, Haryana also introduced the odd-even formula for opening non-essential shops, on the lines of Punjab. In Chandigarh, too, traders have been protesting for the past one week against the total closure of non-essential shops, and a decision on some relaxations can be expected on Monday.“Both Punjab and Haryana have announced relaxations for non-essential shops. It is imperative that shops are allowed to open in Chandigarh too, as businesses, particularly small and medium ones, are facing a severe financial hardship. Traders cannot sustain themselves if their shops are directed to remain closed,” said Charanjiv Singh, president, Chandigarh Beopar Mandal.Last week, the Chandigarh deputy commissioner, on instructions of UT administrator VP Singh Badnore, had called traders for a meeting on the issue. “We were assured that our demand for opening of shops would be considered, at least on the odd-even basis,” said Singh.‘Inclination towards uniform rules across tricity’The number of positive cases in the city has seen a downward trend since the lockdown was imposed, and so has the positivity rate. “In the meeting to be held on Monday, the administration will consider all health indicators and needs of the businesses before taking a final decision on relaxations. There will be an inclination towards keeping uniformity regarding lockdown and accompanying restrictions across the tricity,” said the official.Even last week, the administration had considered allowing opening of non-essential shops on Punjab’s pattern, but finally decided against it in order to “capitalise on the plateauing of cases”.In Punjab, all shops in urban areas follow the odd-even rule while only essential item shops are allowed to open in malls. Restaurants are allowed to provide only home delivery, till 9pm. In villages, all shops are allowed to operate. According to the fresh orders in Haryana, standalone shops have been allowed to open during the day and others can open on alternate days on odd-even basis from 7am to 12pm . Malls are not allowed to open.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/lockdown-likely-to-continue-in-chandigarh-101621793104177.html

Following this input, a probe was initiated in the matter, the officials said.“It was found that there was a lapse on the part of the police post in-charge in implementation of the specified curfew guidelines. Non-essential businesses were staying open and this would not have been possible without his knowledge. The sub-inspector was suspended as he was negligent in the discharge of his duties,” said Harish Chander, deputy commissioner of police, zone 2.Chander said that a departmental inquiry in the matter is still underway. During the current lockdown which has been extended till May 31, only essential businesses are permitted to operate in Gautam Budh Nagar. In addition, Section 144 is implemented in the district which prohibits a gathering of more than five people.The police officials said that complaints have come from other market areas as well but there were more failure reports coming from the Gejha market.Earlier this month, five police personnel, including two sub-inspectors and three constables, from the Phase 2 police station had been suspended. There were allegations that they had detained a liquor store owner and a salesman from Gejha for illegally running the shop during the lockdown. The two were allegedly booked under lighter sections and allowed to go, following which a departmental inquiry was initiated and they were suspended. The DCP said that the matter is still under investigation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/noida-cop-suspended-for-failing-to-implement-lockdown-guidelines-101621792923631.html

23-05-2021||Noida||At UP Gate, Covid takes a toll on protesters strength||Ghaziabad: The farmers protesting against the Centre’s new farm laws at the UP Gate site said that nowadays they are fighting on “two fronts” -- pressing for their demands and keeping Covid-19 at bay. On Sunday, most of the tents and camps were devoid of protesters as their numbers, according to farmer leaders, have reduced to about 500-700 at the site. The hectic activity at the site, which was in prevalence till mid of April, has now taken a halt as the dais on Sunday saw presence of only a handful of protesters waiting for the proceedings to begin. The UP Gate protest site since November 28 last year had been witnessing participation by thousands of farmers from Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand and other states like Punjab and Haryana. “The gathering nowadays has declined as we have asked many of our protesters to go home. It is done keeping in mind the pandemic situation. However, we are still continuing to press for our demands. On the other hand, we are also handling the Covid situation at the UP Gate and none of our protesters has faced issues,” said Jagtar Singh Bajwa, farmer leader and member of UP Gate farmers’ committee. “So, we are fighting on two fronts, and we will not bow down,” he added. Suresh Chand, a farmer from Firozabad in UP, is among many of the first ones who came to the protest site in November. “The activities have halted for a brief period as many people have gone to villages for harvesting of sugarcane. But we are continuing our protest. We have about 10 langars which are operational nowadays. Covid is another obstacle which has come in our way,” Chand said. While few farmers continue to camp in tents put up on the Ghaziabad-Delhi carriageway of the Delhi-Meerut Expressway, others are camping below the UP Gate flyover and have also put up a screen where they mostly spend time watching television during evenings. A visit by an HT team to the site on Sunday revealed that most of the protesters were resting in camps while others were busy preparing food in langars. Saleem Chaudhary from Saharanpur has also been at the site since the beginning of the agitation. “The agitation is not to show our strength. The government knows it. They also know that we will continue to camp here despite spike in Covid-19 cases,” said Chaudhary, who is a member of Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) led by Naresh Tikait. Rajbir Singh Jadaun, state president of BKU, said that they do not allow outsiders to enter the site in the wake of pandemic. “Since the beginning of the agitation, we have a number of poor people coming in to have food at our langars. Despite the pandemic, we have not stopped serving them food. But we have made arrangement for them on two sides of the site where they come in the evening every day in hundreds,” Jadaun said. “To tackle Covid, we restricted the number of farmers at the site and our leaders have also cancelled their rallies. The Samyukta Kisan Morcha has written to the Prime Minister to resume talks and we are waiting for reply,” he said. To avoid any infection, the farmer leaders said that they received cooperation from the district authorities to keep the site infection-free. “But we have also roped in our own fogging machine, and we are ensuring that the site remains clean. Now, we demand that our farmers should get vaccine at the earliest,” Jadaun added. The Farmer leaders said that they are also helping out patients and their families in their respective villages. At Bazpur in Uttarakhand, they have set up “oxygen langar” to help patients get oxygen, while others have started a campaign to make “death register” of fatalities which have taken place in villages. “We have asked our members to get the registers prepared in villages where number of deaths seems more during the past two months. These registers will be sent to the government, and we will try to raise issue if there is mismatch with government figures. The exercise is taking place in Muzaffarnagar, and we will do it in other districts as well,” said Dharmendra Malik, state spokesperson of BKU. The BKU has its headquarters at Sisauli in Muzaffarnagar. When asked, Ghaziabad chief medical officer Dr NK Gupta said, “If the farmers send us a demand, we can arrange for a vaccination camp, and we can also help them get vaccine at the centre near the UP Gate.” Gyanendra Singh, superintendent of police (city 2), said that the gathering has reduced at the UP Gate since the second wave of Covid-19. “We are keeping our communication open with the farmers at the site and our regular police and PAC deployment is continuing. The farmers are continuing their agitation in a peaceful manner,” Singh said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/at-up-gate-covid-takes-a-toll-on-protesters-strength-101621792803613.html
23-05-2021||Other||Vaccinators face resistance in some Uttar Pradesh villages||Covid-19 vaccinators are facing resistance from villagers in some districts of Uttar Pradesh, so much so that around 200 residents jumped into the Saryu river in Barabanki district’s Sisaunda village as health workers insisted that they take the jab on Saturday.Several other villagers sat on the river’s embankment, threatening to jump deep into water if the vaccinators did not leave the village.After several hours of persuasion, the villagers came out of the water but merely 14 agreed to take the vaccine that day, an official said on Sunday.Ram Nagar subdivisional magistrate (SDM) Rajiv Kumar Shukla said the vaccinators will visit Sisaunda, which has a population of 1700, again on Monday to inoculate the remaining beneficiaries.In a separate incident, residents of Auraiya district’s Kadalpur village did not permit health workers to enter their village.When accredited social health activists (Ashas) appealed to the villagers to take the vaccine, the villagers emerged with sticks, threatening to attack the vaccinators. As the villagers refused to take the vaccine, the health workers left the village.Villager also refused to take the vaccine at Khandi in Lalitpur district. Although health workers visited each household urging people to visit the vaccination camp, the villagers did not turn up. Later, the health workers left the village.In Hamirpur district’s Bhatpura village, too, villagers refused to take the Covid vaccine. There, some of the residents were not willing to give their samples for tests either after a team of health workers reached the village on receiving reports about suspected Covid-19 cases. A group of villagers surrounded the health workers, threatening them with dire consequences if they did not leave.Taking note of resistance to the Covid vaccine in the rural areas, the state health and family welfare department has directed the respective districts’ administration to launch an awareness campaign with the assistance of village surveillance committees and newly elected gram panchayat members to motivate the villagers to take the jabs .Additional chief secretary (health and family welfare) Amit Mohan Prasad said the villagers should not believe in misleading publicity about the vaccine.“The vaccine is safe, has no side-effect. It will protect them from Covid infection. Even after taking the vaccine, people should follow the Covid protocol. They should take both doses. The state government has launched statewide test, trace and treat drive in the rural areas to intensify the fight against the second wave of Covid-19,” he said.A state government official said the district administration officials were directed to take strict action against the “anti-social elements” who were spreading rumours against the vaccine. As for the incident at Barabanki’s Sisaunda village, a team led by Ram Nagar sub divisional magistrate (SDM) Rajiv Kumar Shukla visited the spot. The district administration officials and health department team urged the villagers to come out of the river, assuring them that the vaccine would have no side-effects and it would protect them from Covid -19. As a result, 14 villagers relented and agreed to take the vaccine that day.To protect the rural population from Covid-19, the district administration had launched a vaccination drive in villages under a statewide programme for beneficiaries above 45 years of age, Shukla said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/vaccinators-face-resistance-in-some-uttar-pradesh-villages-101621792143566.html
23-05-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai: Fake call centres fleecing US citizens busted at Malad||Bangur Nagar police busted a fake call centre in Malad (West) and arrested eight people for selling sex enhancement supplements to American nationals on Saturday. Earlier on April 29, Malad and Bangur Nagar police had raided three such call centres for similar offences and arrested 10 people. Police said they had received information about few fake call centres, which duped foreign nationals, in their jurisdiction, following which a raid was carried on under the supervision of Vishal Thakur, deputy commissioner of police (zone 11). A police team raided the premises at Vijay Industrial Estate at Chincholi Bunder, Malad and found eight people working there. Upon investigation, the police found out the call centre was operating using a VOIP (Voice Over Internet Protocol) software to make calls to American citizens and sell sex enhancement supplements. Police officers seized the computers and arrested the owner and manager of the outlet along with the eight employees. Thakur said the owners of the call centre used to steal data and phone numbers of American nationals from the dark web, called them with the help of VOIP and lured them into buying sex enhancement supplements. The employees then used to ask the customers to transfer the amount online through money transfer apps. Police also arrested owners of another fake call centre in Bangur Nagar for allegedly selling Google Play apps at a lesser price. The police had detained the employees and released them after giving a notice to be present in court. “We have arrested the owners of the fake call centres and are now looking out for more such establishments which were run by the accused,” said Thakur.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-fake-call-centres-fleecing-us-citizens-busted-at-malad-101621791963567.html
23-05-2021||Mumbai||Barge P305 tragedy: Four more bodies recovered; toll touches 70||The Indian Navy and Indian Coast Guard (ICG) found four more bodies of crew members of barge Papaa305 (P305), which capsized in the Arabian Sea hours after cyclone Tauktae hit the Mumbai coast on May 17, on the seventh day of search and rescue (SAR) operation. The toll of the mishap has now touched 70. Meanwhile the wreck of barge P305 was located on the sea bed. Barge P305, which was deployed at an unmanned platform in Heera oil fields, one of the largest ONGC rigs in the sea, sank about 40 nautical miles west off Mumbai. As Cyclone Tauktae hit the Mumbai coast, the barge got de-anchored on the night of May 16, and hit a platform while drifting in the rough sea. It sank around 7pm on May 17 in choppy seas amid rough weather, which made search and rescue one of the most challenging operations undertaken by the Navy in four decades. Afcons Infrastructure, which leads the consortium that chartered the barge and hired its crew, said 261 members on board and Indian Navy and ICG rescued 186 members and found 70 bodies. A tugboat Varaprada carrying 13 crew members also capsized the same day. Two of its members were rescued by the Navy, while 11 are still missing. The agencies claimed on Sunday they found 17 more bodies at different beaches in Raigad district, Palghar and Valsad at Gujarat. Four of them were found to be of the P305 crew. Officials said seven bodies were recovered from Valsad, one from Daman at Gujarat, one from Arnala beach in Palghar district and eight bodies were found at Alibag, Murud, Nagaon and Sasawne in Raigad district, Maharashtra. A police team from Yellow Gate police station, along with those rescued from P305 and Varaprada, went to Valsad to establish the identities. “We are co-ordinating with the local authorities in Raigad, Daman and Valsad to check if the bodies are of any crew members of the cyclone-hit barges or other fishing boats. The team has also gone with rescued crew members for identifications,” said Suhas Hemade, senior inspector, Yellow Gate police station. Some of the bodies are in decomposed condition and bloated so DNA tests are being conducted to ascertain the identity, said an officer from the Yellow Gate police station. “Barge P305 was located on the seabed after systematic search by INS Maker employing advance side scan sonar. The diving started in the morning and managed to pinpoint the sunken wreck of P305 by specialised teams on board INS Maker and no bodies have been found,” said a Navy officer. INS Maker is proceeding to locate the wreck of tug Varaprada and diving operation will be conducted on Monday, added Navy officials. The search and rescue operation by naval and coast guard ships and helicopters will continue in the area to locate the remaining crew of the sunken vessels, said the officer. So far, 45 bodies have been identified in JJ hospital and 44 handed over to their respective families. Several other recovered bodies are in JJ hospital, but the police are securing DNA samples to ascertain their identity for the families, said a police officer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/barge-p305-tragedy-four-more-bodies-recovered-toll-touches-70-101621791903554.html
23-05-2021||Mumbai||Barge P305 tragedy: Families of deceased identify bodies||The Prajapati family was devastated after the body of their 28-year-old son, who worked as a welder on the ill-fated barge P305, which sank on May 17, due to Cyclone Tauktae, was identified at Sir JJ Hospital on Saturday. The deceased Krishna Kumar Prajapati’s body was identified by his cousin Anil, 33, who was also on the same barge but had returned to land on February 28. “It was his bad luck. My cousin Anup, 22, who also worked as a helper on the same barge, was brought to land 10 days before the cyclone, as his parents were unwell. Krishna also wanted to return. He had not seen his one-year-old son for eight months. However, he did not get leave,” said Anil. “It was my destiny that my passport expired in March and I had to return in February to renew it. During the lockdown, I managed to earn more money selling vegetables, hence I did not return to the barge, where I made a mere ₹20,000,” said Anil. “Krishna had sent a message on May 16, ‘cyclone ki wajah se barge full out hai (due to the cyclone, the barge has moved away from the rig). After that, there was no interaction with him. He was the only son and earning member of the family. His father is a farmer in Prayagraj, Uttar Pradesh and makes ₹600 per day after 12 hours of duty. He gets ₹150 to ₹200 extra after working overtime for three to four hours,” added Anil.Anil had visited the hospital on Thursday and Friday too, in search for his cousin, however, Krishna’s body arrived on Saturday.There are several others like Anil who wait the entire day at JJ Hospital to get clues about their missing family members. Anil Yadav came from Surat on Friday to search for his 32-year-old brother-in-law Santosh Yadav who worked as an electrician on barge P305. Yadav, along with his two relatives have been visiting the hospital every day in the morning and wait till the night. “There is no update till now,” said Yadav. Santosh, a native of Jaunpur, Uttar Pradesh, has three children- two sons and a daughter, aged between 11 to 6 years.Similarly, family members of Ranalucky Kumar, 28, who was a technician on the barge, have also been making regular visits at the hospital since Thursday, to enquire about him. Kumar had jumped in the sea, during the cyclone, when the barge was about to sink. “He has not been found yet,” said his cousin Rana Singh, who was on another barge Trinity Nissi. Singh works as a technician and was also deployed in the same area at the high sea. However, his barge, carrying around 250 people, returned due to the cyclone and anchored near Mumbai harbour. “Few of them were released on May 19 from Trinity Nissi barge after we fought with the employer that we wanted to go Mumbai to search our family members. Others had to return to work soon after the impact of the cyclone ended,” added Singh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/barge-p305-tragedy-families-of-deceased-identify-bodies-101621791843610.html
23-05-2021||Patna||Vaccination for 18-44 years age group resumes after a day’s interruption||Patna resumed regular vaccination against coronavirus for the 18-44 years age group on Sunday, after forced interruption on Saturday, when it ran out of supplies. On paper, however, vaccination did not stop in the state capital even on Saturday. The State Health Society, Bihar (SHSB), which meticulously plans vaccination session sites depending on the availability of vaccines in the state, did well to operate six special camps, where it inoculated 822 people — a symbolic number though against a target population of 5.39 crore in the 18-44 years category in the state. The special camps were held at different offices, including the Raj Bhawan, Delhivery, Chanakya Law University, Indian Oil, Judges Court City and the NTPC-Barh on Saturday. All the 57 regular vaccination session sites, including the 46 rural and urban primary health centres in Patna, were shut in absence of vaccines, said an official who did not wish to be named. Those trying to pre-book vaccination slots, a prerequisite for the 18-44 years population, had a harrowing time doing it on the CoWIN portal. There were some districts left with less than 1,000 doses of vaccine, forcing them to close many vaccination session sites. “We manage our session sites as per availability of vaccines. We have to do firefighting every day,” said Manoj Kumar, executive director, State Health Society, Bihar. Patna civil surgeon Dr Vibha Kumari Singh also came out in defence of the government. “We cannot entirely close vaccination in the district. So, we reduce the number of vaccination session sites to keep the vaccinations low in case of shortage of vaccines. We have no control over it (supplies),” said Dr Singh. The state received 4.89 lakh doses of vaccine for the 18-44 years age group on Saturday. Out of this, Patna received around 50,000 doses of vaccines on Saturday evening and was able to revive its 57 session sites for vaccination on Sunday. After being able to vaccinate 47,207 people on Saturday, the state inoculated 1,24,175 on Sunday against its initial target to vaccinate 2.50 lakh people per day against 7.50 crore people to be vaccinated in the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/vaccination-for-18-44-years-age-group-resumes-after-a-day-s-interruption-101621791063525.html

23-05-2021||Patna||Bihar: MBBS interns at Covid hospital threaten to go on strike over hike in stipend||Around 850 MBBS interns in Bihar may strike work from next week if their demands over increase in stipend, providing insurance cover and counting their period of Covid-19 duty as part of the year-long internship programme were not met. “We will try and meet the additional chief secretary (health), Pratyaya Amrit, tomorrow (Monday). Seeing his response, we will decide the date of our strike if the government doesn’t heed our demands,” said Gautam Kumar, a 2016-batch medico at the Nalanda Medical College Hospital (NMCH). The undergraduate students of the NMCH have blown the bugle of protest by staging a demonstration on college campus Saturday and mobilised support among batchmates of six other medical colleges to get their message across to the state government. Ripples of protest were evident at the Sri Krishna Medical College Hospital in Muzaffarpur and the Darbhanga Medical College Hospital at Laheriasarai in Darbhanga on Saturday. MBBS final year students of other state-run medical colleges, including the Patna Medical College Hospital, Anugrah Narayan Magadh Medical College Hospital, Gaya, Vardhaman Institute of Medical Science, Pawapuri (Nalanda) and Government Medical College, Bettiah, have also expressed solidarity with the NMCH students, leading the protest, claimed Gautam. The NMCH has been declared a 500-bed dedicated Covid-19 hospital along with the Indira Gandhi Institute of Medical Science (IGIMS), an autonomous institute of the state government on the pattern of AIIMS, both in Patna. The students are demanding parity in internship. They claim MBBS interns at the IGIMS get more monthly stipend than any of the other eight state government-run medical institutions. “The enhancement of monthly stipend of IGIMS interns by ₹2,800 to ₹26,300 has been approved in principle. Add to it the ₹1,000 incentive per 8-hour shift for Covid-19 duty, approved on May 21. With an average of eight days of Covid-19 duty in a month, their consolidated stipend would go up to ₹34,000 (approx.), while we will get a pittance of ₹15,000 monthly, with no incentive for Covid duty,” said Gautam. His batchmate Anuj Kumar said the government had not raised their stipend since 2017 when it was last revised from ₹12,000 to ₹15,000. “The stipend of junior doctors, pursuing post-graduation (PG), was increased last year, but that of MBBS interns has not been increased since 2016, though the government is committed to increasing it every three years,” said Anuj. The students are also demanding that their period of Covid duty be counted as part of the one-year MBBS internship programme so that they are eligible to appear in the national eligibility-cum-entrance test (NEET) for postgraduate courses. “We need to complete 365 days of internship before we can appear for the NEET entrance test for the PG programme. MBBS final year medicos at Patna’s IGIMS and in other states have completed their exam and joined as interns, but we haven’t. If the government delays our exams, our internship period will be affected, which will make us ineligible to appear in the NEET entrance test next year. So, our Covid duty should be counted as an internship,” added Anuj. The students mock at the Bihar government’s decision to stop the MBBS final year examination mid-way, after it began on April 17, in light of the spike in Covid-19 cases in the state. “First, the state government defers our exams for the safety of students from the pandemic and a few days later it drafts us for duty in Covid-19 wards,” said Gautam. The medicos are also demanding insurance cover for doing Covid-19 duty, given the risk involved. Bihar has already lost around 130 doctors during the pandemic. Bihar had 44,907 active cases of coronavirus on Saturday, with 6,85,574 cumulative cases and 4,442 deaths. Patna, with 725 new cases out of the 4,375 reported in the state on Saturday, led the district tally with 1,41,380 total cases and 1,135 deaths so far.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/biharmbbs-interns-at-covid-hospital-threaten-to-go-on-strike-over-hike-in-stipend-101621789743451.html

This exam was earlier postponed due to the surge in Covid cases. It is now likely that the education minister is considering the no-exam option for the 1.3 million students who were to appear for the exam this year. The Maharashtra State Board of Secondary and Higher Secondary Education (MSBSHSE) had cancelled the Class 10, Secondary School Certificate (SSC) examination, giving relief to 1.6 million students across Maharashtra. However, no decision has been taken on the Class 12 students yet.On Sunday, during a national-level online meeting with Union education minister Ramesh Pokhriyal, regarding the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE), Class 12 examination, Gaikwad emphasised that the Central Government should actively examine the “no examination” option for Class 12 CBSE students. She said that keeping in mind the ongoing pandemic situation and the projection that children are vulnerable to new strains of coronavirus, this option should be examined. “Health and mental well-being of children, their families must be our priority. Students and parents have been sharing their concerns regarding sitting for exams amid the pandemic,” said Gaikwad.During a press interaction on Sunday, Gaikwad further added that since most professional courses hold entrance exams for admissions, many experts are of the view that it is possible to evaluate the performance of a Class 12 student based on a retroactive assessment model.“Students have been studying in Class 12 for over 14 months. Personally, I believe that we should remove the uncertainty regarding exams and take a decision that is in the student’s interest. Our focus should now be on evolving a uniform assessment policy, vaccination of all teachers and eligible students, and safe resumption of schools and colleges in the next academic year,” said Gaikwad.Sampada Waghmare, a student of Class 12, said that it will be a welcome decision if the examinations are cancelled. “Students have been under immense stress due to the uncertainty around the Class 12 exams. If the decision to cancel the exam is taken it will be a relief. The final decision should be taken soon without any delay,” said Waghmare.Education expert and former chairman of the state education board, Vasant Kalpande, said that offline examinations should be taken for Class 12 students.“We understand that this is an unprecedented situation. And so the board has to postpone the examination. There will come a time when cases will reduce. During that time, the offline examination should be taken. This evaluation is important for students and their careers,” Kalpande said.He further added that students this year faced a big challenge. “Students have studied online and various internal assessments have been taken through assignments and project work. All these are a part of the complete assessment. At many online examinations, we have seen that students used unfair means and passed. In order to keep the assessment fair and unbiased in the state, offline examinations are the only solution,” said Kalpande.Gaikwad said that a meeting with Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray will be held in the next few days.“A decision about the Class 12 examinations will be taken soon. We are arranging a meeting with chief minister Uddhav Thackeray and the decision will be taken,” said Gaikwad.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/noexam-option-for-hsc-students-on-the-table-for-state-education-minister-101621782423177.html

In spite of this, the dumping made near Deccan to construct the pillars and the huge filling at Mula Mutha confluence behind CID office has not been removed. The letter pointed out that a visit and inspection of the Mutha river was conducted in the first week of January and it was noted that the aforementioned dumplings were not removed. “On the contrary, in the Deccan area an additional debris filling of more than two meters height on the riverbed was noticed. We had informed MahaMetro and requested to direct the concerned to immediately remove the new as well as the old dumping,” the letter said. “In spite of all this, till date, the dumping/platforms made on the riverbed have not been removed and this office is receiving complaints from NGOs. If the debris isn’t removed from the riverbed, it can create impediment in the flood carrying section of the river leading to floods. Therefore, you are requested again that the debris/platform should be removed immediately before the rainy season. If any case is filed before the National Green Tribunal (NGT), in case of flood situation in the rainy season due to the debris, the Metro Corporation shall be held entirely responsible,” Chopade warned MahaMetro. Hemant Sonwane, general manager of MahaMetro said, “We build cofferdam, it is a temporary structure designed to keep water or soil out of the excavation in which a bridge pier or other structure is built. We built it at Sangam bridge, Bundgarden area. We have started removing it and around 80 per cent work has been done. The remaining will be removed soon. In the Deccan area, we also put soil for movement of trucks in the riverbed. It will be removed before monsoon.

The civic body is now receiving many applications from other retirement homes for the Vaccination on Wheels Covid-19 service. Retirement homes like Pitashree in Kondhwa, Matoshree near Rajaram Bridge and Janaseva Foundation in Khadakwasla have requested for the service. On Saturday, PMC additional municipal commissioner Rubal Agarwal tweeted: “For decades *Niwara, is the home for senior citizens* in the heart of Pune city - 180 senior citizens were vaccinated at their doorstep through PMC’s initiative Vaccination on wheels”. Agarwal said, “We started this initiative from Niwara and we plan to extend it to others based on the availability of the vaccines.” As of Saturday, Pune city had vaccinated 34% or 1,29,902 of its senior-citizen population with the second dose, while 72%, or 2,74,601 have got the first dose. Ravindra Marathe, a trustee at Niwara, said, “We are grateful to the PMC that they could ease the vaccination process for our members. We have 120 residents and we had to take 20 each day using a bus to the centre. “However, after that, it was very difficult for us to get the second dose and so we requested the PMC to arrange for a special provision. Over 180 of our residents and staff got the second dose. We have 120 senior citizens and 60 employees,” he added. Marathe added that not all could get the vaccine due to the requirement of the Aadhar card. He said, “Usually when these senior citizens come to us they do not have any identity cards so we prepare an Aadhaar card based on the address of our home. However, since the past one year, due to the pandemic, we avoided going out. In the past one year six more residents joined the home, but they could not get their Aadhaar cards. Due to this they have not been vaccinated.” Vaccine on wheels To formally request the service, forward an application to the PMC civic body at vaccination.campus@gmail.com.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/vaccine-on-wheels-requests-flow-in-from-retirement-homes-101621778763079.html

23-05-2021||Bangalore||Bengaluru gets help to breathe better: Passing on Oxygen amid second wave of Covid||When a city is gasping for breath, what do you do? Collect oxygen cylinders! That’s exactly what a group of Bangaloreans have started doing. “The situation in the city is very grim. In the second wave of Covid, it has been an uphill task to arrange for medicines, oxygen cylinders and concentrators. Many people have bought cylinders and kept it at home, taking them out of circulation for others. With Bengaluru gasping for air, we decided to start the campaign to tell people to donate oxygen cylinders for others in need,” says Freeda Lazar, one of the minds behind Pass The Oxygen initiative, which aims to make oxygen accessible and affordable. Some Bangaloreans are trying to provide respite to people who are in need of sourcing oxygen by creating a database of acquired cylinders and circulating them after verification. “There are multiple ways people can contribute towards the initiative. Firstly, they can donate the cylinder to us, and we will refill it and pass it on. Or they can just loan it to us for a specific time period and we’ll make sure it reaches back to them. If contributors don’t have cylinders, they can also simply make a donation which we can use to buy more oxygen cylinders,” says Arshiya Sayed, a volunteer with CoV-aid Bengaluru, a citizen volunteer group.Sayed, with a group of 11 other volunteers from CoV-aid Bengaluru, manages the groundwork with help of 10 autorickshaw drivers, who are helping refill and transport the essentials to those in need. “We understood early on that transportation was a problem for those cases where the entire families are down with coronavirus. So the auto drivers helped us out. Our work turns immensely meaningful when we are able to help out people in need. We recently provided an oxygen concentrator to a 7-year-old in Bengaluru, after transporting it across the city, and to see him recover was amazing,” recalls Sayed. The team is renaming the cylinders after the person they choose. “We are grateful for the life-saving step people are choosing to take, and in return we are renaming the cylinder after the person that means the world to them. We will always refer to a cylinder by that name, as a way to remember them every time a particular cylinder goes around helping save lives,” adds Lazar. And one such contributor is Mayura P Kadur, whose donated cylinder is named Prabhakar, in memory of her father who passed away in 2017. She shares, “I saw the initiative on a friend’s Instagram story, and thought of the cylinder we had in storage from my dad’s clinic. I spoke to my mother about the initiative and she said that we should give it away so that they can help someone in need in the present times, as opposed to just keeping it for ourselves. I hope more people come forward to donate cylinders.” Author tweets @bhagat_mallikaFollow more stories on Facebook and Twitter||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/bengaluru-gets-help-to-breathe-better-passing-on-oxygen-amid-second-wave-of-covid-101621772286242.html

The excel sheet created by Miranda students has information on oxygen providers, beds, medicines, blood plasma, tiffin services, ambulance services, etc, available in Delhi-NCR. It has been circulated in various WhatsApp groups, and helped numerous people find essentials in the time of crisis. Gauri Kumar, another final year Philosophy (Hons) student, works as the medical support coordinator for this team. She shares, “People who we were able to help, often call us offering essentials like oxygen cylinders, which enables us to help more people. We also connect those in need to the plasma donors. It’s crucial to understand that directing people to credible sources is the need of the hour.” Looking at future, setting up Oxygen plant nowThe plight of denizens searching frantically for oxygen cylinders or concentrators, during the second wave of Covid, has inspired students of Shri Ram College of Commerce (SRCC) to raise funds for Covid relief. Jayani Shah, a second year student of BA Economics (Hons), says, “We’ve joined hands with an NGO, Doctors For You, which is working for Covid relief in Delhi, to set up an oxygen plant. This plant will produce 150 litres of oxygen per minute, which would be able to save around 20 to 30 lives at a time!” The plant will be set up at the Commonwealth Games Village Covid Healthcare Facility, which has been converted into a 500 bed, free of cost centre. “Many are still searching for oxygen, and we have realised that the Capital needs a long-term sustainable solution for such a crisis. We’ve a group of over 500 students from the college, who are trying to raise ₹35 lakhs for this project. Also, volunteering for this initiative doesn’t require the students to step out amid the pandemic, and thus ensures their safety as well,” says Arushi Mahajan, a second year B Com (Hons) student.Unused medicines for some, useful for some othersBurning the midnight oil are more that 150 students of St. Stephen’s College, who are volunteering for different endeavours towards Covid relief. “We’ve partnered with a mother-daughter duo — Supriya Malik and Sahria — who run Covid Medicine Recycle, an initiative that collects unused medicines and provides it to others in need. While Supriya and Sahria handle the pick up and drop-off of the medicines, we are creating a database of donors and beneficiaries for them,” informs Anushca Thomas, a second year History (Hons) student. Alongside medicines, Stephanians are also helping put together important resources. Susan Maria Mathew, a second year student of the college, says, “We’re working on clearing doubts of people who wish to help kids who have lost both the parents to Covid. We’re also helping the non teaching staff on premises, by providing them information on vaccination. And we are even circulating a fundraiser among our alumni, to help those who are in need. This is the least we can do to help others.” Author tweets @bhagat_mallikaFollow more stories on Facebook and Twitter||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/du-amps-up-fight-against-covid-college-students-huddle-to-help-the-masses-101621770910900.html
23-05-2021||Bangalore||2 more arrested for black marketing of oxygen cylinders in Bengaluru||Two more persons in Bengaluru were arrested on Sunday for allegedly trying to sell oxygen cylinders in the black market at a time when the shortage of the life-saving gas to treat severe Covid-19 cases remains a major concern, said a senior police officer.“2 accused arrested by CCB (city crime branch) in Sheshadripuram & Byatarayanpura involved in black marketing of oxygen cylinders. 5 cylinders seized..Plz share info on any such activities,” Sandeep Patil, joint commissioner (Crime) said in a post on Twitter.Despite the number of daily Covid-19 infections witnessing a decline in Bengaluru, the demand for oxygenated beds remains high with people struggling to find beds. Karnataka requires at least 1200 MT (metric tonne) of oxygen to cater to its ailing population and is dependent on the centre to fulfil this requirement.However, according to the data shared by Munish Moudgil, the officer in charge of Oxygen supplies in Karnataka, all 30 districts including Bengaluru saw a consumption of 834.84 MT (731.29 kilo litres) of oxygen on May 19 which increased to 858.02 MT (751.59 kilo litre) on May 20.Karnataka is among the seven states that cumulatively account for 66.88 % of India's total active cases and it reported 31,183 fresh cases and 451 deaths on Saturday. The explosion of the second wave of the pandemic has created a shortage of oxygen cylinders, oxygenated and ICU beds apart from life saving medicines such as Remdesivir. The state government has now put in place a SMS-based Remdesivir allocation and information system, aimed at curbing its black marketing and misuse.According to the South Western Railway authorities, the ninth oxygen express reached Bengaluru on Sunday morning carrying six cryogenic containers of liquid medical oxygen measuring 20 MT each. The Union railways minister said the railways had supplied around 1,000 MT of oxygen to the state so far.“#OxygenExpress continues to provide relief to Covid-19 patients, delivered more than 15,000 MT of medical oxygen across Flag of India. Around 1,000 MT oxygen relief supplied to Karnataka to continue helping the people in the State,” Piyush Goyal tweeted on Sunday.A statement by South Western Railway authorities said Karnataka has received 1062.14 tonnes of liquid medical oxygen by rail. “Indian Railways has so far run 224 Oxygen Expresses and transported nearly 14,500 tonnes of liquid medical oxygen in 884 tankers to all over the country to assist state governments in their fight against Covid -19,” it said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/2-more-arrested-for-black-marketing-of-oxygen-cylinders-in-bengaluru-101621769219937.html
23-05-2021||Pune||Your Space: Make vacation fun for kids during Covid||The Covid lockdowns confining school kids to home and online study may have had an impact on their educational levels and learning abilities. Now, spending summer school holidays cooped up at home with their parents, who maybe working professionals, will add to the already unprecedented situation. What steps should schools and authorities take to keep kids busy in a productive way? Spend more time with kidsEveryone was at home throughout the academic year 2020-21 busy with online lectures. Teachers tried well to keep every student attentive in class and conducted exams. Now, kids are not interested in online studies. They want something new. Parents are busy with jobs, online meetings and task completion radar. So, some school students are getting bored or getting angry as they pass their time during the day. My son is also getting irritated sitting at home. I tried to find what may be the solution on this? For that I have to at least think like a kid and what the child finds interesting. So, I tried including a new habit for a few minutes every day. Enjoyed every childish emotion like sprinkling water on his face and allowing him to do so, enjoying his favourite indoor games, and allowing him to enjoy his time his way. I found it refreshing to become a child myself with my kid. The stress just vanishes. One more luck was waiting there to enjoy summer vacations at home. Online summer camp offered by his school is also an activity which is fun. Nice summer camp was planned by his teachers and the principal under the guidance of management. They offered four modules of 30 minutes each. These were different types of music play, different forms of dances, different enjoyable sports activities, ball bottle games, small projects which should be completed in just 30 minutes like making biscuit sandwiches, story creations on pictures, interesting movie show, and drawing but in a new way. There were also basic scientific concepts through small practical things like static energy with comb, composting wet waste material at home, planting seeds and growing. Many more interesting activities were taken and planned by the team of teachers to make time memorable and keep students busy with different emotions like tasks to complete to gain certificates. There were also winners in these activities. Kids spoke enthusiastically on different tasks. Initially they refused to follow the schedule for online activities, but later enjoyed them. Children have gone through a plethora of emotions during the pandemic. Kids are observing their parents in all roles like friend, teacher, brother, sister, aunt, uncle. We, as parents, should try every role to make our kids happy. It’s difficult, but if we decide we can do anything. Everything is possible for us. So, let us start new roles every day or just for a few hours in a day, as we in our childhood enjoyed every relation, everything like happiness, sorrow, fighting, arguing and loving. We used to meet everyone, neighbours and relatives. Now it’s not possible, not for our children for the last one year. So, organise video calls with neighbours, relatives to keep the spirit up and stay in touch.Vidya PatilSchools should hold fun activitiesAs we all know that due to Covid students are confined to online studies which end up resulting in a lot of screen time for them. This may have a good as well as bad impact on them. Instead of conducting classes online, full-time schools can conduct fun activities like watering plants, origami, dance, making best out of waste, vermi compost, fireless cooking and much more with the help of parents. All of such activities will help boost their physical activity which was restricted due to online classes. Schools can also conduct yoga and meditation which will help in boosting their mental health.Deepali SatputeDraw a daily schedule for childThis lockdown and pandemic has been a great challenge to everyone, from students to teachers to parents. In these times, one should not forget that the children need some new activity every now and then. So, keeping them occupied is one of the most important things. Earlier every summer holiday, there was a trip mandatory for the family. If not a trip, then at least we would visit grandparents and extended families. Now even that cannot be done. During this pandemic time, it is important to form a proper schedule for the child. And keep him occupied. For example, we have made it compulsory that the morning tea and coffee will be made by my 10-year-old son. He is also assigned the responsibility of cleaning his own room. Such activities give children a sense of responsibility and also a target to achieve in a day. With this, there is also a physical activity that the child does in the evening like skipping. This keeps him occupied throughout the day.Sandeep ThiteEngage child in activities There are various activities that schools can arrange through online classes. I encourage my child to get involved in gardening and try new recipes at home as she likes it. I think staying indoors during summer vacation does impact the child a lot as this is the only time when they are not bombarded with studies like the whole year. I suggest every parent should decide what their child likes and engage them in it. We have to introduce variety in the activities. But in case a parent is not able to give their whole time to the child because of work, they must plan ahead as it can definitely work. My wife and I are both working professionals, so I totally understand how difficult it is to keep a child busy. Both my kids have their share of work. We also give them group activities so that they learn to share and work together. I love to see my children do, “Do it yourself” projects. They have made so many amasing things under DIY. This has given them a sense of accomplishment and pride. Shashank KimbhauneGrandparents play vital role in upbringing kidsI don’t think all the role of keeping children busy in productive ways can be taken up by schools and authorities. It all eventually falls on the parents to keep the child busy. In engaging the child, grandparents can play a very active role. Since the senior citizens at our homes are a treasure who know so many easy and simple activities, they can certainly help. My younger daughter has learned so many skills from her grandmother about gardening. She now spends most of her time with plants. She has grown coriander, spinach and even a rose plant in our limited space. When the rose first bloomed the smile on the face of my daughter was priceless. Such activities that can help children be closer to nature can help them handle the stress of being at home 24/7. My mother-in-law has also taught my young daughter other crafts that she finds very occupying. Parents should focus on such small activities that the child may like and learn from.Asmita Kulkarni||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/your-space-make-vacation-fun-for-kids-during-covid-101621767365088.html

23-05-2021||Bangalore||Karnataka implements 'tech-driven' system for Remdesivir allocation, information to check misuse||Karnataka which is battling the second wave of Covid-19, has put in place a SMS-based Remdesivir allocation and information system, aimed at curbing its blackmarketing and misuse."In order to bring transparency in the allocation of Remdesivir a tech-driven system has been developed and now the patient will get a SMS informing which hospital is provided the medicine against the SRF ID," Health Minister K Sudhakar said on Sunday."In case if the #Remdesivir is allocated against the SRF ID & the hospital has not provided it to the patient, a facility is provided in the same link to report it to the government. This will help govt in curbing blackmarketing & misuse of Remdesivir," he said in a tweet.Citizens can also check information on Remdesivir using the link https://covidwar.karnataka.gov.in/service2.Deputy Chief Minister C N Ashwath Narayan too in a tweet said, "In case if Remdesivir is allocated against the SRF ID and hospital has not provided it to patients, you can report it to the Govt. This is largely to reduce misuse of the drug."Remdesivir is in great demand for the treatment of Covid-19 infected patients at hospitals.Aimed at ensuring optimal use of Remdesivir, the state government had recently even issued guidelines directing all healthcare facilities in the state to follow it in letter and spirit.It had also called for each healthcare facility to form a Remdesivir Audit Committee and submit a report on the use to the expert committees constituted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/karnataka-implements-tech-driven-system-for-remdesivir-allocation-information-to-check-misuse-101621762201011.html
23-05-2021||Ranchi||Covid-19: About 7,000 prisoners may get bail or parole in Jharkhand to decongest overcrowded prisons||About 7,000 prisoners may be granted interim bail or parole to decongest overcrowded prisons in Jharkhand state, that is battling a second surge of Covid-19 pandemic in the wake of a recent Supreme Court order, a top official said. An order has been issued to jail superintendents by the High- Powered Committee to shortlist prisoners on the basis of a directive by the Supreme Court to release on parole or interim bail, prisoners and the under-trials for offences entailing up to 7-year jail term to decongest prisons in the wake of coronavirus pandemic, Inspector General Prisons, Jharkhand, Birendra Bhushan told PTI. "If the courts approve, in all there are about 7,000 prisoners who may get interim bail. If this happens our jails will run as per capacity," Bhushan said.There are 21,046 prisoners including 15,900 undertrials lodged in the state's thirty prisons that have a capacity to house 16,700 inmates. A high-powered committee that comprises Justice AK Singh of Jharkhand High Court, Principal Secretary Home Rajiv Arun Ekka and IG Prisons Birendra Bhushan had met on May 17 to review the situation and had asked Jail Superintendent to identify eligible prisoners under the criteria. "Once the jail superintendents will provide the list of shortlisted prisoners, their names will be given to the District Legal Service Authority ... granting bail will be the role of judges and courts ... There may be about 7,000 such prisoners and in case their bails are approved, the jails will be less crowded," Bhushan said. Ninety days parole can be sanctioned to eligible prisoners while the period for those already on parole can be extended. He said the exact number of such prisoners will be known in a day or two. Jharkhand has 30 jails out of which 7 are Central jails, 15 district jails, one open jail and remaining are small sub- jails. Apart from shortlisting the eligible inmates, an exercise is also underway to rationalise the number of prisoners in view of the pandemic by shifting prisoners from overcrowded jails to less crowded jails, he said. Taking note of the "unprecedented surge" in Covid-19 cases, the Supreme Court on May 8 had moved to decongest prisons and ordered the immediate release of prisoners who were granted bail or parole last year. Observing that the decongestion of prisons housing around 4 lakh inmates across the country is a matter concerning "health and right to life of" prisoners and police personnel, a bench headed by Chief Justice N V Ramana said all those who were allowed to go out on bail in March last year by the high- powered committees of states and Union Territories (UTs) be granted the same relief without any reconsideration to avoid delay. "Further we direct that, those inmates who were granted parole, pursuant to our earlier orders, should be again granted parole for a period of 90 days in order to tide over the pandemic," the bench, also having Justices L Nageswara Rao and Surya Kant had said in its order. The top court had taken note of its March 23, 2020, order by which it had directed all states and UTs to constitute high- powered committee (HPC) to consider releasing on parole or interim bail prisoners and the under trials for offences entailing up to 7-year jail term to decongest prisons in the wake of coronavirus pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ranchi-news/covid19-about-7-000-prisoners-may-get-bail-or-parole-in-jharkhand-to-decongest-overcrowded-prisons-101621760629001.html

Police arrested two persons including the suspect, identified as Rafi, while probing a robbery case and are on the lookout for three more persons in connection with the May 5 incident where they waylaid a jeweller. The duo, according to police, robbed the jewellery shop owner in "a planned" incident. "The two had keenly watched the jewellery shop owner and struck at an opportune time, relieving him of gold," a senior police officer told PTI. Acting on the complaint of the shop owner, the Periamet police launched a hunt to trace the culprits. "We watched the CCTV footage and traced one of them with the help of the number plate of the vehicle used by them. Of the two, Yashin was arrested on May 10 from Allikulam here and based on his confession, the police team zeroed in on the hideout of his accomplice who was later identified as Rafi, on Friday," the official said. Investigation revealed that Rafi was a suspect in the Central railway station blast case in 2014 and had a non- bailable warrant (NBW) pending against him for a year. About 75 grams of gold, a car and a two-wheeler were seized from Rafi who was later produced before a local court at Chengalpattu and remanded. He had several cases, including a counterfeit currency racket, pending against him. Police said a hunt is on to trace and nab three more persons who were said to be involved in the robbery. A woman was killed and 14 others injured when two low-intensity bombs exploded in a span of five minutes in two coaches of the Bangalore-Guwahati train at the busy Central Railway station here on May 1, 2014.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/2014-chennai-central-station-blast-case-police-arrest-suspect-one-other-101621760565142.html

23-05-2021||Delhi||1,600 new Covid-19 cases in Delhi, positivity rate below 2.5%: CM Arvind Kejriwal||Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal said on Sunday that the national capital recorded 1,600 new cases of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) in the last 24 hours, as he announced that the ongoing Covid-19 lockdown in the city is being extended by one more week till May 31.Also Read | Delhi extends Covid-19 lockdown by 1 week“There was a day in April, when more than 28,000 new Covid-19 cases were recorded in Delhi. In the last 24 hours, however, 1,600 people were found positive,” Kejriwal said. On April 20, the national capital’s infection tally increased by 28,395 fresh cases, according to that day’s health department bulletin. The bulletin also reported 277 additional fatalities related to the viral disease.In fact, the 28,395 cases on April 20 is the highest Delhi has seen in a single-day since the beginning of the pandemic.The chief minister further said, “In April, the positivity rate was recorded at 36%, that is, out of 100 people tested for Covid-19, 36 were returning a positive result. If I talk about the positivity rate from the last 24 hours, it is now below even 2.5%."On April 23, Delhi saw its positivity rate peak at 36.24%, as 26,169 samples tested positive out of 72,208 tested for the coronavirus disease.Over the last few days, the city has seen a continuous decline in its daily cases, as well as in its positivity rate. The number of fresh infections has been below 10,000 for several days; on May 13, there were 10,489 new cases, with a positivity rate of 14.24%.In a bid to break the chain of transmission, CM Kejriwal announced on April 19 that a complete lockdown will come into force at 10pm on the day, and will end at 5am on April 26. Since then, the lockdown has been extended five times, including on Sunday. Kejriwal also said that if cases continue to decrease, Delhi would begin “unlocking” from May 31.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/1600-new-covid-19-cases-in-delhi-positivity-rate-below-2-5-cm-kejriwal-101621755034181.html
23-05-2021||Delhi||Delhi lockdown relaxation to begin from May 31: Arvind Kejriwal||Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Sunday extended the ongoing lockdown in the Capital by another week but said that a phased relaxation will begin from May 31 if the Covid-19 case trajectory and positivity rate continue to decline.He also expressed concerns over vaccine shortage in the light of a potential third wave of Covid-19 in the country, while stressing on the need to prepare against it.“In the last 24 hours, we asked several sections of people what to do and the larger opinion is that the lockdown should be extended by another week. If we open everything now, there is a risk that we may lose all gains on the Covid-19 front we have made over the last one month. The lockdown was supposed to last till 5 am tomorrow. Now, we have decided to extend it till 5 am next Monday (May 31),” said Kejriwal in a live streamed video press briefing.He further said, “However, if the curve continues to decline like this for a week, we will start a phased un-lockdown process from May 31. We cannot open everything at one go. There is an immense risk in it. So, the relaxations have to be implemented in a phased way. I hope people will cooperate in this.”Delhi has had four distinct waves of Covid-19. The last one which started in late-March – coinciding with the second wave in the country – was the most severe and left the healthcare system in the capital overwhelmed. Further, a shortage of medical oxygen and medicines contributed to more deaths. At its peak, Delhi recorded 28,395 cases on April 20 and a positivity rate of more than 36% on April 22.In his Sunday briefing, the chief minister said that the number of new cases recorded in the last 24 hours has dropped to around 1,600 and the positivity rate was less than 2.5%. With that, Delhi recorded a positivity rate of less than 5% -- World Health Organisation’s (WHO) benchmark for Covid-19 cases being under control– for three consecutive days.On April 17-18, a weekend curfew was imposed in Delhi, which was turned into a full lockdown from April 20. This is the fifth time the ongoing lockdown has been extended.Dr Puneet Misra, professor of community medicine at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) in Delhi, said: “The city cannot remain under a complete lockdown forever. That is understandable. Before relaxing the lockdown, Delhi should ideally have a positivity rate of less than 5% for at least one week. Cases are declining and they are likely to further decline by May 31. A phased re-opening of important economic activities can be considered at that point. Also, people must remember that they cannot let their guards down like they did before the second wave of the pandemic hit India. For governments, this is also the time to scale up vaccination.”The move was welcomed by traders and resident welfare associations too.Praveen Khandelwal, secretary general of Confederation of All India Traders, said the strategy of phased opening of lockdown depending on the Covid-19 situation was sound. "Relaxing the lockdown at this point and at one go could have led to a surge in cases again. The government, however, should consider giving some compensation to traders whose income have been affected by the lockdown but they still have to pay salaries, rent, taxes, etc,” he said.Saurabh Gandhi, general secretary of United Residents of Delhi, which is a collective of around 1,800 resident welfare associations (RWA) in the city, said: “It was evident that the situation in Delhi would not come sufficiently under control till the end of this month. The government could have announced a month-long lockdown at one go in the beginning of May instead of going for several week-long restrictions. Now they should focus on increasing vaccine coverage.”Chief minister Kejriwal said that the Covid-19 wave was not over but it had significantly come under control and lauded the people for their support. "We overcame a shortage of hospital beds and medical oxygen in this phase with the help of people, the Central government, Supreme Court and the (Delhi) high court. Now, we are concerned about vaccine shortage. But I am sure that too will be resolved soon,” Kejriwal said.Delhi has a population of 20 million -- of which 15 million are adults, as per electoral rolls. The number translates to a requirement of 30 million vaccine doses. So far, around 26% of the adult population in the Capital has received at least one dose of the vaccine, government records showed.Kejriwal further said, “Right now, our priority is to vaccinate the entire population of Delhi at the earliest. There is speculation of a third wave. We have to prepare for that aggressively in terms of scaling up hospital beds, ICUs, oxygen, tankers, oxygen storage facilities, etc. But high vaccine coverage can totally reduce the possibility of a third wave. We have had talks with several domestic as well as international manufacturers on how vaccine coverage can be increased in Delhi. We are ready to buy vaccines for our entire population no matter how much it costs.”In the 2021-22 budget of Delhi, the city government allocated ₹50 crore for vaccination. However, a recent vaccine shortage forced the government to suspend around 250 vaccine centres meant for the 18-44 age group over the last 10 days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-lockdown-relaxation-to-begin-from-may-31-arvind-kejriwal-101621755087120.html

23-05-2021||Delhi||Delhi extends Covid-19 lockdown by 1 week; unlocking to start from May 31 if cases continue to fall, says CM Kejriwal||Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal extended the ongoing lockdown by one more week - a decision he said has been taken after consulting with citizens and other stakeholders. Kejriwal said that the process of unlocking will start from May 31 if cases decrease and people continue to follow all norms."Delhi is reporting more than 1,000 cases everyday, I asked people in the last 24 hours so we can take a decision together. A common opinion was the lockdown should be extended by one week more, till next Monday 5am," the chief minister said while addressing a press conference.Kejriwal praised the discipline exhibited by citizens in following the lockdown norms crediting their effort and resilience for the declining number of cases in the national capital."We imposed a lockdown from April 20 and within a month due to your discipline and efforts the most deadly wave of Covid-19 till date is weakening," said Kejriwal."I won't say we have won this battle but we have a brought it under control" he added.The chief minister announced during the press briefing that the positivity rate in the national capital has decline further and now stands at 2.5%, much below the rate of 5% mandated by World Health Organization. Delhi also recorded 1,600 new cases of Covid-19 on Sunday, its lowest daily tally since March 1."If we test 100 individuals only 2.5 test positive and 97.5 people test negative," said the ruling Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) chief.The chief minister also talked about the harrowing shortage of oxygen Delhi had experienced during the peak of the second wave, stating that all stakeholders came together to solve the crisis."Delhi went through a shortage of oxygen but the people of Delhi, the central government, Supreme Court, Delhi high court came together to solve it," Kejriwal said.The Delhi government had imposed an initial lockdown on April 20, which was last extended on May 16 for one week.Kejriwal outlined a two-pronged approach to dealing with a third wave of Covid-19, either by vaccinating the 2 crore population of Delhi at the earliest so that a third wave does not materialise, or by ramping up facilities to help the city weather another wave. He emphasised that vaccination remains the government's priority and added that the government is ready to spend as much money as needed for vaccinating its people of Delhi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/elhi-extends-covid-19-lockdown-by-1-week-will-start-unlocking-city-from-may-31-if-cases-continue-to-fall-says-cm-kejriwal-101621750223688.html
23-05-2021||Delhi||New research records 8 more species of snakes in Delhi, number rises to 23||Eight more species have been added to the national capital's list of snakes after an extensive five-year study conducted by researchers from the Delhi University.This has taken the number of snake species recorded in the capital to 23, updating the 1997 list mentioned in the book 'Fauna of Delhi' that is widely used to track Delhi's native species, according to Gaurav Barhadiya, a researcher from the Department of Environmental Studies, Delhi University, who conducted the study.The study recorded a total of 329 snakes in 23 species and nine families. The new additions are -- common bronzeback tree snake, common trinket snake, common cat snake, barred wolf snake, common kukri, streaked kukri, common sandboa and saw-scaled viper.The research, published in the American Journal “Reptiles and Amphibians”, covered all eleven districts of Delhi, between January 2016 and October 2020, through 376 field surveys in various urban forests, parks, private gardens, farms, vacant plots, lakes, and water bodies.The findings were revealed last month. Data collection techniques included pitfall traps, opportunistic encounters, nocturnal road cruising, and road kills encounters. Secondary information on snake rescue has also been taken from NGOs like the Wildlife Trust of India and Fauna Foundation of India. Professor Dr Chirashree Ghosh from the Department of Environmental Studies, who supervised the research, said documentation of urban biodiversity is an urgent requirement as latest statistics and generated data on urban floral and faunal biodiversity has not been compiled and documented properly.“Rapid urbanization is heavily impacting the animal and reptilian population, including snakes. The future planning should be inclusive of preservation of its green spaces and wildlife,” she said. Delhi is an important site for conservation, as it comprises the last spurs of ancient Aravalli mountains in the form of a ridge, which is now in fragments either in the form of urban forests or urban parks and experiences regular snake occurrences in and around houses, gardens, and industrial areas, Ghosh said.This means it still holds good potential and provides an opportunity to conserve the native flora, fauna, and biodiversity amidst a densely populated urban area, she said.Unfortunately, snakes in Delhi have never received priority as compared to the other groups like mammals and avian diversity. Therefore, no significant studies have been published on the occurrence of snakes in the capital, Barhadiya said. “Most snakes we encountered were non-venomous and are harmless and thus, people should not be afraid and kill them on the spot. Persecution of snakes, road mortality, lack of knowledge, habitat modification, and habitat fragmentation are the major threats to snake species in urban Delhi," he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/new-research-records-8-more-species-of-snakes-in-delhi-number-rises-to-23-101621750155903.html

There is a healthcare centre but no one from there goes to the villages to educate people about vaccination and COVID norms. There is also vaccine hesitancy here, but if there were awareness campaigns more people would have taken the vaccinations."When somebody falls ill here, they to the local 'jhola chhap' doctors and when their situation deteriorates they go to district hospitals. That's why people are dying," said Bachchan Thakur, a resident of Sua Kaudia village.Another local of the village, Mukesh told ANI that about 25 people with Covid-19 like symptoms had died in the area recently."The situation was bad in the village about 10 days ago, but people are staying indoors because of fear and that's why the death toll has not increased more," said Mukesh.Jharkhand reported 2037 new coronavirus cases, and 41 deaths, The COVID tally in the state has climbed to 3,27,035, including 22,566 active cases.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ranchi-news/at-least-22-suspected-covid-19-deaths-in-jharkhand-s-palamu-probe-ordered-101621745373778.html
23-05-2021||Ranchi||PM Narendra Modi’s direct review with DMs against federalism: Hemant Soren||While Covid-19 cases in Jharkhand have shown a declining trend in the last few days, chief minister Hemant Soren says the state can’t let the guard down as uncertainty about the nature of the pandemic remains. In a telephonic interview with Vishal Kant, the chief minister spoke over a host of issues including rural spread of the pandemic, hiccups in the vaccination drive besides the Centre-state relations. Here are some excerpts.Q) We are in the middle of the second wave of the pandemic. The numbers of positive Covid cables in Jharkhand have started falling. What is the government’s assessment? Have we crossed the peak?A) Our experience shows a lot of uncertainty related to this disease. It keeps going up and down. Now, there are more associated issues coming up like the black fungus. I think the numbers going down could also be a result of the restrictions we have put in place. So we cannot lower our guard. Overall social distancing and use of masks are the best practice to save oneself from the disease besides vaccination.Q) Besides the high positivity rate, the second wave is more worrying due to its spread in the rural areas, which have very poor health infrastructure?A) Yes, our challenge has increased. In the first wave the spread was largely in the densely populated urban areas. But this time, it has penetrated the rural part. Initially, the situation was getting chaotic. However, we have things under control now. We have now also started a special door-to-door drive in rural areas to scan people, be it those who are unwell or even those who have died. We don’t want to hide data, even of death. In fact having exact data of death also gives us an idea of the direction in which the spread might be going.Q) This pandemic has also brought back the focus to an inadequate public healthcare system. Jharkhand traditionally has had a very poor public healthcare with shortage of doctors, paramedics and technicians. Has this pandemic forced policy makers and your government to change the approach towards public health and make improvements accordingly?A) I totally agree with it. The role of public healthcare has come to fore like never before. In fact despite all the limitations, it is the public healthcare infrastructure that has led the fight against the crisis. The private sector’s role has been exposed that ultimately they are business entities. There is no denying the fact that lots need to be done. Traditionally we have been a poor and anaemic state, be it on economic, social or educational parameters. We are doing an assessment and working on plans to improve healthcare. However, I would also underline that we handled the pandemic in a much better way despite the limitations than some of our neighbouring states.Q) Vaccination is the key to fight this disease. But it’s very slow in the state, especially in the 18-44 age group. What’s the plan ahead?A) There is no denying the fact that there is shortage of vaccines due to supply constraints. Initially, the Centre was doing the procurement and distribution. Then they suddenly left it to the states to procure it for the 18-44 age group. That has led to a chaotic situation. States are now going for global tenders. And then there is no parity in pricing [of vaccines] for the states and the Centre. But we are still making the best effort because the same people will turn around and blame the states if there is a delay in vaccination.Q) Will Jharkhand also go for a global tender?A) Yes, it’s in the process. We will issue it within the next few days.Q) But do you think that will help?A) I am not very hopeful. ...it is going to be a huge burden on the states, especially poor states like us. There is no price parity. Spending hundreds of crores would be a huge burden. But we have no choice.Q) Some other states have said the Centre should be taking over the entire vaccination programme. What’s your position?A) Absolutely. I made a similar demand from the UPA (united progressive alliance) platform. And I still think so. It’s not too late. They made a budget of ₹35,000 crores. The Centre should be doing all procurement and distribution. They are allocating oxygen, medicines and equipment. Similarly, vaccination needs to be done at the national level in a transparent manner.Q) In Jharkhand, there is another challenge in the vaccination programme--- hesitancy, largely due to rumours surrounding the after effect of vaccines especially in rural areas.A) Yes, we have also got feedback about this problem in the rural areas. This is mostly related to lack of awareness. And the confusion and certain events related to vaccines and other drugs being used in the fight against Covid has also contributed to it. People hear about some side effects of the vaccine and duplicate drugs being administered. These things add to the rumours, making it a bigger challenge in a state like ours due to the illiteracy levels. However, we have chalked out a detailed awareness programme with the help of all elected representatives across the political spectrum. The campaign will run up to the level of gram panchayats in order to dispel rumours and encourage people to get vaccinated.Q) Centre-state relations often become a talking point. We have seen conflict situations even during the pandemic. Your tweet about the PM went viral, with the BJP hitting back. What really did you mean by that tweet? Was it to say that such meetings/discussions are not fruitful?A) The basic thing is that there needs to be transparency. I tweeted about the phone call only after news started flashing on TV that he spoke to CMs. We saw the incident of Delhi CM Kejriwal. He was reminded about the protocol of the meeting. But how come what the PM speaks comes in the media? So, how do we (the states) share our concerns and demands? My view was that the state governments need to be taken into confidence before taking any decision. Or else, there would be a problem in implementation. We have an example of what’s happening with the ventilators supplied to states.Q) West Bengal CM Mamta Banerjee raised the issue of PM-DM conference? You were part of it. Do you share similar views?A) I want to clarify that I have no ego hassles to sit there with DMs. However, such meetings are against the principles of federalism. Have we ever seen any other PM in the past hold a review meeting directly with DMs. I totally agree that such meetings are done to humiliate us where we have nothing to speak or contribute. Will the Centre be comfortable if I start doing review meetings with the Union health secretary? He (PM) also needs to think that he is sitting at a very high-level.Q) In the first wave, it was the Centre that imposed the lockdown. This time it has left the states to decide on that. Such restrictions have huge economic fallout? How will the state fight that? There are already reports of economic stress. Two days back a driver sought food in Ranchi for his starving family?A) In that specific case, as soon as we got to know, we extended help to the family at 1 am in the night. As far as imposing a lockdown is concerned, there are double standards there as well. In the first wave, for the Centre lockdown was the first option but the states have been advised that it should be the last option. As far economic stress is concerned, we have an eye on it. We didn’t let anyone starve in the first wave, it won’t happen this time as well.Q) Will the lockdown be extended?Q) The restrictions have clearly helped in containing the spread. We still have 2-3 days left (restrictions end on May 27 morning). We are assessing the situation. The survey we are doing will give us more clarity about the spread in rural areas by around 25th May. We will take a decision as per the situation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ranchi-news/pm-narendra-modi-s-direct-review-with-dms-against-federalism-hemant-soren-101621745162237.html

It also directed medicine sellers to “update the stock position of these drugs four times a day -- at 10am, 2pm, 6pm and 9pm respectively,” the order read.The order was issued on the directions of Delhi Lieutenant Governor (L-G) Anil Baijal.“He had said that it should also be ensured that hoarding, over charging or black marketing of such drugs/medicines does not happen by prominently displaying stocks and rates of such drugs by dealers/retailers/sellers for information of people at large. Accordingly, the government on Saturday issued an order under the aegis of DDMA which will be strictly enforced in letter and spirit by the Drug Controller, DMs and DCPs,” a senior official from the L-G office said.The district magistrates and DCPs have been directed to ensure strict compliance of the order. “In case any person is found violating the aforesaid directions , the defaulting person shall be proceeded against as per Section 51 to 60 of Disaster Management Act, 2005, Section 188 of IPC, the Epidemic Act, 1897 Drugs & Cosmetics Act, 1940 and Rules 1945 and other applicable laws,” the order said.The L-G has further instructed that a similar order be issued for oximeters, oxygen cylinders/concentrators etc.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/shops-to-display-covid-meds-stock-101621720395258.html
23-05-2021||Delhi||At least 1,000 duped on fake Covid jab websites||KSoon after India launched the world’s largest Covid-19 vaccination drive in mid-January, more than 1,000 people across the country were duped of over ₹40 lakh by an international syndicate that allegedly created a fake website, after cloning the official website of the Union ministry of health and family welfare, and offered inoculation to individuals at a cost of ₹4,000- ₹6,000 per shot, the Delhi Police said on Friday.Although that particular fake website was blocked around the first week of February and two separate cases were registered by the Delhi Police – one in February by the CyPAD (cyber crime unit) and another in the last week of April by South Avenue police station – at least eight more fake websites, which offered vaccination slots on payment, have been blocked in the past fortnight, after links to these websites were found circulating as text messages and social media posts, police said.“These links directed people to fake websites or prompted them to download mobile applications for registering themselves for the vaccination. The objective of these websites was to either dupe people of money or to steal their personal and banking data,” said Anyesh Roy, deputy commissioner of police, CyPAD.As far as the two cases registered over the fake website of the ministry of health were concerned, there has been no progress in the South Avenue police’s investigation, the officer said. The investigation done by CyPAD has led to the arrest of two people of Nepal origin,--one from Siliguri in West Bengal and another from Uttarakhand--between March and April. The investigating team also seized their two bank accounts in which more than ₹40 lakh was deposited by at least 1,000 people for getting the Covid-19 vaccine, a senior CyPAD officer, who did not want to be named, said.The two were identified as Shekhar Pariyarwas (caught from Siliguri) and Ashok Singh, who was nabbed in Uttarakhand. Their interrogation revealed that their common link, a man based in Nepal, had approached them for opening bank accounts into which the vaccine aspirants were made to deposit the money, which was further routed to various international bank accounts, the officer quoted above said.Investigators said the fake website was created by copying the original ministry site’s metadata. The fake website is an exact clone of the official website, down to the India state emblem. The only difference in the two websites was the “Appointment for Vaccination” section -- this is not there on the original ministry site.“Upon clicking on the ‘Appointment for Vaccination’ button, the website takes to a URL where the person could select a vaccine for purchase. Upon selecting the vaccine and number of doses, the person needed to share her name and phone number. The payment sought was ₹4,000 to ₹6,000, depending on the vaccine chosen,” the officer said.Apart from taking down such websites, the city police and other agencies have also been issuing advisories on various media platforms to caution people against falling victim to such frauds, said Delhi Police spokesperson Chinmoy Biswal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/at-least-1-000-duped-on-fake-covid-jab-websites-101621719904108.html
23-05-2021||Delhi||Meet on Class 12 exams may discuss proposal for tests in major subjects||The Union government has proposed to the states to conduct Class 12 Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) exams for major subjects only, according to the proposal document seen by HT.Nearly 20 of the 174 subjects offered to Class 12 students are considered major subjects by CBSE. Board students take a minimum of five and a maximum of six subjects out of which four are considered major subjects.On April 14, the education ministry cancelled Class 10 board examination and delayed the Class 12 board examination amid rising Covid-19 cases in India, saying that the situation will be reviewed on June 1.This comes ahead of a high-level meeting to be held on Sunday which will discuss whether Class 12 exams should be cancelled or conducted as per different proposals, officials privy to the matter said. The meeting to be attended by state education ministers and secretaries will be chaired by defence minister Rajnath Singh, Union education minister Ramesh Pokhriyal Nishank announced in a series of tweets on Saturday.“The Hon’ble Prime Minister has desired that any decision affecting the careers of his beloved students has to be taken in wide consultations with all State Governments & Stakeholders. I recently held a meeting with the State Education Secretaries in this regards,” Nishank tweeted.“The consultative process will be further strengthened through a high level meeting to be chaired by Hon’ble Defence Minister Shri rajnathsinghJi, also to be attended by my cabinet colleagues Smt. smritiiraniJi and Shri PrakashJavdekarJi,” he said in another tweet.According to the proposal documents, examination for the major subjects can be conducted in two ways. In the first option, the examination for major subjects may be conducted at the “designated examination centres and in the existing format” like previous years and for the minor subjects “marks can be calculated as per the assessment scheme based on the performance in the major subjects.”Conducting examination in this mode will only be possible if the board has three months which would include “one month of pre-exam activities and 2 months for the conduct of exams and declaration of results and another 45 days for compartment exams”, according to the document.The second option involves multiple changes, including conducting exams at schools where the students are enrolled, reducing the duration of examination from three hours to 90 minutes, and switching to only multiple choice and short answer type questions. The process, as per the second proposal, can be completed in 45 days and results can be declared within 15 days of completion of the exams.The second proposal also includes that the examination can be conducted twice depending on the pandemic situation in various parts of the country. “The Class XII Examinations could be conducted two times by the Board. Wherever the conditions are conducive, examinations could commence from a suitable date. In the remaining locations, the examinations will start after a fortnight of the first phase,” the document states.CBSE officials declined to comment on the proposals.Meanwhile, Delhi education minister Manish Sisodia hosted an Instagram live session with the stakeholders including teachers, principals and students of Delhi schools and sought their suggestions on the matter.Delhi government officials said majority of the school teachers and principals who attended the session said that final grades should be awarded on the basis of unit tests, practical examinations, general tests and pre-board exams already conducted in February-March 2021.“The consensus that emerged from all the meetings with these key stakeholders was that in the absence of vaccines to children, conducting any kind of examinations will only make our students and teachers more vulnerable to the virus. With the surge of Covid-19 cases, teachers and principals stated that the most appropriate decision with regard to Class 12 board exams would be to completely cancel them,” the Delhi government said in a statement.Jyoti Arora, principal of Mount Abu Public School, who was present at the meeting said, “Many school administrators said that online examination cannot be conducted due to the digital divide. The discussion focussed on either cancelling the examination or tests for major papers only.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/meet-on-class-12-exams-may-discuss-proposal-for-tests-in-major-subjects-101621719078774.html
23-05-2021||Delhi||Second plea for Navneet Kalra’s custody rejected||A Delhi court on Saturday rejected for the second time a plea by Delhi Police seeking custody of businessman Navneet Kalra who has been charged with allegedly hoarding and black marketing oxygen concentrators.“In my considered opinion, police custody remand is not warranted. Application is dismissed,” metropolitan magistrate Vasundhra Azad said. The police, on Saturday, had moved a fresh remand application of five days for Kalra.During the proceedings, Kalra, appearing on video conferencing from Mandoli jail, said he was being framed because he is famous. “I run a famous optical shop known as Dayal opticals. I had taken machines from my friend’s company, Matrix Cellular, for friends and family. Police also bought machines for Covid centres from me. People have texted me saying timely help saved lives.”On May 20, another city court junked police’s plea seeking five days custody and sent Kalra to judicial custody for 14 days. The court said that whatever substantial information required has been already procured and no fruitful purpose will be served by extending the police custody.Kalra was arrested from a farmhouse in Gurugram on Sunday evening. The Delhi Police recovered 524 oxygen concentrators from three restaurants – Khan Chacha, Town Hall and Nege & Ju – owned by Kalra and from the office of Matrix Cellular between May 5 and May 7.Before Kalra, five people, including the manager of Nege & Ju restaurant, chief executive officer (CEO) and three senior officers of Matrix Cellular, were arrested after the recovery of the concentrators. However, all five were later released on bail with the court observing that it was unable to understand the offence they had committed as the government did not regulate the prices of the devicesOn Saturday, additional public prosecutor Atul Shrivastava told the court that Kalra’s custody is essential so that he could be confronted with mobile data, bank details and certain persons to unearth the alleged “nexus”.He said that one of the co-accused has recovered from Covid-19 on Friday, and he has to be confronted with Kalra.“The transactions were made through various banks. We had sent notices to various branches and have received some replies also. When he was asked details about the same, he stated that without seeing mobile phones and without consulting his CA, he cannot answer,” Shrivastava said.Kalra contested the claim. “They are saying 23 accounts. I have only one account in HDFC where money was received through RTGS. There is only one account. Because I am famous, they are just trying to put it on me. I am not the manufacturer. When machines were not functioning, I exchanged them,” he said.Kalra’s counsel, advocate Vineet Malhotra, said there is no question of concentrators being of spurious quality.After hearing the arguments, the court rejected the police’s application for five days remand.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/second-plea-for-navneet-kalra-s-custody-rejected-101621718578249.html
23-05-2021||Delhi||Doesn’t feel like May: Rain ensures no heatwave so far||Last year, this week, Delhi was facing a severe heat wave with the maximum temperature hovering between 43 and 46 degrees Celsius. This year, the month of May has so far been kind to the city residents thanks to the cyclonic storm Tauktae and multiple episodes of western disturbance that brought moderate to heavy rain to the Capital.This May, Delhi recorded the lowest maximum temperatures for the month in at least the last 70 years, with the mercury on May 19 dropping to 23.8 degrees Celsius. This was 16 degrees below what is considered normal for this time of the year. This also broke the previous record of 24.8 degrees Celsius, which was recorded on May 13, 1982.Last year, Delhi experienced a severe heat wave spell from May 22 to May 29, with the mercury levels breaching the 47 degrees Celsius mark in some parts.IMD records show that this month, the highest maximum temperature was recorded on May 1, when the mercury touched 41.5 degrees Celsius. The forecast by IMD shows that temperature is expected to rise in the coming days and by May 27, it is likely to touch 39 degrees Celsius.India Meteorological Department (IMD) scientists said unlike the last few years, Delhi has not recorded any heat wave days this May. This month, the Capital also witnessed five western disturbances already, as against the usual two to three, Met officials said.Meteorologists declare a heat wave when the maximum temperature for a location in the plains crosses 40 degrees Celsius. In the hills, the threshold temperature is 30 degrees Celsius. When departure in the day temperature is 4.5 degrees to 6.5 degrees above the normal maximum temperature of a location, it is declared as a heat wave.“This time we have not recorded any heat wave in the national capital, and the temperatures are lower than normal. The primary reason behind the lower than usual temperatures is the higher count of western disturbance in the entire northern India region. The exact picture of whether this has broken any past record will have to be analysed once we calculate the mean maximum temperature in the end of the month,” said Kuldeep Srivastava, head of IMD’s regional weather forecasting centre.Srivastava said that May of 2014 and 2011 also did not record any heat wave days.Even after cyclonic storm Tauktae-induced rainfall, Delhi has received fresh western disturbance, which has resulted in episodes of early morning showers, which kept the temperatures from rising. On Saturday, the maximum temperature was 35.1 degrees Celsius, five degrees below normal, while the minimum temperature was 18.3 degrees Celsius, nine degrees below normal.“We are not expecting heat wave conditions to set now in the coming days, even though there is a possibility of maximum temperatures rising. It has rained almost continuously in many parts of the country in April. The entire north India has been experiencing cloudy skies and strong winds, which also has not allowed the maximum temperatures to rise,” said RK Jenamani, senior scientist, national weather forecasting centre.Delhi and NCR received moderate rainfall throughout Wednesday, which resulted in a drop of 16 degrees Celsius (°C), IMD said. IMD recordings showed that till 8.30pm on Wednesday, Delhi’s Safdarjung observatory had recorded 60mm rainfall.IMD officials said that till now, the all-time record of rainfall for May for Safdarjung is 60.0 mm, recorded on May 24, 1976, and since the rain continued through the night in most parts of the city, this record has been broken.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/doesnt-feel-like-may-rain-ensures-no-heatwave-so-far-101621718105563.html

23-05-2021||Mumbai||Navy recovers 6 more bodies of barge’s crew, 20 missing||The Indian Navy on Saturday recovered six more bodies of crew members of the ill-fated barge Papaa305 (P305) that capsized in the Arabian sea hours after Cyclone Tauktae hit the Mumbai coast last Sunday, taking the overall toll in the tragedy to 66.Search is still on for 20 missing personnel -- nine crew members of P305 and 11 who were on board tugboat Varaprada, which also sank during the cyclone. The Navy dispatched two specialised diving teams from Mumbai on Saturday morning to augment the search.“The teams on board INS Makar, which is also equipped with a side-scan sonar, and INS Tarasa sailed out early morning,” said commander Mehul Karnik, chief public relations officer of the Western Naval Command.He added that the actual work of the diving teams will, however, start only after the exact locations of the sunken barge and tugboat are ascertained and preparatory work completed.The barge was located at the seabed after systematic search by INS Makar late on Saturday.Barge P305 was deployed at an unmanned platform in Heera oil fields, one of the largest ONGC rigs in the Arabian sea. As Cyclone Tauktae hit the Mumbai coast, the barge got de-anchored on Sunday night, and hit a platform while drifting in the rough sea. It sank around 7pm on Monday in a very choppy sea amid rough weather, which made search and rescue one of the most challenging operations undertaken by the Navy in four decades.Afcons Infrastructure, which leads the consortium that chartered the barge and hired its crew, said there were 261 members on board. The barge sank about 40 nautical miles west off Mumbai. The Navy and the Coastguard have so far rescued 186 barge crew members and recovered 66 bodies.Search efforts for remaining crews of P305 and Tug Varaprada continue.On Monday afternoon, INS Kolkata rescued two crew members of the tugboat, Varaprada. Meanwhile, police said nine unidentified bodies were found along the coast in Raigad (4), Daman (1) and Valsad (4) over the past two days.“We are co-ordinating with the local authorities in Raigad, Daman and Valsad to check if those bodies are of any crew members of the cyclone-hit barges or boats,” said Suhas Hemade, senior inspector, Yellow Gate police station.Mumbai Police spokesperson, deputy commissioner of police Chaitanya Siriprolu said police have so far received 61 bodies of P305 crew and 31 of those have been identified and 28 handed over to their respective families.The DCP added that police are also securing DNA samples of the unidentified bodies for ascertaining their identity in future.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/navy-recovers-6-more-bodies-of-barge-s-crew-20-missing-101621712119921.html

The boys, aged 15 and 17, belong to Pakistan’s border district of Kasur.

The recovered firearms include two Austria-made Glock pistols (.9mm) and a Brazil-made Taurus pistol (.45 bore) and a Smith and Wesson (.45 mm) pistol made in USA that fetch lakhs of rupees in the black market as they are not available in India. Cartridges were also seized. The accused was identified as Karamjit Singh of Kohar Singh Wala village in Ferozepur district. The police have secured his three-day police custody. Superintendent of police (SP) Bhupinder Singh Sidhu said Karamjit was nabbed on a tip-off. “During preliminary investigation, it was found that he was working at the behest of Harbans Lal of Mukstar district, a murder accused lodged in jail. Now, we will bring Harbans on production warrant to cross-question the two,” he said.The police are trying to trace the source of the seized weapons. “According to our information, the weapons were handed over to him at Bhucho Mandi in Bathinda district.

23-05-2021||Chandigarh||Validity of marriage no ground for denial of protection to couple: Punjab and Haryana HC||The Punjab and Haryana high court has said the question over validity of a marriage cannot be a ground for denial of protection sought by a couple who have married against the wishes of their parents. The high court bench of justice JS Puri said this while dealing with a plea in which a coordinate bench on protection plea of a Jalandhar woman, who converted from Islam to Hinduism to marry a Hindu man, had asked whether the execution of an affidavit is sufficient for her conversion. The query was posed to their lawyer on May 12 and he was asked to address arguments on the issue on May 17. The plea said she executed an affidavit on April 28 declaring that she has converted to the Hindu religion. She married the boy the same day. The court had asked whether, execution of an affidavit is sufficient to convert to Hindu religion. On May 17, before Justice Puri, the petitioners’ counsel had submitted that their prayer was confined only to granting protection of life and liberty and the validity of the marriage was not the subject matter. The lawyer had also referred to a 2014 judgment in which a division bench had held that even in the absence of such validation, the state was obligated to protect their life and liberty. “The scope of the present petition is only regarding the protection of life and liberty of the petitioners and, therefore, the validity of the marriage cannot be a ground for denial of such protection,” the bench of justice JS Puri said while disposing of the Jalandhar couple plea and asking authorities to take steps to protect their lives and liberty. In past two weeks conflicting judgments have been reported on protection to runaway couples. On May 11 one of the benches observed that the “entire social fabric of the society will get disturbed” if the plea for protection from a live-in couple is accepted, the other bench termed live in relationships “morally and socially not acceptable” and dismissed the plea. These judgments were followed by two other benches ruling the opposite, while a bench on May 18 held that live-in relationship is not prohibited nor does it amount to commission of any offence. Another bench had come out with observations that live-in relationships may not be acceptable to all, but could not be termed illegal. Hence, the denial of protection to a live-in couple would be a mockery of justice.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/validity-of-marriage-no-ground-for-denial-of-protection-to-couple-punjab-and-haryana-hc-101621714980463.html

It recorded five deaths in the past one month. Nearly 800 people were tested in the village in the past one week. Sarpanch Manpreet Kaur said it all started a month ago. “The virus spread in the village since the villagers did not take any precautions. People continued to sit together in the village common area and did not get tested, which deteriorated the situation,” she said.Now, the movement in the village has been restricted and those found positive for the virus and their family members are not allowed to step out of their homes.Dr Aslam Parvez, a medical officer, said of the 42 cases were reported two days ago while 37 tested positive on Saturday.“The villagers’ reluctance to get tested is the main reason behind the spread.

The information we have received confirms that the body bore injuries,” he said.Those privy to the autopsy revealed that apart from the body, injuries were noticed on the head. The nature of the head injuries suggested they were caused by boots, they said.The vendor was assaulted on a road and then at the Bangarmau police station on Friday afternoon for alleged violation of the partial coronavirus curfew in force in the state, it was alleged.He was selling vegetables, like many others in Bhatpuri area of Bangarmau, when police arrived and began chasing away people.It was alleged that he was brutally beaten up inside the police station, where he was taken in an unconscious state. As his condition worsened, he was taken to the Bangarmau community health centre where he was declared dead on arrival.A case of murder was registered against two policemen and a home guard after the alleged incident, which sparked a series of widespread protests. Police officers struggled to pacify local people who put up a road blockade, which continued till late Friday night.The blockade ended and the body was sent for the post-mortem examination after officers on the spot gave a cheque for ₹2 lakh as compensation, agreed to request the government for a compensation of ₹50 lakh and assured early arrest of the police constables and the home guard. The two constables were suspended and the home guard sacked.Though the case was lodged with Bangarmau police in Unnao, the investigation was handed over to inspector Indrapal Singh who is currently posted at the office of the Unnao superintendent of police. Officials said the decision was taken to maintain transparency in the investigation so that it could not be influenced at the local level.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/unnao-vendor-beaten-to-death-by-cops-had-14-injuries-reveals-autopsy-101621712132891.html
23-05-2021||Bangalore||Volunteers lead Covid-19 fight in Bengaluru while braving personal losses||At a time when Bengaluru, like rest of the country, is battling the surging second wave of Covid-19 pandemic, volunteers from across the city have come forward to help residents while braving personal losses. From providing meals, supplying oxygen cylinders, arranging hospitals beds to burying the dead, the Good Samaritans have made relentless efforts in coming to the aid of scared and scarred city residents.They did all this while battling their own adversities, including losing loved ones to the unprecedented surge of Covid-19 in the past two months.One such volunteer is Anne Morris, who helped in performing the last rites of 16 victims of Covid-19 on May 14, one of whom was her own uncle. She felt anguish that day like never before while volunteering, something that she has been doing since the first wave of the pandemic. “I have been helping to give decent burial to several victims of Covid-19, but when it came to my uncle, there was no one to help me,” Morris said, recalling her uncle’s ordeal.Morris, who is also the curator of the Indian Christian Cemetery, began volunteering with food distribution to migrant workers during the nationwide lockdown when the pandemic hit the country in March last year, before moving to help people with burials when Covid-19 deaths spiked in the second wave.“My uncle needed dialysis and we took him to a private hospital, which charged us more than ₹30,000. It was a daylight robbery and it made me question why I was doing the volunteer work in the first place,” Morris recalled. Besides her uncle, Morris also lost her brother-in-law, another uncle and her godfather to the viral infections, all in the month of May.While undergoing dialysis, her uncle tested positive for Covid-19 and died in a private hospital. Her 52-year-old brother-in-law succumbed to the infection after he was unable to get a hospital bed. “On May 9, after his saturation levels dropped, we approached multiple hospitals. We asked all volunteer groups we knew of, but we couldn’t find him a bed. It was only after five days, we got an ICU bed, but he died soon after he was admitted. By then, his condition had worsened,” she said.Morris said she was upset and anguished after suffering losses. “We helped so many and there was no one to help us. I wondered if I should continue to do volunteer work. But now, I’m back to work. A lot of people need help,” she said.Shahulla Khan, 45, was a third-generation funeral service worker at the Muslim Burial Ground on Mysore Road. According to his family, since the beginning of the pandemic, he had buried more than 300 bodies and even lived in the burial compound itself. He knew several Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) officials, who reached out to him for help in burying bodies, but when he fell ill, there was no one to help, his family said.Khaleel Khan, a relative of Shahulla, said they started looking for a bed when he first complaint of difficulties in breathing. As his saturation level began dropping drastically, the family began making frantic calls, even to the BBMP officials he knew.“We started looking for beds in the last week for April. We couldn’t find any oxygen beds. With help of some volunteers, we were able arrange an oxygen cylinder. We kept him at home on oxygen supply. But we were not able to find more cylinders,” Khaleel said.He added that whenever they called the BBMP officials they knew, they said there were no government beds available. Once his condition deteriorated, the family decided to take a gamble. “We tried several hospitals, but no beds were available. We then took him to a government hospital and told the security guard that we had reserved a bed. Once we were allowed to go in, we pleaded to the doctor, who allowed him to be on the floor with oxygen support,” Khaleel added.Hours later, Shahulla passed away. “Despite helping several families during the pandemic, when the virus caught up with him, he got no help,” Khaleel said.Another volunteer Sagay Raj Ambrose, who has been helping people to find food and oxygen during the pandemic, said he could do little when his younger brother fell sick. “I started volunteering during the first wave of Covid-19. Some told me about a family, where the son was hospitalised and an elderly couple were not able to get food, because they couldn’t get out. With the help of a friend, I delivered ration at their home. It all started there,” said Ambrose, who worked at the Bengaluru international airport.During the second wave, he helped several families in home isolation with ration kits and oxygen cylinders. It was during this time that he got a distressing call. “On May 6, my 45-year-old younger brother Vijay started facing breathing difficulties and his saturation levels were dropping. As soon as I got the call, I tried to get to the hospital, but nothing was working out,” he said.Ambrose said besides the non-availability of beds, hospitals were also demanding Covid-19 test reports before admitting patients. “Since his situation was critical, we didn’t have the time for a test, but with the help of a friend, we got a CT scan done. The scan said his condition was really bad,” said Ambrose.Unable to find an ICU, even with the help of other volunteers, he took his brother to a private hospital, where he was kept in the emergency room. “They gave him oxygen and an injection as well. We kept trying to move him to an ICU, but before we could get it, he passed away,” Ambrose said, wearing a brave face while recalling his brother’s story.Ambrose continues to be a volunteer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/volunteers-lead-covid-19-fight-in-bengaluru-while-braving-personal-losses-101621712153944.html
23-05-2021||Other||Barge tragedy: MVA wants Union min to go, BJP calls for action against pvt firm||The ruling Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government and Opposition Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) were locked in a war of words on Saturday over the P305 barge tragedy off Mumbai coast during Cyclone Tauktae, which has so far claimed 66 lives.MVA has held the Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) and the Union petroleum ministry responsible for the tragedy, and the three ruling partners – Congress, Shiv Sena and Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) – have demanded petroleum minister Dharmendra Pradhan’s resignation.Meanwhile, BJP has alleged that the Maharashtra government is “shielding” the contractor firm against whom a criminal case should be registered. BJP leader Ashish Shelar has demanded that Afcons Infrastructure, whose chartered barge P305 sank in the Arabian Sea, be charged with culpable homicide and a criminal case be registered against its officials. “Leaders from MVA government are shielding Afcons Infrastructure and its owners Shapoorji Pallonji and its directors. A case has been registered against the captain who is still missing. How can the captain alone be held guilty for the tragedy? The contractor company is solely responsible for the incident , despite which it’s being shielded by the people in the government,” he said.Shelar has also raised questions over the offshore operation by the contractors even after the cyclone warnings were issued. “Afcons was expected to begin the winding up process by May 12, but sought an extension till June 15. It did not bring its employees back despite the cyclone warning on May 11. Other companies, including ONGC, called their personnel back, but Afcons continued the operations. I have met Mumbai Police commissioner Hemant Nagrale and demanded a thorough inquiry into it by registering a case against the contractor firm,” he said.An Afcons spokesperson said that the company has no comment to offer on the statements by political leaders. In its statement issued on Friday, the company had said, “It’s our moral duty to support not only the families of the deceased persons involved in direct rolls, but also the families of all the deceased who were employed with sub-contractors. The calamity arising from the fury of Cyclone Tauktae was unprecedented, and we share the anguish of the affected families. We will ensure that the families of the deceased receive total compensation.” Meanwhile Shiv Sena, which heads MVA, has demanded a criminal action against ONGC, which comes under the Centre. In an editorial in party mouthpiece Saamana on Saturday, the party said that the deaths were “culpable homicide” as ONGC did not take the cyclone warnings seriously. “The cyclone warning was given well in advance, but ONGC ignored it and didn’t recall the personnel working on the barge. Forty-nine bodies have been found and 26 are still missing [the toll later surged to 66 and nine are said to be missing]. Had the Indian Navy and the Coast Guard not launched the search and rescue operations, around 700 people would have drowned. They were conducting oil rigging for ONGC, and hence, it was the government-owned firm’s duty to protect their lives,” it stated.Sena’s Member of Parliament (MP) and Saamana’s executive editor Sanjay Raut, said, “A culpable homicide case must be filed against the CMD (chairman and managing director) and directors of ONGC for whom the personnel of the private contractor were working. Why did ONGC not take any action to bring them to the shore? Their negligence has led to the deaths of 60 people,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/barge-tragedy-mva-wants-union-min-to-go-bjp-calls-for-action-against-pvt-firm-101621713240411.html

Earlier, the quota for daily distribution of oxygen was fixed due to its acute shortage. Officials said now sufficient oxygen cylinders were available to cater to the hospitals’ requirement, so the quota system had been suspended.Yashpal Garg, nodal officer for oxygen supply, said hospitals must ensure judicious and optimum utilisation of the oxygen procured, and also submit details of its usage every day.High rates by refiller to be probed A Punjab Civil Services officer, Jagjit Singh, has been tasked with probing the allegedly high rates charged by the authorised oxygen supplier catering to private hospitals.“Though the re-filling charges for D-type cylinders are fixed at ₹295 with 12% GST, M/S Super Agencies took between ₹600 and ₹800.

On Saturday, the final day of the drive-through vaccination, four teams vaccinated at least 2,900 people between 9am and 7:30pm. So far, 1,98,453 persons have been vaccinated in the district. Earlier, the drive-through vaccination was only to take place for two hours each in the morning and evening. However, when a large number of people turned up the drive continued until late in the evening without a break. Sanjay Sagar, a Sector 11 resident, who had brought his 19-year-old daughter to get the jab, said, “Their infrastructure was good and the staff was excellent. It hardly took a couple of minutes to get the jab and enter the details. A long queue of vehicles had formed to get the jab,” he said.Priya Kapoor Malik, a teacher from Pinjore said, “The staff as well as the police were very polite and efficient. They were working without break. Even the Red Cross was serving packed food to those waiting on the roads.”However, those on two-wheelers or on foot were not allowed to get the jab. Dr Meenu Sasan, immunisation officer said: “We could not give vaccines to those on two-wheelers, because they would have had to wait for the vaccine. Where would they have waited? The drive was in an open area.”  “People even from far-off places such as Shimla and Baddi had come for inoculation, while many were from Chandigarh and Mohali,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/5000-turn-up-for-two-day-drive-through-vax-camp-in-panchkula-101621713120762.html

The framing of charges is being delayed as some of the accused are insisting for their physical presence before the trial court to respond to the allegations to be framed against them. However, the Maharashtra government has issued an order prohibiting the physical production of those on death row in other terror-related cases. On July 13, 2011, a series of blasts took place at Zaveri Bazaar, Opera House and Dadar between 6.52pm and 7.05pm. Mumbai Police had arrested 11 accused and said they belonged to an outfit named Indian Mujahideen. In 2017, special public prosecutor Ujwal Nikam had moved a plea for issuance of production warrant against the accused for a speedy trial in the case. Most of the accused had been lodged in Taloja jail, Tihar jail and Hyderabad jail for various offences. Hence, the prosecution sought for their production. Two years later on March 29, 2019, the special MCOCA (Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act) court passed an order to frame the charges against the 11 arrested accused, a crucial step to pave a way to begin the trial. However, till date, the court has been able to frame charges against only a few accused as the rest have been insisting on physical appearance before the court. The prosecution has expressed its inability to produce all the accused before the court as few of them are facing capital punishment in the Hyderabad blasts case. One of the accused, Ajaz Shaikh, who is facing a death sentence in connection with the Hyderabad twin blasts case, had approached the court for his physical production for framing of charges and also to meet his lawyer for further aid. The prosecution as well as the prison authorities informed the court that the state government passed a general order for the non-removal of present applicant from prison as he has been facing a death sentence passed in another case. Considering this, the court rejected Shaikh’s application, observing, “Frequent directions have been issued earlier for proceeding expeditiously into the matter. The various other accused persons are however, not cooperating for framing of the charge on the similar ground as that of the present applicant raised, for insisting their physical presence before the court.” The court in its order has hence said, “The accused persons concerned must cooperate to proceed further expeditiously, otherwise the appropriate procedure will be adopted in furthering the proceeding.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/trial-in-13-7-mumbai-blasts-likely-to-be-delayed-further-101621713059292.html

Dayalan said it was alleged that remdesivir injections, which are being provided to private hospitals at controlled rates by the state government for treatment of Covid patients, were taken wrongfully by the hospital with no corresponding record of the patients concerned.Police too verifying allegations As the three directors of the hospital and chief finance officer have lodged counter complaints against each other over illegal procurement of the drug, police are investigating the allegations.In their complaint, hospital directors Deepak Tyagi, Virender Dhankhad and Dr Manoj Sharma have stated that chief finance officer Mukesh Sharma was found illegally procuring remdesivir injections and selling them at a premium to the patients outside the hospital with the help of his son.While contrary to these claims, Mukesh alleged in his a counter police complaint that the directors fabricated documents pertaining to the drug.The police are verifying the complaints and have recorded the statements of employees of the hospital.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/mohalis-mayo-hospital-issued-show-cause-notice-over-remdesivir-misuse-101621712999739.html

The study conducted in 25 cities across India has concluded that only 14% of people wear masks correctly.Dr Tatyarao Lahane, director, Directorate of Medical Education and Research (DMER), said citizens need to adopt Covid-appropriate behaviour at least till the end of the year. “Maharashtra has shown a remarkable progress in bringing down the cases. Even in the 15 districts currently showing high number of cases, we should remember that the surge started late and will soon decline in the coming days. However, we cannot afford to let our guard down,” said Dr Lahane.He has credited the lockdown for the decrease in cases and said that the lockdown was imposed as a last resort on April 22 as 67,013 cases were detected on that day and citizens were not adhering to Covid-19 guidelines. “There will be no need for any lockdown if people follow simple rules such as wearing masks properly, sanitising their hands regularly and maintaining social distance,” said Dr Lahane.This view was endorsed by Dr Ameet Mandot, director, Gut Clinic, who emphasised on the need for self-discipline among people. “Citizens should not repeat the mistakes that they had made last year after the restrictions were eased, like indulging in social gathering, holding mammoth religious and wedding functions and roaming unnecessarily,” said Dr Mandot. “If people don’t wear masks and indulge in casual behaviour, all the gains achieved till now will be lost, and we will face a more severe third wave,” warned Dr Mandot.Maharashtra’s Covid-19 tally has reached 5,553,225 and the toll is at 87,300 after 682 Covid-19 deaths were reported in the state on Saturday. The highest deaths – 14,516 – were reported in Mumbai, followed by Pune (11,068).Currently, there are 352,247 active cases in the state, of which the highest –54,198 – are in Pune, followed by Mumbai with 28,232 patients.The state also conducted 281,585 tests. Amravati and Nashik have eased the lockdown restrictions owing to a decline in cases. In Washim, traffic police personnel Manisha Chouke, who is seven-months pregnant, was seen managing the traffic and urging citizens to adhere to Covid-19 restrictions. In Dhule, Washim and Nanded, the police nabbed those roaming or driving without a valid reason and conducted their Covid-19 antigen tests. At Dombivli, a 100-year-old senior citizen was discharged from hospital after he successfully triumphed over the virus.To prevent the Covid-19 outbreak among infants and children, Maharashtra’s paediatric taskforce will guide the doctors in an online meeting scheduled on Sunday between 12pm and 2pm in the presence of chief minister Uddhav Thackeray.Meanwhile, despite the decline in the Covid-19 cases, the state is facing a new challenge as the number of patients suffering from mucormycosis (black fungus) is increasing rapidly.The state seems to be reeling under a shortage of Amphotericin B injections, used in the treatment of mucormycosis, as relatives of patients have been frantically searching for the drug. State energy minister Nitin Raut has blamed the Central government for lack of adequate supply of the drug.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/dont-let-down-guard-despite-decline-in-covid-19-cases-say-maharashtra-s-doctors-101621712939240.html

Civil surgeon Adarshpal Kaur said the headquarters had been able to provide the doses required for the three patients still recuperating here.‘Will get 2,000 vials from pvt supplier’UT health secretary Arun Gupta said the administration was trying to procure the drug on the lines of Punjab and will be placing an order for 2,000 vials from a private supplier as the supply from the Centre will not be enough.“As soon as we have the stocks, we will set up a centralised distribution system for hospitals,” he added.“Liposomal Amphotericin-B is administered daily as per the patient’s weight. For instance, the daily dose will be 350mg for a patient weighing 70kg, which can be roughly fulfilled with five vials for three weeks,” said Dr Arunaloke Chakrabarti, professor and head of department of medical microbiology, PGIMER.According to hospital director Dr Jagat Ram, among the 35 black fungus patients at the institute, 24 were Covid positive and 11 were non-Covid.“A lot of these patients are Covid positive and diabetic, with compromised immunity. Such patients are victims of indiscriminate use of steroids and hence, develop mucormycosis even after discharge. There is a need to monitor the sugar level of patients receiving steroids during Covid treatment, which will help stem the formation of fungus,” Dr Ram added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/shortage-of-drug-to-treat-black-fungus-adds-to-chandigarh-hospitals-pains-101621712339786.html

Visuals shared by Maurya showed a handful of guests at the wedding, all wearing face masks even as BJP leaders vied to congratulate Maurya for following the Covid protocol in letter and spirit. BJP leaders said though up to 25 people were permitted in weddings by the state government, Maurya’s son’s marriage was attended by only 21 close relatives. “Following the Covid protocol, marriage of my son Yogesh Kumar Maurya with Anjali Maurya was solemnised. I expect your wishes and blessings as I could not receive them directly,” Maurya said tweeting photos of his son’s marriage. Anjali hails from Rae Bareli. “A top minister led by example. Such gestures would help in conveying the message of holding marriages with limited people to break the chain of Covid-19 infection,” UP BJP spokesman Navin Srivastava said. On May 18, the UP government had restricted the number of guests in marriage functions to 25 after revising its previous order in which 50 people in closed halls and 100 people in open spaces like lawns were permitted.

23-05-2021||Chandigarh||Covid warriors: The real superheroes sans capes||Relentlessly attending to a steady stream of patients, running from bed to bed, going without food and water for over six hours at a stretch while sweating profusely under a heavy PPE kit such is the punishing daily routine of our medics in these drastic Covid times.Sadly, only a few privileged hospitals that can afford to give their staff PPE kits, which has exacted a toll on our heroic medical professionals, many of whom have succumbed to the deadly disease. I am the proud mother of a Covid warrior, a budding doctor, whom I have not hugged in weeks. Every day she is in close proximity with death, trying to save the lives of Covid patients. We only speak on the phone when she returns home after strenuous hours. She has isolated herself from the entire family so that we do not contract the deadly virus.No, not all heroes wear capes, some wear scrubs, PPE kits, surgical gloves, stethoscopes and still don’t live to see another week! Despite all precautions, the sanitisers, the triple masks, and the PPE kits many medical professionals have themselves succumbed to the infection while treating their patients. Ironically, sometimes the patients survive but their medics do not. But, they just don’t give up, you know! The deep sense of morality, responsibility and duty takes over. There is nothing like ‘social distancing’ between a doctor and a patient in a Covid ward. They simply keep trying their best to save the hapless patient lying there gasping for breath, whose vitals are fluctuating, who is unable to reach out to his family, who fears death and who is dying to be given a second chance to live life just once more. The angels in white coats — nurse or doctor —are their only hope.Coming from a family of army veterans where her grandfather and father have fought for India, my daughter was not one to sit at home, though many told her to make up some excuse to skip the call of duty and protect her family. For her, nation and duty came first!Like most of her colleagues and seniors, she has to keep her emotions aside while dealing with Covid patients and their families. If they know a patient is at the threshold of death, doctors begin preparing the family, which is already devastated trying to arrange for funds for their loved one’s treatment. Further, the aggrieved family cannot give the departed soul the funeral they deserve as they cannot see or touch the infected body. Often the doctor is brutally blamed for the death but once again our medics are trained to understand the emotions of the common man amid grief. But do you understand a doctor’s life during Covid times ?The deadly virus has not only gripped the body and mind of each patient in the ICU ward, but it also takes its toll on the emotional health of each medical personnel. Yet, they have to keep sane and return home to their families and behave ‘normal’. Not to forget, they are almost treated as ‘untouchables’ even though they are not Covid positive ! Though the PPE kit drops off at the hospital premises, the sense of duty does not, as they wash their clothes separately, sweep their rooms on their own and food is served in different utensils at a safe distance. Just like prisoners served food separately in jail! The support of an entire worried family is behind each Covid warrior who is trying to save your life, please don’t forget that! So, please be responsible citizens and get yourself vaccinated at the earliest and do not land up in Covid wards, so our doctors and their families can take a breather!No, they don’t feel scared for themselves, as they know they may have already acquired the virus being in the hospital 24x7, but they are scared for their families’ safety! Can you imagine the inner conflict these doctors undergo? To save helpless patients they don’t know in an ICU ward and then return home, tired, in an isolated room and unable to meet their own family just to protect them? Who do they choose? Or should they choose anyone at all? They just continue doing their duties with empathy and compassion.As a mother who is worried all the time but proud all the same, I stood by my daughter when duty called, turning a deaf ear to hearsay! Because I read a line somewhere which said, “Virus is everywhere, but so is Waheguru”. Ultimately, she and each Covid warrior fighting out there are in His hands too.(The writer is a Panchkula-based author)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/covid-warriors-the-real-superheroes-sans-capes-101621711679607.html

Hence the process was being simplified to allow all hospitals willing to treat Covid patients to do so. She said such hospitals would not be notified but only their list would be made. At present, 59 hospitals in the private sector are listed for Covid treatment, while the total number of hospitals in the city is 691. In view of a possible third wave, it appeared significant to allow all interested hospitals to treat Covid patients, Jacob said in a press statement. Hospitals can apply via http://dgmhup-gov-in with documents such as registration certificate, Fire NoC and bio-medical waste management certificate.Hospitals which are not enrolled/notified as Covid hospitals have to apply while those already treating Covid patients do not need to follow any further process.A three-member pandemic public grievance committee has also been constituted. The members are Dr Samir Misra, senior faculty of trauma surgery department at the King George’s Medical University, Covid command centre in charge Prabhas Kumar and a special chief judicial magistrate. The committee can be approached by people who are not satisfied with treatment at any hospital or have been overcharged, as well as for any other Covid-related complaint.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/pvt-hospitals-keen-to-treat-covid-patients-may-apply-for-permission-101621711499742.html

The university had invited Samajwadi Party patriarch and the then defence minister Mulayam Singh Yadav as the chief guest. Former President APJ Abdul Kalam and former chief election commissioner TN Sheshan were awarded honorary DSc and LLD degrees respectively.“A call for the institution of medals and scholarships has been made and those interested in sponsoring them can do so. A three-member committee has been set up to scrutinise the proposals and the details will be available on the AU website soon,” said the PRO.In another important decision, the AU administration has announced that the tenure of the guest faculty, presently engaged in different departments, has been extended till July 15, 2021. The decision has been taken to facilitate the completion of the course of the classes whose exams are scheduled in July.The heads of the departments were also informed that from May 27, the offices will start reopening for administrative work with 50 per cent of staff coming for three days a week, on a rotation basis. “The process of cleaning and sanitisation of the offices and departments is being carried out.

23-05-2021||Chandigarh||Random forays: Ten ways to beat the blues||The monstrous reign of the pandemic continues for now, but hopefully not for much longer. At last, there appears to be waning of the curve, and this is thankfully also reflected in decreased numbers of SOS calls that one has been receiving. Yet, and heartbreakingly so, three good friends have succumbed to the disease in recent days.However, a motivational writer must gear up and buckle up at all times, so here goes. In a not-so-subtle departure from recent writings about philosophy and deep inspiration, it is time to list out a few concrete ways in which we can combat this contagion with superior solidity. These suggestions are primarily for those who are hale and hearty, but are struggling to cope with the barrage of sad news floating around. 1.Pray more: If you’re spending five minutes per day in prayer, please multiply that by at least six. Families that pray together will find powerful vibrations of peace, joy, strength and calmness, emanating from and into their environs. Let us not underestimate the power of collective prayer, a vibratory force which science has not yet understood, but which will definitely benefit humanity forever.2.Volunteering: A truly laudable way to keep yourself gainfully engaged is to volunteer with an NGO which is out to provide care and succour to the ill and needy. Even if you have to volunteer from home, there are numerous options to choose from. You can also lessen the impact of negative news by assuaging the feelings of the elderly and having long conversations with them.3.Sing together:Group singing, and even solo humming in the shower, will elevate the mood as well as increase happy hormones within you. Singing has a demonstrated and proven effect on improving mental as well as physical health. I’m no expert on this, but am sure that singing is good for your lungs too.4.Outdoor exercise: Even if there is little or no space available outdoors, due to the lockdown, breathe in some fresh air whenever you can. Indulge in some brisk walking or even jogging on the spot if necessary. Get those lungs exercised and your bodily cells jumping about boisterously. 5.Play games: With the family in the living room, with friends online, with yourself (quizzes, puzzles et al) and be competitive. Antakshari or dumb charades are terrific family games. Online apps like Psyche and word games are also sure shot entertainers and build knowledge as well.6.Counsel younger people: The young are often left feeling anxious about their future and this pandemic has worsened their worries. There are many youngsters who might really benefit by a call from a well-meaning senior. Maybe someone who was your junior in college or a subordinate in a former office. 7.Read a lot: Pick up all those books which you had meant to read but could never get down to. Books are also stress busters and provide a soothing old-world balm to the hassled modern human being who spends a humongous amount of time with his smartphone.8.Get creative: Pick up a new hobby or skill. There are plenty of online classes to choose from. From culinary skills to belly dancing, from French classes to origami, you can learn a lot during the lockdown. Also start writing those articles, which you always wanted to write. Try out your photography skills with still life or portraits. Creativity is a proven stress buster.9.Start your own YouTube channel: Everyone loves speaking, or most people do. Get over that camera shyness and record yourself a few times. Ask your friends if your speech or singing was up to the mark. Once they give the go ahead, take the plunge and launch yourself on YouTube. You’ll be surprised to find that you’re much better than most people out there!10. Meditation and the search within: Those who’d always been meaning to start meditating ‘one day’ will do well to make a serious attempt during these uncertain times. The peace that comes from meditation has a calming effect upon us all day long. Learn some techniques and just go ahead!It is the inner conquests which matter, after all.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/random-forays-ten-ways-to-beat-the-blues-101621710900379.html
23-05-2021||Delhi||Covid-19 jabs for 18-44 age group to be shut from today: CM Kejriwal||Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Saturday appealed to the central government to increase the Capital’s allocation of vaccines against the coronavirus disease, saying that the city was running out of stocks and that inoculations of younger adults in the 18-44 age group were to grind to a halt at government-run centres by Sunday.Delhi received 1.6 million doses of Covid-19 vaccines this month, and its allocation for June has been halved to around 800,000, the chief minister said, adding that at this rate, it will take the city 30 months – or two-and-a-half years – to inoculate its entire adult population of around 15 million adults.Kejriwal reiterated that Delhi needs around 8 million doses per month to vaccinate all adults in the next three months.“Delhi needs 80 lakh vaccine doses every month. In comparison to this, the central government allocated 16 lakh doses to Delhi in May. The same has been slashed to 8 lakh doses for next month (June). At this pace, it will take 30 months to vaccinate all adults in Delhi. Till then, no one knows how many waves and deaths due to Covid-19 will we have to see. We need 2.5 crore (25 million) more doses to vaccinate the rest of the adults in Delhi,” he said at an online press briefing.Kejriwal also said that on Saturday, most government-run vaccination centres will run out of doses to administer to those below the age of 45.Only 31 government-run vaccination centres for younger adults were functional on Saturday, compared to the around 200 that were open earlier this week. According to the government’s records, no fresh stocks are expected for the rest of this month.“Vaccines for the 18-44 age group have finished because of which centres for the youth are being closed from today. Few doses of the vaccine are left in some centres, but these also will get over by today evening. From tomorrow (Sunday), all centres for the youth will shut down. We have also written to the central government asking for more vaccines,” Kejriwal said.To be sure, centres by private hospitals are still open for inoculating younger adults through doses they acquired directly from vaccine makers. Senior officials of private hospitals -- Indraprastha Apollo, Max group and Sir Ganga Ram Hospital -- told HT on Saturday that they have sufficient stock for the below-45 category as of now. They did not give further details. Additionally, the Capital also has doses for people aged 45 and above.Hours after Kejriwal’s statement, the Bharatiya Janata Party on Saturday hit out at the Aam Aadmi Party leader for “indulging in politics” over the issue of vaccination and said the chief minister should stop making “excuses”.Union minister and BJP leader Prakash Javadekar said the Centre has provided millions of doses to Delhi so far and will continue to do so. “Delhi chief minister constantly does politics in the name of Delhi... Even during the time of oxygen (crisis), he kept saying ‘oxygen, oxygen’ and then later said Delhi has surplus oxygen. Kejriwal should stop making excuses,” Javadekar said in a statement.The minister was referring to the nearly three-week-long crisis starting April 22 that saw hospitals across the city make several distress calls as they ran low on medical oxygen needed to treat Covid-19 patients. Both the Centre and the Delhi government were criticised by courts on reacting late to the emergency, which claimed the lives of dozens of Covid-19 patients on oxygen support.Earlier this month, the central government said state governments are allowed to altogether procure 20 million doses directly from manufacturers this month to vaccinate younger adults in the 18-44 age group. Of this figure, the Centre has finalised a fixed quota for each state based on the population of younger adults, a move it says is meant to ensure equity in supplies.So far, about 26% (3,885,425) of the city’s adult population has received at least one dose, although the recipients are likely to include people from the neighbouring NCR towns of Noida, Ghaziabad, and Gurugram. Only 7.5% (1,132,154) is fully vaccinated with both the doses.Kejriwal on Saturday also said he wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi and suggested four ways for the Centre to increase vaccine supply at a time when the country’s inoculation drive is struggling to pick up pace despite the urgency necessitated by the deadly second wave of infections.Underscoring the need to inoculate entire populations to wrest control from the virus, Kejriwal said the Centre should direct companies in India within 24 hours to start manufacturing Covaxin, the vaccine developed by Bharat Biotech. The firm said earlier in May it is prepared to share details of its technology and production process with other manufacturers to boost supply.The Centre should also approve foreign-made vaccines within 24 hours, and negotiate with international vaccine makers instead of leaving it to the state governments to individually procure doses, he said.“The 36 states and union territories of India are fighting among themselves in front of the (foreign) companies. What image is this projecting of India? The government of India should buy vaccines from them and distribute it among the states,” he stressed.Under the existing norms, the Centre procures 50% of the vaccines produced, while the remaining 50% is to be purchased by the states and private hospitals. Several states, including Delhi and Maharashtra, have said they are reaching out to foreign companies to get additional stocks.The CM’s remaining suggestions included requesting countries that have additional vaccine doses to give them away, and permitting international vaccine makers to manufacture shots in India.“We are arranging beds, oxygen and medicines, but vaccine is the most effective weapon of protection against the fatal virus,” Kejriwal said.“This period (when the Covid-19 outbreak is receding) has to be utilised to give at least the first dose of the vaccine to as many people as possible. It looks like the number of doses available will go up from July... after that there is a need for aggressive vaccination. That is the only hope for preventing another surge,” said Dr Amit Singh, associate professor at Indian Institute of Science-Bengaluru.The Union government has said it is trying to help manufacturers increase production and that India will have obtained around 2 billion doses -- which will be sufficient to vaccinate most adults -- by the end of the year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/covid19-jabs-for-18-44-age-group-to-be-shut-from-today-cm-kejriwal-101621710228806.html

23-05-2021||Lucknow||Helping others during pandemic gives immense satisfaction to this BBAU student||Amid the ongoing second wave of pandemic when help comes in rare, a post graduate student of Babasaheb Bhimrao Ambedkar University, Lucknow, has been working tirelessly to assist others by being a bridge between the needy and corona relief workers. 22-year-old Lakshmi Yadav, a student of M Sc second semester of chemistry department, shares verified leads on social media platforms with those people who are in distress. Besides this, she also helps in arranging oxygen, beds, plasma, ventilators, Remedesvir and blood. The thought of helping others stemmed from her personal experience when some members of her family were down with Covid in this second wave of the pandemic. “At that time I had sought help through various social media sites and people came forward to help. I got inspiration from the kind gesture and decided to do the same,” said Yadav, a native of Rae Bareli district. In the beginning she started by sharing information on social media platforms, said Rachana Gangwar, PRO of the varsity adding that “Then she also made contact with those people who were providing medical supplies and assistance. By working as a bridge between the needy and corona relief workers she did a splendid job. She provided verified helpline numbers of these people through different social media apps.” Later, she joined an NGO where she worked with a larger group of people. Speaking about it Lakshmi said: “I joined the Corona support group where I worked with a team of about 150 people and helped hundreds of people.” She added, “It is not a work of few hours but a 24-hour responsibility. I only get 3 to 4 hours of sleep a day. But today the society needs us and helping people provides me immense satisfaction.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/helping-others-during-pandemic-gives-immense-satisfaction-to-this-bbau-student-101621710659019.html
23-05-2021||Chandigarh||15 illegal mining spots in Tarn Taran to be under CCTV surveillance||Tarn Taran police have identified 15 spots, which were being used for illegal sand mining for the past five years in the district, for installing closed-circuit television (CCTV) cameras to curb the practice.For keeping 24x7 surveillance, the CCTV cameras will be installed from the funds of the Saanjh Kendra, set up by the Punjab government to provide police-related services to the people. Besides, the police have also identified nearly two dozen routes near Beas and Sutlej rivers, which were being used for transportation of illegally excavated sand, to install special barricading.On Saturday, Tarn Taran senior superintendent of police (SSP) Dhruman H Nimbale along with other senior police officials visited the vulnerable pockets for finalising the mapping for the project. He also held meetings with the panchayats of those villages from which the illegal business had been going on for the past few years.“We have asked the panchayats to identify the suspected vehicles passing through their villages, so the accused involved in the illegal trade could be identified and arrested,” said the SSP. He said the station house officers concerned will remain in touch with the panchayats and the work for installing the CCTV cameras will begin soon.“From May last year to date, we have registered 59 cases, besides arresting 70 accused. We have also confiscated 39 trailers laden with sand, three earth-moving machines, five motorised carts, 15 tippers and a Mahindra Bolero. The amount of the impounded vehicles is pegged at ₹5.34 crore,” said the SSP.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/15-illegal-mining-spots-in-tarn-taran-to-be-under-cctv-surveillance-101621710542907.html
23-05-2021||Chandigarh||Roundabout: Dating death with a drizzle of poems||Amritsar boy Gul Chauhan, who chose to make Chandigarh his home, is one of a kind in the world of Punjabi littérateurs. He has carried the evergreen tree of his salad days through life, penning around 10 books of verse and prose in his own easy and unhurried manner. An old friend, he shares none of the ambitions and anxieties of writing with the purpose of winning first the languages department award, then the coveted Sahitya Akademi Award and with a little bit of luck the international Dhahan Prize for Punjabi Literature. Such minor concerns have never bothered him, for his has been a tryst with his own words and thoughts aiming to translate the noise around him into the music of an innocent song sung by a village schoolgirl in Government School, Khizrabad, off the Siswan Road: Tikka pawan sair nu janwa tedha cheer kadh ke, jeharhian moh-mohabbatan laayian o’ na jayio chhad ke (I’ll wear a gold ornament in the side-parting of my hair out on a walk, do not ever leave me forgetting the tender ties of love).Poet and the pandemicThere is much that one can share about the experience of knowing this character who goes about with a confused expression, living the literary vagrancy, awargi would be a better word, in the tradition of famed writers of yore such as Sarat Chandra of Bangla, Majaz and Manto of Urdu and our own poet of the city, Kumar Vikal, who wrote in Hindi. An outdoorsy person he would go chasing dreams in Sector 17 around 20 years ago without fail and post himself in one of the corridors and watch eagerly through the glasses perched on his snub nose beautiful women come and go. But what has been most noticeable in these times are his poems addressed to the harrowing experience of the second wave of Covid-19 written in his very free and conversational style, which has been his contribution to Punjabi poetry over the years. “When the first wave of the pandemic was announced with the banging of thalis and lighting of lamps preceding the lockdown, I dismissed it all like many other Punjabis as some new demon created by the State to puzzle the people and take away their attention from more pressing issues. But it was in the cruel second wave while the body politic was indulging in kumbh melas or trying to capture Bengal, the horror struck with friends, relatives, co-writers just withering away as the strange infection travelled up their nostrils.” Thus, these poems were penned, says Gul, with lurking fear that the virus could be climbing the stairs of his home any moment. “Well, the fear was genuine for in my journey of starting from poetry and then moving to prose for a long time, I had returned to poetry in the last five years and now this nuisance was here to put an end to the enchanting time I was having,” he adds, in all seriousness. Ode of loss and longingThe first anthology of Gul’s poems Hare Rang Di Kavita (The Book of Green Poems) came out in the first lockdown. An artist as well, he first posted the poems on Facebook accompanied with his own sketches. The book was still lying in the sanitised parcel as one read them sometimes one a day and sometimes six a day on the social networking site. It is beautiful poetry that was born out of everyday experiences and thoughts from cleaning his room to eating a watermelon. Then the recent change of mood made one tear the parcel and pull out the book just to remember that life was filled with green words not too long ago.And onto the recent ones, while one is still mourning the death of poet friend Mangalesh Dabral and then more names start adding up on the page of loss. Gul describes this despair in the face of deathy his own credulous way: ‘Kyon aini chheti chetti mar rahe ne log/ Hore gal hai akhbar de page te marna kise da/ Facebook di abhasi bheerh te dam torhda door da dooja koi…(Why are people passing away in such a hurry/It is another thing when someone dies on a newspaper page/Some some stranger calling it a day in the virtual crowd of the Facebook...). “It is quite another thing when a friend calls in a scared voice to briefly inform that so and so has died as what does one have to do with so and so. One takes a deep breath saying that let the whole country die with shortage of oxygen but let your one friend who is struggling to breathe live another day,” he says, in a sardonic monologue capturing the bitter truths of a time when death is a way of life. But there are moments when the poet looks away from the darkness to cheer his friends and readers saying: ‘Nahi darna nahi dost/Guzar jayega eh daur/ Beet jaayegi eh kaali raat barkha di/Kal charhega phir suraj apna/Agge ton vi chamakda damakda nawan!’ (Don’t be afraid my friend/This time too shall pass/The dark rainy night will end/The sun will come out again/Bright, shinier than before, anew).Talking to oneselfThe poet goes on talking to himself in the isolation of his room, sometimes wary of peeping out of the window lest some sad news travels in. All of us have done so in the lonely masked times over and again. These spontaneous outpourings by Gul catalogue the melancholy and ruthlessness of the times no bars held. And one weaves one’s way through the words trying to put some order in the disorderly mess. Yes, one would like to ask the poet: “Gul, what colour will you give to this book of poems?” And then one adds, “When all this ends will I find you in Sector 17 once more in the evenings humming the lines of your naive village girl student?”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/roundabout-dating-death-with-a-drizzle-of-poems-101621710541499.html
23-05-2021||Mumbai||I jumped holding hands of my cousins but lost them to the sea, recalls P305 tragedy survivor||Udaram Meghawal was visibly upset and infuriated when he started arguing with a guard at Sir JJ Hospital mortuary on Friday evening. “Show me the mark of cut on the shoulder and the lost finger,” he insisted when the guard and a policeman asked him to check if a body of a matching height and built was that of his elder son, Amararam, 40.The 65-year-old from a remote village in Pali district of Rajasthan was unable to cope with the news that he had lost both his sons — Amararam and Pappuram, 32 — in barge Papaa305 or P305 tragedy.However, the guard informed him that such marks will not be visible, as the body was swollen due to drowning. Meghawal reluctantly took three rounds of the mortuary and examined the body again and again, but did not identify the body as that of his elder son.“My world is devastated and I am feeling as if all my cognitive functions are dead,” said Meghawal. He said he was “afraid of facing his two daughters-in-law and their four children aged between three and 11 years”. What bothered him the most was this: “Now, who will provide for them, who will take care of them?”He left the hospital mortuary late on Friday evening with the body of Pappuram and performed last rites on Saturday afternoon at his hometown. Now, one of his nephews will visit the mortuary on Sunday to ascertain if any of new the bodies at the mortuary is that of Amararam.Both Amararam and Pappuram were working on P305 along with their cousin Mahendra Ranawat, 19. All three of them had jumped in the sea around 4pm on Monday (May 17) when water had entered the ill-fated accommodation barge and it was about to sink.Ranawat was rescued by INS Kochi, 16 hours later at 8am on Tuesday, while Pappuram’s body was recovered during search and rescue operation and Amararam is still missing.“Amararam and Pappuram were doing piping work on the barge when they took me on the ship as a helper, said Mahendra. The 19-year-old comes from a farming family and is one of the five siblings — two elder sisters and two younger brothers. After completing Class 12, he decided to work to help his father financially for his sister’s marriage. Pappuram brought him to Mumbai and after completing paperwork, they went on to the barge on November 4. His salary was being deposited in his father’s bank account to ensure maximum savings.Ranawat said that on May 15 all of them were informed about the incoming cyclone. On Sunday evening, wind speed started increasing and the gusty sound gave an indication of what lied ahead. The crew members were, however, not mentally prepared for what happened next. All eight anchor cables of the barge gave way by Monday morning, leaving the barge at the mercy of the stormy weather. The barge drifted and hit a platform; soon water started entering the barge from the damaged side and the vessel began tilting, said Ranawat, adding that by 2pm on Monday water level reached the deck and crew members started jumping in the choppy sea.Following suit, he and his two cousins jumped in the sea together so as to avoid drifting at 4pm, about an hour before the barge capsized. “However, as we jumped from the barge, water gushed in the wind pipe of Pappuram and he started gasping for breath,” said the 19-year-old. “We tried to help him stay above water level, but the high waves made it difficult and eventually Pappuram breathed his last around 6.30pm.”Ranawat and Amararam, however, continued to hold hands. “Both of us were crying and pleading for help,” said Ranawat who, around three hours later, realised that Amararam’s movement stopped. As wind speed increased further and waves roared higher, he got separated from his cousins and drifted away.Exhausted and famished due to the rough seas and lack of food since Sunday afternoon, he again saw Pappuram floating a few metres away from him. He tried to reach Pappuram, but couldn’t because of the high waves. Completely helpless and alone, the 19-year-old let the sea take him wherever it wished and floated with the help of the life-jacket.Around 8am on Tuesday, May 18, the naval ships engaged in search and rescue operation noticed Ranawat and rescued him. He was one of the 125 survivors brought to Mumbai by INS Kochi on May 19.“I had lost all my belongings. I remembered the mobile number of a cousin who lives in Pune. I called and informed him about the incident,” he said, with tears rolling down his eyes. The cousin then informed their family about the tragedy.Meghawal said he came to Mumbai by train after hearing about the incident and reached the city on May 21. He directly went to the Sir JJ Hospital with one of his nephews, Kishor Ranawat, and shortly identified the body of his younger son, Pappuram.“Nothing can be more burdensome and agonizing than the bereavement of one’s own children,” said Kishor, adding, “Now we have to bear the grief and sorrow of the death my brothers.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/i-jumped-holding-hands-of-my-cousins-but-lost-them-to-the-sea-recalls-p305-tragedy-survivor-101621708935714.html
23-05-2021||Chandigarh||Illicit liquor unit busted at Muktsar’s Badal village||The Punjab excise department has busted an illicit liquor racket at Badal village in Muktsar district with the arrest of its kingpin Manoj Sharma.It was the first major raid by the excise department in southern Punjab since April last year, when the authorities had launched Operation Red Rose against illicit manufacturing and trading of liquor.According to officials privy to the matter, the role of a politically influential person from the village — which is the native place of Shiromani Akali Dal president Sukhbir Badal and state finance minister Manpreet Badal — is under scrutiny.Joint excise commissioner Naresh Dubey, who oversaw the raid at the manufacturing unit on Friday, said the gang was supplying illicit liquor in southern Punjab.“The unit was operating from an orchard and it was under surveillance for over 10 days. Besides recovering more than 2,200 liters of extra neutral alcohol, our team also found a huge cache of holograms, packaging material of various premium liquor brands and packed cases ready for delivery,” he said.Two men, Pargat Singh and Jashan Singh, who were working at the unit were also held besides the kingpin. “Land records have been summoned. More arrests are likely,” said Dubey. Muktsar senior superintendent of police D Sudarvizhi said a case is being registered at the Lambi police station.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/illicit-liquor-unit-busted-at-muktsar-s-badal-village-101621708320712.html
23-05-2021||Patna||AIIMS-Patna doctor bats for increased surveillance, testing, vaccination||Dr Umesh Kumar Bhadani, head of the expert committee formed by the Patna High Court order and dean at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), Patna on Saturday said that there was a growing need for increased surveillance, testing, vaccination and more treatment, but the most important factor remained Covid-appropriate behaviour.“There is expected third wave 6-8 months after the end of the second wave, which may end in July 2021. It may be in pockets or localised areas, depending on the vaccinated population. The virus mutates and vulnerable people are likely to get infected. Therefore, it is important to reach out to maximum people, as infected persons without symptoms are more dangerous,” he said, while speaking at a meeting on Covid-19, organised and moderated by senior advocate and former additional solicitor general SD Sanjay.Bhadani said that during the first wave, all were equally vulnerable, but aged people got sicker and so they were vaccinated first. “In the second wave, the virus has mutated, but those vaccinated are less vulnerable. The young people move more for livelihood and so got more infected. The third wave is anticipated to affect the younger population more, which are not vaccinated and move more. As per data, when 86% of people develop immunity, it is called the stage of herd immunity,” he added.The AIIMS doctor said that there was a need for massive information and awareness campaign for basic hygiene and social protection, as also preventing large gatherings. “Vaccination has to be in. creased, but it takes time. The Gram Panchayats should play an active role and empowered with proper awareness and action plan. The resources should now be directed to the grassroots level and there should be mobile vans for testing and vaccination. There should be centralized and state-level experts group,” he added.Bihar health minister Mangal Pandey said that the state government and the Centre were working together to control the pandemic and the results were showing, with the positivity rate dropping from 16% around 25 days ago to just 4% today, resulting in a large number of beds in Covid care centres and dedicated Covid hospitals unoccupied. He said the pace of vaccination would also pick up in June and improve further in mid-July.“With less than 50,000 active cases, Bihar is ranked 16th in the country. Although Bihar received just 16 mt of liquid medical oxygen (LMO) per day before the pandemic, it reached up to 210 mt to meet the growing demand. There was no shortage of oxygen or important drugs. Around 50,000 vials of Remdesivir are still stocked in districts. There is ample stock of Amphotericin,” he added.Pandey said that it was unfortunate that some ventilators, which were not functional in some districts due to shortage of anaesthetists and technical staff, were being highlighted in media, but the fact that over 1500 ventilators are functional saving lives. “We did appoint anaesthetists, but we did not get as many as we required,” he said, taking a dig at the leader of Opposition Tejashwi Prasad Yadav for offering to open a Covid care centre in his government home without understanding that some basic standards have to meet for opening any such facility.BJP state president Dr Sanjay Jaiswal said it was quite disappointing that, as per a recent survey, barely 60% of people use masks in towns, out of which 20% wear it on the chin. “One can well imagine the situation in rural areas,” he said, adding that when the states were getting 42% of the divisible tax pool of the centre, they should also come forward to take the responsibility of vaccinating people below 45 years.He said that over 50-lakh vaccines had been damaged by the states when every vaccine was important. The Centre is doing everything to augment supply. Covaxin license has been given to five companies. When Centre will complete free vaccination of above 45 years, it will also take the load off states,” he added..||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/aiimspatna-doc-bats-for-increased-surveillance-testing-vaccination-101621703218940.html
23-05-2021||Pune||Curtain Call: How songs saved “blackouts” of a play||Last week, I wrote about my experience and approach towards adapting the short story “Cycle”, written by eminent Marathi writer Vyankatesh Madgulkar. The takeaway from that experience was that it was important to create the world in which the characters from the story would be set it. And while the original story definitely sets up a world for the reader, it does need more visual elements while making it into a play. I guess that is why this process is termed as “adapting”. This experience helped when I adapted another story into a play. The next story that a friend and I adapted into a play was titled “Dalan” (The Grind) written by another well-known writer DM Mirasdar. Mirasdar is famous for creating characters with funny traits and throwing them in hilarious situations. “Dalan” is no exception! The protagonist in the story – a schoolteacher – has this unique ability to guess correctly whether the mother of a student will be a looker or not. Based on this, he makes up some excuse regarding the academics of a particularly sweet-looking kid so that his mother will come and meet him. When she does and he realises that he is right (yet again!) he tries his best to get invited to her house when her husband is out of town. After many days of playing the waiting game, he gets an invitation, and his happiness knows no bounds! At night, when the village has gone to sleep, he visits her. After a few awkward moments when he is about to make a move, someone knocks on the door! Not knowing what to do and where to hide, the woman urges the schoolteacher to quickly drape a saree and to start grinding wheat in the hand mill stone. The visitor is an old woman staying next door and has come to have a chat to pass her time. The chat goes on till dawn and the teacher is successful in only one thing – grinding one whole gunny bag of wheat into fine flour! Like “Cycle”, the structure of the play fell in place very quickly (or so I thought). We concentrated on dialogues more. There were some really funny lines in the original story and they helped set the tone to come up with more dialogues. The challenge was to make it seamless. Improvising with actors helped a lot too in this exercise. We were cruising along smoothly and were ready with it nearly a week before our actual performance. It was the day of our first grand rehearsal and everybody was very excited. We had also invited a few of our friends over to receive some quality feedback. One thing that I noticed was that they were laughing during the scene and once the next scene started, it took some time for them to start laughing again. We had four scenes in the play of nearly eight to nine minutes each. Once the run-through was over, the friends gave the exact feedback that I had noticed. They were enjoying the individual scenes, but the overall play lacked pace. After a “big” team meeting, in which we discussed various solutions to address this issue, I decided to go back to the drawing board – the script and the original story. I read the story and I enjoyed it yet again. Then I read the script and I found that I was enjoying reading that too. So, where was the problem? The next day at rehearsal, I watched the play again and then it dawned on me. There was a blackout between every two scenes, of nearly half a minute each. And I felt that after those thirty seconds of inactivity, getting back into the groove was taking time. We were playing some interesting recorded tracks during the blackout, but somehow those four blackouts were dragging the pace. It was my good fortune that one of the team-members was a good poet and another a good musician. I asked them if they could come up with original songs for the situations. They were more than happy to take up the challenge. Our actors weren’t trained singers, but they were excited to sing too! The new songs were fun and very easy to sing! It just changed the fabric of the play. Because of these songs we were able to do away with the blackouts! All our set changes took place in full stage light, in front of the audience. What’s more, our actors changed the set while singing so it didn’t even feel like a set change. It just fit in organically! There was just one costume change for the lead actor, when he finally visits the woman. But even that became a fun visual with him singing and changing on stage. It successfully showed his happiness and excitement without explicitly saying so! The play opened and received a lot of love. It has been nearly 14 years to the first show, but we still perform it whenever we get a chance to get the dates of the 27 team members! Nipun Dharmadhikari is a storyteller and looks forward to telling them on stage, in front of the camera or in person||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/how-songs-saved-blackouts-of-a-play-101621701058224.html

The complex has played a major role in sparking hostilities with the Hamas in Gaza and violence across Israel.Al Jazeera reported that dozens of Jewish, backed by heavily armed Israeli special forces, stormed the Al-Aqsa Mosque compound in occupied East Jerusalem in the early morning, hours after Palestinian worshippers were beaten and assaulted by Israeli police, according to the Islamic authority overseeing the site.Citing witnesses, Palestinian news agency WAFA said Israeli police had earlier on Sunday assaulted Palestinian worshippers who were performing dawn prayers at the mosque and assaulting them.WAFA added that at least six Palestinians had been arrested.The Temple Mount is the holiest place in Judaism, as the site of the biblical Temples. It is also a site of the third-holiest shrine in Islam, the Al-Aqsa Mosque.Jews have been barred from visiting the Temple Mount since May 3, when authorities made the decision to shutter the compound to non-Muslims amid spiraling tensions in the city, reported Israel Times.The fighting between Israel and Hamas began on May 10, after Gaza militants fired barrages of rockets at Israel in protest to the Israeli measures in East Jerusalem.A tit-for-tat trade of fire broke out, where Israeli fighter jets carried out hundreds of airstrikes on the Gaza Strip. Israel said that it targeted the infrastructure of Hamas and other militant groups in the enclave.On Friday, an Egypt-brokered ceasefire was reached between the two sides.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/jerusalems-temple-mount-complex-opened-for-jews-for-first-time-in-20-days-101621791322591.html
23-05-2021||World||Indian peacekeepers help civilians evacuate after volcano erupts in Congo||The Indian Army played a crucial role in the evacuation of civilians and United Nations personnel from North Kivu’s capital Goma after a volcano erupted in the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo on Saturday, officials familiar with the development said on Sunday. The Indian Army’s brigade involved in peacekeeping operations in the African country is headquartered in Goma, and it accounts for the largest deployment of Indian forces on foreign soil alongside South Sudan. “The Indian brigade HQs held its ground and in a calculated and calm manner, thinned out 70% of the strength of the camp and sent them to the Himbi company operating base (COB) for safety. A minimum strength continued to hold onto the camp ensuring no threat to UN and national assets as also providing security to empty aviation base and aviation fuel stored there,” said one of the officials cited above. Chief of defence staff General Bipin Rawat commanded the Indian brigade in 2008-09 when he was a brigadier. There are more than 2,300 Indian troops with the UN’s costliest peacekeeping mission in the Congo, a sprawling (the size of western Europe), dangerous and notoriously unstable country formerly known as Zaire. It was here that heavyweight boxing champion Muhammed Ali knocked out George Foreman 46 years ago in a world-famous bout called “Rumble in the Jungle”. Sandwiched between Nyiragongo volcano and the exploding Lake Kivu, Indian soldiers are operating in the Congo under a 15-minute evacuation plan. The Indian brigade is located next to the Goma airfield, which plays an important role in providing logistics support to UN peacekeepers deployed in eastern Congo. Mount Nyiragongo, located near Goma, erupted on Saturday night causing panic among the local communities. “Most of the lava, however, has flowed towards Rwanda and only a small stream is trickling towards Goma. As a precautionary measure, various country contingents were told to be on alert by the UN’s internal security system that calculated that evacuation will not be required. However, a majority of the country contingents including aviation contingents evacuated immediately,” the official said. The army also established an observation point that gave real-time updates of the lava flow to the brigade HQs, enabling it to relay correct information to the UN and creating a semblance of orderliness in the civilian evacuation, he added. Lava flow has slowed down considerably. “Lava flow at this stage is unlikely to reach Goma town unless there is fresh eruption through fissures. Intermittent earthquakes of very low intensity are being currently experienced.” India has a long history of deploying troops in the Congo: the first Indian blue berets (the colour used on UN duty) served from 1960 to 1965. It is the only UN mission where an Indian soldier — Captain G.S. Salaria — was awarded the Param Vir Chakra. He died in 1961, trying to save the Katanga province from falling to rebels.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/indian-peacekeepers-help-civilians-evacuate-after-volcano-erupts-in-congo-101621788604126.html

Pratasevich is a co-founder of the Telegram messaging app’s Nexta channel, which Belarus last year declared as extremist after it was used to help organize major protests against Lukashenko.Pratasevich, who had fled the country for Poland, faces charges that could carry a prison sentence of up to 15 years.The presidential press service said the bomb threat was received while the plane was over Belarusian territory. Officials later said no explosives were found on board. Flight-tracker sites indicate the plane was about 10 kilometers (six) miles from the Lithuanian border when it changed course.There was no immediate comment from Ryanair.Exiled opposition leader Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya called on the International Civil Aviation Organization to begin an investigation.“It is absolutely obvious that this is an operation by the special services to hijack an aircraft in order to detain activist and blogger Raman Pratasevich,” she said in a statement. “Not a single person who flies over Belarus can be sure of his safety.”Months of protests arose after last August's presidential election that official results say gave Lukashenko a sixth term in office.Police cracked down on the protests harshly, detaining around 30,000 people and beating many of them.Although protests died down during the winter, Belarus has continued to take actions against the opposition and independent news media. Last week, 11 staff members of the TUT.by news website were detained by police.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/belarus-opposition-figure-detained-after-ryanair-flight-diverted-to-minsk-101621787796482.html
23-05-2021||World||France concerned about 'risk of apartheid' in Israel||French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian warned on Sunday of the risk of "long-lasting apartheid" in Israel in the event the Palestinians fail to obtain their own state.Le Drian is one of the first senior French officials to use the term "apartheid" in reference to Israel, which has angrily denied any policy of racial discrimination.The veteran politician made the remarks in an interview with RTL radio and Le Figaro newspaper in reference to the clashes between Jews and Arabs that erupted in several Israeli cities during the latest conflict.The violence, which revealed simmering anger among Israeli Arabs over the crackdown on Palestinians in Jerusalem, shattered years of peaceful coexistence within Israel."It's the first time and it clearly shows that if in the future we had a solution other than the two-state solution, we would have the ingredients of long-lasting apartheid," Le Drian said, using the word for the white supremacist oppression of blacks in South Africa from 1948 to 1991.Le Drian said the "risk of apartheid is high" if Israel continued to act "according to a single-state logic" but also if it maintained the status quo."Even the status quo produces that," he said.He added that the 11-day conflict between Hamas and Israel had shown the need to revive the moribund Middle East peace process."We have take one step at a time," he said, expressing satisfaction that US President Joe Biden had reiterated support for creating a Palestinian state alongside Israel.Israel's latest offensive against Hamas killed 248 people in the Gaza Strip, including 66 children, and wounded over 1,900, the Hamas-run health ministry said.Meanwhile, rockets fired by Palestinian armed groups into Israel killed 12 and wounded around 357 others, Israeli police said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/france-concerned-about-risk-of-apartheid-in-israel-101621786065488.html
23-05-2021||World||Gaza bookshop owner's dreams buried under the rubble||For decades, it was the place to go for books in the blockaded Gaza Strip, from school texts to the Koran to Arabic translations of European literary classics.But last Tuesday, owner Samir al-Mansour watched in disbelief as the bookshop and publishing house he had poured his life into went up in smoke."Forty years of my life were obliterated in less than a second," said the man in his 50s, a cigarette between his fingers, staring at a mound of concrete, paper and squashed plastic chairs."There are 100,000 books under this rubble," he said.At around 5:00 am on Tuesday, Mansour was at home watching television when the channel reported the Israeli air force was about to hit the building housing his bookshop.Mansour rushed over, but came to a dead stop some 200 metres (220 yards) away from the building, just in time to see a missile obliterate his life's work.The latest deadly clashes lasted 11 days and saw Israel launch air strikes in response to a rocket barrage by Hamas, which rules Gaza, and other Islamist groups."I have nothing to do with an armed group, a political faction," Mansour told AFP."It's an attack on culture."- 'Never happened before' -Mansour started working in his father's bookshop in the 1980s, when he was just 14 years old, then took over in 2000 and soon branched out into publishing.As rescue workers continue to look for bodies and survivors in the rubble after the military conflict, Mansour was mourning all that he has lost.Buried in the rubble were copies of Islamic religious texts, children's picture books and a copy of Fyodor Dostoevsky's "The Brothers Karamazov".Israeli strikes on Gaza since May 10 have killed 248 Palestinians, including 66 children, and have wounded over 1,900 people, the Gaza health ministry says.Rockets and other fire from Gaza have claimed 12 lives in Israel, including one child and an Arab-Israeli teenager, an Israeli soldier, one Indian, and two Thai nationals, medics say. Some 357 people in Israel have been wounded.There is controversy about how many of those killed in Gaza were combatants, and how many were civilians.Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel's bombing campaign had killed "more than 200 terrorists" in Gaza.Mansour said he had lived through two Palestinian uprisings and three Gaza wars."But this had never happened, my bookshop was never destroyed," he said.His son-in-law Montasser Saleh had arrived in Gaza from Norway to visit the family just before the conflict started, and was with him when his life was turned upside down."We were at home, watching television," Saleh said.- 'More than a bookshop' -He recounted how on the TV channel Al Jazeera "they said there had been a warning shot on the building containing the bookshop".He too said they immediately rushed over to the building."Samir wanted to go and grab some papers, his computer, but he was too scared to go in and be hit by a missile, so we stayed outside," he said.Mosaab Abu Toha, a poet and the founder of the Edward Said library started after the Gaza war in 2014, said the Gaza Strip had lost "one of its main cultural resources"."Mansour was more than a bookshop," he said. "It was a publishing house publishing Gaza writers."The books were printed in Egypt -- some to come back to Gaza, but others to stay there and be circulated around the Arab world."It was a way to lift the siege on Gaza through literature," he said of the blockade on the Palestinian territory in place since 2007.For Gaza readers, the publishing house had printed around 1,000 copies of the works of local authors such as Ghareeb Askalani or Yusri al-Ghoul.Mansour is not the only book or stationery shop destroyed in the latest Israeli bombing campaign.Nearby Iqraa was also levelled, and the Al-Nahda stationery and bookshop was reduced to a pile of pulverised cinderblocks.In front of what remains of Al-Nahda, a poster assured loyal customers it would re-open soon."Ideas do not die," it read.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/gaza-bookshop-owner-s-dreams-buried-under-the-rubble-101621783127556.html

23-05-2021||World||USCIS should approve H-1B visas for 6 years, suggests Cato Institute's David Bier||The United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) recently revoked a memo, issued during the Donald Trump administration, to ensure smoother H-1B visa extension. The Trump-era memo required immigration officers to treat each visa extension request as a new application. This caused an increase in additional documentation which subsequently increased administrative burden and costs for sponsoring employers.The latest policy guidance instructs officers to defer to previous approvals while extending work visas such as H-1B. However, the officers may not defer to a prior approval when there is a material error, material change, or new material facts that adversely impacts the petitioner’s, applicant’s, or beneficiary’s eligibility. While the new memo came as a huge relief for foreign workers with temporary work visas, David J. Bier, a research fellow at the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank headquartered in Washington, D.C., believes much more can be done to further improve the US immigration system.Even though the Immigration Act of 1990 has authorised H-1B visa holders to receive status for up to six years, the department of labor (DOL) and the USCIS regulations limit labor condition applications (LCAs) and petition approvals to no more than 3 years. Last year, H-1B workers and employers had to file more than 320,000 extension requests.Also Read | Biden administration removes Trump-era H-1B rule vacated by courtIn response to invitations to the public for comments on improvements to the legal immigration system, Bier said that filing for an extension after 3 years is an “unnecessary and expensive burden.” Bier argued that employers and workers suffer unjust costs and potential delays in the visa extension process and the agencies are burdened with additional reviews of materials that they have already reviewed and approved.“USCIS should replace the 3-year limit on initial H-1B petition approvals with a 6-year limit, and DOL should revert to its earlier regulation allowing a 6-year approval of LCAs,” he wrote.Due to the recent policy guidance update, Bier suggests that there is no longer any basis for defining “coming temporarily” to mean less than six years now that Congress has explicitly stated otherwise. In the fiscal year ending September 2020, more than 3.19 lakh H1-B visas were issued to those born in India, according to an annual report on characteristics of H-1B speciality occupation workers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uscis-should-approve-h-1b-visas-for-6-years-cato-institute-s-david-bier-101621775067154.html
23-05-2021||World||IAEA may no longer get nuclear sites images: Iran||Iran’s parliament speaker said Sunday that international inspectors may no longer access surveillance images of the Islamic Republic’s nuclear sites, escalating tensions amid diplomatic efforts in Vienna to save Tehran's atomic accord with world powers.The comments by Iran’s parliament speaker Mohammad Bagher Qalibaf, aired by state TV, further underscored the narrowing window for the U.S. and others to reach terms with Iran. The Islamic Republic is already enriching and stockpiling uranium at levels far beyond those allowed by its 2015 nuclear deal.“Regarding this, and based on the expiration of the three-month deadline, definitely the International Atomic Energy Agency will not have the right to access images from May 22,” Qalibaf said. May 22 was Saturday.Hours later, however, a website called Nournews that's believed to be close to Iran's Supreme National Security Council quoted an anonymous official suggesting Tehran's deal with the IAEA could be extended “another month.”The International Atomic Energy Agency had said its director-general would brief reporters later Sunday in Vienna. The United Nations agency did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Under what is called an “Additional Protocol” with Iran, the IAEA “collects and analyzes hundreds of thousands of images captured daily by its sophisticated surveillance cameras,” the agency said in 2017. The agency also said then that it had placed “2,000 tamper-proof seals on nuclear material and equipment.”Iran’s hard-line parliament in December approved a bill that would suspend part of U.N. inspections of its nuclear facilities if European signatories did not provide relief from oil and banking sanctions by February. The IAEA struck a three-month deal with Iran to have it hold the surveillance images, with Tehran threatening to delete them afterward if no deal had been reached.It wasn't immediately clear if the images from February had been deleted. Before Qalibaf’s remarks, lawmaker Ali Reza Salimi urged an open session of parliament to ensure Iran’s civilian nuclear arm “erased” the images. The Atomic Energy Organization of Iran did not immediately comment on the decision.“Order the head of the Atomic Energy Organization to avoid delay," said Salimi, a cleric from Iran's central city of Delijan. The “recorded images in the cameras should be eliminated."It also wasn't clear what this meant for in-person inspections by the IAEA. There are 18 nuclear facilities and nine other locations in Iran under IAEA safeguards.Qalibaf said Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who has final say on all matters of state, supported the decision.In 2018, then-President Donald Trump pulled the U.S. unilaterally out of the nuclear deal, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action. An escalating series of incidents since Trump’s withdrawal has threatened the wider Mideast.Over a year ago, a U.S. drone strike killed a top Iranian general, causing Tehran to later launch ballistic missiles that wounded dozens of American troops in Iraq.A mysterious explosion also struck Iran’s Natanz nuclear facility, which Iran has described as sabotage. In November, Iranian scientist Mohsen Fakhrizadeh, who founded the country’s military nuclear program some two decades earlier, was killed in an attack Tehran blames on Israel.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/inspectors-may-no-longer-get-nuclear-sites-images-iran-101621768667404.html
23-05-2021||World||Congo's Mount Nyiragongo volcano's lava flows short of regional capital Goma||Congo’s Mount Nyiragongo unleashed lava that destroyed homes on the outskirts of Goma, but witnesses said Sunday that the city of 2 million had been mostly spared after the volcano erupted at night and sent thousands fleeing in panic.Residents said there was little warning before the dark sky turned a fiery red, leading to fears that the eruption could cause the same kind of devastation as the last time in 2002 when hundreds died. There was no official word on how many may have been killed amid the scramble to flee the city late Saturday.The UN peacekeeping mission had said that it didn't appear the lava was flowing toward Goma based on reconnaissance flights, but untold thousands still set off in search of safety. Some boarded boats onto Lake Kivu while others attempted to reach Mount Goma, the highest elevation point. At least 3,000 fled across the nearby border into Rwanda.On Sunday, residents ventured out to assess the damage after a night of panic. Smoke rose from smoldering heaps of lava in the Buhene area near the city.“We have seen the loss of almost an entire neighborhood," said Innocent Bahala Shamavu. “All the houses in Buhene neighborhood were burned and that’s why we are asking all the provincial authorities and authorities at the national level as well as all the partners, all the people of good faith in the world, to come to the aid of this population.”Elsewhere witnesses said lava had engulfed one highway connecting Goma with the city of Beni. However, the airport appeared to be spared the same fate as 2002 when lava flowed onto the runways.Goma is a regional hub for many humanitarian agencies in the region, as well as the UN peacekeeping mission known as MONUSCO. While Goma is home to many UN peacekeepers and aid workers, much of surrounding eastern Congo is under threat from a myriad of armed groups vying for control of the region’s mineral resources.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/congo-nyiragongo-volcano-s-lava-flows-short-of-regional-capital-goma-101621768761625.html

Reports from other media said up to 15 members of the security forces had been killed.Mobye is around 100 km (60 miles) east of the capital Naypyidaw, but lies near territory held by some of the ethnic armed groups that have fought for greater autonomy for decades.An alliance of four ethnic groups opposing the coup battled early on Sunday with security forces in Muse, one of the main border crossings to China, Myanmar media said.Since the army took power, local People's Defence Forces have also sprung up to oppose the junta - often armed with shotguns and homemade weapons. The video from Mobye showed at least one fighter firing an assault rifle.While the junta is struggling with renewed conflict on several fronts, it also faces daily protests and strikes that have paralysed hospitals, schools and much private business.TEACHERS SUSPENDEDMore than 125,000 school teachers - nearly a third of the total - have been suspended for joining a civil disobedience movement to oppose the coup, an official of the Myanmar Teachers' Federation said.At least 815 people have been killed by security forces since the coup, according to the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners activist group.The junta disputes that figure. Its leader, Min Aung Hlaing, said in comments broadcast on Saturday that 300 people had been killed in addition to 47 police.Protesters also demand the release of nearly 4,300 people who have been arrested since the coup, including Suu Kyi, 75.Min Aung Hlaing said Suu Kyi was healthy and would soon appear in court. Her next hearing is on Monday on some of the many charges brought against her, which range from illegal possession of walkie-talkie radios to breaching a state secrets law.The army seized power claiming fraud in a general election won by Suu Kyi's party in November. Its accusations had been dismissed by the former electoral commission, dozens of whose officials are now locked up.In further comments from an interview released by Hong Kong-based Phoenix Television on Sunday, Min Aung Hlaing sought to reassure Chinese businesses after some factories were set ablaze recently in the commercial capital Yangon."Our citizens are not being anti-China but it's the politics that cause the hatred," he said.Some opponents of the coup have accused China of supporting the junta, which has been condemned by Western countries that have introduced limited sanctions. China has been milder in its approach and has said it seeks stability in its neighbour.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/prodemocracy-protesters-seize-police-post-kill-security-forces-in-myanmar-101621767466478.html

When the cold snap struck, the race, comprising 172 participants, was halted. Soon after, several runners were reported to have gone missing, and a rescue operation was launched.By Sunday noon, the remains of the 21 victims had been recovered at the site of the tragedy, the rescue headquarters was quoted as saying by the news agency Xinhua.The other 151 participants were all confirmed safe, of whom eight suffered minor injuries and were treated in hospital, the media report said.“According to the rescue headquarters, at about 1pm on Saturday, hail, freezing rain and gales hit the area of the race’s high-altitude stage, between 20-31km. Participants suffered from physical discomfort due to the sudden drop in air temperature,” the report said.Rescue work was challenging due to the harsh, mountainous terrain, a further drop in the night-time temperature and poor communications signals. More than 1,200 rescuers were deployed, assisted by thermal-imaging drones and radar detectors, according to state media.National broadcaster CCTV quoted rescuers as saying the low temperature was the biggest threat faced by participants as they wore thin clothes.One runner, Mao Shuzhi, told Reuters news agency that she turned back midway into the race when the weather abruptly changed.“The rain was getting heavier and heavier,” said Mao, who was about 24km into the race at the time and hadn’t yet reached the mountains.She decided to head back to her hotel, having had previous bad experiences with hypothermia, but others carried on or were already in the worst-hit areas.Baiyin’s mayor Zhang Xuchen said, “As the organiser of the event, we are full of guilt and remorse. We express deep condolences and sympathy to the families of the victims and the injured.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/deadly-cold-snap-strikes-marathon-race-in-china-leaves-21-runners-dead-101621767723171.html

This is why we must anticipate and vaccinate all people at risk with a third dose by the end of the summer, in particular the residents of nursing homes who received their first dose at the beginning of the year," Bancel told French newspaper Journal Du Dimanche.The CEO of the US drugmaker further suggested that in order to protect the "fragile unvaccinated people," all adults and adolescents must also receive a booster jab.Bancel warned that three or even two months of delay in vaccinations could lead to an increase in the number of hospitalizations and deaths, which could, in turn, lead to a fourth Covid-19 wave in France.Moderna is now testing three different booster strategies, he said. The first is against the original Wuhan strain, the second is against the South Africa strain and the third is a combination of both. The effectiveness of these three boosters is later on measured on the four variants deemed to be the most dangerous by the World Health Organization.The company is planning to launch a study on people near early June and aims to get approval from regulatory agencies by September.Starting May 28, the Moderna vaccine will be joining AstraZeneca and Johnson & Johnson in French pharmacies and general practitioners offices. Around 300,000 doses of the vaccine will be available in pharmacies weekly. The arrival of Moderna in French pharmacies is expected to make the vaccine more accessible to isolated elderly people or overlooked workers and will help with a speedier vaccination progress in the country as the vaccine itself can be stored in the refrigerator for up to one month.So far, about 90 million people have been inoculated with Moderna's Covid-19 vaccine globally. Around 14 per cent of France's total population has been fully vaccinated and 31.5 million people have received at least one dose.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/moderna-ceo-advocates-booster-covid-19-vaccine-jab-to-protect-people-at-risk-101621765585199.html

Speaking at BBC Breakfast, Adam Finn, member of the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation, stressed that the ongoing pandemic is a global crisis and the government needs to “think globally and not just domestically.”“It may well be better for children in this country if vaccines are used to stop outbreaks like the massive outbreak in India which then get imported into this country and provide a threat to them and their schooling,” he said.The United Kingdom has administered at least one dose of Covid-19 vaccine to more than 55 per cent of the country’s population and on Saturday, the National Health Service (NHS) opened bookings for people aged 32 and 33 to get their first Covid shot. The latest expansion of vaccination eligibility would cover about 1.1 million people, according to the NHS. Finn said that it remains unclear whether children will need vaccination.“I think we need to wait and see on that. It is not clear at this point whether we will actually need to vaccinate children in order to get that population immunity that we have to get,” he added.Also Read | Children can get and spread Covid infection': Centre clarifies 3 points amid 3rd wave concernsOn the other hand, the United States has already started inoculating 12- to 15-year-old children after the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) gave emergency use authorisation to Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine for the age group. The decision, however, drew criticism since vaccine supply in lower- and lower-middle-income countries has not been enough to vaccinate even health care workers.“In January, I spoke about the potential unfolding of a moral catastrophe. Unfortunately, we are now witnessing this play out,” the World Health Organization (WHO) director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told a press briefing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/moving-covid-shots-to-india-could-benefit-uk-children-suggests-vaccine-advisor-101621764947448.html

The British people will have confidence that the strongest controls are in place to keep them safe," she said.The UK Home Office hopes to make entry to the UK fully digital by the end of 2025.It means people wanting to come into the UK without a visa or immigration status will have to apply for an Electronic Travel Authorisation (ETA), similar to the US system, with 30 million applications expected to be processed every year.As well as launching her latest immigration plans, Patel will also focus on failings in the asylum system and the need to crack down on people smugglers. Earlier in the week, she was filmed accompanying police as they arrested suspected ringleaders of a people smuggling gang that used minicab and lorry drivers to move migrants in and out of the UK.The British government has said that in the past 10 days, more than 140 foreign criminals have been removed from the UK, totalling more than 700 so far this year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-home-secretary-priti-patel-to-unveil-digital-visas-to-count-migrants-101621763778042.html

Two public housing blocks will have all residents screened after several cases were found in each of them, the government said Sunday.Two shopping centers on the western part of the island will be closed for two weeks starting Sunday after 10 Covid-19 infections were recently linked to the properties, authorities said. Four were detected from testing operations that were offered to those who were at the mall earlier this month, according to a statement on Saturday.“Our epidemiological investigations have found that there is likely ongoing transmission among individuals who visited these malls,” the health ministry said. “To break any potential chain of transmission and enable deep cleaning of the premises, JEM and Westgate shopping malls will be closed to all members of the public.”Ong also addressed concerns that cases of vaccinated people getting infected means there’s little benefit in getting inoculated against Covid-19. In the current outbreak, 78 vaccinated individuals had been infected, many of whom are frontline workers, he said. That compares with 300 unvaccinated infections, Ong said.“International studies continue to show that vaccinations are very effective in preventing infections, and severe illnesses,” he said.Singapore preliminarily confirmed 22 new cases of locally transmitted Covid-19 infection as of 12 p.m. on Sunday, three of which are untraceable, according to a statement from the health ministry. There were three imported cases, according to the ministry.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/singapore-govt-to-conduct-more-tests-surveillance-to-curb-covid-19-outbreak-101621763377644.html

He was also the architect of Britain's campaign to leave the European Union.Johnson, who has imposed three lockdowns during the pandemic, has hailed Britain's vaccination programme as a success, but the United Kingdom has one of the highest COVID-19 death tolls and it has suffered a deep economic slump."If we'd had the right preparations competent people in charge, we wd probably have avoided lockdown1, *definitely* no need for lockdowns 2&3," Cummings wrote on Twitter on Saturday."Given the plan was AWOL/disaster awful decisions delayed everything, lockdown1 became necessary."The government has said there are lessons to be learned from the pandemic since facing accusations of being slow to impose lockdowns.Cummings is due to appear on Wednesday before a joint inquiry of the lower house of parliament's Health and Social Care Committee and the Science and Technology Committee.On herd immunity, where the virus spreads through the population to increase overall resistance, Cummings wrote on Twitter: "Our original plan was wrong & we changed when we realised."Johnson's Downing Street office said in a statement that "herd immunity has never been a policy aim or part of our coronavirus strategy.""Our response has at all times been focused on saving lives and ensuring the NHS (National Health Service) was not overwhelmed. We continue to be guided by the latest scientific advice."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/disaster-uk-pm-johnson-s-ex-top-aide-recalls-early-covid-19-plan-101621761929944.html

23-05-2021||World||Opposition alliance to move court against dissolution of Nepal parliament||Nepal's President dissolved the House of Representatives on Saturday for the second time in five months and announced snap elections in November, rejecting both embattled Prime Minister K P Sharma Oli and the Opposition alliance's claims to form a government, a "regressive" move that will be legally challenged yet again.President Bidya Devi Bhandari announced in an early morning statement that the House of Representatives has been dissolved in accordance with Article 76(7) of the Constitution, ending a day of high-voltage political drama in the Himalayan nation, amidst the raging COVID-19 pandemic.As per the Article, a date to conduct another election within six months must also be fixed. The President has called early elections pursuant to the Article, the dates being set for November 12 and November 19.The announcement came after Prime Minister Oli in his last deal-sealing move on Friday midnight recommended the Office of the President to dissolve the 275-member House and announce dates for early elections.Earlier, Oli and Opposition leader Sher Bahadur Deuba had staked separate claims to premiership, both of which were rejected by the president, citing that none had adequate grounds for winning a vote of confidence."It has been noted that Prime Minister Oli counted those lawmakers as his supporters who extended support to the Opposition alliance, whereas the UML and JSP-N have forwarded letters stating action would be taken against those who had gone against the party to endorse the Opposition's claim," Bhandari said in a statement late on Friday.According to the statement from the President's Office, 26 lawmakers of the CPN-UML and 12 lawmakers of the Janata Samajbadi Party had supported both Oli and Deuba.The president’s announcement plunged Nepal into further political crisis, a reminder of her December 2020 decision when she first dissolved the House at Oli’s recommendation, a move that swayed the course of Nepali politics towards uncertainty.The Supreme Court had annulled the duo's move in February.Alarmed by the duo's move yet again, the leaders of Nepal's Opposition alliance on Saturday decided to take all legal and political means to counter Prime Minister Oli and President Bhandari's "unconstitutional and undemocratic" move of dissolving the House.In a joint statement issued at the end of a meeting called to discuss their future strategy, the Opposition leaders termed the President’s move unconstitutional, undemocratic, autocratic and regressive.The President did not follow her constitutional responsibility of appointing a new prime minister on the basis of the constitutional claim as per Article 76 (5) of the constitution with signatures of majority lawmakers, the joint press statement said. by the parties after a meeting on Saturday to chart out their future strategy.“Instead she sided with Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli with malafide intentions and dissolved Parliament in an attack on the constitution and democracy. This regressive move has pushed the country towards new political polarisation and complexity."The statement was signed by Nepali Congress President Sher Bahadur Deuba, CPN-Maoist Centre Chair Pushpa Kamal Dahal 'Prachanda', CPN-UML leader Madhav Kumar Nepal, Chairperson of Janata Samajbadi Party-Nepal Upendra Yadav and Vice-Chair of the Rastriya Janamorcha Durga Paudel.The Opposition alliance is devising a strategy to approach the Supreme Court with all its lawmakers on Sunday demanding to scrap the president's decision.The parties blamed the president for making an assault on the Constitution and democracy in partnership with the prime minister, who had lost a trust vote in the House.The parties claimed that the government is hell-bent on its attempt to prolong the autocratic rule despite the COVID-19 pandemic in the country.The Nepali Congress also accused President Bhandari and Prime Minister Oli of misusing the Constitution for their own benefit as their personal property."Prime Minister Oli recommending forming a new government, President Bhandari announcing to stake a claim to form new government giving less than 24 hours, not appointing prime minister as per the provision of the Constitution and dissolving HoR and holding a Cabinet meeting in the middle of the night are unconstitutional and anti-democratic," the party said in a statement."NC strongly objects to these kinds of activities,” it said. Deuba, urging all the democratic forces to unite and act together for the protection of the Constitution and democracy, vowed to take political and legal action against the House dissolution.Speaker of the House of Representatives Agni Prasad Sapkota also said President Bhandari's decision to dissolve the House is against the spirit of the Constitution of Nepal."The unprecedented move is against the political struggle and verdict of the apex court which had annulled Prime Minister K P Sharma Oli's earlier move of dismantling the parliament on December 20, 2020," Sapkota said in a statement.Nepal’s political crisis took a dramatic turn on Friday as embattled Prime Minister Oli and the Opposition parties staked separate claims for the formation of a new government by submitting letters of support from lawmakers to the president.Oli claimed the support of 121 lawmakers from his own party CPN-UML and 32 lawmakers of Janata Samajbadi Party-Nepal (JSP-N) for his reappointment pursuant to Article 76(5) of the Constitution.Nepali Congress President Deuba claimed to have garnered the support of 149 lawmakers. However, a dispute emerged after a few lawmakers from the Madhav Nepal faction put out statements claiming that their signatures were misused and that they did not sign any paper to install Opposition leader Deuba as the prime minister against their own party chief.Earlier on Thursday, the president's office stated that the government had forwarded a request to invoke Article 76 (5) as Prime Minister Oli, it has been learnt, is in no mood to undergo another parliamentary floor test as there is no prospect of an otherwise result given the complex internal dynamics within parties represented in the federal parliament.Nepal plunged into a political crisis on December 20 last year after President Bhandari dissolved the House and announced fresh elections on April 30 and May 10 at the recommendation of Prime Minister Oli, amidst a tussle for power within the ruling Nepal Communist Party (NCP).Oli's move to dissolve the House sparked protests from a large section of the NCP led by his rival 'Prachanda'. In February, the apex court reinstated the dissolved House, in a setback to Oli who was preparing for snap polls.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/opposition-alliance-to-move-court-against-dissolution-of-nepal-parliament-101621761008617.html
23-05-2021||World||Photos show Dubai princess Latifa, focus of UN concern, at malls||Photos on social media appear to show a missing Dubai princess who months earlier described herself in a video as being held against her will out at two major malls in the city-state.Images published by a woman identified in British media as former Royal Navy member Sioned Taylor show Sheikha Latifa bint Mohammed Al Maktoum at the Mall of the Emirates at a movie theater there, as well as at a restaurant at Dubai Mall near the Burj Khalifa, the world's tallest building.The photos corresponded to those locations, with the Mall of the Emirates image likely taken in May due to the film being advertised in it.Taylor did not respond to a request for comment. The government's Dubai Media Office did not acknowledge the release of the images.The photos' pedestrian captions belie the fact that United Nations experts and human rights activists had called on Dubai's ruler, Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, to provide information on his daughter.Sheikha Latifa, 35, had tried to flee the country in 2018 only to be detained by commandos in a boat off India.Videos released in February by the BBC had Sheikha Latifa describing herself as being in a villa that “has been converted into a jail.”“I don’t know when I’ll be released and what the conditions will be like when I’m released,” she says in one of the videos. “Every day I am worried about my safety and my life.”The dramatic would-be sea escape and its aftermath intruded into the carefully controlled image maintained by the family of Sheikh Mohammed, who is believed to have several dozen children from multiple wives. Some of his sons and daughters figure prominently in local media and online, but others are rarely seen. Sheikha Latifa was widely known for her love of skydiving prior to 2018.Sheikh Mohammed’s family life again became a public matter in 2020. Then, a British judge ruled the sheikh had conducted a campaign of fear and intimidation against his estranged wife and ordered the abduction of two of his daughters, one of them Sheikha Latifa. The ruling came in a custody battle between Sheikh Mohammed and his estranged wife Princess Haya, the daughter of the late King Hussein of Jordan.Sheikh Mohammed also serves as the vice president and prime minister of the hereditarily ruled United Arab Emirates, a federation of seven sheikhdoms on the Arabian Peninsula.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/photos-show-dubai-princess-latifa-focus-of-un-concern-at-malls-101621760650824.html
23-05-2021||World||Bangladesh appeals to world community for Covid-19 vaccine doses||Bangladesh has mounted a diplomatic campaign as part of its desperate efforts to get the coronavirus vaccine amid fears that the B1.617.2 variant of COVID-19 that first emerged in India could rapidly spread in the neighbouring country.Foreign Minister A K Abdul Momen has described the vaccine situation in the country a "crisis" and said that Bangladesh is "desperate" to get the vaccines from the US, China, Canada, Russia and the UK apart from India.On Saturday, he made the appeal on British TV channel ITV News, a day after he appeared on the CNN network with an identical appeal.Momen said Bangladesh tried to close its porous borders with India but could not prevent the influx of people and around 3,350 Bangladeshis returned from India through Benapole land port alone from April 26 till date.They feared many more could have carried the virus through the borders beyond detection though the detection rate still remained low."You know that Bangladesh and India have a very good relationship -- we tried to close the border so that people from India don't come, but a lot of people came and many Bangladeshis went there and they're coming back," Momen told the CNN.He told newsmen in Dhaka that Bangladesh has so far officially sought vaccines from the US, the UK alongside China, Russia and of late Canada.Health officials said Bangladesh currently has a stock of one million doses of AstraZeneca's Covishield vaccine and Chinese Sinopharm jabs and is expecting 100,000 Pfizer shots but they feared all would be exhausted within few days. After its request to the US, Bangladesh has urged the UK to provide 1.6 million COVID-19 vaccine doses to meet its emergency needs."I'm not asking for too much, I'm only asking for 1.6 million AstraZeneca doses that they have . . . (UK) they should immediately disburse those to Bangladesh so that people can have their second dose," Momen told the ITV News.Bangladesh earlier entered into a deal with India's Serum Institute (SII) to procure 30 million doses of vaccines. But it received seven million doses in two consignments until February while the third consignment, which was expected in March, is yet to reach the country. India had provided 3.2 million doses as gifts to Bangladesh."India is facing a very critical situation, very alarming… They're finding it difficult, we can understand it," Momen told the British TV channel.In his interview with CNN, Momen said the big problem is that a large number of people in Bangladesh who took the first dose of Oxford-AstraZeneca could not take the second dose and so "we need it desperately".Bangladesh also contacted China and Russia to get their vaccines while Beijing said it was set to provide six lakh more COVID-19 vaccine doses as second batch of gift nine days after sending first batch of five lakh doses as the donation.Dhaka earlier this week signed a non-disclosure agreement with China on purchasing Sinopharm COVID-19 vaccine and co-produce the vaccines in Bangladesh, a month after reaching a nearly identical deal with Russia for the production of Sputnik V vaccine.The coronavirus has so far claimed 12,348 lives in Bangladesh with 38 deaths in the past 24 hours while the tally of infections surged to 7,87,726, with health officials reporting 1,028 new cases.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/bangladesh-appeals-to-world-community-for-covid-19-vaccine-doses-101621760060352.html

"We are working to further expand production capacity with a growing network of partners."The Nasdaq-listed firm, which is backed by investor Dietmar Hopp, GlaxoSmithKline as well as the German government, has said it aims to produce up to 300 million doses of the vaccine in 2021 and up to 1 billion in 2022.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/germanys-curevac-working-to-expand-covid-19-vaccine-production-capacity-101621759762879.html
23-05-2021||World||China invading Bhutan in a gradually, stealthily: Report||China has been gradually and stealthily invading its tiny neighbour Bhutan for years now, reveals new research findings.A paper published by journal Foreign Policy stated that China has built an entire town, replete with roads, a power plant, two CPC buildings, a communications base, military and police outposts and a warehouse, almost 8 kilometres into Bhutan, reported the Australian news, site news.com.au.In early April, the Chinese welcomed a delegation of international visitors to the city of Kunming in Yunnan province, which discussed China's mountainous southern border, which lies uninhabited and sports wild terrain.With a population of just 800,000 compared to China's 1.4 billion, "there is little Bhutan can do" but watch as Beijing takes large gulps of its territory, the research paper states."This involves a strategy that is more provocative than anything China has done on its land borders in the past," wrote Robert Barnett in Foreign Policy earlier this month.The largely Buddhist Bhutanese have much in common with the people of Tibet which now lies within China. But diplomatically and economically, the government in Thimphu has closer links to India and Beijing doesn't even have an embassy in Bhutan.That Bhutan and China can't agree where their 470 km common border lies is nothing new. By some accounts Beijing claims 12 per cent of the territory governed by Thimphu. The recent meeting in Kunming was the 25th the two nations have held concerning the frontier.China has long built roads into these disputed territories. But building a whole town within the internationally recognised territory of another nation, even if that territory is disputed, is striking, reported news.com.au.Called Gyalaphug, or Jieluobu in Chinese, an administration block at its centre features a hammer and sickle. A nearby banner proclaims "Resolutely uphold the core position of General Secretary Xi Jinping!"It's estimated several hundred people, and even more yaks, could now live in Gyalaphug. That number is boosted by a rotation of construction workers, party cadres, police and soldiers."There is little that Bhutan can do," said Barnett, given China would know it's clearly violating a 1998 agreement to leave the disputed areas be, reported news.com.au.To the frustration of Bhutan, China's territorial claims keep growing. Gyalaphug, for instance, is well within Bhutan according to some official Chinese maps from the 1980s.Also, Bhutan is adamant that the dispute in the country's east, where Beijing now claims land in the Sakteng wildlife reserve, is a new one. It's never been raised by China before. Sakteng does not even border China, reported news.com.au.It does, however, border the India' north eastern state of Arunachal Pradesh, which Beijing also claims as its own. Observers say that's another sign it's not really about Bhutan at all. China's real target appears to be India.Stealthily but steadily, Beijing is reportedly building whole towns across internationally recognised borders in a new and dangerous global power play.What Beijing has already done in the South China Sea - building outposts and claiming dubious sovereignty - is now also being done in the Himalayas, according to reports.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-invading-bhutan-in-a-gradually-stealthily-report-101621759471821.html

But relationships can change," Thunberg said in the video marking the International Day of Biological Diversity.Also Read | ‘Heartbreaking’: Greta Thunberg urges global help for India amid Covid-19 crisisA focus on agriculture and linking the climate crisis to health pandemics is a new angle for Thunberg who has typically focused her ire on policy-makers and carbon emissions from fossil fuels."The climate crisis, ecological crisis and health crisis, they are all interlinked," she said.Thunberg said the spillover of diseases from animals to humans was caused by farming methods, adding that a move to a plant-based diet could save up to 8 billion tonnes of CO2 each year.The World Health Organization has said the coronavirus was probably transmitted from bats to humans through another animal, while scientists say 60% of the infectious human diseases that emerged from 1990 to 2004 came from animals.Meanwhile, demand for alternatives to regular meat is surging worldwide due to concerns about health, animal welfare and the environment.More than two dozen firms are testing lab-grown fish, beef and chicken, hoping to break into an unproven segment of the alternative meat market, which Barclays estimates could be worth $140 billion by 2029.The Global Center on Adaptation, which works to accelerate climate resilience, said in January climate change could depress global food production by up to 30%, while rising seas and more intense storms could force hundreds of millions of people in coastal cities out of their homes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/greta-thunberg-aims-to-change-how-food-is-produced-101621753234773.html

Canada has the largest Tamil population outside the Indian subcontinent, numbering over 300,000 and with roots in India, Sri Lanka, and other nations such as Singapore and Malaysia. The chair will foster scholarship and research into the language and as well as its cultural aspects.The groups that participated in the initiative included Canadian Tamil Congress and Tamil Chair Inc, and among its supporters was the government of the Indian state of Tamil Nadu. A total of $3 million has been raised for the endowment to begin the process of formalising the programme.Wisdom J Tettey, principal of University of Toronto’s Scarborough campus (UTSC) told HT that the university will now embark on a global search to appoint the chair. He said they will seek an “outstanding reputation and who can undertake research and connect with the community in ways that ensure co-learning and reciprocal interaction”.Among those who welcomed the move was accountant Sivan Ilangko, also president of Canadian Tamil Congress. “The worldwide Tamil community is interested in both ancient and modern Tamil literature. There are also expectations that the Tamil chair will include interdisciplinary studies, cultural studies, classics, sociology, political science, anthropology, geography, linguistics, literature and fine arts. We expect there will be teaching and research in these areas,” he said.Ilangko pointed out that Tamil is among the oldest surviving classical languages with a tradition that is more than 2,000 years old. It is also a modern language spoken by over 80 million people in numerous countries.UTSC principal Tettey felt that institutionalising Tamil studies will attract those even beyond the Tamil community. “Tamil studies have different components - from language studies, to history and culture. As an institution with a global remit and perspective, the interest will be from a wide range of people around the world with different motivations,” said Tettey.“The chair’s work in the context of Toronto, which has a huge community of Tamil origin with global connections, will support our vision of inspiring inclusive academic excellence and enriching our multicultural society by studying, promoting, and sustaining Tamil culture and heritage around the world,” the UTSC principal said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/first-ever-chair-of-tamil-studies-to-be-established-at-a-canadian-university-101621748826445.html

All you need to know about inquiry findingsIn a statement, the 70-year-old said his continued presence at the gallery would be a "distraction to an institution I care deeply about.”“As I said two days ago, I am very sorry for the events of 25 years ago and I believe leadership means taking responsibility,” said Hall, who served as the BBC’s director-general from 2013 until 2020.John Kingman, the deputy chair of the National Gallery's board of trustees, will assume Hall's role for the time being. He said the gallery is “extremely sorry” to lose Hall but that "we entirely understand and respect his decision.”The 126-page report by retired Judge John Dyson, published Thursday, found the internal BBC investigation had covered up “deceitful behavior” by Bashir, who was little-known as a journalist when he interviewed Diana.The BBC also has faced questions about why Bashir was rehired in 2016 as the broadcaster's religious affairs correspondent.Diana’s sons, Princes William and Harry, have excoriated the BBC since the report’s publication, saying there was a direct link between the 1995 interview and their mother’s death in a traffic accident two years later as she and a companion were being pursued by paparazzi.The BBC commissioned the report after Diana's brother, Charles Spencer, complained that Bashir used false documents and other dishonest tactics to persuade Diana to grant the interview.In the interview, Diana said her marriage to Prince Charles had failed because he was still in love with former lover Camilla Parker Bowles, whom Charles would go on to marry a decade later.Also Read: Princes William, Harry hit out at BBC for ‘deceit’ in obtaining Diana interviewDiana, then 34, said she was devastated when she found out in 1986 — five years after her marriage — that Charles had renewed his relationship with Camilla. Diana said she was so depressed that she deliberately hurt herself in a desperate bid for help.“There were three of us in this marriage, so it was a bit crowded,″ Diana famously remarked.The fallout from the report has raised serious doubts about the BBC’s integrity, while the British government has said it would review the rules governing the oversight of the editorially independent national broadcaster.The BBC, which was founded in 1922, is funded by a license fee payable by everyone. The rules governing its operations are set out in a royal charter that requires the corporation to be impartial, act in the public interest and be open, transparent and accountable. A mid-term review of the BBC’s governance is scheduled to begin next year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/exbbc-head-quits-gallery-job-amid-diana-interview-fallout-101621740934032.html
23-05-2021||World||'Never wanted to harm Diana': Journalist at centre of controversial interview denies link to her death||A former BBC journalist found to have deceived Princess Diana in order to secure an explosive interview with her in 1995 has denied he was responsible for a chain of events that led to her death, a newspaper reported.Martin Bashir told The Sunday Times he believed his actions did not harm Diana.An independent investigation published on Thursday found that Bashir lied and deceived Diana that she was being spied upon to persuade her to agree to the interview in which she disclosed details of her failed marriage to Prince Charles."I never wanted to harm Diana in any way and I don’t believe we did," Bashir told The Sunday Times.Diana's eldest son William has said the way the interview was secured was "deceitful" and the BBC's failures contributed significantly to Diana's "fear, paranoia and isolation."His younger brother Prince Harry and Diana's brother Charles Spencer have said the interview was part of a series of unethical practices that ultimately cost Diana her life in a car crash in Paris in 1997."I don’t feel I can be held responsible for many of the other things that were going on in her life, and the complex issues surrounding those decisions," Bashir told The Sunday Times in an interview."I can understand the motivation... but to channel the tragedy, the difficult relationship between the royal family and the media purely on to my shoulders feels a little unreasonable ... The suggestion I am singularly responsible I think is unreasonable and unfair."The Sunday Times quoted Bashir as admitting that he used forged bank statements which the inquiry said was part of the deception of Diana . "Obviously I regret it, it was wrong,” he told the newspaper. “But it had no bearing on anything. It had no bearing on (Diana), it had no bearing on the interview.”Britain's government said on Friday it would examine how the BBC was run after the inquiry criticised the broadcaster for its "woefully ineffective" investigation into Bashir's actions.London's police force has said officers will assess the contents of the report to see if there was any significant new evidence, having previously ruled out a criminal investigation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/never-wanted-to-harm-diana-journalist-at-centre-of-controversial-interview-denies-link-to-her-death-101621741524113.html

He made the statement during an interview with Hong Kong's Phoenix Television on Thursday, only excerpts of which have been published till now."Daw Aung San Suu Kyi is in good health. She is at her home and healthy. She is going to face trial at the court in a few days," Min Aung Hlaing said, reiterating unverified claims of voter fraud in Myanmar's election in November 2020, in which Aung San Suu Kyi's party, the National League for Democracy (NLD), won. This alleged voter fraud, which has been rejected by the election commission, is the military's justification for the coup.Also Read: Suu Kyi ordered to show up in court on May 24On being asked what he felt about Aung San Suu Kyi's performance as a leader, the military head said, "She tried all she could." Suu Kyi, a Nobel laureate, is widely popular in her country for striving to bring about democratic reforms non-violently.The deposed leader has been under house arrest and has made no physical public appearances since the military took control of the country on February 1 this year.In the days following the coup, which resulted in widespread protests and a turmoil as military clashed with civilians, over 4,000 people were detained and more than 800 killed. On Sunday, more than 125,000 school teachers in the country were suspended by the military for joining a civil disobedience movement to oppose the coup, an official of the Myanmar Teachers' Federation said, according to Reuters.Suu Kyi's next virtual court appearance, for which she will appear by video link, is due on Monday. She has been charged with flouting coronavirus restrictions during 2020's election campaign and possessing unlicensed walkie-talkies and is yet to be allowed to speak directly to her lawyers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/myanmar-coup-junta-leader-says-aung-san-suu-kyi-in-good-health-101621741492294.html
23-05-2021||World||Tiny Lithuania stands up to China as Europe freezes investment pact with Beijing||Lithuania, a tiny nation of less than 2.8 million people, said on Saturday it was quitting the China-led "17+1" grouping with central and eastern European states and asked other countries to walk out of the forum set up by China in 2012 to forge ties and expand its influence."Lithuania no longer considers itself a 17+1 format member and does not participate in this initiative," foreign minister Gabrielius Landsbergis told news agency AFP on Saturday. He also described the platform as "divisive" from the European Union’s perspective, urged EU members to pursue "a much more effective 27+1 approach and communication with China and stressed that "Europe's strength and impact is in its unity".The announcement had been in the works for some time. Lithuania, like some other countries in the region, has been increasingly suspicious of China for some time. It was in 2019 that the Baltic state first identified Chinese espionage as a threat to its national security."As Chinese economic and political ambitions grow in Lithuania and other NATO and EU countries, activities of the Chinese intelligence and security services become increasingly aggressive," the State Security Department and the Second Investigation Department under the Defense Ministry said in their National Threat Assessment 2019 report, according to The Baltic Times.Its latest threat assessment report released in February this year was equally scathing, accusing Beijing of trying to exploit the Covid pandemic to discredit perceived adversaries and improve its image. A few weeks before releasing its security assessment, Vilnius had already signalled her country’s disappointment when Prime Minister Ingrida Šimonytė deputed her transport minister to sit in front of the camera for the China-CEEC Summit held via video link. President Xi Jinping, for the first time, addressed the summit.To be sure, Lithuania isn’t the only one within the “17+1” grouping to have tempered its expectations from the grouping that was once expected to lead to a rush of Chinese investment and infrastructure. Five other countries, Bulgaria, Estonia, Latvia, Romania, and Slovenia, also indicated their diminished interest in the grouping and were represented by ministers at Xi Jinping’s high-profile February summit.China watchers in Delhi say Lithuania’s moves - it has announced its decision to open a trade office in Taiwan, spoken out against human rights violations by Beijing and blocked Chinese X-ray inspection equipment at airports - is an indicator of the deteriorating relationship between China and European Union.The EU-China investment pact, sealed in December 2020 after being negotiated for nearly seven years, was the latest casualty when European Parliament on Thursday halted ratification of the agreement which was then seen as a geopolitical win for China. It was proof of Europe’s independence from the US and Beijing’s ability to collaborate with US’ allies who adopted a moderate approach.On Thursday, the European Parliament refused to consider the investment deal as long as its “baseless and arbitrary” penalties were in place.According to the resolution, the parliament, which must ratify the investment deal, "demands that China lift the sanctions before Parliament can deal with the Comprehensive Agreement on Investment".In a vote passed with 599 votes in favour, 30 against and 58 abstentions, the lawmakers also warned that lifting the sanctions would not in itself ensure the deal's ratification. The legislators said they will take into account the human rights situation in China when deciding to greenlight the multi-billion deal.The decision to freeze the investment pact had been expected by some analysts after China retaliated against the US, UK and EU over sanctions related to allegations of human rights abuses in the western region of Xinjiang by announcing measures against 10 European politicians, scholars and research groups.China has been criticised for its treatment of Muslim Uyghurs and other minorities in Xinjiang. A panel of UN experts in 2019 said an estimated 1 million people have been sent to counter-terrorism internment facilities in the region, part of a set of policies the U.S. has said amount to genocide.Angela Merkel’s Germany was one of the few voices that continue to speak in favour of the EU-China pact. According to AFP, German economy minister Peter Altmaier said China "is the European Union's largest trading partner and the United States' largest trading partner, and thus plays an important role in the global economy," Altmaier said, adding: “We want to reach results with China that are in the interest of both sides".Chancellor Merkel, who has adopted a China-friendly course, is due to step down in September this year. Annalena Baerbock, the chancellor candidate for Germany’s Greens, has condemned human rights violations in China and said that, as chancellor, she would block imports of Chinese goods produced with forced labour.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/tiny-lithuania-stands-up-to-china-as-europe-freezes-investment-pact-with-beijing-101621718303245.html

I didn't do like a welcome home when we got out of the hospital unfortunately because of the pandemic," she told AFP."And so this is my first celebration for her and I really wanted to do it with my family and friends and you know, I know she might not remember it but I want her to know that this did happen," she said.While her guests seemed delighted to be together, many pointed out that they did not want to invite people to their homes yet -- except for very close friends who they would be sure have been vaccinated."I don't know if we'll ever go back to complete comfort with that... not in the immediate future," said Merry Mathes, 58.Farther into the park, Marcus, a 25-year-old vaccinated paralegal, was partying alongside a dozen friends, with a synth and a hired DJ.He has only been to two parties since March 2020, both of them outdoors: one, which was limited to 10 people, was for his best friend's wedding, and the other was in Central Park in early May."I am not ready for parties inside, but maybe in the fall," he said.What if it came back? "Business is picking up, it started last week," said Lemuel Rodrigues, a party store manager in Manhattan."Most people are having it at home, or in parks, with other family members that they know," he said.Even though his business is still idling, he praised the continued caution of his customers: Despite 60 percent of the city's adult population having received at least one dose of the vaccine, many New Yorkers continue to wear masks on the streets, even though that regulation was lifted at the end of April.Also Read: US is investigating heart problem in few young vaccine recipients"A lot of people just want to go back to normal real fast.

"It was the first event I have been to where I didn't know the majority of the people," he said.The gathering was so close to the old "normal" that "a week later we still talked about it, and how different it felt to be at a normal party."Bars and restaurants have been allowed to open at full capacity since Wednesday.But when will the big gala evenings that make New York a hot spot for the jet set be back?According to Marcy Blum, who organizes parties and weddings for a wealthy clientele, even if the large reception venues do not reopen before September, her books are already full until April 2022.The phone started ringing a month ago, "when it was clear we were all going to have access to vaccines," she said."Everything comes out of the woodwork at once," she added, noting that people who had postponed their weddings are now scheduling them, but "people are still cautious... everybody still wants an outdoor venue or a tented venue."The Met Gala, one of the most popular social events in the world, is likely to symbolize this recovery: Traditionally held in May and canceled in 2020, it is scheduled to take place on September 13, 2021.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-new-yorkers-ready-to-party-again-just-not-indoors-101621735303885.html

Mountaineering was closed last year due to the pandemic.Nepalese officials could not immediately be reached for comment Saturday. Other climbing teams have not announced any Covid-19 infections among their members or staff. Several climbers have reported testing positive after they were brought down from the Everest base camp.Furtenbach said most teams on the mountain were not carrying virus testing kits, and that before his team pulled out, they had helped conduct tests and had confirmed two cases.Most teams are still at base camp, hoping for clear weather next week so they can make a final push to the summit before the climbing season closes at the end of the month, Furtenbach said.In late April, a Norwegian climber became the first to test positive at the Everest base camp. He was flown by helicopter to Kathmandu, where he was treated and later returned home.Nepal is experiencing a virus surge, with record numbers of new infections and deaths. China last week canceled climbing from its side of Mount Everest due to fears the virus could be spread from the Nepalese side.Nepal reported 8,607 new infections and 177 deaths on Friday, bringing the nation’s totals since the pandemic began to more than 497,000 infections and 6,024 deaths.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/over-100-covid-19-cases-on-everest-despite-nepal-s-denial-says-expert-guide-101621734589258.html

He is already on the junta's wanted list on charges of inciting disaffection.Myanmar had 430,000 school teachers according to the most recent data, from two years ago."These are just statements to threaten people to come back to work. If they actually fire this many people, the whole system will stop," said the official, who is also a teacher. He said he had been told that the charges he faces would be dropped if he returns.Reuters was unable to reach a junta spokesman or the education ministry for comment. The state-run Global New Light of Myanmar newspaper has called on teachers and students to return to schools to get the education system started again.The disruption at schools echoes that in the health sector and across government and private business since the Southeast Asian country was plunged into chaos by the coup and the arrest of elected leader Aung San Suu Kyi.Around 19,500 university staff have also been suspended, according to the teachers' group.Parents keep children homeRegistrations begin next week for the school term that starts in June, but some parents said they also plan to keep their children out of school."I am not going to enrol my daughter because I don't want to give her education from military dictatorship. I also worry about her safety," said 42-year-old Myint, whose daughter is 14.Students, who have been at the forefront of daily protests at which hundreds of people have been killed by security forces, also said they planned to boycott classes."I will only go back to school if we get back democracy," said Lwin, 18.Myanmar's education system was already one of the poorest in the region - and ranked 92 of 93 countries in a global survey last year.Even under the leadership of Suu Kyi, who had championed education, spending was below 2% of gross domestic product. That was one of the lowest rates in the world, according to World Bank figures.A National Unity Government, set up underground by opponents of the junta, said it would do all it could to support the teachers and students itself - calling on foreign donors to stop funding the junta-controlled education ministry."We will work with Myanmar's educators who are refusing to support the cruel military," Sasa, who goes by one name and is a spokesman for the national unity government, said in an email to Reuters. "These great teachers and brave teachers will never be left behind."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/more-than-125-000-teachers-in-myanmar-suspended-for-opposing-coup-101621730438756.html

23-05-2021||World||New Covid-19 cases in US plummet to lowest levels since last June||New coronavirus cases across the United States have tumbled to rates not seen in more than 11 months, sparking optimism that vaccination campaigns are stemming both severe Covid-19 cases and the spread of the virus.As cases, hospitalizations and deaths steadily dropped this week, pre-pandemic life in America has largely resumed. Hugs and unmasked crowds returned to the White House, a Mardi Gras-style parade marched through Alabama's port city of Mobile, and even states that have stuck to pandemic-related restrictions readied to drop them. However, health experts also cautioned that not enough Americans have been vaccinated to completely extinguish the virus, leaving the potential for new variants that could extend the pandemic.As the seven-day average for new cases dropped below 30,000 per day this week, Rochelle Walensky, the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, pointed out cases have not been this low since June 18, 2020. The average number of deaths over the last seven days also dropped to 552 — a rate not seen since July last year. It's a dramatic drop since the pandemic hit a devastating crescendo in January.“As each week passes and as we continue to see progress, these data give me hope,” Walensky said Friday at a news conference.Health experts credit an efficient rollout of vaccines for the turnaround. More than 60% of people over 18 have received at least one shot, and almost half are fully vaccinated, according to the CDC. But demand for vaccines has dropped across much of the country. President Joe Biden's administration is trying to convince other Americans to sign up for shots, using an upbeat message that vaccines offer a return to normal life.White House health officials on Friday even waded into offering dating advice. They are teaming up with dating apps to offer a new reason to “swipe right” by featuring vaccination badges on profiles and in-app bonuses for people who have gotten their shots.Ohio, New York, Oregon and other states are enticing people to get vaccinated through lottery prizes of up to $5 million.Across the country, venues and events reopened after shuttering for much of the last year.On Saturday, Karen Stetz readied to welcome what she hoped would be a good crowd to the Grosse Pointe Art Fair on Michigan’s Lake St. Clair.With natural ventilation from the lake and mask and capacity restrictions easing, Stetz was optimistic that artists who make their living traveling a show circuit that ground to a halt last year would begin to bounce back. The event usually draws from 5,000 to 10,000 people.“I feel like most people are ready to get out,” Stetz said by phone shortly before opening the fair. “It seems like people are eager, but it’s hard to know still. I’m sure there’s a percentage of people that are going to wait until they’re comfortable.”In Mobile, thousands of joyful revelers, many without masks, competed for plastic beads and trinkets tossed from floats Friday night as Alabama’s port city threw a Mardi Gras-style parade. But only about a quarter of the county's population is fully vaccinated. Many went without masks, though health officials had urged personal responsibility.Alabama's vaccination rate — 34% of people have received at least one dose — is one of the lowest in the country. It's part of a swath of Southern states where vaccine uptake has been slow. Health experts worry that areas with low vaccination rates could give rise to new virus variants that are more resistant to vaccinations.“My biggest concern is new strains of the virus and the need to remain vigilant in the months ahead,” said Boston College public health expert Dr. Philip J. Landrigan.A medical center in Louisiana reported Friday it has identified the state’s first two cases of a Covid-19 variant that has spread widely since being identified in India. The Covid-19 variant has been classified as a “variant of concern” by Britain and the World Health Organization, meaning there is some evidence that it spreads more easily between people, causes more severe disease, or might be less responsive to treatments and vaccines. The variant has also been reported in several other states, including Tennessee, Nebraska and Nevada.Though Landrigan said the big drop in cases nationwide was “the best news we've had on the pandemic” and showed that vaccines are working, he warned that people should remain vigilant for local flare-ups of new cases.Many states have largely dropped orders to wear masks and stay distanced from other people. Meanwhile, even places such as California — the first state to issue a statewide shutdown as the virus emerged in March 2020 — prepared to remove restrictions on social distancing and business capacity next month.State health director Dr. Mark Ghaly said Friday the decision was based on dramatically lower virus cases and increased vaccinations.But in Vermont — the state with the highest percentage of people who have received one shot — Gov. Phil Scott has tied the lifting of restrictions to the vaccination rate. He offered to lift all remaining restrictions before a July 4 deadline if 80% of those eligible get vaccinated.Landrigan figured it will take a nationwide vaccination rate of at least 85% to snuff out the virus. But for now, the steep drop in cases gave him hope that pandemic-level infection rates will soon be a thing of the past.“It is getting to the point to where by the Fourth of July we might be able to declare this thing over," he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-covid-19-cases-in-us-plummet-to-lowest-levels-since-last-june-101621727716954.html

23-05-2021||World||Over 70 police officers have quit since storming of US Capitol in January||More than 70 Capitol police officers have quit after the events of January 6, when a crowd of supporters of former US President Donald Trump stormed the US Capitol in Washington, D.C., in an attempt to interrupt the vote count, the Politico reported on Saturday, citing the police union.According to the Capitol Police union chair Gus Papathanasiou, officers are "demoralized" and "looking for a way out" as they face longer working hours for an indefinite period of time and deal with the trauma caused by the recent attacks, the news outlet stated."What keeps me awake at night is not the challenge of hiring and training more police officers, but keeping the officers we have right now. We have many officers on the fence about whether to stay with this department," Papathanasiou was cited as saying by the Politico.On Thursday, the US lawmakers passed a $1.9 billion emergency funding bill aimed to enhance the security of the Capitol. It provides for overtime pay, hazard pay and retention bonuses, in addition to more equipment and better training for the police officers. However, this measure may not be enough to solve the issue amid the surge in violence, the union chair was quoted as saying by the Politico.In early April, an unknown person approached the territory of the Capitol by car, shot down two police officers and then crashed into a fence. After that, he got out of the car and, allegedly, rushed at the police brandishing a knife. In response, the officers opened fire. The attacker and one of the wounded police officers died in the hospital.On January 6, a crowd of supporters of then President Donald Trump ransacked the US Capitol and disrupted the work of Congress counting electoral votes to formalize Joe Biden's victory. More than 140 people were reportedly injured in the storming, five people died of various causes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/over-70-police-officers-have-quit-since-storming-of-us-capitol-in-january-101621723701073.html
23-05-2021||India||Kamal Nath booked for saying ‘Indian Covid-19 variant’ responsible for second wave||Madhya Pradesh Congress Committee (MPCC) president Kamal Nath was booked on Sunday for allegedly maligning the image of India internationally by claiming that the ‘Indian variant’ of the Covid-19 virus was responsible for the second wave in the country, police said.The case was registered on the complaint of medical education department minister, Vishwas Sarang and other BJP leaders. BJP leaders alleged that the Congress leader held a virtual press conference and blamed the ‘Indian strain’ for the deadly second wave. BJP leaders also lodged the complaint on a video that went viral on social media in which Nath can be seen addressing Congress MLAs on the issue of shortage of fertilizers and other issues and telling them it is the right opportunity to start a fire so that farmers would get justice. The case has been registered under Section 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant) of IPC and Section 54 (punishment for false warning) of Disaster Management Act by the Crime Branch, Irshad Wali, deputy inspector general (DIG) of police said. According to the FIR, “Kamal Nath said Covid-19 started with the Chinese variant but now it is the Indian variant of Covid-19 which is responsible for the second wave and many countries have suspended flights due to the Indian variant. Nath also said Indians who are working and studying in foreign countries are facing trouble due to it. But in reality foreign countries are trying to help India by sending important items to fight against the epidemic. Nath tried to misguide people and to create disturbance in the country.”“Nath also violated the norms of WHO, in which the organisation clearly said no variant of the virus should be named after a country, person, organisations and birds’ names,” reads the FIR.The FIR also mentions that Kamal Nath tried to spread anarchy by telling Congress MLAs to start a fire to ensure justice for agitating farmers. “Nath and other Congressmen are trying to create unrest in India and MP by doing dirty politics as they had done during the 1984 riots. Nath insulted our country internationally and he should be booked under sedition charges,” Vishwas Sarang said. After the FIR against him Kamal Nath said, “People who lost family members due to shortage of oxygen, injections, beds and other facilities during the second wave should also register an FIR against the heartless chief minister and other ministers of MP. People, who lost their family members due to Covid-19 and their deaths have not been included as Covid deaths, should also register an FIR against the CM and his cabinet ministers.” Former minister and Congress MLA Jitu Patwari said, “The BJP-led state government is misusing power to hide the data and the real pain of Covid-19 infected people. They are not concerned about India’s image but they are more concerned about the Prime Minister and BJP’s image. They should book all the Congress leaders because we will not keep mum on lies of the state and central government.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kamal-nath-booked-for-saying-indian-covid-19-variant-responsible-for-second-wave-101621793764264.html
23-05-2021||India||In Bihar, vaccination for those in 18-44 age group resumes after day’s interruption||Patna resumed regular vaccination against coronavirus for the 18-44 years age group on Sunday, after forced interruption on Saturday, when it ran out of supplies. On paper, however, vaccination did not stop in the state capital even on Saturday. The State Health Society, Bihar (SHSB), which meticulously plans vaccination session sites depending on the availability of vaccines in the state, operated six special camps, where it inoculated 822 people — a symbolic number though against a target population of 5.39 crore in the 18-44 years category in the state. The special camps were held at different offices, including the Raj Bhawan, Delhivery, Chanakya Law University, Indian Oil, Judges Court City and the NTPC-Barh on Saturday. All the 57 regular vaccination session sites, including the 46 rural and urban primary health centres in Patna, were shut in the absence of vaccines, said an official who did not wish to be named. Those trying to pre-book vaccination slots, a pre-requisite for the 18-44 years population, had a harrowing time doing it on the CoWIN portal. There were some districts left with less than 1,000 doses of vaccine, forcing them to close many vaccination session sites. “We manage our session sites as per availability of vaccines. We have to do fire-fighting every day,” said Manoj Kumar, executive director, State Health Society, Bihar. Patna civil surgeon Dr Vibha Kumari Singh also came out in defence of the government. “We cannot entirely close vaccination in the district. So, we reduce the number of vaccination session sites to keep the vaccinations low in case of shortage of vaccines. We have no control over it (supplies),” said Dr Singh. The state received 4.89 lakh doses of the vaccine for the 18-44 years age group on Saturday. Out of this, Patna received around 50,000 doses of the vaccines on Saturday evening and was able to revive its 57 session sites for vaccination on Sunday. After being able to vaccinate 47,207 people on Saturday, the state inoculated 1,24,175 on Sunday against its initial target to vaccinate 2.50 lakh people per day and against 7.50 crore people to be vaccinated in the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-bihar-vaccination-for-those-in-18-44-age-group-resumes-after-day-s-interruption-101621790524174.html

"I am not against allopathy. Rather I admit that allopathy has been serving humanity through the continuous progress it made," Ramdev wrote expressing regret that his reading out the WhatsApp message which denigrated modern medical science may have hurt people's sentiments.The move comes after Union health minister Dr Harsh Vardhan wrote a letter to Ramdev urging him to withdraw the statements as those have hurt the doctors' fraternity who are fighting day in and day out. Doctors are "akin to deities for the people of the nation," Dr Vardhan said.माननीय श्री @drharshvardhan जी आपका पत्र प्राप्त हुआ,उसके संदर्भ में चिकित्सा पद्दतियों के संघर्ष के इस पूरे विवाद को खेदपूर्वक विराम देते हुए मैं अपना वक्तव्य वापिस लेता हूँ और यह पत्र आपको संप्रेषित कर रहा हूं- pic.twitter.com/jEAr59VtEeA video of Ramdev went viral in which Ramdev was seen calling allopathic medicine 'tamasha'. 'waste' etc."At this time calling presently practised treatment as 'Tamasha' you have not only questioned the allopathy but also the ability and motive of the doctors practising it, which is inappropriate," the health minister wrote.Though Ramdev expressed regret, he said criticism of any branch of medicine should not be seen as an attack and it is in no way opposing science. "Everyone should progress through self-evaluation. Some allopathic doctors too consider Indian medical science, Ayurveda, yoga as pseudo-science, which hurts crores of people."If modern medical science has come up with the treatment of polio, chickenpox, then Yoga, Ayurveda and naturopathy too have worked towards finding a permanent way out for blood pressure, sugar, thyroid, arthritis, fatty liver, hepatitis, asthma and several genetic diseases," Ramdev said."I respect allopathy doctors who have saved crores of lives during the Covid-19 pandemic. We too have saved many lives through Yoga and Ayurveda; that too should be respected," the Yoga guru said.The Indian Medical Association on Saturday sent a legal notice to Ramdev over this statement and sought prosecution of Ramdev under the Epidemic Act.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ramdev-withdraws-statement-on-allopathy-but-says-self-evaluation-is-necessary-101621789708240.html

Experts explain||Amid the sharp rise of the cases of mucormycosis or black fungus among Covid-19 patients in India, experts have warned that this fungal infection can happen even without Covid and so those who have high blood sugar level should be on alert."This is an infection which was present before Covid too. What medical students are taught about black fungus is that this infects diabetic people — those who have uncontrolled diabetes. The combination of uncontrolled diabetes and some other significant disease may lead to black fungus," Niti Aayog (health) member VK Paul said.Explaining the severity of diabetes which makes one vulnerable to black fungus, Dr Paul said blood sugar level reaches 700-800, a situation medically known as diabetic ketoacidosis, attack of black fungus, be in among children or older people, is common.Diabetes, cold oxygen, unwashed masks: AIIMS doctor lists reasons for rise in black fungus cases"Any other diseases like pneumonia aggravate the situation. Now, there is Covid which itself has its impacts. Then comes the use of the steroid. All these have compounded the situation, but in short people without Covid can also get mucormycosis, if the other conditions are present," Dr Paul said.Healthy people have no need to worry about this infection, AIIMS' Dr Nikhil Tandon has said adding that those who have weakened immunity are only at a greater risk."It may have happened that the Covid variant in the second wave of the pandemic has attacked the immunity more than the first wave which is why so many cases of mucormycosis are being reported. In addition to this, there has been rampant use of steroids in this wave. But nothing can be said with certainty without proper investigation," Dr Tandon said.On Sunday, the total number of black fungus cases in Haryna rose to 398, with Gurugram reporting the maximum of 147 cases. Kerala reported four blacck fungus deaths, whle Uttarakhand declared mucormycosis as an epidemic. In Madhya Pradesh's Jabalpur, one case of white fungus was reported on Saturday, which doctors said is curable and common.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/can-people-without-covid-get-black-fungus-experts-explain-101621787722954.html

Earlier, 76.70 lacs vials of the drug were made to all states till May 23, thus total 98.87 lacs vials of #Remdesivir have been allocated across the country so far," Gowda tweeted.With a massive surge in coronavirus infections across the country, demand for Remdesivir has gone up manifold.The government has already waived customs duty on Remdesivir, its raw materials and other components used to make the antiviral drug in order to help augment domestic availability and reduce the cost of the injection.On April 11, the Centre banned the export of the injection and its APIs till the situation improves.Various drug companies have also cut the prices of Remdesivir injection following intervention of the government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/states-uts-given-over-9-8-million-vials-of-remdesivir-so-far-union-minister-sadananda-gowda-101621784647543.html

The state government relaxed a few lockdown regulations so that essential goods and agricultural products can be moved and emergency activities initiated in south Bengal. During the day, the Indian Air Force deployed a C-130 aircraft to carry 21 tons of essential equipment and 334 National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) personnel from Patna, Vananasi and Arakkonam (in Tamil Nadu) to Kolkata and Port Blair. “The cyclone is expected to make landfall on the West Bengal and adjoining Odisha coast on May 26. The IAF has kept a C-17, an IL-76, three C-130s, four An-32s and two Dornier transport aircraft on readiness. Additionally, 11 Mi-17V5s, two Chetaks, three Cheetahs, two ALH Dhruvs and seven Mi-17 helicopters are also on alert for any eventuality,” the IAF said in a statement. The Alipore weather office in Kolkata said at 3 pm on Sunday that the low pressure noticed over east-central Bay of Bengal on Saturday had concentrated into a depression about 560 km to the north-northwest of Port Blair (Andaman), 590 km east-southeast of Paradip (Odisha), 690 km south-southeast of Balasore (Odisha) and 670 km south-southeast of Digha (West Bengal). It is very likely to move in a north-northwest direction and intensify into a cyclonic storm by May 24 morning and into a very severe cyclonic storm in the subsequent 24 hours. It will continue to intensify further and reach north-west Bay of Bengal by May 26. It is very likely to cross north Odisha and West Bengal between Paradip and Sagar islands by evening of May 26, said the weather office. In Kolkata, the city civic body beefed up operation at all 80 pumping stations so that rainwater can be drained out fast. “We have already started pumping out excess water so that the underground drainage system remains clear when the cyclone hits the city,” said Tarak Singh, a member of the board of administrators at the Kolkata Municipal Corporation. Civic body staff also started trimming overgrown trees to minimize damage to property and overhead wiring. People in large parts of the city had to live without power for days last year when Cyclone Amphan snapped electricity cables. Kolkata Police commissioner Soumen Mitra held a meeting with officials of the army, NDRF, civic body and CESC, the private power supplier to the city.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/air-force-carries-relief-material-ndrf-staff-as-bengal-preps-for-cyclone-yaas-101621784523791.html
23-05-2021||India||Will Covid 3rd wave affect children? 10 things experts have said||It is not yet known when a third wave of the Covid-19 pandemic will strike India. Experts are not yet certain that a 3rd wave will come. But amid apprehension of a 3rd wave later this year or early next year, states have started preparing, focussing mostly on protecting the children.Here is what experts have said on a possible 3rd wave so far:1. AIIMS director Dr Randeep Guleria has said there is not enough evidence that the third wave is going to predominantly affect the children. The ace receptors to which the virus binds itself to the human cells are relatively less in children as compared to adults, he said.2. But it can not be said that children can't be affected by the virus at all. They can get infected and can spread the infection to others, Niti Aayog (health) member VK Paul has said.3. However, the impact is mild among children. Generally, they do not require hospitalisation and symptoms may not be present.4. Efforts must be on to not allow children to become part of the transmission chain, Dr Paul said, adding that the age group when children become more mobile should be paid more attention.5. But is a third wave inevitable? The government's principal scientific advisor K VijayRaghavan said it will depend on many factors including how much the population is protected.6. By protection, he meant vaccination, immunity and Covid-19 appropriate behaviour. If a large population of any particular area get vaccinated and abide by all Covid-appropriate behaviour.7. A third wave is possible if there is an opportunity, in the form of a susceptible population.8. It may not occur at the same time at all places in India. It may not occur at all, K VijayRaghavan earlier said.9. The Centre has issued guidelines on how to treat Covid-19 cases among children. The Uttar Pradesh government has decided to vaccinate parents of kids under the age of 10 so that they do not get infected from their children if the latter contract the virus.10. Clinical trials of Bharat Biotech's Covaxin for the age group of 2 to 18 years have started. "We will have some degree of protection because clinical trials are currently underway for children," Dr Guleria has said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/will-covid-3rd-wave-affect-only-children-10-things-experts-have-said-101621783786753.html

23-05-2021||India||Health minister Harsh Vardhan asks yoga guru Ramdev to take back his recent statements on allopathic medicines||Health minister Harsh Vardhan on Saturday in a tweet asked yoga guru Ramdev to take back his recent statements on allopathic medicines and modern medicine saying that his statements have hurt the sentiments of the doctors who are fighting the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic.संपूर्ण देशवासियों के लिए #COVID19 के खिलाफ़ दिन-रात युद्धरत डॉक्टर व अन्य स्वास्थ्यकर्मी देवतुल्य हैं।बाबा @yogrishiramdev जी के वक्तव्य ने कोरोना योद्धाओं का निरादर कर,देशभर की भावनाओं को गहरी ठेस पहुंचाई।मैंने उन्हें पत्र लिखकर अपना आपत्तिजनक वक्तव्य वापस लेने को कहा है। pic.twitter.com/QBXCdaRQb1The health minister in a tweet said, "The doctors fighting the Covid-19 pandemic day and night, are akin to deities for the people of the nation. Baba @yogrishiramdev has hurt the sentiments of the nation, as it disrespected the corona warriors.""I have written a letter to him asking him to withdraw his objectionable statement," the health minister further added. The health minister in his letter also mentioned that he had spoken to Ramdev regarding his statements. Harsh Vardhan said that Ramdev terming allopathic practices as 'tamasha' and 'bekaar' were unfortunate. He highlighted that the current recovery rate and low case fatality rate in India is due to the efforts of the doctors. Harsh Vardhan also highlighted that given the current pandemic situation in the country it was unfortunate that Ramdev chose to question the abilities and methodology employed by doctors battling the Covid-19 pandemic. He also remined the yoga guru that Polio, SARS, tubercolosis, chicken pox and Ebola vaccines were also treated by vaccines which were possible due to allopathy. He pointed out in his letter that Ramdev is a public figure and since what he says is widely followed by the public the yoga guru should exercise caution before making any such statement. 'Your statements hurts doctors and weakens our resolve in this battle against the pandemic," the health minister said. Harsh Vardhan also shared images of the letter written to Ramdev, who in a viral video, running on social media platforms since Saturday, was seen saying that allopathic medicines have failed to cure Covid-19 and more people have died due to administration of allopathic medicines than shortage of medical oxygen or lack of hospital beds. Ramdev's statements were met with harsh criticism by the Indian Medical Association (IMA) who wrote strongly-worded letter to the Centre and also demanded the yoga guru's arrest for his statements. The Patanjali Trust on Saturday evening issued a statement saying that Ramdev's words were taken out of context and he bears no 'ill-will' towards allopathic practices or modern medicine.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/health-minister-harsh-vardhan-asks-yoga-guru-ramdev-to-take-back-statement-101621775459091.html

State education ministers and chief ministers of several states were also present at the meeting.Given the present pandemic situation, the Central Board of Secondary Education on April 14 postponed the class 12 exams and said it would notify the final dates by June 1. After the consultation, the government said that it will stick to this schedule and the dates will be announced before June 1.CBSE 12th board Exams 2021 Live Updates: No decision, States suggestion soughtAs the result of CBSE class 12 exams decide the admission of students to higher education institutes in India and abroad, this examination can not be done away with, the Board has noted. At the same time, the safety the security of the students and teachers should not be risked. Hence, the Board has explored two options.Under option A, exams of only 19 major subjects will be conducted at the designated centres. The assessment of the minor subjects can be done based on the performance of the major subjects.Under this option, the entire process will take three months, including pre-exam activities and the declaration of results. The Board said that this option is possible only when such a period of three months is clearly and safely available to the Board. August could be a convenient time but if the situation is not conducive to conduct the exams safely, then this option will not be viable.Under option B, exams will be held at the schools itself and instead of three hours, the papers will be of 90 minutes and questions will be of multiple option types. The students will have to appear in one language and three elective subjects only and the results of the 5th and 6th subjects will be assessed based on the performance in these subjects.However, the examinations will have to be conducted twice under this option based on when the situation in a state is conducive for holding the examinations. If a student can not appear in the first phase due to any Covid-related matter, a second chance will be offered. Question papers will not have to be printed in this option and so logistics will remain limited.Going by option A, the pre-exam activities will take place from Jule 1 to July 31 and the exams will be held from August 1 to August 20. The time slot between August 21 and September 5 has been slotted for evaluation while the tentative result date will be September 20.If the Board finalises Option B, then the pre-exam activities will take place between July 10 and July 15. The 1st phase of the examination will take place between July 15 and August 1, while the second phase will take place between August 5 and August 26. Evaluation will take place on a daily basis and will be completed by August 30 and the result will be announced on September 5.However, this is only a tentative schedule and the final one will depend on the inputs of the states. Some states have also wanted a mix of the option A and B, but all states have agreed that the class 12 examinations should be conducted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/over-75-of-states-want-option-b-for-cbse-12-exams-govt-sources-101621774647254.html

In the last 24 hours, there were 240,842 positive cases and 3,741 related deaths, the Union ministry of health and family welfare (MoHFW) dashboard showed on Sunday morning. India’s infection tally thus stands at 26,530,132, including a death toll of 299,266, as per health ministry’s data.With the daily Covid-19 caseload amid a relative fall, here are a few things to keep an eye on for next week:(1.) MHA’s national directives on Covid-19: Towards the end of every month, the Union ministry of home affairs (MHA) issues fresh nationwide Covid-19 directives or extends the existing ones till the end of next month. In continuation with this, the MHA will most likely issue directives for June in the coming days.Also Read | No restriction on movement of people and goods under new Covid guidelines: MHA(2.) Decision on international air travel: International air travel was suspended last March, along with domestic travel, as the first nationwide Covid-19 lockdown was announced to break the chain of transmission. While domestic flights resumed last May, the ban on international flights remains.Also Read | International passenger flights’ suspension extended till May 31(3.) India’s Covid-19 death toll to cross 300,000: Daily deaths due to the viral disease have seen unprecedented highs in recent days. India’s death toll due to the infection will cross the 300,000-mark, making it only the third country, behind the United States (589,703) and Brazil (448,208) to cross this mark.(4.) States to decide on extending curbs: Earlier in the month, several states extended restrictions like lockdowns, mini-lockdowns, corona curfews etc. till May 31 or June 1. Respective state governments are now likely to decide on whether to extend the restrictions any further or not.Also Read | 'Lockdown in Delhi extended by 1 week; unlocking from May 31 if...': Kejriwal(5.) Farmers to intensify protests: Agitation against the three contentious farm laws has continued despite concerns that the three protest sites in Delhi may emerge as Covid-19 hotspots. The farmers have, however, said they will intensify their movement from May 26, on the completion of six months of the protests.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mhas-covid-19-directives-decision-on-international-air-travel-what-to-keep-an-eye-on-in-coming-week-101621772461980.html
23-05-2021||India||Haryana farmers' convoy leaves for Delhi to join protest at Delhi borders||Defying the Covid lockdown, thousands of farmers gathered at Haryana’s Karnal and Panipat toll plazas before leaving in a convoy for Delhi in a build up to the May 26 protest, organised to mark six months of the agitation against the three controversial farm laws enacted by the centre.The gatherings at the two toll plazas, where many farmers were not seen wearing masks or maintaining social distance, was also aimed at dispelling the notion that their protest, which started at several points on Delhi borders in November last year, was dying out amid the second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic. On May 20, a large convoy of farmers from Punjab's Taran Taran had left for Delhi and a prominent farmer leader has promised that convoys of around 2,000 vehicles each will leave every week from one district of the state for Delhi to participate in the May 26 protests.Farmers have been protesting at five sites in large camps near Delhi’s borders: Singhu, Ghaziabad, Tikri, Dhansa and at Shahjahanpur on the Rajasthan-Haryana border, demanding the rollback of three laws passed in September last year to lift restrictions on trade in farm produce. They have described the laws as pro-corporate. However, the government has maintained that the laws are for their benefit.The continued protests have also sparked concerns of a potential spread of Covid-19 infections, but the farmers have refused to give up the agitation, citing it as a matter of livelihoodHaryana Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) president Gurnam Singh Charuni led the farmers’ convoy of SUVs, cars and bikes from Karnal's Bastara toll plaza, where they had gathered since Sunday morning."This new movement of farmers will not only give strength to the agitation but will also give a message to those claiming that the agitation is likely to end due to a decline in the number of farmers at Delhi borders," said a farmer leader pleading anonymity.With the harvesting of wheat finished and transplantation of paddy to start from June 15, farmers’ unions from Haryana are reaching out to villages for the past one week to ensure a huge gathering of farmers from the state reaches Delhi borders on May 26.So far, 11 rounds of talks between 40 farm leaders and the government have failed to resolve the crisis. Both the government and farmers called off the series of discussions on January 22, citing lack of progress. The unions have rejected the government’s offer to freeze the laws for 18 months. The Samyukta Kisan Morcha (SKM), an umbrella body of over 40 protesting farmer unions, which is spearheading the protests, has written to the prime minister on Friday, urging resumption of talks.Gurnam Singh Charuni, who is also a member of the Samyukt Kisan Morcha, slammed Haryana police’s action on farmers. "Farmers were beaten up and the police also registered FIRs against farmers but why did they not book the cops who had assaulted women farmers and damaged our vehicles," he asked.He was referring to over 350 farmers getting booked for rioting, unlawful assembly and obstructing any public servant in discharge of public functions among other charges after they protested outside a temporary Covid hospital in Hisar, where Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar was scheduled to inaugurate the hospital earlier a few days ago.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/haryana-farmers-convoy-leaves-for-delhi-to-join-protest-at-delhi-borders-101621772327952.html

Cyclone Yaas is likely to cause heavy rainfall and storm surge in the coastal districts of the two states while making a landfall anywhere in between north Odisha coast and Sundarbans.The Prime Minister has called for involving various stakeholders like coastal communities and industries and directly reaching out to them and sensitising them, the PMO said.“PM directed officials that advisories and instructions on do’s and don’ts during the cyclone [should] be made available in easy to understand and local language to citizens of the affected districts,” the PMO release said.The review meeting comes in the backdrop of the tragedy brought about by Cyclone Tauktae, that on Monday evening sank Barge P-305, which housed personnel engaged in maintenance work of an offshore oil drilling platform of the state-run oil and gas major ONGC, off the Mumbai coast. The death toll on the barge rose to 66 with the recovery of six more bodies on Saturday, while nine personnel are still missing, the Navy said yesterday.The ministry of home affairs is reviewing the situation ahead of the arrival of another cyclone and is in touch with the state governments, union territories and the central agencies concerned. It has already released the first instalment of the state disaster response fund (SDRF) in advance to all states, and the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) has pre-positioned 46 teams equipped with boats, tree-cutters, telecom equipment in five states and a Union territory. In addition, the Indian Coast Guard has also been alerted and the navy is gearing up as they continue to be on standby, the PMO noted.Union home minister Amit Shah along with senior government officials and representatives from the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA), secretaries from ministries of telecom, power, civil aviation and earth sciences attended the virtual meeting.Last year on May 20, south West Bengal was hit by cyclone Amphan in the Sunderbans with a wind speed of 155–165 km per hour and gusting up to 185 km per hour. It had killed 98 people while pummelling through six districts. Weather experts say that Cyclone Yaas’s landfall could coincide with the spring tide on the full moon, also on May 26, making the storm surge higher and devastating.In the villages of Bengal’s coastal districts, officials are making announcements about the approaching cyclonic storm and the evacuation process that could start on May 25. Fishermen were being asked not to venture out into the sea. District officials said that the number of cyclone and relief shelters, where evacuated people would be kept, was being increased by roping in school and college buildings so that social distancing could be maintained.The Odisha government on Saturday ordered all district collectors of coastal areas to bring people living in mud houses to cyclone shelters with Covid-19 appropriate behaviour.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ensure-timely-evacuation-pm-modi-at-cyclone-yaas-review-meeting-101621766279459.html

23-05-2021||India||Adar Poonawalla is the only official spokesperson, Serum Institute says after executive director criticises govt||Serum Institute of India's CEO Adar Poonawalla is the only official spokesperson of the company, the world's largest vaccine maker has clarified after its executive director Suresh Jadhav was found to be a little critical of the government's vaccination drive. Speaking at an online health summit, Jadhav said the government began vaccinating people from multiple age groups without taking into account the availability of stocks. He also said that the government did not consider WHO guidelines, as reported by news agency PTI.Serum Institute has made it clear that this is not the view of the company. "On behalf of our CEO Adar C Poonawalla, I want to inform you that this statement is not issued on behalf of Serum Institute of India Private Limited and the Company completely dissociates itself from this statement. It is reiterated that this is not the view of the company at all," Prakash Kumar Singh, director of government and regulatory affairs at Serum wrote in a letter to the health ministry, PTI reported.Gavi hopeful Serum Institute will resume supplies for COVAX by 3rd quarterIt also mentioned that Adar Poonawalla is the only official spokesperson of the company."Serum is committed to maximise its Covishield production and it stands shoulder-to-shoulder to strengthen the government's fight against Covid-19," the letter said.Jadhav said the government started the vaccination drive knowing well that it did not have adequate stock. Initially, 300 million people were to be administered the vaccine for which 600 million doses were required, but before that target was reached, the vaccination drive was opened to non-priority groups, including people above the age of 45 years and then people above the age of 18 years, he said. "That is the greatest lesson we learnt. We must take into account the availability of the product and then use it judiciously," he said.Serum CEO Adar Poonawalla defends vaccine export, says ‘daily cases were at an all-time low’The government in April approved advanced payment of ₹4,500 crore to both Serum Institute and Bharat Biotech so that they can ramp up their production. Out of this ₹4,500 crore, Serum received ₹3,000 crore from which Adar Poonawalla thanks PM Modi and finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman.Serum Institute has been the centre of several controversies in recent days. After the Centre allowed state governments and private hospitals to directly procure vaccines from the manufacturers, Serum courted controversies over selling the vaccines at different rates to the Centre and the state governments. After the rates were revised, Adar Poonawalla said in an interview he was under immense pressure and was facing unprecedented aggression over the vaccine.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/adar-poonawalla-is-the-only-official-spokesperson-serum-institute-says-after-row-over-executive-s-comment-101621763459875.html
23-05-2021||India||Jammu court denies bail to illegal Rohingya immigrants||A local court in Jammu on Saturday rejected the bail applications of two illegal Rohingya immigrants, who had prepared fake documents of Indian citizenship, saying their release could cause law and order problems and threat to national security.Additional sessions judge Jammu, Kishore Kumar, also said the court was surprised how Abdul Ghafoor and Ashiqur Rahman fraudulently procured Indian passport, Aadhar card, Pan card, bank accounts etc suggesting presence of an elaborate racket producing fake documents.Bahu Fort police had registered an FIR under sections 419, 465, 467, 468 and 471 of the Indian Penal Code against the accused after learning that two Myanmar natives were residing at Bathindi’s Rahim Nagar in Jammu assuming Indian identity. They were also booked under Section 12(b) of the Passport Act and 14-A of the Foreign Act.During police investigations Ashiqur Rahman was found to be in possession of a Pan card, a driving license, an Aadhar card, birth certificate and ₹140,000 in cash apart from passbooks and cheque books for J&K bank, the State Bank of India (SBI) and the Punjab National Bank (PNB). The other accused, Abdul Ghafoor, was found in possession of cheque book, passbook and ATM card of IDBI bank, a pan card, two Aadhar cards apart from ₹2.20 lakh in cash. None of the accused could satisfactorily explain how they procured these documents, police had said in its report.It further claimed that both the accused were residents of Myanmar who entered India illegally and were residing in Jammu, impersonating as citizens of India.After hearing both the sides and going through the police report, the court observed that the accused were involved in a serious offence.“It is very strange that they succeeded in securing a pan card, driving license, Aadhar card, passports etc and were operating their bank accounts in different Indian banks. The accused were involved in a very serious offence which carries punishment up to life imprisonment. It appears that there is a well established racket for procuring and preparing such types of documents for the accused persons and others,” the court said.It observed that the release of the accused could create many law and order issues and cause a threat to the security of the nation. “It cannot be ruled out that these accused persons may be involved in criminal as well as militancy activities in the state,” the court said, giving out reasons for rejecting their bail pleas.220 illegal Rohingya immigrants are already lodged in Hiranagar sub jail in Jammu’s Kathua district under an exercise by the Jammu & Kashmir administration to repatriate them to their native land on the instructions of the Centre.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jammu-court-denies-bail-to-illegal-rohingya-immigrants-101621763394841.html

23-05-2021||India||Goa panel for vaccinating lactating mothers on priority before '3rd Covid wave'||Goa should prioritise vaccination of lactating mothers having children below two years of age among the 18-45 age group with an aim to safeguard both mother and child against a potential third wave of Covid-19 pandemic, an expert committee has recommended to the government.“Mothers that are lactating were earlier not in the recommended category of persons to be vaccinated, but now we know it is definitely a positive [thing] to vaccinate all lactating mothers because they would pass on the antibodies to the babies and also be in a position to handle the baby, if god forbid the child tends to become Covid positive later on. So this is one age group we suggest to the task force to put on priority basis,” Dr Harshad Kamat, a member of the expert committee said.The expert committee of doctors from the government and the private sector, set up to advise the government on the third wave, has also recommended that those suffering from co-morbidities related to kidney, liver and diabetes are also prioritised for vaccination within the 18-44 age group.“We have requested the DHS that two groups should be given priority for vaccination within the 18-44 age groups: Lactating mothers (whose children are less than 2 years old) and those who have diabetes or renal failure or liver problems within the 18-44 age groups since they can develop severe symptoms,” Dr Jagdish Cacodcar also a member of the task force, said.The expert group anticipates that the speculated third wave of the pandemic could arrive around September and impact a greater proportion of children. While the group's recommendations are in line with several individual experts who have said that a potential third wave of the disease could impact more kids, the Central government's principal scientific advisor K Vijay Raghavan had earlier this month said that the next wave may not take place equally at every place if adequate precautions were taken.“We saw that last year, 7-8% children were positive and across the last three months, around 8-12% infected were children below the age of 18 years. So the percentage was going up. What was in single digits [during the first wave] has reached 11-12%. The same is the pattern all over India as those under 20 years of age comprise 12% of all confirmed Covid cases,” Dr Cacodcar added.The group has also recommended increasing the number of facilities to treat children since they are yet to be vaccinated against the disease.“It's not that the 3rd wave will affect only the children, but the proportion of children [among the infected] is likely to increase,” Dr Cacodcar added.“By what proportion will Covid-19 cases among the children rise is dependent on infectivity of the organism, schools reopening, people’s complacency and resumption of crowded gatherings,” Dr Cacodcar said. The Covid-19 pandemic has so far infected nearly 145,000 people in Goa and claimed 2,341 lives.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/goa-panel-for-vaccinating-lactating-mothers-on-priority-before-3rd-covid-wave-101621758025926.html

While 23 Dongria Kondh tribals had tested positive last week, in the last 3 days another 62 tested positive in Kalyansinghpur and Bissamkatak block of Rayagada district during an intensive testing drive. Similarly, 12 Bonda tribals living in Malkangiri district have tested positive for Covid-19.Expressing their concern that the Bondas and Dongria Kondhs are very vulnerable to Covid, the activists led by Lingaraj Azad of Niyamgiri Surakhya Samiti and social activist Prafulla Samantara in an open letter to Patnaik, said that the government should take special and adequate measures to protect the life of the two communities."The current protocol of home quarantine will not work within Adivasi communities because of different ideas about privacy and isolation in Adivasi cultures. Home quarantine measures within Adivasi areas are not the right way to contain the spread or break the chain of the pandemic," the activists said.The activists urged that instead of naso/oropharyngeal swab testing, saline swirl and gurgle methods of testing should be done twice every week for the Dongria and Bonda people. "Door to door surveys must be done by a team of trained local volunteers for regular monitoring of symptoms and reporting to quarantine centres for any suspected cases,” the letter said.The activists suggest that all the tribes in the area are given an adequate number of 3-layered masks, PPE kits, medicines and vitamins as safety precautions.“Further, home remedy treatment measures as prescribed by the ministry of Ayush also be considered as part of the treatment protocol wherever needed," they demanded, adding that all PHCs located in Adivasi areas are upgraded on a war footing and equipped with sufficient medical equipment, medicines, person power and necessary infrastructure.Samantra and other activists demanded that Dongria and Bonda families must be provided with a special livelihood relief package as compensation for their agriculture and minor forest produce which they cannot sell in the haats/local markets which are non-functional due to prolonged shutdown/lockdown.The SC/ST welfare department meanwhile started a ₹100 a day wage compensation for all PVTG persons testing positive for Covid for the next 14 days. As per the PVTG Covid management strategy, a health kit is being provided to every family of infected PVTG households, valued at Rs. 2,500.It also brought out a standard operating procedure (SOP) for Covid management in PVTG areas in which door to door surveillance will be done by rural health care activists and volunteers with the support of community resource persons. As per the SOP, persons with Covid symptoms should be isolated and tested and if an outbreak or cluster of cases is reported from an area, small containment zones may be set up.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/odisha-activists-seek-quarantine-centres-for-covid-19-hit-tribal-groups-101621756359079.html

The cyclone is expected to hit the land between Sundarbans in West Bengal and north Odisha.Union home minister Amit Shah along with senior government officials and representatives from National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA), secretaries from ministries of telecom, power, civil aviation and earth sciences attended the virtual meeting.At the meeting, the Prime Minister directed senior officers to work in close coordination with states to ensure the safe evacuation of people from high-risk areas and timely evacuation of those involved in off-shore activities.He also spoke about the need to ensure that time duration of outages of power supply and communication network are minimum, and if there is an outage, it is restored swiftly. PM Modi further directed officials that advisories and instructions on dos and dont's about the cyclone be made available in easy to understand and local language to residents of the affected districts.With Odisha and West Bengal bracing for cyclonic storm Yaas, the Indian Army on Saturday informed that it has arranged columns and engineer task forces are on standby for rescue and relief operations.West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee and Odisha chief minister Naveen Patnaik had earlier reviewed the preparedness for the cyclonic storm in high-level meetings with officials in their respective states on Saturday.Mayurbhanj, Bhadrak and Balasore districts are likely to be worst affected by the cyclonic storm, Umashankar Das, Deputy Director of India Meteorological Department (IMD) in Bhubaneswar said on Sunday."We are expecting that the well-marked low-pressure area over the east-central Bay of Bengal will concentrate into a depression during next 12 hours and by tomorrow (May 24), it is going to be a cyclonic storm and will continue to move in the north north-westward direction and on May 26 it will reach Odisha, West Bengal, and Bangladesh coast," Das was quoted as saying by news agency ANI.The head of Regional Meteorological Centre (RMC) in Kolkata Dr Sanjib Bandyopadhyay had earlier advised the fishermen of West Bengal not to venture into the sea from May 23 evening, and advised those who are in the deep sea to return to the coast by May 23 morning, in view of Cyclone Yaas.Yaas will intensify as it heads towards northwards, and will make the landfall as very severe cyclonic storm, the IMD has said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-holds-meeting-on-cyclone-yaas-landfall-expected-on-may-26-101621753141780.html

It is unacceptable & against the basic tenets of the service & civility. Civil servants must have empathy & provide a healing touch to society at all times, more so in these difficult times,” the IAS Association tweeted on Sunday. IAS Association is an organization of serving and retired members of the Indian Administrative Service.Collector Ranbir Sharma slapped a man and threw his mobile phone to the ground and encouraged cops to beat him up with sticks. After the video of the incident went viral drawing condemnation of his actions, Sharma apologised on Saturday, while trying to rationalise his conduct."Today a video is viral on social media in which I am shown slapping a man who was out during [the] lockdown. I sincerely apologize for today's behaviour. I never had any intention to disrespect or belittle the person in the video," Sharma said in a video statement before adding, "He was riding a bike and was speeding. The man also misbehaved with officials."However, taking a strong exception to the incident, Chhattisgarh chief minister Bhupesh Baghel on Sunday transferred the officer and attached him to the state secretariat as a joint secretary. Gaurav Kumar Singh was appointed the new district collector of Surajpur in his place."An incident of Surajpur district collector Ranbir Sharma misbehaving with a young man has been brought to my attention by social media.

23-05-2021||India||Petrol prices close to ₹100-mark in Mumbai after 12th hike in 20 days||After a day’s pause, fuel rates jumped again for the twelfth time in 20 days after petrol and diesel prices were raised by 17 paise and 27 paise a litre on Sunday respectively, making petrol costlier by ₹2.81 and diesel by ₹3.34 a litre since May 4. The hike has also driven the price of a litre of petrol one step closer to Rs100 mark in Mumbai.Petrol's price in Mumbai has reached ₹99.49 per litre, while the pump price of diesel in the financial capital is now ₹91.30 a litre. Fuel rates are costliest in Mumbai among the major metros. In national capital Delhi, Petrol price surged to ₹93.21 per litre and diesel to ₹84.07 a litre. While fuel rates in Delhi are the benchmark for the entire country, retail prices of the two fuels differ from place to place because of variations in state taxes and local levies.Petrol has, however, crossed the ₹100 mark in several cities and smaller towns, particularly in Rajasthan, Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh. Some of the cities selling the fuel over ₹100 per litre include Ratnagiri, Parbhani, Aurangabad, Indore, Bhopal, Gwalior, Jaisalmer, Ganganagar and Banswara.Retail prices of petrol and diesel are moving up despite a fall in international oil prices this week. Benchmark Brent crude fell by over 4.34% on Friday at $66.44 per barrel from $69.46 a barrel on Monday. State-run fuel retailers align fuel prices in India with international rates on the previous day.There are two key reasons for higher petrol and diesel rates – taxes on auto fuels and a spike in international oil prices. To be sure, much of the retail price is taxes. For instance, in Delhi, on May 16, central taxes accounted for 35.5% of petrol’s price, and state taxes, 23%. On diesel, central levies are over 38.2% while state taxes are about 14.6%. Through 2020, as global crude prices fell, the central government raised excise duty on the fuel to shore up its finances. States too followed suit -- with revenues hit on account of the pandemic.International oil prices and rupee-dollar exchange rate impact domestic pump prices as India imports over 80% crude oil it processes and pays in dollar. Brent crude closed 2.04% up at $66.44 a barrel on the last trading day (Friday) this week.According to executives working in state-run oil marketing companies, pump prices are also high because companies are recovering their past revenue losses like the one suffered for 66 days since February 27 when prices were not raised because of assembly elections in four states and one Union territory.During the 66-day pause on rate hike, state-run retailers had reduced petrol and diesel rates by 77 paise and 74 paise a litre, respectively in four small steps. But, the entire gains to the consumers were quickly reversed in the first four consecutive rounds of rate hikes starting from May 4.HT wrote on April 28 that fuel rates would incrementally move north after polls as state-run fuel retailers were losing about ₹3 a litre on fuel sales due to higher international oil rates at that time apart from depreciation of rupee against the dollar.The government deregulated the pricing of petrol on June 26, 2010 and diesel on October 19, 2014. Accordingly, state-run retailers are free to change pump prices every day. Public sector retailers — IOC, Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd (BPCL) and Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Ltd (HPCL)— controls almost 90% of the domestic fuel retail market.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/petrol-prices-close-to-rs-100-mark-in-mumbai-after-12th-hike-in-20-days-101621746981812.html

Dr P Sarat Chandra, senior neurosurgeon at All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) in New Delhi said that patients within six weeks of Covid-19 treatment are at the highest risk of contracting black fungus."One of the most important reasons is uncontrolled diabetes, systemic use of steroids along with tocilizumab, patients on ventilation and taking supplemental oxygen. Within six weeks of Covid treatment if people have any of these factors they are at the highest risk of black fungus," said Dr Chandra who also teaches neurosurgery at AIIMS.The doctor also said that administering cold oxygen is dangerous and anti-fungal drug Posaconazole has to be given to patients who are deemed particularly vulnerable to the disease. Chandra’s cautionary words reiterate the concerns raised by many health experts."Giving cold oxygen directly from the cylinder is very dangerous. Anti-fungal drug Posaconazole can be given to high-risk individuals to reduce incidents of black fungus," Dr Chandra said.He also cautioned against the long term use of face masks, advising N-95 masks be discarded after five uses and cloth masks to be washed daily. He also advised against storing masks in damp places, as after prolonged usage it runs the risk of catching fungus."Prolonged use of masks to be discouraged as any cloth mask kept in a damp place with prolonged use may catch fungus. Cloth masks should be washed every day and N95 masks preferably discarded after five uses. “Rotatory use of masks is preferred, that is, keep one mask for every day of the week and rotate them again,” he advised.States like Rajasthan, Gujarat, Punjab, Haryana, Karnataka, Odisha, Telangana and Tamil Nadu have declared mucormycosis a 'notifiable' disease under the Epidemic Diseases Act after a letter from the Centre.On Friday, AIIMS Delhi Director Dr Randeep Guleria said that Covid-19-linked infection has claimed more than 7,000 lives in the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/diabetes-cold-oxygen-unwashed-masks-aiims-doctor-lists-reasons-for-rise-in-black-fungus-cases-101621743246767.html

Working as a daily wager in a brick kiln in Jharkhand’s Dhanbad, Sangita says that the less repressive lockdown has at least allowed her to earn, even if it is a meagre amount for every brick she moves.“Last year was really bad, there was a strict lockdown, and one could not even work for a daily wage,” she said. “There was nothing one could do, and we needed the money.” She added that this time she was able at least find work. “I get paid for every brick I lift. In a day, I make between ₹200-150.” She works from around 10 in the morning to 5 pm in the evening.Sangita’s plight was highlighted on Saturday as the National Commission of Women (NCW) wrote to the chief secretary of the state and the All India Football Federation to intervene in her case and provide financial assistance to the sportsperson. “The condition of Ms. Sangita does bring embarrassment and shame to the country which should be addressed at priority. Ms Sangita has not just represented India on an international platform, but she has also represented Jharkhand in the world due to her own hard work and consistency,” the commission said.According to the state sports secretary Pooja Singhal, the government is ascertaining the details to provide Sangita all necessary financial support and the district magistrate of Dhanbad has been told to take stock of the situation.A state government official, on the condition of anonymity, said he believes that Sangita should be eligible for at least one of the scholarships offered to sportspersons. “Sangita’s case surely merits support, she is awaiting national trials,” the official said.The official added that the government had last year identified seven sportspersons and supported them during the pandemic by housing them in Ranchi. “The chief minister (Hemant Soren) takes a personal interest in sports, and even held the portfolio as a minister until a few months ago. A new sports policy is awaiting the state cabinet nod which will ensure that sportspersons can be provided accident and health insurance. It has been delayed due to Covid-19.”The official added that the priority was to ensure that Sangita receives the financial and structural support needed to pursue her career in the field. “The government will look into it and take action within the next couple of days. She is young, it is not a job that she needs, but the wherewithal to pursue the sport,” the official said.Sangita said she had applied for a scholarship last year, but no money had come through so far. “I did apply, but have not received any amount yet,” she said. She has one younger brother, one elder brother and three elder sisters. Her father, she added, has only partial vision, leaving the siblings to take care of the household.Sangita, however, is not expecting much. “Last year, the government interceded by providing ration,” she said. “The people who live nearby, some of our neighbours were the ones who got together and helped.”This has not stopped the young woman from chasing her dream though. Every morning at 6:30, she heads to the local stadium to practice. “I practice from around 6:30 to 9:30 and then head to the kiln to work. There is no morning curfew time, so I get to play,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/international-footballer-works-at-brick-kiln-jharkhand-govt-promises-help-101621737421562.html

Home ministers Amit Shah and other ministers will also attend the meeting.A 22-member team of Odisha Disaster Rapid Action Force (ODRAF) has been pressed into services by the state government in the wake of Cyclone Yaas. It has been asked to stockpile essential items and relocate people to local wind shelters.Here are the latest developments on Cyclone Yaas ahead of its landfall:||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cyclone-yaas-trains-to-odisha-cancelled-army-task-forces-on-standby-101621735857657.html

On April 14, the education ministry had cancelled Class 10 board examination and delayed the Class 12 board examination amid rising Covid-19 cases in India, saying that the situation will be reviewed on June 1.Sunday's meeting will be attended by state education ministers and secretaries. According to documents seen by Hindustan Times, the Centre has proposed to the states to conduct the Class 12 examination for major subjects only.Nearly 20 of the 174 subjects offered to Class 12 students are considered major subjects by CBSE. Board students take a minimum of five and a maximum of six subjects out of which four are considered major subjects.The education ministry had invited suggestions from various stakeholders that could also be taken up at the meeting.While a large section of students and parents have been demanding that the exams be cancelled, school principals have varied views on the possible options that can be explored."Under present circumstances, I visualize JEE type of online exams, through the involvement of the NTA. It would require setting up of the centres as per different locations, involving schools as self-centres or perhaps both. It would be a humongous exercise but can be at least considered for all major subjects opted for by a large number of students," said Sangeeta Hajela, Principal, DPS Indirapuram.Rajat Goel, Director, MGR School Rohini, said, the assessment exam can be conducted online by the CBSE or the school may be allowed to plan an internal exam."There can be another part of aptitude test that can be made an intrinsic part of question papers as it will help them in passing the entrance exams of various universities or colleges," he said.These exams are usually conducted in February-March every year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/defence-minister-rajnath-singh-to-chair-crucial-meeting-today-on-class-12-exams-101621731478134.html
23-05-2021||India||Fuel emergency on flight with Indian boxing team||A SpiceJet flight, ferrying the Indian boxing team to the United Arab Emirates for the Asian Boxing Championship 2021, was forced to circle around Dubai for 45 minutes on Saturday and allowed to land only after it declared a fuel emergency.While government officials said the delay was caused due to confusion over the flight plan in Iran’s capital Tehran, there were reports that the airline took 37 people (31 passengers and six crew members) on board after declaring the flight to be a cargo one. The airline denied this.“An Indian boxing contingent travelled on a SpiceJet flight from Delhi to Dubai today. The aircraft has reached Dubai safely and all passengers have cleared immigration. The flight and passengers carried proper documentation. The flight was not filed/categorised as a cargo flight and this information is absolutely wrong and is denied,” an airline spokesperson said.News agency PTI reported that there may have been some confusion over the approval of the contingent’s visit. The contingent included six-time world champion Mary Kom and one of India’s best boxers Amit Panghal.Interestingly, Boxing Federation of India subsequently issued a statement, thanking the Indian ambassador to the UAE for his assistance. The statement added that the team flew “under the air bubble arrangement”, with “all relevant permissions” and that two rounds of RT-PCR tests were conducted on the team -- at the airport and the hotel. Ajay Singh, chairman and managing director of SpiceJet, is also the president of the Boxing Federation of India.The airline said it was a regular passenger flight under the air bubble agreement with UAE. The UAE has barred all travellers from India since April 25 -- except UAE nationals, diplomatic passport holders and official delegation letter holders -- due to the second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic.The flight, SG142, was not allowed to enter the Iran airspace because the local air traffic control did not find the flight in their system, government officials said requesting anonymity.“The issue began when the Tehran air control declared that they did not have SG142’s flight plan in their system and asked the pilot to connect with the UAE airspace. The Dubai traffic control informed the same [that they did not have the flight plan] and said they couldn’t land unless there was an emergency,” said the officials cited above said.The flight was allowed to land in Dubai after it declared a fuel emergency, the officials said.“While the aircraft was holding in the UAE airspace, the Ras-Al-Khaimah traffic control [in UAE], after learning about the aircraft’s fuel asked SG 142 to land in Dubai,” DGCA officials familiar with the matter said.According to people familiar with the matter, the flight was yet to be cleared for return to Delhi till Saturday evening.Separately, the DGCA has also decided to conduct an inquiry into the matter. “We will conduct an inquiry. We will take appropriate action, only based on a detailed inquiry, which will take some time,” Arun Kumar, director general of DGCA, said.With inputs from agencies||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/fuel-emergency-on-flight-with-indian-boxing-team-101621723293530.html

23-05-2021||India||Covid situation stabilising, focus on improving it: Govt||The overall Covid-19 situation in the country appears to be stabilising and the government will work towards ensuring further improvement, the Union health ministry said on Saturday, even as it clarified that children are not immune from the infection, but the severity of the disease in this age group is lower than that in adults.“There are only seven states that are reporting more than 10,000 cases and six states with 5,000-10,000 cases. Six states are reporting a high number of deaths. These are Maharashtra, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, UP, Punjab and Delhi,” said Lav Agarwal, joint secretary, Union health ministry, during a press briefing.There are more than 93 districts where declining case positivity is being noted, he added.The statement comes as India’s tally of Covid-19 cases climbed to 26,528,515 on Saturday, with 240,566 new cases. The toll due to the disease rose to 299,309 with 3,734 fresh fatalities.Niti Aayog member (health) VK Paul said: “It is not that children are affected less by the infection; our sero-survey shows antibody prevalence in children to be between 10 and 17%. We also know that children can transmit the infection to others. When children do get the infection, the symptoms are mild most of the time. Fortunately, a very small percentage of the children need to be hospitalised.”He added that there was already a protocol in place for treating infected children that must be followed.Paul also said there was no need to stop breastfeeding after receiving the vaccine against Covid-19. “Now, lactating women can get the vaccine. But, there is a myth that breastfeeding should be stopped for a day or two after vaccination. This is not true. Breastfeeding should be done as usual; it should not be stopped. This is not part of any advisory.”About the surge in cases in rural areas, Paul said: “This time, the rural areas have also been affected. Given this, the jahan bimar, wahan upchar slogan becomes more important. Even those who are recovering at home should be connected to the health system for advice and it has to be ensured that those in need of hospitalisation are able to get ambulance, beds in a timely manner.”Asked about vaccine wastage, the health ministry said Covishield wastage has reduced from 8% on March 1 to 1% now, while Covaxin wastage decreased from 17% to 4% in the same period.The ministry also addressed concerns regarding the rising cases of mucormycosis or black fungus in Covid patients. Paul said the availability of Amphotericin-B, the key drug to treat the deadly disease, is now being increased and the ministry is in touch with five additional manufacturers. “The possibility of mucormycosis (also known as black fungus) increases when the blood sugar levels are uncontrolled. It is essential for people to control this. There is also a role of steroids; steroids are wonder drugs that can save lives. But if the use is not rational – if it is given before time, given for a longer duration, prescribed in higher doses than required, taken without need, and given for undue time – it can harm,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-situation-stabilising-focus-on-improving-it-govt-101621721246152.html

23-05-2021||India||DMA demands FIR against Ramdev||The Delhi Medical Association has written to the Daryaganj police station asking them to file an FIR against yoga entrepreneur Ramdev (Ramkrishna Yadav) for defaming allopathy. This comes after a video of the yoga teacher surfaced where he is seen saying that all allopathic therapies against coronavirus disease (Covid-19) have failed and people have died despite getting medical intervention.“The impugned video refers to the modern medical system – allopathy – as tamasha and stupid science on the pretext of failure of the medicines such as (hydroxy)chloroquine, remdesivir, fabiflu and other antibiotic drugs in controlling the spread of coronavirus disease and saving the lives of several people who died due to Covid-19,” the letter to the deputy commissioner of police said.The Indian Medical Association also sent a legal notice to Ramdev, stating, “You... claimed and stated that ‘Allopathy ek aisi stupid and diwaliya science hai’. In the past also, you have been claiming that modern medicine doctors are murderers, in order to sell your so called wonder drug/medicine for Covid-19 cure.”The organisation in a letter to Union health minister Dr Harsh Vardhan, himself an ENT doctor, has demanded that Ramdev be prosecuted under the Epidemic Diseases Act 1897 or that the minister accept his accusations and dissolve the modern medical facility.The organisation had earlier criticised the minister for being present at an event endorsing Ramdev’s Coronil that was claimed to be the first evidence-based medicine for Covid-19.A release issued by Patanjali Yogpeeth said, “It is clarified that the truncated version of the video is totally out of context… It is necessary to mention that the event was a private event and Swami jee was reading out a forwarded WhatApp message… Swami jee has no ill-will against the modern science and the practitioners of modern medicine… He believes that allopathy is a progressive science; and a combination of allopathy, ayurveda and yoga will be beneficial to everyone during such difficult times.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/dmademands-fir-against-ramdev-101621717300293.html

The survey was launched on April 12 but halted only after two days with the unprecedented spike in daily cases and the imposition of curbs to break the chain of transmission.The government has been carrying out sero surveys to measure the rate of exposure to the Sars-Cov-2 virus, which causes Covid-19.“The sero survey had to be stopped after two days because of the increasing number of cases. Now, there hasn’t been any discussion on when the sero survey will be completed. It is likely to happen only once the lockdown is lifted. This sero survey will capture the number of people who were exposed to the infection during the current wave,” said an official from Delhi’s health department.A senior district official confirmed the development, stating that the government has given no direction on what is to be done with the samples that were collected for two days in April. “The samples are sent to the labs every day after collection. However, we have not received any guidance on whether the samples will be included with the fresh samples when the sero surveillance resumes,” the official said.The survey followed the protocol followed in the previous round – just over 100 samples to be collected at random from each of the 272 municipal wards in the city. The total sample size was fixed at 28,000. With a portion of population being vaccinated, the survey was also to ask about vaccination history of the participants.The fifth serological survey in Delhi, conducted between January 15 and January 23, showed that 56.13% of the 28,000 people sampled tested positive.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sero-survey-in-delhi-likely-after-lockdown-101621717072186.html

Nadda has also mentioned that no public functions will be held to mark the anniversary.“…Unfortunately, the problem (pandemic) is so big that some children have lost both their parents in the pandemic. We are aware of their sorrow. It is now our responsibility to plan and take steps for their future. It is our social responsibility to stand with such children and take care of them,” the letter to the CMs says.The CMs have been asked to take quick steps to create a roadmap for the scheme keeping in view the requirements, circumstances and traditions of the respective states.States such as Delhi, Chhattisgarh, Himachal Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh have also announced that they will take over the responsibility of education and other needs of children orphaned during the pandemic. In HP, chief minister Jai Ram Thakur said the government offers Rs. 2500 per child per month as financial assistance for maintenance of such children living with the extended families till the age of 18 years. In Delhi, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal said the government will pay ₹2,500 per month till the children turn 25 and their education will be paid for too.The letter also specifies that no public programmes will be held to mark the seven years of the Modi government keeping in view the current state of the pandemic.The BJP-led NDA was elected to power at the Centre for the second term on May 30, 2019 with an unprecedented majority of 303 MPs. Nadda, has urged the cadre in the states to undertake seva or relief work and show gratitude to the people that they gave us the chance to serve them.The party has stepped up its efforts to provide relief materials to those in need and also relaunched its Seva Hi Sangathan (organisation is service) campaign to aid the government’s efforts of encouraging Covid appropriate behaviour.As part of the campaign, Nadda has been interacting with state unit functionaries, members of parliament and national office bearers to take stock of the relief work that is being carried out.According to a party functionary aware of the details, the party has so far set up 3,176 dedicated helplines in districts to help connect people with doctors and direct them on how to seek medical care. “So far 2,629 meetings have been held virtually, which were attended by MPs, MLAs and other public representatives.

23-05-2021||India||‘Insult to India’: Javadekar slams Kamal Nath for variant remark||Union Information and Broadcasting Minister Prakash Javadekar on Saturday accused Congress leader Kamal Nath of “insulting the nation” by referring to the B.1.617 variant of the coronavirus as the “Indian variant” and said the opposition party has not only been stoking fear and apprehension, but also weakening the fight against the pandemic.Addressing the media, Javadekar said Congress president Sonia Gandhi should explain why her party is engaged in negative politics and why she has not criticised her colleague and former Madhya Pradesh chief minister Kamal Nath’s statement on the variant being Indian.“He called it the Indian corona. And said Hamari Pechaan, Mera Bharat Covid. This is an insult to India. Many other Congress leaders have also done so. The WHO has already clarified that no country’s name has been attributed to any variant,” Javadekar said.To be sure, it has become common practice the world over to refer to mutant strains of the SARS-CoV-2 virus which causes Covid by the location where they are first identified. For instance, one identified in the UK late last year is called the UK variant -- even by Indian government departments. However, the Indian government has been vary particular about ensuring that no one calls the B.1.617 variant, first identified in India, as the Indian variant and even issued a statement in this regard.Nath, while attacking the government over its response to the second wave of Covid-19 had referred to the variant first found in India as the “Indian variant”.Commenting on the letter Gandhi has written to Prime Minister Modi on the procurement of drugs for patients of black fungus, Javadekar said the government has already taken proactive steps to procure the necessary medicines for the over 9,000 patients across the country.In her letter to the PM, the Congress chief said there is an acute shortage of vital drug Amphotericin-B that is required to treat Mucormycosis or black fungus. She also said that since the black fungus infection is not covered under the Ayushmann Bharat scheme that offers free health insurance to the poor, the government should provide relief to a large number of patients who cannot afford the treatment.Javadekar insisted that the opposition has not played a constructive role and instead created doubts about vaccines. “When Covaxin was developed after research in the country they called it the BJP vaccine; now when the vaccine has proved effective, they are spreading doubts and fears that there will be a travel ban because it is not on the list of vaccines that are globally recognised... As far as I know, WHO has not taken any such decision, but the Congress’s statements show the party is insulting the country and weakening the fight against the pandemic,” the minister said.His reference is to the Indian drug regulator’s unprecedented emergency use authorisation granted to Covaxin, in clinical trial mode, before even interim data on the efficacy of the vaccine was available. Subsequently, this interim data did show the vaccine was very effective, but it is still not clear on what basis the approval was given. News reports on Saturday claimed that as countries reopen for travellers, they will look for those vaccinated with vaccines approved either by their regulators or WHO. Covaxin is yet to be approved by WHO, although some reports add that this is largely a procedural issue and will be sorted out soon.Responding to the Delhi government’s demand for more vaccine doses, Javadekar said the Union government is making all efforts to undertake distribution of vaccines to all states. “The 50 lakh (5 million) vaccines that have been provided to Delhi so far were provided by the Union government. It is the Union government that has provided the 20 crore-plus (200-million plus) vaccines in the country and in future also it will continue to do so,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/insult-to-india-javadekar-slams-kamal-nath-for-variant-remark-101621712143824.html

In a telephonic interview with Vishal Kant, the chief minister batted for better coordination between the Centre and the states. Edited excerpts:Q) We are in the middle of the second wave of the pandemic. The numbers in Jharkhand have started falling. What is the government’s assessment? Have we crossed the peak?A) Our experience shows there is a lot of uncertainty related to this disease. It keeps going up and down. Now there are more features coming up like black fungus. I think the numbers going down could also be a result of the restrictions we have put in place. So we cannot lower our guard. Overall social distancing, using mask are the best practice to prevent oneself from the disease besides vaccination.Q) As you said vaccination is key to fight this disease. But it’s very slow in the state, especially in the 18-44 age group. What’s the plan ahead?A) There is no denying the fact that there is shortage of vaccines due to supply constraints. Initially, the Centre was doing the procurement and distribution. Then they suddenly left it to the state to procure it for the 18-44 group. That has led to a chaotic situation.States are now going for a global tender. And then there is no parity in pricing for the states and the Centre. But we are still making the best of efforts because the same people would turn around and blame the states if there is a delay in vaccination.Q) Will Jharkhand also float a global tender?A) Yes, its in the process. We will issue it within the next few days.Q) But do you think that would help?A) I am not very hopeful. Even if they do it is going to be a huge burden on states, especially poor states like us. There is no price parity. Spending hundreds of crores would be a huge burden. But we have no choice.Q) Some other states have said the Centre should be taking over the entire vaccination programme. Do you also advocate it?A) Absolutely. I made a similar demand from the UPA platform. And I still think so. It’s not too late. The Centre should be doing all procurement and distribution. They are allocating oxygen, medicines and equipment. Similarly, vaccination needs to be done at the national stage.Q) Centre-state relations often become a talking point. We have seen the conflict even during the pandemic. Your tweet about the PM went viral, with the BJP hitting back. Did you mean to say that such meetings/discussions are not fruitful?A) The basic thing is that there needs to be transparency. I tweeted about the phone call only after news started flashing on TV that he spoke to CMs. We saw the incident of Delhi CM Kejriwal. He was reminded about the protocol of the meeting. But how come what the PM speaks comes in the media. So how do we (states) share what we had to say in such meetings and about the demands of any specific state. My view was that the state governments need to be taken into confidence before taking any decision. Or else there would be problems in implementation. We have the example of what’s happening with the ventilators supplied to states.Q) CM Mamata Banerjee raised the issue of the PM-DMs conference? You were part of it. Do you share similar views?A) I want to clarify that I have no ego hassles to sit there with the DMs. However, such meetings are against the principles of federalism. Have we ever seen any other PM doing that kind of review meeting directly with the DMs. I totally agree that such meetings are done to humiliate us where we have nothing to speak or contribute.

Fight against communal forces will top the party’s main agenda,” said the new opposition leader.Satheesan (56) takes over the mantle from Ramesh Chennithala, who during his stint took up many popular issues and unearthed several alleged omissions and commissions of the first Pinarayi Vijayan government.The Congress had suffered a humiliating defeat in the recent assembly elections, which saw its strength reduced to 21 in the 140-member house.According to party insiders, the high command’s decision to pick Satheesan is considered a major policy shift in the faction-ridden state unit. The party has also given enough hints that Kerala Pradesh Congress Committee president Mullapally Ramachandran will also be shifted. Sensing his imminent exit, the state unit chief has expressed his desire to quit, a party insider said on the condition of anonymity. After poll debacle, many young leaders sought a major operation in the party to check its further slide.

23-05-2021||India||Andhra CM asks Centre to halt direct vaccine supply to private hospitals||Andhra Pradesh chief minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy on Saturday asked the Centre to do away with the policy of allowing private hospitals to procure Covid-19 vaccine directly from the manufacturers and taking up vaccination, at the cost of government hospitals.In a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the CM said many state governments had taken a decision to vaccinate people, including those in the age group of 18-44 years, free of cost. “However due to insufficient availability of vaccine under both channels of supply, only those who are above 45 years of age are being vaccinated in Andhra Pradesh as they are more vulnerable,” he said.As per the liberalised policy of procurement and pricing of Covid-19 vaccine, private hospitals willing to provide vaccination services could procure vaccine doses directly from the manufacturers, exclusively from the 50% supply earmarked for “other than Government of India” channel.Jagan said this liberalised policy was sending out wrong signals to the people. Due to the price differential offered to them and also the flexibility available to the private hospitals to fix the price of their vaccines, these hospitals are charging as high as ₹2,000 to ₹2,500 for each dose from the public.“This makes these doses one of the costliest in the world and inviting criticism from general public. Vaccine is for a public good and ideally it needs to be given free of cost or at least at affordable rates,” Jagan said.The chief minister said due to lack of enough supply of vaccine to cater to even the 45+ age group completely, there was no possibility of taking up the free vaccination of the 18-44 years for the next few months.“It appears very unreasonable to allow some private sector hospitals to vaccinate people of all age groups at such exorbitant rates. Not only is it a disadvantage to the poorer sections of the society who cannot afford such high cost, but it also creates a situation of black marketing of the vaccine, which administratively is a Herculean task to control,” he said.Jagan said though providing various options to the public to get vaccinated in both the government and private hospitals was a good idea, it was possible only if there was a surplus supply and availability of vaccines. “Since in the present situation, where vaccine supply is very limited, providing this option to the private hospitals, where in they charge an exorbitant price, is socially unacceptable and administratively difficult to monitor,” he said.He appealed to the PM to dispense with the supply of vaccines to private hospitals so that the entire stock was available only to both the central and state governments to take up vaccination of all eligible people.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/andhra-cm-asks-centre-to-halt-direct-vaccine-supply-to-private-hospitals-101621712186987.html

23-05-2021||India||Leopard, 2 cubs found dead near Mysuru, poisoning suspected||Bengaluru: A leopard and her two cubs were found dead in the Belavadi Industrial Area, about 12 km from Mysuru city, on Saturday, forest department officials said, suspecting that big cats were poisoned.The mother leopard was about 5 years old and the cubs were around a year old, officials said. Deputy conservator of forests (DCF), Mysuru, Prashanth Kumar said that a half-eaten carcass of a dog was found near the leopard. “It is suspected that the dog was poisoned and kept there to lure the leopard,” Kumar said, adding that the leopard and her cubs might have died after eating the poisoned dog. He said the standard operating procedure stipulated by the National Tiger Conservation Authority in such cases has been followed. The post-mortem was conducted and recorded in the presence of senior officials. “The viscera of the leopard carcasses have been sent to the Institute of Animal Health and Veterinary Biologicals at Bengaluru and the Forensic Science Laboratory in Mysuru. Once the report is available, we will be able to tell the cause of death conclusively. But it is very clear that this is an unnatural death,” Kumar said. The department has registered a case under the Wildlife Protection Act and an investigation has been ordered. A sniffer dog has been engaged to track those who poisoned the dog. “There were no instances of leopard spotting in these areas in recent times and the motive behind the poisoning remains unclear. At the same time, the State Pollution Control Board was asked to take samples of water from a nearby lake to examine if there was a high level of pollution in the lake, which caused their death,” Kumar said. A few days ago, a video of a mother leopard and a few cubs crossing a road had gone viral on social media. Kumar said they were different since the leopards in the video were smaller. The outskirts of Mysuru are an ideal habitat for leopards as the city is surrounded by reserve forests, sugarcane fields and jungles. Leopards are seen stalking cattle and street dogs near the city.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/leopard-2-cubs-found-dead-near-mysuru-poisoning-suspected-101621711019061.html
23-05-2021||India||Man alleges torture in custody, probe ordered||Bengaluru: Karnataka police have ordered a departmental inquiry after a Dalit man alleged that he was forced to drink urine in custody in Chikkamagaluru district, officials said. The incident took place on May 10 at Gonibeedu police station in Mudigere taluk of the district. The inquiry was ordered after the man lodged a complaint with the Chikkamagaluru superintendent of police (SP). In his complaint, the man alleged that Gonibeedu police took him into custody on May 10 based on an oral complaint by a group of villagers accusing him of creating a discord between a couple in the village. The man said no written complaint was filed against him, but he was kept in the police station from 11 am to 10.30 pm. “Policemen beat me up for a couple of hours. Then they asked another man who was in the lockup to urinate on me. He refused, but he was forced to do it. After that, they made me lick the urine on the floor,” he alleged. Chikkamagaluru SP Akshay M Hakay said that based on the man’s complaint, a case has been registered against the sub-inspector of the police station under the Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe (Prevention of Atrocities) Act. Hakay didn’t reveal the section under which the sub-inspector has been booked. “Deputy SP of Chikkamagaluru sub- division has conducted a preliminary inquiry into the incident and we have also recorded the victim’s statement. Now we have ordered a departmental enquiry, which will be impartial. If he (the sub-inspector) is found guilty, the official will get maximum punishment,” Hakay said. He refused to divulge the findings of the preliminary investigation. Asked about the action taken against the sub-inspector, Hakey said he has been transferred out of the police station. “We will discuss about his suspension,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/man-alleges-torture-in-custody-probe-ordered-101621710959000.html

23-05-2021||India||Volunteers lead Covid-19 fight in B’luru while braving personal losses||Bengaluru: At a time when Bengaluru, like rest of the country, is battling the surging second wave of Covid-19 pandemic, volunteers from across the city have come forward to help residents while braving personal losses. From providing meals, supplying oxygen cylinders, arranging hospitals beds to burying the dead, the Good Samaritans have made relentless efforts in coming to the aid of scared and scarred city residents. They did all these while battling their own adversities, including losing loved ones to the unprecedented surge of Covid-19 in the past two months. One such volunteer is Anne Morris, who helped in performing the last rites of 16 victims of Covid-19 on May 14, one of whom was her own uncle. She felt anguish that day like never before while volunteering, something that she has been doing since the first wave of the pandemic. “I have been helping to give decent burial to several victims of Covid-19, but when it came to my uncle, there was no one to help me,” Morris said, recalling her uncle’s ordeal. Morris, who is also the curator of the Indian Christian Cemetery, began volunteering with food distribution to migrant workers during the nationwide lockdown when the pandemic hit the country in March last year, before moving to help people with burials when Covid-19 deaths spiked in the second wave. “My uncle needed dialysis and we took him to a private hospital, which charged us more than ₹30,000. It was a daylight robbery and it made me question why I was doing the volunteer work in the first place,” Morris recalled. Besides her uncle, Morris also lost her brother-in-law, another uncle and her godfather to the viral infections, all in the month of May. While undergoing dialysis, her uncle tested positive for Covid-19 and died in a private hospital. Her 52-year-old brother-in-law succumbed to the infection after he was unable to get a hospital bed. “On May 9, after his saturation levels dropped, we approached multiple hospitals. We asked all volunteer groups we knew of, but we couldn’t find him a bed. It was only after five days, we got an ICU bed, but he died soon after he was admitted. By then, his condition had worsened,” she said. Morris said she was upset and anguished after suffering losses. “We helped so many and there was no one to help us. I wondered if I should continue to do volunteer work. But now, I’m back to work. A lot of people need help,” she said. Shahulla Khan, 45, was a third-generation funeral service worker at the Muslim Burial Ground on Mysore Road. According to his family, since the beginning of the pandemic, he had buried more than 300 bodies and even lived in the burial compound itself. He knew several Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) officials, who reached out to him for help in burying bodies, but when he fell ill, there was no one to help, his family said. Khaleel Khan, a relative of Shahulla, said they started looking for a bed when he first complaint of difficulties in breathing. As his saturation level began dropping drastically, the family began making frantic calls, even to the BBMP officials he knew. “We started looking for beds in the last week for April. We couldn’t find any oxygen beds. With help of some volunteers, we were able arrange an oxygen cylinder. We kept him at home on oxygen supply. But we were not able to find more cylinders,” Khaleel said. He added that whenever they called the BBMP officials they knew, they said there were no government beds available. Once his condition deteriorated, the family decided to take a gamble. “We tried several hospitals, but no beds were available. We then took him to a government hospital and told the security guard that we had reserved a bed. Once we were allowed to go in, we pleaded to the doctor, who allowed him to be on the floor with oxygen support,” Khaleel added. Hours later, Shahulla passed away. “Despite helping several families during the pandemic, when the virus caught up with him, he got no help,” Khaleel said. Another volunteer Sagay Raj Ambrose, who has been helping people to find food and oxygen during the pandemic, said he could do little when his younger brother fell sick. “I started volunteering during the first wave of Covid-19. Some told me about a family, where the son was hospitalised and an elderly couple were not able to get food, because they couldn’t get out. With the help of a friend, I delivered ration at their home. It all started there,” said Ambrose, who worked at the Bengaluru international airport. During the second wave, he helped several families in home isolation with ration kits and oxygen cylinders. It was during this time that he got a distressing call. “On May 6, my 45-year-old younger brother Vijay started facing breathing difficulties and his saturation levels were dropping. As soon as I got the call, I tried to get to the hospital, but nothing was working out,” he said. Ambrose said besides the non-availability of beds, hospitals were also demanding Covid-19 test reports before admitting patients. “Since his situation was critical, we didn’t have the time for a test, but with the help of a friend, we got a CT scan done. The scan said his condition was really bad,” said Ambrose. Unable to find an ICU, even with the help of other volunteers, he took his brother to a private hospital, where he was kept in the emergency room. “They gave him oxygen and an injection as well. We kept trying to move him to an ICU, but before we could get it, he passed away,” Ambrose said, wearing a brave face while recalling his brother’s story. Ambrose continues to be a volunteer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/volunteers-lead-covid-19-fight-in-b-luru-while-braving-personal-losses-101621710899068.html

23-05-2021||India||Autopsy reveals 14 injuries to UP vendor beaten to death by cops||KANPUR: A post-mortem examination on Saturday revealed 14 injury marks on the body of the teenage vegetable vendor who was allegedly beaten to death by policemen and a home guard in Unnao’s Bangarmau town on Friday.Unnao’s additional superintendent of police (ASP) Shashi Shekhar Singh on Saturday said there were several injuries on his body.“I do not have the report at this time. The information we have received confirms that the body bore injuries,” he said.Those privy to the autopsy revealed that apart from the body, injuries were noticed on the head. The nature of the head injuries suggested they were caused by boots, they said.The vendor was assaulted on a road and then at the Bangarmau police station on Friday afternoon for alleged violation of the partial coronavirus curfew in force in the state, it was alleged.He was selling vegetables, like many others in Bhatpuri area of Bangarmau, when police arrived and began chasing away people.It was alleged that he was brutally beaten up inside the police station, where he was taken in an unconscious state. As his condition worsened, he was taken to the Bangarmau community health centre where he was declared dead on arrival.A case of murder was registered against two policemen and a home guard after the alleged incident, which sparked a series of widespread protests. Police officers struggled to pacify local people who put up a road blockade, which continued till late Friday night.The blockade ended and the body was sent for the post-mortem examination after officers on the spot gave a cheque for ₹2 lakh as compensation, agreed to request the government for a compensation of ₹50 lakh and assured early arrest of the police constables and the home guard. The two constables were suspended and the home guard sacked.Though the case was lodged with Bangarmau police in Unnao, the investigation was handed over to inspector Indrapal Singh who is currently posted at the office of the Unnao superintendent of police. Officials said the decision was taken to maintain transparency in the investigation so that it could not be influenced at the local level.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/autopsy-reveals-14-injuries-to-up-vendor-beaten-to-death-by-cops-101621710659574.html

During the first wave in 2020, India had lost 748 doctors. With the updated toll shared by the IMA today, India has now lost over 1,000 doctors due to Covid-19.Of the 96 deaths reported in Bihar, 38 had taken place in Patna alone with 14 deaths reported from Muzaffarpur, as per a list released by the IMA, Bihar chapter. Five deaths have been reported in Bhagalpur and three each at Gaya and Siwan.“Doctors in Bihar have been working continuously. The committee has been formed to find out the reasons for death as doctors even in non-Covid hospitals and clinics have been treating patients. In many cases proper distancing with patients could not be maintained,” said Dr Singh, IMA national president (elect).The IMA president blamed the lack of proper care and facilities for doctors for such a high number of casualties. “In all government or private hospitals no beds have been reserved for doctors’ treatment. Doctors died for want of beds and ventilators,” alleged Dr Singh. “At least two beds could have been reserved for our fraternity members and the mortality would have been much less. After all, we are also working for the people and their welfare,” he added.Dr Singh was also critical of oxygen supply and said that the state capital has more than 200 hospitals (both government and private) but only 90 got oxygen supply during the crisis. “More than 100 did not get supply but still kept treating patients by managing oxygen in the name of humanity,” he said.The IMA has demanded that doctors should be properly treated even in private hospitals and beds should be earmarked for them. “We demand that those doctors who died due to Covid-19 should be given ₹50 lakh compensation amount by the respective state governments,” Dr Singh demanded and informed that IMA has decided to give ₹10 lakh each to families of poor doctors. “In Bihar, we are going to give ₹10 lakh to family of three poor doctors and this will be done in other states as well,” Dr Singh said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bihar-ima-forms-panel-to-probe-deaths-of-doctors-due-to-covid-19-as-toll-touches-96-101621708921390.html
23-05-2021||India||Odisha orders evacuation of those living in mud houses ahead of Cyclone Yaas||Ahead of the landfall of cyclonic storm Yaas between north Odisha and Sundarbans by May 26, the Odisha government on Saturday ordered all district collectors of coastal areas to bring people living in mud houses to cyclone shelters with Covid-19 appropriate behaviour.Chief minister Naveen Patnaik who undertook a review meeting, ordered all district administrations in the six coastal districts to immediately evacuate people so as to ensure zero casualty during the storm. All precautions should be taken and Covid-19 appropriate behaviour should be maintained during the evacuation procedure, Patnaik ordered. All those who will be moved to the shelter houses will be provided with masks also.According to the India Meteorological Department, a low pressure area has already developed in northern Andaman Sea which is likely to intensify into a depression by May 23 morning and turn into a very severe cyclonic storm by May 24. It will move north-north-westwards and make landfall anywhere in between north Odisha and Sundarbans by May 26. During the storm, the wind speed is expected to be around 120-165 kmph with 185 kmph gusts of wind.Special Relief Commissioner Pradeep Kumar Jena on Saturday said that arrangements are being worked out to ensure Covid-19 appropriate behaviour and oxygen supply in the state. The industries department is reviewing the situation with oxygen manufacturers and refill agencies so that there will be no production, generation and refilling problem. Further, contingent arrangement for stocking extra oxygen cylinders in Covid Hospitals is also being worked out.A contingent plan has already been made to ensure adequate power backup, drinking water, food and drugs, doctors and paramedics staff are available at all Covid Hospitals and Covid Care Centres.At least 66 ODRAF, 22 NDRF and 177 fire service teams will be deployed in areas likely to be affected by the approaching cyclone.As the condition of the sea is likely to get very rough during the cyclone, the Coast Guard has safely brought back all fishermen who had ventured out into the sea.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/odisha-orders-evacuation-of-those-living-in-mud-houses-ahead-of-cyclone-yaas-101621709339429.html
23-05-2021||India||Yaas approaches, navy, coastguard on standby||Cyclone Yaas will likely intensify into a “very severe cyclonic storm” and cross the Odisha and the West Bengal coasts on May 26, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) warned on Saturday, days after the strongest Arabian Sea storm in over two decades left a trail of destruction on the western coast and claimed dozens of lives at a barge off Mumbai.The memories of Tauktae and the havoc wreaked by Amphan last year have prompted both the Centre and states likely to be affected by Yaas to enhance their vigilance and preparedness. The fact that the crossing of the cyclone, by current estimates, coincides with the spring tide (which could mean more storm surges) is worrying, according to experts.A low-pressure area formed over the east-central Bay of Bengal and the adjoining north Andaman Sea on Saturday. “The low-pressure area is very likely to concentrate into a depression over east-central Bay of Bengal by tomorrow, the 23rd May morning. It is very likely to move north-north-westwards, intensify into a Cyclonic Storm by 24th May and further into a very severe cyclonic storm during the subsequent 24 hours,” IMD said.Also read | Cyclone Yaas likely to intensify into very severe cyclonic storm: IMDWhile a low-pressure area is the first stage of the formation of a cyclone, not all low-pressure areas intensify into cyclonic storms. However, the possibility of Yaas’s further intensification into an “extremely severe cyclonic storm” (wind speed of 167-221kmph) cannot be ruled out, scientists said. Yaas is named by Oman and the word means a fragrant plant like jasmine.An “extremely severe” cyclone, Tauktae, the most powerful one to barrel through the region in over two decades, caused gusts of wind up to 210kmph and nine-metre-high waves as it raced past Mumbai and made landfall in Gujarat on Monday night. The havoc forced governments in Gujarat, Maharashtra, Goa, Karnataka and Kerala to evacuate hundreds of thousands of people in low-lying areas with at least 60 people losing their lives in storm-related incidents. The storm also sank a barge off the Mumbai coast, resulting in the deaths of 61 people so far.“As on today the models are indicating that the cyclone will move towards and cross the West Bengal coast. It is, however, a large system and will definitely impact north Odisha and Bangladesh coasts. We still have five days so it’s too early to give exact details of its landfall,” said Sunitha Devi, in charge of cyclones at IMD.The National Crisis Management Committee (NCMC), headed by cabinet secretary Rajiv Gauba, met on Saturday to review preparedness for Cyclone Yaas in the Bay of Bengal, with the top bureaucrat directing various agencies to ensure safety of Covid-19 patients, hospitals and oxygen generation plants.“Reviewing the preparedness of the central and state agencies, Gauba stressed that all measures should be taken in a timely manner so that loss of lives and destruction of property is minimised,” a statement released after the meeting said.In view of the possible intensification of the low-pressure area, the Indian Navy has kept its ships and aircraft on standby for possible rescue and relief operations in West Bengal and Odisha. The National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) also deployed its teams in 11 districts of West Bengal on Saturday.Also read: Cyclone Yaas unlikely to match intensity of super cyclonic storm Amphan, says IMDApart from putting at least 14 of the state’s 30 districts on high alert in the wake of IMD’s forecast, the Odisha government has urged the Navy and the Indian Coast Guard to be prepared for the emerging situation. In West Bengal, district administrations, particularly in the coastal block and Sunderban islands, have already started strengthening the embankments that form the only barricade between the rivers and villages. Fishermen in West Bengal have been advised not to venture into the sea from May 23 evening till the storm passes, and those who are in deep sea have been told to return to the coast by May 23 morning.Last year, a cyclone named Amphan pummelled south West Bengal and coastal Odisha, leaving at least 100 dead. IMD officials have said they cannot rule out the possibility that Yaas will intensify like Amphan.Though Amphan impacted the same region last year, it commenced its journey as a low-pressure area over south Bay of Bengal; Yaas is over east-central Bay of Bengal. Both North and South 24 Parganas, which were devastated last by Amphan, are likely to be impacted again.Large-scale evacuations in coastal areas in India and Bangladesh were carried out last year because of Amphan. Around 2.4 million people were displaced in India, mostly in West Bengal and Odisha, and 2.5 million in Bangladesh. While many returned soon afterwards, damage to more than 2.8 million homes resulted in homelessness and displacement for thousands, a World Meteorological Organisation (WMO) statement said.“The sea surface temperatures over east-central Bay of Bengal are around 31 degrees C, 1-2 degree C above. Ocean heat potential is also high and all other conditions are favouring intensification. But its too early to say what shape it will take during landfall,” Devi said.The low-pressure area is very likely to concentrate into a depression over east-central Bay of Bengal by May 23 morning. It is very likely move north-north-westwards, intensify into a cyclonic storm by May 24 and into a very severe cyclonic storm in 24 hours. It is likely to continue to move north-north-westwards, intensify further and reach North Bay of Bengal near West Bengal and adjoining north Odisha and Bangladesh coasts around May 26 morning.Yaas is likely to cross West Bengal and adjoining north Odisha and Bangladesh coasts around May 26 evening. Over West Bengal, light to moderate rainfall at most places with heavy rain at isolated places is likely to commence over coastal districts from May 25, with significant increase in intensity subsequently, according to IMD. Light to moderate rainfall at most places with heavy to very heavy rainfall at a few places and extremely heavy rainfall at isolated places is very likely on May 26. Sub-Himalayan West Bengal and Sikkim are likely to receive light to moderate rainfall at most places on May 26 and heavy to very heavy rainfall at a few places with extremely heavy rainfall at isolated places on May 27.Light to moderate rainfall at many places, with heavy rainfall at isolated places is likely over north coastal Odisha on May 25 and over north Odisha on May 26. Sea conditions will be rough to very rough over Andaman Sea and adjoining east-central Bay of Bengal on May 22 and 23; high to very high waves (wave height of 9-14 metres; wind speed of 38-63kmph) over major parts of central Bay of Bengal, north Bay of Bengal and along and off Odisha, West Bengal, Bangladesh coasts is likely between May 24 and 26.Tidal waves of 1-2 metre height are very likely to inundate low-lying areas of Andaman & Nicobar Islands on May 22 and 23. Fishermen have been advised not to venture into southeast and east central Bay of Bengal, Andaman Sea and along and off Andaman & Nicobar Islands during May 22 to 24, into central Bay of Bengal from May 23 to 25 and into north Bay of Bengal and along and off West Bengal, Odisha, Bangladesh coasts from May 24 to 26.The cyclone may also support the timely onset of monsoon over Kerala. “Formation of such systems just before monsoon aids in monsoon onset. Monsoonal flow or winds are strengthened over the Arabian Sea. Monsoon is likely to make onset over Kerala around May 31, 1-2 days here or there,” said Devi.The April-May and the October-December periods are known to witness cyclones. Last May saw the formation of two cyclones – one in the Bay of Bengal (super cyclonic storm Amphan) and the other in the Arabian Sea (severe cyclonic storm Nisarga) – that hit the Indian coasts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/yaas-approaches-navy-coastguard-on-standby-101621707343514.html
23-05-2021||India||Vaccines work against B.1.617 but single dose may not be enough: UK data||The B.1.617.2 variant of the coronavirus, which is believed to have contributed to the devastating second wave of Covid-19 in India, does not render vaccines ineffective but it could require people to get both doses in order to be adequately protected against symptomatic disease.The inference, based on preliminary data from infections among people in the UK, has implications for India’s vaccination drive, according to experts who said the country must now focus on expanding coverage and may need to reconsider its decision to increase the gap between shots.Data from the UK, first reported by the Financial Times on Saturday, suggested a single dose may be significantly less effective against the new variant. “One dose offered 33 per cent protection against symptomatic infection from B.1.617.2, and 51 per cent against B.1.1.7,” said the report.Follow HT's Coronavirus vaccine tracker hereThe difference in protection reduced to a mere 6 percentage point when people were vaccinated with both doses, the report added. The data was based on a pooled analysis of people who received the Pfizer-BioNTech and the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine in the UK.When both doses were given, the vaccines appeared to offer 81% protection against the B.1.617.2 variant and 87% protection against B.1.1.7.Experts said that though there is a drop, vaccines continue to protect against the B.1.617 variant. “In any case both shots are required for good and lasting immunity so the focus should continue to be that. The data so far shows reduced but sufficient protection against B.1.617,” said Shahid Jameel, virologist and director, Trivedi School of Bioscience, Ashoka University.“The focus should be on vaccination at scale,” he added.A second expert said the findings reinforce concerns around delayed intervals for second doses, a policy that India and the UK have followed.“The UK vaccine dose delay policy is controversial and risky, and the Indian policy needs reconsidering. The protection conferred by a single dose is not going to be enough to stop the spread of B.1.617, particularly as the vaccines in use in India are not the strongest known. Even the mRNA vaccines struggle against the resistant variants when given only once,” said John P Moore, virologist and professor at Cornell University’s Weill Cornell Medicine.Also read: Govt, Pfizer hit an impasse on vaccine indemnity demandOn May 13, India announced that people on Covishield (the India-made version of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine) need to wait 12-16 weeks for their second doses, citing real world data from UK that showed improved efficacy when the gap between shots was expanded. But on May 15, the UK itself reduced the gap from 12 weeks to 8 weeks and accelerated rollout to more groups, citing the B.1.617 variant.Jameel added that it might be too soon to determine if the extended dosing schedules pose a risk.The B.1.617 is a variant with three sub-lineages – B.1.617.1, B.1.617.2 and B.1.617.3. Among these, whole genomic sequencing has shown that B.1.617.2 has grown rapidly in several parts of the world, including India, UK and US.According to an updated analysis by outbreak.info of data on the global repository GISAID, 58% of the samples sequenced in India over the last 45 days are of this variant, which now appears to have become dominant after rising from relative obscurity in mid-March. Along with B.1.617.1, the B.1.617 lineage now accounts for 70% of the samples analysed in the last 45 days.Moore added that the data from UK reinforce what has been observed in lab analysis. “I am not surprised by the reports from the UK. The B.1.617 variant is known to have a set of mutations associated with antibody resistance, and assays in a UK lab (Gupta in Cambridge) confirm that. It’s a set of mutations not any individual one that’s responsible,” he said.In an interview to Global News, the CEO of BioNTech, Ugur Sahin said on May 20 that he expects the Pfizer-BioNTech mRNA vaccine have around 70-75% efficacy in preventing infection of the B.1.617 variants. While this is lower than the 95% protection from the variant that was first seen in Wuhan, experts said vaccines are likely to still offer significant protection from severe illness.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/vaccines-work-against-b-1-617-but-single-dose-may-not-be-enough-uk-data-101621707528654.html
23-05-2021||Today's||From the 19th century, the story of a dissenting judge and colonialism||At a time when courage has become rare, one has to look up to those who stood for dissent in the colonial era. Syed Mahmood, son of the great social reformer of 19th century India, Sir Syed Ahmed Khan, was the perhaps first judge to espouse the cause of judicial freedom. He was born on May 24 in 1850. Mahmood made history during his six-year stint as a judge of the Allahabad High Court (HC) from 1887 to 1893, which was the highest position a “native” could hold in the British Government of India. He was the first Indian Muslim and the first north Indian to be appointed to any HC in India, besides being the first non-European member of the Allahabad Bar. From the age of 32 in 1882, he officiated as a judge of Allahabad HC thrice, before eventually becoming permanent in 1887.As a judge, Mahmood stood out for demonstrating judicial integrity through dissent. Even while he was still only a temporary judge of the Allahabad HC, he wrote dissenting judgments with vigour and fearlessness, and put humanity at the centre of his judicial universe, a digression from the purely legalistic approach of earlier judges.In his famous dissenting judgment in Queen Empress vs Phopi, he recognised “fair trial” as an essential part of the criminal justice system, in defiance of the then colonial law, to protect the rights of the accused in situations where they were neither present in person before the court nor represented by a lawyer. Similarly, in Queen Empress vs Babulal, his dissent put checks on torture of prisoners for extraction of confessions under the colonial evidence law.Thereafter, the chief justice of Allahabad HC, Sir John Edge, stopped assigning Mahmood criminal cases. Eventually, this hostility with Chief Justice Edge culminated in Mahmood’s resignation from judgeship in 1893. As a truly independent judge, he simply could not accept judgeship being dependant on the frowns and smiles of the British. Sir Syed, his father, saw it as a spiteful act of “Englishmen robbing Indian civil servants of their self-respect”, but was proud his son had the courage to stand up to the British. Tej Bahadur Sapru, a prominent Indian freedom fighter who helped in drafting the Indian Constitution, termed the episode a “public calamity”.Imagine those days of the last quarter of the 19th century when Justice Mahmood was the only Indian among British judges. As an Indian judge of standing in colonial India, he perhaps exemplified the burden of double consciousness — having to think of as an Indian judge in British India. As a son of India with a judicial aptitude far ahead of his time, many of his dissents were later accepted by the courts, and continue to be the law of the land. He was quoted by the Supreme Court (SC) of India in the Shayara Bano judgment abolishing the practice of triple talaq; and recently, in 2020, SC in Raghunath vs Radha Mohan, quoted with approval his judgment on the Muslim law of pre-emption.While Mahmood is most reputed for his metier in Muslim law, his judicial scholarship sparkled in other areas of law as well, leavened by his vintage quest for a reason to confront orthodoxy and dogma. His pronouncements on Hindu Law not only widened the grounds for Hindu widows for claiming maintenance, but were also useful in drawing the legislative framework of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 — the modern codified Hindu law governing marriage and divorce.The enduring light of Mahmood shines from the intellectual integrity he never let go of in moments of conflict. To the Indian legal fraternity, he will inspire us to learn deeply, think clearly and most crucially, never be afraid, when it is time to speak.Mohammad Nasir is an assistant professor of law at Aligarh Muslim UniversityThe views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/from-the-19th-century-the-story-of-a-dissenting-judge-and-colonialism-101621781044662.html
23-05-2021||Today's||Covid-19: When citizens protect the right to life||The right to life laid down in the Constitution seems in grave danger today with the coronavirus pandemic raging across the country. Our elected representatives, who are duty-bound to uphold this right, have been found severely wanting in this regard. However, in many places, citizens have come together at significant cost to their lives and livelihoods to lend a helping hand to those in need.Ramnagar village in Kanpur, with a population of 5,000, has seen five Covid-19-related deaths, with 50 cases being reported. The government’s overstretched health care system, which is hardly enough for the metros, was not likely to be of much help to this little village. But people did not give up. They collected money and created a corona relief bank. They secured basic necessities such as oximeters, thermometers and medicines. Isolation facilities were set up and the entire village sanitised. Ramnagar is now free of Covid-19.In 11 villages in Hapur in western Uttar Pradesh, people were quick to impose their own lockdown as soon as the second wave took hold. No one has left these villages for weeks and no one has been allowed in. As a result, these villages have been protected from the vicious second wave. These could be models for other rural areas, but it is unlikely that any political initiative will be forthcoming.Let us look at another heartwarming story of mutual cooperation. When Harendra Gangwar, a teacher from Bareilly, died of Covid-19, it was found that he was not entitled to the state pension scheme. Yet, ₹19 lakh was deposited in his account, thanks to the efforts of a self-care team. This team has been formed by those teachers who are not beneficiaries of the government pension scheme. Members of this team across the state contribute ₹100 each in the case of the death of a colleague. There are more than 45,000 members in this group. The government ought to be making every effort to promote such groups.Another inspiring story is that of Ashu and Akash, two friends from Roorkee. Neither of them were eligible for any welfare schemes either from social institutions or the government. Their families were in precarious financial situations already, made worse by the onslaught of the pandemic. Akash is studying for his bachelor’s degree and has to pay the fees to continue his course. To raise money for this, he started selling vegetables on an e-rickshaw portal with his friend, Ashu. Now, both can fulfil their immediate needs.There are thousands of young people who, despite being victims of adversity, do not want to make the rounds of government offices or charitable institutions pleading for help in cash or kind. They have confronted challenges and moved on with their lives, on their own. There are many women who have taken up the responsibility of feeding orphan children in their neighbourhoods. The tradition of Panna Dhai (a 16th-century nursemaid to Maharana Sangram Singh’s son Uday Singh II) has not been forgotten.On May 3, I had written in this column about how people are overcoming their own grief over the loss of loved ones and are collecting medicines for those in need. Such people have been and are the bedrock of Indian society and civilisation. This time of distress has been a learning experience for many Indians even as they face so much trial and tribulation. Job parameters are changing, businesses are reinventing themselves, social relationships are transforming and even last rites are taking new shape. In Varanasi, Christians renounced their centuries-old customs when they came to Manikarnika and Harishchand ghats with the bodies of their relatives to be cremated. Their ashes are being buried in cemeteries. Similarly, some people from Braj are immersing the ashes of the departed in the Yamuna itself, eschewing the practice of conducting this ritual in the Ganga in Haridwar or Prayagraj. This was never the tradition in this area. The virus is forcing many changes in traditional beliefs and customs.Today, in the midst of hopelessness and despair, these examples fill us with renewed hope that some good may come out of this terrible time. Society may put aside its differences and pull together to confront crises as the villagers I mentioned did. People may accept adapting traditions and customs when required. People may put aside personal considerations to help others in greater need.But our political class seems to have learnt no lessons from all this. They are busy hurling accusations at each other and playing futile games of one-upmanship. They should sit back and contemplate on what they were elected for — to uphold people’s constitutional rights. This is a task at which they have failed on all counts.Shashi Shekhar is editor-in-chief, HindustanThe views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/covid19-when-citizens-protect-the-right-to-life-101621781043598.html
23-05-2021||Editorials||When the pandemic hits the highest peak||A coronavirus outbreak on Mount Everest has infected at least 100 climbers and support staff, according to a report by Associated Press on Sunday. Lukas Furtenbach, an expedition organiser, said there were at least “100 people minimum positive for Covid in base camp, and then the numbers might be something like 150 or 200.” Other climbers have talked about the presence of only rapid antigen testing facilities at the base camp and the lack of adherence to protocols such as social distancing. While international climbers are required to take the RT-PCR test on arrival in Kathmandu, this isn’t uniformly followed. And there is no protocol for testing Nepali support staff. This means that Covid-19-positive climbers and staff may be mingling with others throughout the trek. The climbing season ends on May 29.Mountain tourism is an important part of Nepal’s economy, and Everest climbers alone contribute more than $300 million to the country. Last year, Nepal was forced to cancel all climbing expeditions, including those to Everest, due to Covid-19, leading to a strain on the economy and livelihood loss for the support staff. To offset these losses, Nepal issued a record 408 permits for Everest this season; an additional 125 permits have been issued for Lhotse, which uses the same base camp.While one can appreciate Nepal’s economic and domestic compulsions, opening up Everest this season — and keeping it open — is not just risky for mountaineers, but also other citizens. Nepal is already facing an unprecedented surge of cases, severely straining a weak health care system. It is time to climb down from the peak.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/when-the-pandemic-hits-the-highest-peak-101621781048550.html
23-05-2021||Editorials||End the farm agitation, now||Last week, the Samyukta Kisan Morcha, representing a set of farm unions, wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi. It placed the onus of resuming dialogue to end the farm agitation on him, while sticking to its demand for the repeal of farm laws and a legal guarantee of minimum support prices (MSP). On Saturday, agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar said that the unions should either accept the government’s offer to suspend the farm laws for 18 months or come up with an alternative proposal for talks to resume, and again rejected the demand for the repeal of laws. May 26 marks six months of the farm agitation. The movement is a classic example of how a grassroots struggle can lose its way because of rigidity and the absence of sound political leadership. It succeeded in bringing issues of India’s political economy, especially the transition in agriculture, to the forefront; it raised genuine questions about the process through which farm laws were pushed through in Parliament; it represented a moment of mass assertion in politics and pushed the government onto the defensive; and it drew international solidarity.But farm leaders failed to capitalise on their own political success. On January 26, elements within the movement turned violent, tarring India’s Republic Day celebrations. The unions refused to acknowledge that the government was willing to introduce a set of amendments to address their concerns, not wholly but substantially. They did not take up the government’s reasonable offer of the suspension of laws — an 18-month suspension effectively means the laws are unlikely to come into force during the term of the current Lok Sabha. They imposed impossible demands such as a legal guarantee for MSP, which will have inflationary consequences. And most fatally, they have continued mass protests even as the second wave has devastated lives in Delhi, Punjab, Haryana and west UP — and these political congregations would have played a role in spreading the infection, putting at risk the lives of farmers, their families, community, and society at large. With the Centre reiterating that its offer is on the table, the farm unions must accept the 18-month suspension of laws, end their agitation, explain to their own base why maximalism won’t work, focus on the pandemic, and engage in consultations to improve the legal framework over the next year-and-a-half. Instead of intensifying protests, it would be wiser to use the six-month landmark to move beyond the politics of agitation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/end-the-farm-agitation-now-101621781045727.html
