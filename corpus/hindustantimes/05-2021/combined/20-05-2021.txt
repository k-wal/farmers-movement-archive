This is not surprising. The government is after me,” Singh told HT.Asked whether he would visit the CID office in person, Singh said, “I have five days to think about it.”The first information report (FIR) was lodged on July 28, 2020, more than a year after Singh wrested the Barrackpore Lok Sabha seat from the TMC’s then incumbent MP Dinesh Trivedi who has also joined the saffron camp.The development came three days after urban development minister Firhad Hakim, panchayat minister Subrata Mukherjee, Kamarhati legislator Madan Mitra and former TMC leader Sovan Chatterjee were arrested from their homes on Monday morning by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) in connection with the 2016 Narada sting operation case in which they are accused to taking bribe. All four are in judicial custody.CID officials visited Singh’s residence at Bhatpara in North 24 Parganas district on Thursday night and put up the notice on the entrance to the house. He has been asked to appear for questioning at the CID headquarters in Kolkata’s Alipore area at 11 am on May 25.The case was registered at Bhatpara police station under sections 403,409,420, 486, 471 and 120B of the Indian Penal Code and Section 13 of the Prevention of Corruption Act.The state police had earlier raided the residences of Singh and some of his relatives.In August last year, police raided Singh’s home in connection with the case which allegedly involves financial irregularities to the tune of ₹11 crore at Bhatpara municipality and a local cooperative bank.Singh was chairman of the Bhatpara municipality from 2010 to 2019. He left the Trinamool Congress (TMC) and joined the BJP in March 2019. He also headed the bank’s board.Recognised as a heavyweight leader, Singh was a four-time legislator of the TMC from Bhatpara before he joined the BJP and defeated Trivedi in 2019. The election was marked by violence which continues intermittently in the region. Singh’s son and brother-in-law are also sitting legislators of the BJP.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/bengal-cid-summons-bjp-lok-sabha-mp-arjun-singh-in-economic-offence-case-101621535001495.html

The rates for the ambulance had been fixed by the district magistrate according to an order issued on May 9. – ₹1500 for an oxygen ambulance for the first 10km, and ₹60 for per kilometre thereafter), non-oxygen ( ₹1000 for first 10km and ₹50 per km thereafter), ventilator supported ( ₹2000 for first 10kms and ₹7 per km thereafter), advanced life-support with doctor ( ₹4000 for first 10km and ₹75 per km thereafter) and even AC and non-AC vehicles for shifting bodies to the cremation ground. “The officials were asked to conduct checks after we received complaints of overcharging by ambulance operators. The two persons were arrested, and their vehicles were seized. The transport department officials are also checking if other ambulances of these operators violated any registration norms,” said Ajay Shankar Pandey, DM. According to the team of officials which posed as a decoy, they contacted two ambulance operators at Lohiya Nagar over the phone. “We asked them for an ambulance to shift a patient to Bareilly. They told us the fare as ₹50,000 instead of the capped rate which is about ₹16,000 for an oxygen ambulance. Thereafter we said that we require a normal ambulance and they quoted ₹22000 to ₹24000 for the trip. We called them to an area near Sihani-Gate police station and got them arrested and their ambulances were also seized,” said one of the officers who led the team, requesting anonymity.“The owners of the ambulances are operating 11 such ambulances and we have asked the transport department to check their registrations and other compliances. If they are found erring, further action will be initiated,” the officer added. The police identified the two suspects as Hariom Yadav and Sarvesh Kumar. “Both were booked under section 151 of the CrPC and they both will be produced before the court of sub-divisional magistrate. The two ambulances involved were also seized,” said Krishna Gopal Sharma, SHO of Sihani-Gate police station.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/posing-as-decoy-ghaziabad-officials-get-two-ambulance-operators-arrested-for-overcharging-101621534304656.html

20-05-2021||Noida||Demand for medical oxygen drops in Gautam Budh Nagar||Noida: Demand for medical oxygen in Gautam Budh Nagar district has been on the decline and more Covid beds are now vacant as more and more patients have started recovering from the infection, officials said.While 125 Metric Tonnes (MT) of oxygen is required for all Covid beds with oxygen support in the district across its 27 Covid-dedicated hospitals, currently only 80 to 85 MT is being used as of now. A week earlier, the medical oxygen being used through liquid medical oxygen (LMO) plants or cylinders was 98.87 MT in the district.“Currently, the per day consumption of oxygen in between 80 to 85 MT across all 27 private and government hospitals treating Covid-19 patients, which is being fulfilled without issues, as the consumption has dropped due to slight drop in the number of fresh cases and increasing recovery rate. However, if we have to supply oxygen to all the available oxygen beds, we would require at least 125 MT of oxygen. For now, the situation is under control,” said Dr Sweta Khurana, nodal officer for oxygen supply, Gautam Budh Nagar. She added that while oxygen cylinders are available as well for patients, focus needs to be more on the stored LMO though plants.Officials also pointed out that now that oxygen supply is under control, more focus is required to ensure “a regulated supply of oxygen” and storage of LMO. “The situation began to improve from May 12, when oxygen started to be vacated in light of increasing recoveries. Focus is now towards ensuring a regulated supply of the oxygen which means a confirmed and guaranteed supply daily. For now the oxygen is being arranged by the district administration through different channels. However apart from Inox in Greater Noida, oxygen from other suppliers is not consistent and the quantity may vary from day to day. Also, we are focusing more on the storage of LMO,” said Khurana. On Thursday, there were 239 new cases in the district, while 436 were discharged over the past 24 hours. The total number of people discharged in the district so far stood at 55,520, as per the state bulletin. On May 12, the district had recorded 992 new cases, and 1228 recoveries. Back then, the tally for recoveries was 6,818 less, at 48,702.District divisional forest officer PK Srivastava, who had been looking after refilling of cylinders from Ghaziabad, concurred that the demand has dropped in the district. “By last week, we had to get approximately 1,200 D-type cylinders refilled from agencies in Ghaziabad, which has now come down to approximately 1,000 per day,” said Srivastava. The city at its peak last week refilled 1,890 D-type cylinders each 0.01 MT, and 200 B-type Cylinders each of 0.0021 MT.According to official records as of Thursday, of the total 2,458 functional oxygen beds in the district, 1,373 were vacant, while 219 ICU/Ventilator beds were vacant; as many as 917 out of 1,056 general beds in hospitals were vacant.Meanwhile, a 100-bed hospital with oxygen concentrators was started at Jewar. “This community health centre was shut for the past 11 years, so we repaired it using ₹50 lakh from my MLA funds. Help came from the Yamuna Expressway Industrial Development Authority as well, which helped us with infrastructure. An ambulance was given by the district administration, a generator was provided by the district police department. Even villagers came forward to help and it’s a fully functional facility with four doctors. We also received over 50 high quality oxygen concentrators and are working to make the facility better for rural areas,” said Dhirendra Singh, MLA, Jewar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/demand-for-medical-oxygen-drops-in-gautam-budh-nagar-101621533825412.html
20-05-2021||Noida||Noida authority provides 1,500 oxygen cylinders to Covid-19 patients||NOIDA: The Noida authority on Thursday said that it has provided over 1,500 oxygen cylinders to Covid-19 patients in need from its various centres in the city in the past 17 initial days of the service.The authority started supplying oxygen cylinders on May 3 from its two counters set up at community centres in sectors 93B and 135, amid the shortage of oxygen in the city.The authority provides the D-type oxygen cylinders of two different capacities -- 40-litre and 5-litre -- for ₹500 and ₹200, respectively. On May 11, the authority decentralized the process of distribution and started refilling empty cylinders at 10 more locations in the city, said officials. On May 16, it also started home delivery of oxygen cylinders to home-isolated patients who are either living alone or whose relatives cannot reach refilling stations.“Now, the pressure on the authority to provide oxygen cylinders has eased out, though we are supplying cylinders to the needy continuously since we started. We are now not receiving many calls,” said Santosh Upadhyay, officer on special duty, Noida authority.According to the officials, the authority has delivered 1,334 cylinders from its two counters in community centres, while it supplied 179 cylinders and 30 oxygen concentrators since May 11, when 10 more centres were set up. More than 10 cylinders and 16 oxygen concentrators were delivered at home since May 16, they said. “We accept empty cylinders and deliver the same within 48 hours after re-filling. Now, the demand is falling rapidly,” said Upadhyay.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/noida-authority-provides-1-500-oxygen-cylinders-to-covid-19-patients-101621533824593.html
20-05-2021||Noida||Second Covid-19 wave takes 311 lives in just 46 days in Noida||NOIDA: Since April 4 this year to May 19 or 46 days, as many as 311Covid-related deaths have taken place in Gautam Budh Nagar district. While April saw 121 Covid-19 deaths, the number of deaths due to the viral infection from May 1 to 19 was 190. Last year, the number of deaths in the district due to Covid was 91.GB Nagar chief medical officer,Dr Deepak Ohri said that since the past few days, the number of deaths recorded daily has come down, which is directly proportional to the number of cases. “We hope that the number of daily deaths will further go down by the end of this month, as the number of daily new cases is already on a downward trend,” he said.He, however, said that the case fatality rate (CFR) has been much higher in the second wave with respect to the first wave. “Even doctors are foxed with the number of deaths. The new variant of the virus is like a silent killer, which took the lives of patients within a matter of hours in some cases. The CFR of the district, which was nearly 0.35% during the first wave (91 deaths out of 26,100 cases), has mounted to 0.90% with 311 deaths out of 34,547 cases,” he said. Echoing similar views, a doctor of the district health department said that the second wave has affected age groups differently. “As per the internal data of the district, there has been a huge increase in the infection rate among young people, from 31% in the first wave to 39% in the second wave. In the first wave, the majority of infected patients were the elderly with multiple comorbidities. But, in the second wave, the trend has completely shifted, where the younger generation was more infected,” the doctor said, requesting to not be identified. Dr Akash Raj, the medical director of Super Specialty Paediatric Hospital and Post Graduate Teaching Institute (SSPHPGTI), better known as Child PGI, said that the virus seems to have acquired a greater transferability. “The entire spectrum of age groups – from the paediatric to the geriatric population – everyone is getting affected now. Predominantly, it is because the virus has changed its form and it is far more infectious. Every other person now has Covid-19, which was not the case last year,” he said.Dr Saurav Srivastava, the head of medicine and the in-charge of the L-3 Covid-19 facility at the Government Institute of Medical Sciences (GIMS), also said that any concrete reason behind younger people being infected can only be ascertained through in-depth studies and analysis. “However, all we can say is that ever since social restrictions were eased, it is the younger generation which has stepped out to go to work and indulged in social gatherings, and consequently flouted precautionary measures. We all have to continue to practice Covid-19 precautions, like social distancing, masking and hand-washing. We also suggest our patients to stay in touch with local doctors, who can provide information if Covid-19 cases begin to increase in their localities,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/second-covid-19-wave-takes-311-lives-in-just-46-days-in-noida-101621533584583.html
20-05-2021||Noida||Covid-19 deaths reach 400 in Ghaziabad, 125 patients still on ventilator support||Ghaziabad: Amid a steady decline in Covid-19 cases, the number of deaths due to the infection reached 400 on Wednesday in the district. According to the state health bulletin, about 73% of the fatalities, or 294, took place between April 1 and May 19.Officials of the district health department said that more deaths may occur in coming days as about 125 patients are still on ventilator support in different health-care facilities. The district had recorded 102 deaths till December last year. The major spike in fatalities took place from mid of April and extended to the month of May, the data showed. The previous highest in terms of fatalities were 50 in June last year. According to records of the district health department, the district’s mortality rate was about 0.76% on May 19. According to the data last compiled by the health department of the peak period from April 1 to May 13, 80 fatalities of total 252 took place in age group over 60 years, while 58 deaths took place in age group 41-50 and another 50 in age group 51-60 years. On a positive note, the cases are showing a declining trend in Ghaziabad. According to the health bulletin, the district recorded 2,507 positive cases from May 14-20 against 4,174 cases in the previous week (May 7-13). On Thursday, the district reported 364 new cases, taking the tally of active cases to 2,760.The health officials said that the 125 patients on ventilator support are from Ghaziabad as well as from other districts. “Recovery rate of Covid-19 patients who are on ventilator support is low. So, we are concerned about such 125 patients. Besides, many patients are also in ICU and on oxygen support. There are about 815 ICU beds with an occupancy of about 90%. At present, the fresh cases have reduced, but fatalities are still coming in,” said Dr NK Gupta, chief medical officer. “During the second wave, it is seen that patients in ICU generally recover within a week or so. If they take longer, the chances of recovery get reduced. Such conditions are seen in patients having co-morbidity,” Gupta said. Experts are of opinion that fatalities will ensue as patients are still under treatment in ICUs and on ventilator support. “Normally, in non-Covid cases about 60-70% patients on ventilator recover. However, this rate has declined to about 10-20% in case of Covid patients. So, utmost care is to be taken of such patients,” said Dr Ashish Agarwal, president of Indian Medical Association (Ghaziabad). Agarwal further warned that post-Covid cases need to be monitored till patients recover fully. “As a result of the infection, patients develop a lot of complications to lungs and also become fragile. So, it is expected that health authorities will have to devote another six months for post-Covid care,” he added. The district administration earlier this week issued directions that the Covid ward in hospitals will be monitored through the Integrated Covid Command and Control Centre (ICCC) and it will also take health status of the patients.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/covid19-deaths-reach-400-in-ghaziabad-125-patients-still-on-ventilator-support-101621533524611.html
20-05-2021||Noida||Challenge remains, PM tells officials as district magistrates of GB Nagar, Ghaziabad attend online address||Ghaziabad: Amid the ongoing Covid-19 crisis, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday interacted with district magistrates of several worst-hit states, including DMs of Gautam Budh Nagar and Ghaziabad. During the online interaction, the PM lauded the work of the district officials in fight against the pandemic, but he warned that the “challenge remains” as long as the infection is present in the country. The two districts in Uttar Pradesh are among the high caseload districts where total cases since March last year have crossed the 50,000-mark each. According to the state health bulletin, GB Nagar has 4,964 and Ghaziabad has 2,760 active cases as on May 20. “The Prime Minister stressed on the need to use local experiences and the need to work together as a country. He urged to spread messages on keeping villages Corona-free and following Covid-appropriate behaviour, even when cases are declining. He asked the officials to devise their strategy in a rural and urban specific way and ensure that the rural India is Covid-free,” said a statement issued by the Prime Minister’s Office. “He emphasized that the methods and strategies in dealing with the pandemic should be dynamic as the virus is expert in mutation and changing the format. He said virus mutation is concerning the youth and children. He stressed the need to boost vaccination drive,” the statement further added. According to PTI, the PM had video conference with DMs of 60 districts in the country. The two districts of GB Nagar and Ghaziabad were among the selected ones from UP. Suhas LY, district magistrate of GB Nagar, said that during a presentation given by the Union health secretary, there was mention of Noida with regard to the work done for isolation centres and day-to-day supply of oxygen. “In mid-April when cases started to surge, there was high demand for oxygen and our authorities started supplies to patients in home isolation. We also set up isolation facilities at our community health centres, besides the work done in this regard by RWAs and apartment owners’ associations. So, this way we promoted public-private partnership and the district’s name was mentioned by the Centre’s health officials during the presentation,” Suhas said. He said that the PM asked the officials to keep the morale high and stressed on the need to boost and share best practices devised during the pandemic. “The PM also stressed on the need for future preparedness to deal with any possible third wave. In this connection, we already have 100 paediatric ICU beds at our Child PGI and we have preparedness to come up with 125 of more such beds within two days whenever need arises,” Suhas added. During his recent visits to both the districts, UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath had also directed officials to come up with PICU beds in medical colleges and district hospitals in order to tackle any possible third wave which may also affect children and teenagers. Ghaziabad district magistrate Ajay Shankar Pandey said that the community health centres (CHCs) in the district have 30 beds each while the primary health centres (PHCs) have five beds each to treat Covid patients. “Keeping in mind any likelihood of a third wave, we have directed that 50 beds each should be roped in at the CHCs and provision of beds at each PHC should be increased to 15. This is done to provide immediate treatment to patients and if need be, they will thereafter be referred to any other health-care facility. Our focus is now on rural areas,” Pandey said. “We have also directed that 10 PICU beds should be created at Sanjay Nagar hospital and 12 others should come up at the district women hospital for children up to age of 12 years,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/challenge-remains-pm-tells-officials-as-district-magistrates-of-gb-nagar-ghaziabad-attend-online-address-101621533464559.html

Later, the district administration had called for claims from family members of the employees, who had performed poll duty and died because of corona. The administration received 74 claims and the same were scrutinised by a committee set up by the district administration. The committee was headed by chief development officer Shipu Giri. “We scrutinised all the claims but found there was none which fits the present criteria of getting compensation. Only the person, who has left his home for poll duty and had died before reaching back to his or her home after performing the duty, would be considered for the compensation,” said Renu Srivastava, district panchayat raj officer (DPRO). She further said the report has been sent to the government on Tuesday and if it decides to relax the norms or take any further decision, the same would be followed at the district level.Meanwhile, the teacher’s association has lambasted the decision of the state government and the set norms. The association had claimed that 1,621 teachers, educators and other departmental personnel who were on poll duty in the state had died due to coronavirus. They have demanded a compensation of ₹1 crore each to the families of the deceased and government jobs for the dependents.“The fact that the state government has found just three cases of teachers suitable for compensation in the state as per the laid norms shows the insensitivity of the government. First, the government and the State Election Commission committed a crime of deploying teachers and employees of different government departments and other organisations like many centrally-funded academic institutions for poll duty during the peak of second wave of corona in the state and secondly, during the election training, voting and counting, they completely failed to follow the corona prevention guidelines and take precautionary measures,” said state general secretary of UP Madhyamik Shikshak Sangh (Thakurai faction), Lal Mani Dwivedi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/deaths-of-poll-duty-staff-none-of-prayagraj-s-74-applicants-eligible-for-compensation-101621533344577.html

Face covers, sanitisers and Covid medicines would also be distributed through these chariots which were being managed by Sanjay Rai, the convener of the unorganised labourers’ association, the BJP leaders said. The UP BJP chief said in the first phase, these chariots would be taken to districts where there were many Covid-affected labourers from the unorganised sector. “The opposition parties must understand that this is not the time to do politics. Rather, it is the time to engage in welfare of the people. There will be many occasions to engage in politics,” he said. “Under PM Narendra Modi’s stewardship, the country is fast moving on the path to defeat Covid. UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath is also working tirelessly for the people, without caring about his health,” he said. Bharala said he hoped the chariots would visit places like Kanpur, Gautam Buddha Nagar, Agra and Moradabad as many labourers were working in industries in these districts. He also thanked chief minister Yogi Adityanath for announcing financial relief for people like porters, rickshaw pullers, cobblers and barbers who had been affected due to the pandemic. Meanwhile, UP BJP chief Swatantra Dev has praised the centre’s decision to increase subsidy on DAP fertiliser. “Now instead of ₹500 per sack of fertiliser, the farmers would get a subsidy of ₹1200 per DAP fertiliser sack,” he said, adding this was the biggest subsidy increase ever.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/up-bjp-chariots-to-create-awareness-among-labourers-101621533044531.html

The 37-year-old sea diver, Pawan Chand Katoch of Gharoh village, which is 6km from Dharamshala, went missing off the Manglore port in Udupi district, Karnataka. He had been employed with Under Water Services Limited (UWSL) since 2009 and was deployed on the tugboat, Alliance, when the deadly cyclone ploughed through the costal state. “We contacted UWSL’s senior diving manager Paramjeet Singh Jassal and vice-president Ravi Sexena but did not get a satisfactory response regarding the wellbeing of my son. We do not know whether they are putting any efforts to search for the missing men or not,” said his father, Jagroop Chand Katoch. Congress general secretary Kewal Singh Pathania met Pawan’s family at Gharoh and assured them that all possible help will be provided. He also wrote a letter to the chief minister Jai Ram Thakur seeking his intervention in the matter.“I urge you to take up the matter with the concerned state and the company to get information about Pawan Chand Katoch,” he wrote. It is learnt that the tugboat was contracted by Mangalore Refinery and Petrochemicals Limited (MRPL) for its single-point mooring facility.The boat with nine crew members aboard left the Manglore port on May 14 to carry out maintenance work at the facility, 17km from the port. While returning to the shore on May 15, the boat was caught in the rough sea and capsized.The damaged tugboat later washed ashore at Padubidri. Of eight workers, three survived, one died and the remaining, including Pawan, are missing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/cyclone-tauktae-kangra-diver-onboard-tugboat-still-missing-101621532085475.html

The fungal infection has been found to affect recovering Covid patients, especially those on steroid therapy or with a sugar imbalance. Dr Janak Raj, senior medical superintendent of IGMC, Shimla, the state’s premier healthcare institution, on Thursday said that the patient, a woman, hails from Hamirpur.

The fungal infection is under her nose. She is undergoing treatment for the same and her condition is stable.” Health authorities on the alert Meanwhile, a top health official, who did not wish to be named, said the government was on the alert and was ready to tackle mucormycosis. State National Health Mission director Dr Nipun Jindal said it had been observed that mucormycosis is on the rise among post-Covid patients in the country. “Uncontrolled diabetes, immunosuppression by steroids, prolonged intensive care unit stay, comorbidities, transplant and malignancy are predisposing factors for this disease. The state has already issued an advisory regarding the prevention and management of black fungus disease in the hospitals.”The district health society and directorate of medical education have been asked to take stock of adequate antifungal drugs such as amphotericin B in their respective institutions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/first-black-fungus-case-detected-in-himachal-101621529687974.html

During her fight with the virus, her oxygen level had once dropped to 70. Meenu is principal of a private school in Delhi.Her husband Rohit Chauhan, on April 1, she had come to Kurukshetra to take her daughter back from her parents’ home. She developed Covid symptoms and was then tested positive.She was taken to a private hospital in Kurukshetra but her condition started to deteriorate and she was put on oxygen support. Few days later, she could not recover and the infection spread to both her lungs.When she was unable to breath normally, doctors shifted her to the intensive care unit and put her on ventilator on April 8.“It was a critical time.

20-05-2021||Lucknow||Yogi Adityanath holds out compensation hope for kin of UP teachers who died on 'panchayat polls duty'||Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath on Thursday told government officials to work with the state election commission (SEC) to change the guidelines so that government staffers who died of Covid-19 after working for the recently-concluded Uttar Pradesh panchayat polls can get compensation.“The UP chief secretary and the additional chief secretary (panchayati raj) should coordinate with the commission and request it to amend the guidelines by including death due to Covid infection in a certain time period from the date of election duty. The first meeting should be held today itself,” Yogi Adityanath said at a Covid-19 review meeting on Thursday.Yogi Adityanath’s directive is a response to demands from teachers’ associations who have claimed that 1,621 government school staffers died due to Covid-19 between the first week of April and May 16 (two weeks after the counting of votes).The state government’s basic education department appeared to have rejected this demand on Tuesday when it insisted that according to official records, only three government teachers succumbed to Covid-19 when they could be treated on election duty under the existing rules.On Wednesday, the department announced that the government would give ₹30 lakh each to the next of kin of the three schoolteachers and a government job to an eligible candidate in each family. The four-phase panchayat elections were held on April 15, 19, 26 and 29. The counting of votes was taken up on May 2.The decision was sharply criticised by teachers and opposition parties who sought a liberal interpretation of the rules since there was a gap between the time when a person contracted the infection, fell ill and died. Studies have shown that the median time between someone testing positive for Covid-19 and dying from it is around 13.8 days.At Thursday’s review meeting, Yogi Adityanath said the state government had been acting as per the SEC guidelines so far for compensating any staff who dies on election duty, be it teachers, shiksha mitras, anudeshaks, rozgar sewaks, police personnel, or any government employee on election duty.“But because the guidelines are old — when Covid did not exist — so there is a need to have a relook with sympathy,” he said.A senior state government official said that any policy change would be with retrospective effect, factoring in the panchayat polls held in April.Hindustan Times has been reporting extensively on the issue, including the need to relook and change the guidelines. In the HT reports, several experts, including former chief election commissioner of India SY Quraishi, said the state government and the state election commission (SEC) should go for a “liberal interpretation” in case of casualty of government staff deployed on election duty, especially when the country is facing the pandemic.Dinesh Chandra Sharma, president of the Pradeshiya Prathamik Shikshak Sangh (a teachers’ association), welcomed Yogi Adityanath’s decision. “The step by the chief minister is worth welcoming and we stress that the compensation should be ₹1 crore and any policy change must be with retrospective effect,” he said. He added that the Allahabad high court had made an observation for the government to consider giving compensation of ₹1 crore.Giving a break-up of the association’s claim on the number of deaths, Sharma said: “Out of 1,621 government school staff, 1332 were teachers, 209 shiksha mitras (para teachers), 25 anudeshaks (instructors), five block education officers, 15 clerks and 35 other employees.”A former official with the state election commission, who asked not to be named, said, “One should consider the death of government staff on a case-by-case basis and there cannot be a generalised rule that can be applied to all cases.”Yogi Adityanath told the Covid review meeting that the state government is committed to providing all necessary benefits, especially, in times of election duties or any other such duties. So, get into a dialogue with the SEC and make necessary recommendations.”For his part, Sharma said: “The government should also talk to us for suggestions before formulating new guidelines. We suggest that the criteria should include getting Covid infection within 10-12 days of the duty, death within at least a month of infection. It should also include post-Covid death by factors such as ‘black fungus’.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/yogi-adityanath-reaches-out-to-up-teachers-seeks-change-in-compensation-rule-101621529504887.html

In a video message, the workers said that they are stranded in Nepal due to lockdown and most of them have fallen sick but getting no medical attention there. They have requested the Jharkhand government to “save their lives.”Migrant worker Narayan Das, a native of Ramgarh block of Dumka district and currently residing in Nepal, said that all 26 labourers from Dumra district are stuck at Gauri Gaon village in Sindhupalchowk district of Nepal. “We had come here for construction work in a hydro-power plant about two-and-a-half months back. A contractor from Himachal Pradesh brought us here. In past one week, we all fell sick one by one. We have symptoms like fever and cough. Some of us were given saline, but we are not getting proper medical care here,” Das said.He said, “Because of soaring cases of Covid-19, the lockdown has been imposed here. So, we are also struggling to arrange for food. We don’t have money to buy food and treatment or return home.”“We request the Jharkhand government to please help and rescue us from here. Otherwise, we might die without proper treatment,” Das said.The state migrant control room (SMCR) officials said they were in touch with the labourers. “We have communicated the Dumka administration to provide them immediate help,” said Shikha Lakra, SMCR team lead.Deputy development commissioner (DDC), Dumka, Sanjay Singh said, “We have been informed that around 35 labourers are stuck in Nepal. However, we are not focusing on numbers, as we have to bring all those stranded there.”“Since they are stuck in a foreign land, we have to follow certain protocols. The deputy commissioner is writing a letter to the Indian embassy in Kathmandu seeking guidance on how to rescue them. We will begin the rescue operation once permission is granted,” Singh said.He said buses would be sent according to the number of labourers stranded there. “A team of paramedics equipped with Rapid Antigen Test (RAT) kits would also go to ascertain the health condition of the labourers. If anyone is found infected with Coronavirus, we will ensure a separate arrangement to bring him. In case anyone found to be seriously ill, we will ensure to get a better medical facility in Nepal,” he said.Not only in Nepal, thousands of labourers, who are stranded in different states of the country, have also sought Jharkhand’s governments help for their rescue. According to the data provided by the state control room, as many as 6044 migrant workers are stuck in different states, including Maharashtra, Karnataka, Odisha and Chhattisgarh, and they want to return.Lakhs of migrant labourers working in different parts of the country have already returned home after cases started rising in April this year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ranchi-news/26-j-khand-migrants-stuck-in-nepal-develop-covid-like-symptoms-seek-help-101621527044325.html

With a huge tribal population inhabiting the 13 scheduled districts, low digital literacy and lack of proper internet connectivity are hampering the registration process through apps, the petition said.The state government has also mentioned that the vaccination process could be expedited in the state if it is allowed to use the portal developed by the state government, as it could work both online and offline, and provide the option of walk-in registration to the beneficiaries.“…direct the Government of India to disband the mandatory registration on CoWIN App under the “Liberalised and Accelerated Phase 3 Strategy of Covid-19 Vaccination” in so far as it concerns the Applicant, State of Jharkhand and consequently, direct the Government of India to allow/ permit the Applicant State to use its own robust, pragmatic and user-friendly mechanism devised for registration for Covid-19 vaccination process,” the petition filed by the state said.The petition said that walk-in registration was available for vaccination of the 45+ age group, but is not an option for those aged between 18-45 years (approximately 1.4 crore people) in the state.“Post the commencement of Phase –III, the state is facing major difficulty in registering the potential beneficiaries as there are issues of digital literacy and digital exclusion apart from glitches in the portal, especially in rural areas. The registration process in CoWIN is very cumbersome and complicated with the involvement of OTPs and captcha. Since the server is flooded with requests, it has become very slow to operate. Sometimes OTPs are not received and the dropdown menu does not function in the app,” it added.The petition, which the state government officials said is likely to be taken up in the coming days, said that the state government is ready with a robust portal of its own that will provide hassle-free service for vaccine registration.“Jharkhand, being a state with heavy forest cover and tough terrain, has many villages that come under network shadow area. Unlike CoWIN, Jharkhand State Portal (http://amritvahini.in) will run in the remotest of the areas irrespective of network connectivity so that the rural and tribal population of the state can easily reach out for vaccination,” the petition said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ranchi-news/covid-vaccination-18-44-age-group-j-khand-moves-sc-seeking-exemption-from-registration-on-cowin-app-101621526984246.html

The overcrowded prisons In the midst of Covid-19 pandemic is a serious concerns for the state government. A senior official of the state home department said that a proposal to construct multiple new jails with modern amenities was under consideration of the state government. He said multi-storey prisons would also be considered at some of these places. The official overcrowding was a bigger challenge, especially in high-security central prisons housing criminals from organised gangs and those jailed for serious and heinous crimes. Inmates have to be segregated and kept physically apart from each other, especially those from rival gangs or with possible hostility, they added.Officials said some of the inmates, who have violent history or those involved in cases of terrorism and Maoism, have to be housed separately, and that additional jails will also help prison administration better segregate the existing population from security point of view.Sources said the new jails will be designed by Bureau of Police Research and Development (BPR&D).Around 10 acres of land will be needed for a subdivisional jail. Around 20 acres of land is needed for district jail while 30 acres for a central jail.IG (Prisons) Mithilesh Mishra said, “Construction of the new prisons is at the planning stage. We are in talks with the government for land sanction and other formalities.

Not satisfied with the affidavit of the Patna Municipal Corporation (PMC), the court observed it “seemed to conceal more than it revealed” and wanted specific answers to its queries. “The affidavit says nothing. Do we shut our eyes on the realities? Is it the fact in Patna?” the bench of Chief Justice Sanjay Karol and Justice Sanjay Kumar observed, seeking clarity on bio-waste disposal. “How many people are isolated at home and who is picking up garbages from those houses? How many tests are being conducted in Patna? How many tonnes of waste is being generated and collected? Which is the agency dealing with it and where is the waste being taken to? How many people are involved with that? How many PPE kits are being given in the city and to whom? These are issues for consideration,” the bench said. The bench had directed the PMC to file a detailed affidavit regarding bio-waste collection/disposal and steps taken for sensitization of the people after the PMC’s counsel said that the IGIMS was entrusted with the responsibility of bio-waste disposal, which had outsourced the work to some private agency. The government had earlier said in an affidavit that there were four common biomedical waste treatment facilities in the state to cover 38 districts. All waste generated from testing, treatment, diagnosis, quarantine centres and vaccination centres are collected from all health care facilities by vehicles provided by the plants and taken to treatment facilities. Testing done in fields and waste collected are also routed to treatment plans through PHCs. PMCH course correction Patna Medical College and Hospital (PMCH) will fortnightly apprise the Patna HC of the outcome of the corrective steps taken to improve its functioning in the light of the court order following the reports of the three-member experts’ committee and amicus curiae Mrigank Mauli. Appearing for the PMCH, senior counsel PK Shahi said the hospital had set up three separate committees. While the first committee is to monitor oxygen supply, the second one would oversee the arrangements in the wards and the third would be for grievance redressal. “All care and caution is being taken with regard to oxygen. Today, more than 50% beds in the wards are not occupied,” he said. Earlier, the three-member committee constituted by the Centre on the directive of the Patna HC to examine the facilities available at the hospitals in Patna and the status of oxygen supply, had visited the PMCH and pointed to deficiencies there and made some adverse remarks in its report on the status of oxygen supply. The committee was headed by Dr Umesh Kumar Bhadani of AIIMS, Patna.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/pmc-faces-hc-s-ire-over-biowaste-disposal-in-patna-101621526864194.html
20-05-2021||Other||16 new cases of black fungus, 4 of white fungus found in Patna||PATNASixteen new cases of black fungus were reported in Bihar on Thursday while four cases of white fungus, associated with coronavirus, were detected at the Patna Medical College Hospital (PMCH) in the last as many months, the last having been found four days back, said doctors. The total cases of mucormycosis in the state had now gone up to 103, said Dr Anjani Kumar, additional director, health services, Bihar. Twenty-eight patients were admitted at the AIIMS-Patna, 41 at Indira Gandhi Institute of Medical Sciences (IGIMS), one at the Nalanda Medical College Hospital and 33 at different private facilities in Patna, including one in Nalanda, said Dr Kumar. Dr Satyendra Narayan Singh, professor and head of department of microbiology at the PMCH, who found the four cases of white fungus, cautioned doctors against excessive use of steroids on Covid-19 patients. Referring to the black and white fungus as opportunistic fungi, present both in the air and the soil, Dr Singh said they affect people with low immunity level, especially the old, suffering from uncontrolled diabetes, cancer and kidney patients or those who have undergone organ transplants like kidney and liver, and were on immunosuppressant drugs. Dr Kranti Bhawna, additional professor and head of ENT department at AIIMS-Patna, too cautioned against overdose of steroids for cure of Covid-19 patients. She said prolonged steroid therapy compromised immunity of patients and made them vulnerable to fungi attack. “Good glycemic (sugar) control is the key. While treating Covid-19 patients on steroids, doctors should be careful to keep their sugar level under control. Secondly, overuse of steroids is not good, as it decreases the immunity,” said Dr Bhawna, adding that fatality in mucormycosis is 30%-80%. Dr Bhawna has been operating upon at least two cases of mucormycosis at AIIMS everyday. “We have around 45 patients with mucormycosis at our institute of which at least five are serious and in ICU. If doctors at PMCH, Nalanda Medical College Hospital and the Darbhanga Medical College Hospital begin to operate black fungus cases, it will help reduce our load,” she said. Two deaths have so far been attributed to black fungus in Patna. Among the deceased was a local doctor, who died at the Ruban Memorial Hospital, a private facility in Patna, on May 17. Earlier on May 12, a 58-year-old male from Kaimur died at Patna’s AIIMS, a day after he was admitted there.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/16-new-cases-of-black-fungus-4-of-white-fungus-found-in-patna-101621526806123.html
20-05-2021||Other||9 months on, 26 ventilators sent to DMCH set to go live||DARBHANGAStung by reports that 26 ventilators supplied under PM Cares Fund were still lying unused for the last nine months, officials of the Darbhanga Medical College and Hospital (DMCH), the largest government hospital in north Bihar, were not being used in the absence of any “plan or guidelines.”The state had got 207 ventilators in March 2020 for its different health facilities. On May 2 this year, as per health department sources, permission was granted for installation of some of the ventilators at private hospitals and two dozens were installed thereafter. A health department official said that state requires at least 144 anaesthetists to run these ventilators but Bihar has only 77. State health minister Mangal Pandey, while talking to some media persons earlier, had admitted to the shortage of expert hands to run the ventilators. AT the DMCH, on April 26, technical experts from Bihar Medical Services and Infrastructure Corporation Limited (BMSICL) handed over 24-bed ICU facility equipped with ventilators to the DMCH administration. “The installation work had to be accomplished by BMSICL. We are trying our best to utilise the equipment with full support from district administration,” said an insider of DMCH, preferring anonymity.A successful dry run of newly installed ventilators was completed in the first week of May. However, there were some technical glitches, which caused delay in the installation of equipment. DMCH principal Dr K N Mishra said they were working towards it amid the second wave of pandemic. “We have to start Covid Care Hospital in Nursing College and Hostel. The newly installed ICU facility has been set up in a building which was originally constructed for teaching purposes. For the installation of ventilators, entire electrical wiring and oxygen supply system was needed to be modified.”DMCH superintendent Dr Mani Bhushan Sharma said in all likelihood, the new ICU facility equipped with new ventilators would become functional in a day or two.The ICU in-charge, Dr Hari Damodar Singh, said the newly built ICU could not be utilised properly soon after installation due to huge quantity of oxygen required in running the machines. In order to keep all the ventilators in running condition, the ICU requires a steady oxygen supply of 250 cylinders. Hence, the DMCH administration decided to manage all patients judiciously.“As of now, the oxygen supply chain has improved drastically. We hope to start them within a day or two,” he said. In the meantime, eight-bed ICU facility equipped with ventilators at Trauma Centre is available for patients, the ICU in-charge said, adding that one of the bed was lying vacant on Thursday.An official, requesting anonymity, also alleged that Centrally supplied ventilators had shown poor performance. A DMCH doctor said the new 25-bed ICU set up at ground floor failed to sustain the sensitive functioning of ventilators initially due to the lack of commensurate pressure of oxygen, which has been rectified now.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/9-months-on-26-ventilators-sent-to-dmch-set-to-go-live-101621526804207.html
20-05-2021||Other||Lockdown takes its toll on May tax collection||PATNAThe lockdown in Bihar, which came into force on May 5 this year and was further extended till May 25, has taken its toll on the state’s tax collections, which have started plummeting.The total revenue for May is expected to be around ₹500 crore as against ₹2,700 crore last month, prompting the finance department to go for higher borrowings within specified limit from next month onwards to meet various expenditures. Sources said tax collections for May till Thursday was over ₹400 crore and expected to reach the ₹500 crore by the end of month. “There is a huge shortfall in tax collections from internal sources this month as against last month’s figures. This is owing to lockdown and restrictions in commercial activity,” said a finance department official, seeking anonymity. The sharp decline is a major cause of worry for finance officials, who say the state, having already battled contraction in economy last fiscal, would not have enough funds for development works and committed expenditure if Covid restrictions continue over the next few months. “We have to increase our borrowings from next month. We are only hoping central devolutions are higher this fiscal or else the fiscal position will be tight and adversely affect implementation of schemes,” said another official. The state government has a borrowing limit of ₹36,000 crore for the current fiscal (2021-22). Sources said the government will be borrowing ₹2,000 crore next week in the first tranche and then ₹4,000 crore from next month onwards from the market to ensure funds for various expenditures and shortfall in revenue collections. The borrowings would be assessed once the tax collections start improving, officials said. The state’s public debt for the fiscal 2020-21 stands at ₹1.77 lakh crore. The state government total budget outlay is ₹2.18 lakh crore for 2021-22, with a target of ₹40,000 crore as revenue from state’s own internal sources like transport, commercial taxes, registration and mining. Last fiscal, Bihar managed to get ₹60,000 crore as central devolutions by way of its share in central taxes, belying apprehensions that the devolutions would be much less due to the economic contraction on account of the Covid-19 pandemic. In 2019-20, the state had received ₹63,000 crore as central devolutions from share of taxes. Sources said the government’s tax collections from own sources in the last fiscal was close to ₹35,000 crore, a shortfall of 10 -12% against the target of ₹39,900 crore. “Our tax collections were good despite lockdown and restrictions for several months last year. The higher central devolutions than expectedsaved the day for us in terms of keeping our fiscal position good so far,” said a finance official. He said the picture of fund availability from central sources would be clearer for the current fiscal when the 43rd GST council meeting, to be chaired by union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman, takes place on May 28.Sources the state government has kept a budgetary provision of ₹3,500 crore as compensation cess for the current fiscal.

The prime minister had video conference with collectors of 60 districts in the country, including 17 in Maharashtra, along with chief ministers of 11 states. During the virtual meeting, Ahmednagar collector Rajendra Bhosale apprised him of the initiatives being implemented in the district, said a statement from the state information department. Modi expressed satisfaction at the steps being taken by the district authorities, it added. As of Wednesday, Ahmednagar has reported 2,42,317 Covid cases with 2,575 fatalities. In the first wave, the case fatality rate (CFR) of the district was 1.5 per cent which fell to 0.9 per cent in the ongoing second wave, Bhosale said. All the households in the district were surveyed and patients who had co-morbidities were given timely treatment, which brought down the CFR, he told the PM. During the first wave 0.4 million lakh tests had been conducted, while in the second wave 0.5 million samples have been tested so far, the collector said. The “Hivre Bazaar” pattern promoted by Popatrao Pawar, a village Sarpanch from the district who is a Padmashree recipient, ensured that his village became coronavirus-free. This was then implemented in the district. Under Pawar’s guidance, 1,316 gram panchayats implemented the pattern under which four teams of health officials and NGOs were formed to survey each household. In other initiatives, a nodal officer was appointed to oversee the refund of excess fees charged by private hospitals, the collector said. He himself toured every taluka in the district at least twice a month and spoke to village officials to boost their morale. Special efforts were taken to set up oxygen production plants in the district and a deputy collector-level officer was put in charge of each plant, he told the prime minister. Nodal officers were appointed for hospitals to ensure smooth oxygen supply, Bhosale said. New arrivals in villages were sent to isolation rooms. During the second wave even home isolation was stopped and all coronavirus positive persons were admitted to Covid care centres, the collector said. Those violating curfew orders and loitering in public were subjected to rapid antigen tests, he said. Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray also praised the district administration’s efforts, the statement added||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/pm-praises-ahmednagar-s-handling-of-covid-crisis-101621522783916.html

Three people were killed in the incident which took place on Monday afternoon when a group of villagers were protesting against the camp, which opened on May 12 near Silger village - a Maoist stronghold along the border of Sukma-Bijapur districts. The villagers have been demanding the removal of Silger camp and justice for the three tribals who died in Monday’s firing. They are also planning to start a protest again from Friday in which the residents of about 12 villagers will take part, a local said. The villagers had claimed that security forces opened fire unilaterally on protestors and those killed were tribals while police said Maoists were part of the crowd that was protesting against the camp and that the ultras started the gunbattle. Inspector-General of Police (Bastar range) Sundarraj P said, the preliminary investigation revealed that the three deceased were allegedly linked with frontal organizations of banned CPI (Maoist) but police are trying to ascertain this input. Prima facie, the deceased have been identified as Uska Pandu, a Bhumkal commander from Timmapur village (Sukma); Kowasi Waga, DAKMS (Dandakaranya Adivasi Kisan Majdoor Sangthan) member from Chhutwahi; and Kursam bhima, militia member from Gundem village (Bijapur), the IGP said. The villagers claimed that those killed were farmers and on Thursday they put the bodies of the deceased at the protest site and demanded justice. Meanwhile, on Wednesday evening, human rights activist Bela Bhatia, along with activist Jean Dreze, tried to reach the protest site but was stopped by the security forces. “Held up outside Chiramangi CRPF camp. I was on my way to Silger but have been stopped. They have been told that I should not be allowed to proceed without the SP’s permission. In the morning, I had gone to the district hospital at Bijapur to meet the injured but was not allowed to talk to them. We (Jean Dreze and I) were told to undergo two covid tests at the hospital which we did even after being vaccinated. Even after six hours of wait, I was still not allowed to speak with the injured. Out of the five injured, I saw three had bullet injuries. Also, throughout my time in the hospital, a policewoman was following me wherever I went. I cannot help but feel that I have been deliberately kept from visiting Silger. I see this as an obstruction in my duty as a lawyer,” a statement issued by Bhatia on social media stated. On Thursday, Bhatia claimed that the permission is still in process and meeting with officials is going on. On the other hand, Maoists called for ‘bandh’ in Bijapur and Sukma districts on Friday in a written statement and stated that the villagers were protesting peacefully but senior police officers ordered firing upon unarmed tribals.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/in-sukma-maoists-call-for-bandh-villagers-protest-with-dead-bodies-101621522247000.html

The decision was taken after Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) city president Prasant Jagatap, Shiv Sena party leader Sanjay More, and Congress leader Ramesh Bagwe met deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar about the issue.The SOPs include not allowing members of political parties or any person to enter the vaccination centre. Staffers at the centre can now seek police protection to handle the situation and file a case against any intruder.The commissioner’s order also prohibits posters or hoardings around vaccination centres.Mulrlidhar Mohol, mayor, said, “Prohibition of local corporators is not good. Corporators are servants of the public. To help the public is the duty of the corporation. PMC should not put blame on political parties for the misuse of power by some corporators. If we are not present at the centre, people will ask us questions.”“It is absolutely wrong to give orders to file a police complaint against a corporator. The decision has been taken under political pressure,” he added.Aba Bagul, Congress leader in the corporation said, “It is not acceptable to file a police complaint against corporators. The corporation doesn’t have enough manpower or machinery to successfully complete the vaccination drive. The commissioner should not hold all corporators responsible for any wrongdoing.” Prithviraj Sutar, Shiv Sena Party leader in PMC said, “Due to too much political interference, the PMC commissioner took the decision.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/politicos-not-in-favour-of-new-sops-governing-vaccination-drive-101621521763874.html

The committee will include chief engineer of the Jal Vidnyan Prakalp (Nashik), chief engineer of the water resource division, Pune, and superintendent engineer of the Pune Irrigation division. The government has as asked for a report in three months.Avinash Surve, chairman of the committee, said, “The irrigation department does water management on the basis of availability of water, crop patterns, purposes of water (drinking, industry, agriculture). After some time, the situation changes and we have to make changes. Climate change will affect rainfall and will directly impact the availability of water.”There are 25 dams in the Bhima basin, spread across three sub-basins – the Bhima sub-basin, the Neera sun-basin and the Mula-Mutha sub-basi - with 17 reservoirs. The need for the panel comes against the background of Pune city increasing its demand for water from the dams, to serve an expanding population.Given Pune city’s increasing water usage, the rural areas of Pune district are complaining of a water shortage.A decision on increasing the water quota for Pune city is pending.Pune’s annual water usage has increased from 11.50 thousand million litres per cubic feet (TMC) to 18.50 thousand million TMC, annually. As per statistics released by the water resource department, the population in the rural areas of Pune district is forecast to reach 4.520 million; and the urban population, 9.265 million, by 2030. Meanwhile, the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) is accessing the Bhama-Askhed dam for water, which is 45km away from the city. Twenty-three villages have also been cleared to merge with the PMC limits.The committee will start a pilot project in the Bhima sub-basin to study and review water distribution.The committee will give recommendations based on the pattern of water usage, irrigation capacity, proportion of sludge, and increasing capacity of projects.“Due to rapid urbanisation and industrialisation, the basic planning of water distribution has changed. Water usages vary. We will study supplying more water to cities and the increasing pressure on the agriculture sector to find a solution. We will have to increase the capacity of Pune city’s water usage, as well as the agriculture water usage,” Surve said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/state-forms-committee-to-study-water-distribution-from-dams-in-bhima-basin-101621521103795.html
20-05-2021||Pune||Pvt hospitals in Pune likely to start vax drive for 18-44 age group from today||Pune: The private hospitals in the city are likely to start administering vaccine doses to 18-44 age group beneficiaries from Friday as the stock purchased directly from manufacturing companies has started arriving, various hospitals HT spoke to said. The doses, once arrived, will be used for 18-44 age group, who are awaiting the vaccination after the state government suspended the drive in view of shortage of vaccines last week. It will be after three weeks that private hospitals in the city resume vaccination as the state government had refused to allot them doses from May 1. Among those who received the stock till Thursday evening were Noble hospital and Ruby Hall Clinic. Dr HK Sale, executive director of Noble Hospital, said, “Our hospital has received 1,000 doses of Covishield vaccine of the first order of 6,000 doses. Now that we have received the supply, vaccination process will start from Friday at our hospital centre.” Noble hospital has priced each dose at ₹900 and has asked intended beneficiaries to come for vaccination only after registering names through CoWIN portal. As the central government allowed private players to buy the vaccine doses, prominent hospitals from Pune have already placed their orders to vaccine manufacturers. Ruby Hall Clinic also received an undisclosed number of doses of Covishield with authorities planning to begin vaccination within two days. “We had given the order of vaccine doses order to Serum Institute of India for Covishield vaccine, and we have received some doses today. We will be among the first private hospitals from the city to start the drive from vaccine purchased directly from manufacturers. Initially, we have given an order of around 10,000 doses, but as per the availability, it will be supplied to us,” said Dr Avdhut Bodamwad, medical superintendent at Ruby Hall Clinic. Another private facility hoping to start vaccination drive within two days is Deenanath Mangeshkar hospital. Dr Dhananjay Kelkar, medical director, Deenanath Mangeshkar Hospital said, “We have given order of 36,000 vaccine doses to Serum and it is expected to get the stock within a day or two. The government has given its standard price of purchase of ₹630 and we will be giving it at ₹900 per dose. Those above age of 45 will be allowed walk-in vaccination and for above 18 people they should register on CoWIN and take appointment. Also, we have started special funds for vaccination in our hospital through which the poor will be given free vaccine doses.” Similarly, Bharati Vidyapeeth Hospital has also given the vaccine order. Dr Jitendra Oswal, deputy medical director at Bharati Vidyapeeth medical college, hospital and research centre said, “We were already in contact with Serum Institute to get the vaccines for our hospitals and now we have given the first order of 20,000 doses of Covishield. We hope to get the maximum number of doses though it depends on the availability and supply from the company. From next week onwards we will resume our vaccination process at our hospital.” Bharati Vidyapeeth was among the city-based hospitals which conducted human trials for Serum manufactured Covishield. India is currently administering Bharat Biotech made Covaxin too besides Covishield. “Along with Serum, we are in talks with other vaccine manufacturers too, Bharat Biotech for Covaxin and also trying to get the Sputnik vaccine. Once we get all the three vaccine doses, the speed of vaccination will be increased,” Oswal said. In Pune, currently only public hospitals are administering doses to those above 45 years of age. However, the government has prioritised those lined up for second dose. Many private firms and industries based in Pune have also inquired and asked hospitals for arranging mass vaccination of their employees, said doctors. Sale from Noble hospital said once there is ample availability of doses, they will start vaccination to corporates at their campuses.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/pvt-hospitals-in-pune-likely-to-start-vax-drive-for-18-44-age-group-from-today-101621519963772.html

However, we all started falling sick one by one for the past week. We have symptoms like fever and cough. Some of them were given saline but we are not getting proper medical care here,” Das said.He said, “In view of soaring cases of Covid-19, a lockdown has been imposed here.

There is no space left to walk and vehicles cannot come out from our parking. I work at a private hospital and need to go to work everyday. For the last two days, I cannot take my vehicle and have had to hire an autorickshaw,” said Dhanesh Kamble, a resident of Shaniwar Peth.“PMC workers should have done the work in phases, keeping some road open for local residents to move,” Kamble added.The road starting from the New English School, Ramanbaug chowk till Omkareshwar Mandir chowk has been dug up in Shaniwar peth. Roads in Sadashiv peth, Navi peth and Shukrwar peth have all been dug up.“We understand that government wants to complete the work before the rainy season and take advantage of the current lockdown as there is less traffic. At the same time, there should be a time limit. You cannot just dig up a road and keep it as is, for 10 to 15 days.

It is not clear as to when the augmentation of production could be done in actual production. The Centre should immediately look into this aspect. A status report should be filed detailing the present production, the producers, their capacity, their enhanced capacity and by when can the enhanced capacity be put in use,” a high court bench, comprising Justice Vipin Sanghi and Justice Jasmeet Singh notified, resuming its hearing on the matter from Wednesday.The bench further asked the Centre to place on record the steps taken by it to import the medicine from abroad, to be used in the country. “It appears that the domestic production of the medicine is far less for the requirement on all India basis,” it observed.Also Read | SOS calls for black fungus drug as cases rise in DelhiResponding to this, Kirtiman Singh, the Centre’s standing counsel, said, “There are five companies which are currently producing Amphotericin-B and the shortage is because the demand has increased due to the increase in demand. Also, the drug is only used in warmer countries and that too for mosquito bites.” Singh further said that the Centre would request for the drug from the countries which are producing it and also list steps to increase its production.Also Read | Make Mucormycosis a notifiable disease under epidemic act, urges CentreOn this, the two-judge bench clarified that it was not questioning the allocation by the Centre. “The only thing is that the bridge between demand and supply must be bridged or else we will lose more precious lives. Float a global tender and ask internationally,” the bench directed the central government.The court also noted that Delhi was facing a shortage of the drug, with the supply being just two-thirds of the quantity required by the national capital. This was over information provided by the Centre that the Capital got just over 3,000 vials of the drug as against the requirement of 8,400 vials per week.The bench was further informed by the Centre that Delhi deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia had written to them seeking 1 lakh vials for the city. However, it said that such a demand would amount to “hoarding” of the essential drug. On this, Rahul Mehra, representing the Delhi government, said, “The current requirement is about 15,000-18,000 vials per week and the government is seeking more as it wants to create a buffer since cases of black fungus might increase in the coming days.”At a time when daily Covid-19 cases have seen a relative decline in Delhi, cases of black fungus have been on the rise.

Channi, 69, is survived by wife Harleen Kohli and children Gyan Dev and Sukhmani. A recipient of the Sangeet Natak Akademi Award and a Fulbright scholar, Channi was among the pioneers who enriched the arts. He belonged to Patiala and came to Chandigarh to study theatre in the first year of the Department of Indian Theatre founded by veteran Punjabi playwright Balwant Gargi in 1972. Recalling those days, his classmate Rani Balbir says, “He was a natural actor who could innovate at the spur of the moment. He loved to clown and charm and was the dearest classmate and close friend for a lifetime.” Also read: Sonia Gandhi writes to PM, seeks free education for kids orphaned by CovidStreet theatre times It was here that he found a mentor and friend in Gargi, who could see the spark in this handsome youngster, and encouraged him to join the National School of Drama (NSD) in Delhi in its splendid days with Abraham Alkazi as director. Passing out of the NSD, Channi chose the city of Chandigarh as his playground for street theatre, taking students from the city’s College of Arts and staging amazing productions such as Daffa 144 and Disturbed Area among others. He groomed the students in theatre and many of them went on to become established names in different fields. Photographer Diwan Manna says, “We came from villages, worked with Channi and learned much from him. We owe what we are to him for he had imbibed well the skills he learned from Gargi and Alkazi.” Others who were part of the street theatre team included celebrated dancer Navtej Johar and artistes such as late Naresh Pandit and Viney Vadhera. “His foresight and contacts were great, and we performed at the Gateway of India in Mumbai with writer Khwaja Ahmad Abbas and director Imtiaz Khan in the audience. He also invited the famous Badal Sarkar from Kolkata to do a workshop with us in Chandigarh,” says Manna. Dynamic artiste Channi believed in going miles before he rested and worked as a television producer with Jalandhar Doordarshan, making innovative programmes and tele-films based on Punjabi literature. He went on to become a professor at the Film and Television Institute of India, Pune. Chandigarh, however, remained his favourite and he set up the NGO Centre for Education and Voluntary Action (CEVA) doing community theatre and making commissioned films. Many remember him still as the face of protest at Jallianwala Bagh in Richard Attenborough’s famous 1982 film, Gandhi. He was given this role by casting director Dolly Thakore, another theatre veteran. Thakore recalled with love; “He bought his first fridge with the ₹4000 that we paid him and named it Dolly. This was an endearing story he loved to relate.” With tributes flooding social media, his actor-director friend Kamal Tewari said: “May all have the strength and courage to bear the loss of this dynamic artiste.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarh-loses-theatre-artiste-gurcharan-channi-to-covid19-101621513904053.html
20-05-2021||Pune||India’s first ‘at home’ antigen test kit developed by Pune firm to be available from next week||Pune: After the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) on Wednesday approved India’s first home-based rapid antigen testing (RAT) kit for Covid, Pune-based molecular diagnostics company Mylab Discovery Solutions said it will be made available within a week. The kit, advised by ICMR and to be used only on symptomatic individuals and on immediate contacts of laboratory confirmed positive cases, will be priced at ₹250. The company said it has current production capacity of one million per day with plans to augment it up to 1.5 million within two weeks. The kit, named as CoviSelfTM, for self-use test can be used by symptomatic individuals and immediate contacts of confirmed cases as per ICMR guidelines. Users of this test will not need sample collection by a healthcare professional. This will ease pressure on already overburdened testing labs and reduce delays in testing, which is more than 72 hours in some parts of the country. The country’s apex health research body stated, “all individuals who test positive using CoviSelf may be considered as true positives and no repeat testing is required”. It also said “all RAT negative symptomatic individuals may be treated as suspect Covid-19 cases and are advised to follow the ICMR/MoH&FW home isolation protocol while awaiting the RT-PCR test result”. ICMR has advised the kit users to download a mobile app which is available for both Android and iOS operating systems, and use the same device where the app is installed to take a picture of the strip in the kit after the testing process is completed. Each kit will have all testing materials, instructions for use (IFU) leaflet and a biohazard bag to safely dispose after testing. “The test is designed to be done using nasal swab (not the deep nasopharyngeal swab) to reduce the discomfort,” said Dr Gautam Wankhede, director - medical affairs, Mylab Discovery Solutions. According to Wankhede, the kit will provide results within 15 minutes while users who test positive are advised to immediately isolate so that they do not infect others and quickly contact a healthcare provider. “Most western countries have allowed self-test for their citizens and consider it as a powerful tool to break the chain. This easy-to-use test combines with Myab’s AI-powered mobile app so that a user can know his/her positive status, submit the result to ICMR directly for traceability, and know what to do next in either case of result. We are sure this small step will be a big leap in mitigating the second and subsequent waves,” said Sujit Jain, director, Mylab Discovery Solutions. Speaking about the accuracy of the kit results, Wankhede said, the firm has made every possible step to ensure the outcome is accurate. “With ICMR also accepting it, we can say its accuracy is as much as the kit being used professionally by labs outside,” he said. The firm, which was working on the kit since last seven months, had submitted the proposal to ICMR around six weeks ago.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/indias-first-at-home-antigen-test-kit-developed-by-pune-firm-to-be-available-from-next-week-101621513843265.html

Several families have lost multiple members, leaving them with a grief that they may not be able to recover from any time soon. Hindustan Times reaches out to three such families in the district. Elderly couple died one day apart For Arun Chopra, 35, who lost both his parents in a span of two days, life will never be the same again. His father, Surinder Chopra, 67, an arhtiya, was the first to contract the virus following which his mother Kiran Lata, 60, also got infected. Subsequently, Arun, his wife and two sons also tested positive. While Arun, his wife and kids recovered, his elderly parents weren’t so lucky. Both his parents were initially admitted to a private hospital but after 10 days, their condition started deteriorating, forcing him to rush them to government facilities. His mother was taken to Rajindra Hospital, Patiala, where she breathed her last on May 11. Before he could share the devastating news with his family, his father too passed away at Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research on May 12. Arun said he spent nearly ₹6 lakh on his parents’ treatment. 3 members of a family wiped out in a week Another family in BRS Nagar G-Block witnessed three deaths in a span of a week. First, a 47-year-old man died, then his 75-year-old father succumbed and finally, his younger brother’s wife also lost her life to the virus. The younger brother, who was recently discharged after recovery, is devastated. “I lost three family members when I was myself under treatment. My children have lost their mother, grandfather, and uncle. We have recovered from the disease but will never recover from this tragedy,” he said, wishing to remain anonymous. 24-yr-old died just a day after he tested +ve Sarabjit Singh, a health department employee, lost his 24-year-old son just three months after the latter’s wedding. “We were still in celebration mode when my son tested positive on April 30. We first took him to a public health centre in Payal but as his condition continued to deteriorate, we rushed him to the civil hospital, where he succumbed the next day,” said Sarabjit.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/grief-overload-for-families-losing-multiple-members-to-covid19-101621511083399.html

20-05-2021||Other||Taste of life: Before Alphonso was king, Pune’s local mango varieties ruled taste-buds||The year was 1911 and the month January. Sir George Sydenham Clarke, Governor of Bombay, decided to send exquisite and expensive gifts to some of his friends and compatriots in India and abroad. The first consignment, he decided, was to be mangoes, grown around Bombay and Poona.Things did not proceed his way. On February 2, 1911, a frost occurred in Poona with disastrous effects on the mango flowers, all of which were blackened and killed.There was no harvest of the fruit in Poona that year and the Governor was disheartened. He might have communicated his disappointment to his friends in Egypt, because the same year, British officials in Egypt placed an order for mango plants from Poona.In 1912, a consignment of grafted mango plants was sent from the Ganeshkhind Botanical Gardens in Poona, to the Director-General of Agriculture, Giro, Egypt. Later, in April 1916, a consignment was sent from Poona to Jamesabad in Sind and arrived in good condition; and another to Gorakhpur in the United Provinces, equally successfully.Bajirao Peshwa II had planted large numbers of mango trees in the neighbourhood of Poona. It is said that he had long caravans employed to bring seeds from Goa, and when the British took over the city, many of the plantations remained, to show the poor quality of the average mango fruit raised from seed.The British noted that in the Bombay Presidency, although mango trees were seen in every village, yet there were undoubtedly certain classes of soils that influenced the yield and excellence of the fruit. G Marshall Woodrow, noted horticulturist, stated that fruit of the highest quality might be produced on a loamy soil three feet in depth containing five—ten per cent of lime and enough peroxide of iron to give the soil a reddish tinge. He mentioned that an excellent mango type was found on the banks of the Mula river near Ganeshkhind in alluvial loamy soil to a depth of five feet. There was another plantation of 5,000 trees near Khed Shivapur, a few miles south of Poona, situated on soil of five feet of dark brown loam, nine feet of marl, two feet of gravel, and three feet of very porous murum (a disintegrated form of trap rock).So the British decided to survey the region and encourage the harvest of the already existing local varieties rather than those brought to Poona from Goa and Ratnagiri. The result of this endeavour was the cultivation of several varieties which the British thought were superior to the famous Alphonso.There were large plantations of the Alphonso variety in Kirkee (Khadki). Then there was Badshah, grown near Dhankawadi, which had agreeable flavour but was woolly. Mrs Petit’s garden in Wanowrie had the Batasi variety, the saplings of which had been imported from an orchard in Parel. The Bhopaly and Motiya varieties grew near Hirabaug, the trees of which were shoulder high. Wadgaon had orchards of two varieties – Dalbed and Deorukhya. The former was considered superior to the Alphonso variety by many British officers. Bhamburda (Shivajinagar) had the Gadgya variety. It had a piquant flavour and the trees were dwarf. Alandi had orchards of the Jhiprya variety. The pulp of this fruit was white and it was considered a good to use in cakes and jams.Sardar Balwantrao Natu planted the Khoont variety in his garden in Kadus. It was a very fine fruit with an un-attractive colour. Then there were Moraya, Kubdya and Kalia near Sinhagad (Donaje). The pulps of these fruits were deep yellow with very few fibres. Pandhrya too grew in the same area, the pulp of which was sweet and greenish yellow. Vishnu Sadashiv’s garden hosted the Mahaluga variety. The pulp was woolly and flavour slightly mild. This fruit was not much liked by the natives, but was a darling of some Europeans. The undisputed king of the local varieties was the Pia-posha from Bhamburda, the skin of which was rich cream coloured, suffused with crimson on the exposed side. The pulp was pale yellow, very sweet. The fruits were large and the fragrance delightful. The valuable colouring matter, Indian Yellow, was obtained from the urine of cattle fed on the Pia-posha mango leaves.A close second were the Rajia and Ryotya, fruits of which were very sweet and colour so exquisite that European housewives bought the fruits to decorate their dining tables.In Bombay and in the neighbourhood of Ratnagiri, the mango harvest was nearly over by the end of May, except for a few late varieties; whereas in Poona and the neighbouring districts, it began from the middle of May and continued till the end of June. Because the mangoes were sold late, especially after the rains had set in, the demand for them was very low, and as a consequence, they had to be sold very cheap.After the First World War ended, Alphonso became the favourite of the rich. These fruits were brought to Pune from Ratnagiri and were considered a status symbol. The fine local varieties were unfortunately overshadowed and later almost erased from the public memory by the Alphonso. Pia-posha mango chutney recipe The Pia-posha mango could now only be found in vintage recipes, like the one for mango chutney published in the Bulletin of the Botanical Department, Jamaica, in 1905 : Three pounds Pia-posha mangoes (turned, but not ripe, 3 pounds tamarinds, 2 pounds raisins (weighed after stoning), 8 pounds brown sugar, 1 pound chilies, 1\2 pound garlic, 2 pounds green ginger, 1\4 ounce mace, 1 ounce mustard seed, 1\4 ounce cloves, 1\4 ounce pimento, 1\2 pound table salt. Soak tamarinds in 2 quarts of the best vinegar, stir them about with a wooden spoon to get the pulp off, and take out the seeds and the leathery part in which they are enclosed. Cut the raisins small. Peel the ginger and grate it. Pound the chilies, garlic, and mustard seed in a mortar, using a little of the vinegar to moisten. Mix all together thoroughly; it is then ready for use.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/taste-of-life-before-alphonso-was-king-pune-s-local-mango-varieties-ruled-tastebuds-101621507784465.html
20-05-2021||Delhi||Country battles Covid-19, and celebrations pave way for charity||Hardships often bring out the best in people. And this has been clearly visible in the last few weeks as the second wave of Covid-19 hit, prompting many Delhiites to try and help those in need. Be it verifying leads for oxygen beds, medicines and oxygen concentrators, or cooking food and delivering it to the needy in the neighbourhood – several citizens have gone out of their way. And while last year’s lockdown saw people celebrating their special occasions such as birthdays or anniversaries in a low-key fashion, this year most have marked the date by doing something for the Covid-affected.Rashmi Aggarwal, 19, had earlier decided to throw a huge party this year for her birthday in April – given she couldn’t do much for her 18th birthday in 2020 – but the grief all around prompted her to instead donate her savings to a nearby gurdwara’s oxygen langar. “It’s heart wrenching to see the grim situation in the country. My uncle’s entire family is battling Covid in Bengaluru, whereas some of my friends here in Noida have parents or siblings fighting the virus. Knowing what they are going through, I couldn’t even cut a cake for my birthday. I combined the funds meant for my birthday party with money my parents and grandparents gave me for the occasion and donated all of it to the gurudwara,” says the Noida resident, who donated ₹15,000 for the cause.Fans of South Korean band EXO raised ₹1 lakh through an online fundraiser, to mark the birthday of band member, singer-songwriter Byun Baekhyun on May 6, and donated it to Mission Oxygen. Anu Konsam, Manipur EXO-L representative, which organised the fundraiser, says, “During these hard times we decided to do what we could for Baekhyun’s birthday. We got to know about Mission Oxygen and came together to collectively raise funds for it,” adding, “Raising ₹1 lakh in three days from a fandom mostly comprising students, it’s quite overwhelming. Covid-19 has hit us hard but let’s go through this together. Together we ‘can-dy’ overcome!” she adds, making a reference to Baekhyun’s solo song, Candy.Another EXO fan, Gurugram resident, Shriya Banerjee, says, “Giving for a cause on member’s birthdays or group debut/ fandom anniversary is our way of saying ‘thank you’. Different fanbases keep doing fundraisers, be it in form of collecting cash or selling fan made merchandise, profits from which are donated for a cause. This is not only from a sense of community or belonging but is also because the idols themselves believe in giving. K-pop stars such as Suho supports ALS (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis) while Sehun volunteers to help less privileged children, thus encouraging the fans too, to keep giving back to society.”While some celebs, like actor Viraf Patell, opted for a court marriage with fiancé Saloni Khanna, and devoted the budget earmarked for a grand wedding to Covid relief, ordinary citizens too have set aside wedding or anniversary plans to contribute to the cause in their own way. Delhi’s Akshat Gaur, an architect who runs his own start-up, had his anniversary in the first week of May. But instead of giving a treat to friends and family, he decided to keep the party going even longer by serving food to Covid patients in his neighbourhood. “I wanted to do something, but couldn’t zero in on something. One evening I spotted my neighbour, who was against eating outside food, collecting a meal left by a food delivery agent. Asked, he revealed both he and his wife were down with Covid and couldn’t make food. At that very moment my wife and I decided to provide meals to such needy individuals,” he says.And they devised an innovative mechanism for it. “My wife and I aren’t good cooks, so we called our cook, who we’d initially sent on leave due to the pandemic. We told her that we wanted to provide for the Covid-affected and needed her help. She readily agreed and even brought another lady to help her. I brought the dry rations and with the help of a delivery service, sent food to far off places. Within my locality, I myself go and give out meals,” shares Gaur.Exemplifying love and compassion is another young couple, who got married in April and dedicated their leave to help people on social media get verified leads. “We got married in April and were to go to the Maldives for our honeymoon, but soon after travel was restricted so we dropped the plan. Seeing that social media was flooded with pleas for oxygen beds, ventilators, etc, we decided to dedicate four hours in the morning daily to verifying leads for oxygen beds and plasma donors in Delhi-NCR,” says Sudha Krishnan, who has since joined back at work but still tries to help people. She adds, “My husband and I divided our work, he would track requests and I’d make calls and verify leads. It felt quite fulfilling to know we could actually meet some people’s requirements. I’m glad we put our leave to good use.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/country-battles-covid-19-and-celebrations-pave-way-for-charity-101621506163977.html

20-05-2021||Patna||Video of patient pushed to Bihar hospital on cart goes viral, patient vanishes||A video footage of a patient being brought to a government hospital on a pushcart-- which is generally employed to carry garbage-- in Bihar's West Champaran district has gone viral on social media on Thursday.In the video, about half a dozen people are seen pushing the cart, with the patient inside, before shifting her to a stretcher after reaching the sub divisional hospital in Bagaha, 70 kms north of Bettiah.Family of the patient, identified as Kamali Devi, said they were forced to bring her to the hospital, about 7kms from their house at Malkauli near Bagaha 2, on a garbage pushcart after a rapid deterioration in her health on Wednesday evening. "She is running high fever and has developed breathlessness," said Nathuni Bin, Kamali's husband."What else can be done when the vehicles are not plying," he asked, avoiding a direct answer to a query if he tried for the ambulance or not.The woman's husband was referring to absence of public transport during the ongoing lockdown in Bihar, clamped to contain the spread of Covid-19 cases during the second wave of the disease in the state.Recently two incidents of bodies of Covid-19 patients being carried on carts owned by the civic administration in Nalanda district went viral on social media, raising questions on availability of ambulances in the state. A probe was ordered in the first of the two cases reported from Biharsharif town earlier this week.In the present case, Bagaha’s sub divisional magistrate (SDM) Shekhar Anand said there was no need to bring the patient on a handcart. "In the course of our investigation, we came to know that the patient was not denied the ambulance. We have a good number of ambulances for service, and we want people to make use of our ambulance services for ferrying the patients," the SDM said.In another twist to the saga, the 45-year-old patient was found to have left the Bagaha sub division hospital without notifying the authorities, who have now declared her LAMA (left against medical advice). "She was under our treatment as she was suffering from breathlessness. But, in the morning, she was nowhere to be found in the hospital and hence she has been declared a LAMA," said Dr. AK Tiwari, the medical officer of the hospital.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/video-of-patient-pushed-to-bihar-hospital-on-cart-goes-viral-patient-vanishes-101621502536285.html

Kejriwal also promised the government will ensure supply of medicines needed to treat the disease and invest on public awareness drives."Chaired an important review meeting with experts in the light of increasing black fungus cases. We have to stop black fungus cases and ensure that those infected by it get treatment. We have taken some important decisions to contain spread and treatment of black fungus," the chief minister tweeted after the review meeting on Thursday.The meeting comes against the backdrop of a sharp increase in cases of mucormycosis, or black fungus. So far, more than 185 cases have been recorded in the Capital.Black fungus has been found mostly among people with uncontrolled diabetes, whose immunity is compromised, or among people who are given excessive steroids or immunity-modulating drugs such as tocilizumab during their treatment for the coronavirus disease.According to doctors, if left untreated, black fungus can kill up to 80% of those infected.If not detected early, it affects the orbit of the eye and the mouth, resulting in people losing their vision or jaw during debridement — the process of removing dead tissue from an infection or wound.The surge in cases of the life-threatening disease that affects some recovered Covid-19 patients has led to shortage of the antifungal medicines used to treat the infection.On Wednesday, the Delhi high court asked the Delhi and central governments to report on the steps taken to resolve the shortage of Amphotericin B, an antifungal drug used to treat the infection||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/have-to-stop-cases-kejriwal-orders-centres-for-black-fungus-in-3-hospitals-101621500653817.html

We also have to stop this disease from growing and those who are getting this disease have to be given better treatment as soon as possible," he said in a tweet.Kejriwal further said some important decisions were taken in the meeting for the prevention and treatment of this disease."Some important decisions were taken in the meeting for the prevention and treatment of this disease- 1- Centers for treatment of black fungus in LNJP, GTB and Rajiv Gandhi Hospital 2- Adequate management of medicines used in its treatment 3. To spread awareness among people about disease prevention measures," he added.Earlier, the Delhi government has set up a four-member technical expert committee (TEC) to prevent the indiscriminate use of Amphotericin-B injection and to establish a transparent and efficient system of distribution of this drug to the needy and hospitalised Covid-19 patients.The rare fungal infection called 'mucormycosis' or 'black fungus' is on the rise in several parts of the country, including Delhi.As per the Union Health Ministry, mucormycosis or black fungus is a complication caused by a fungal infection.People catch mucormycosis by coming in contact with the fungal spores in the environment. It can also develop on the skin after the fungus enters the skin through a cut, scrape, burn, or other type of skin trauma.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/black-fungus-delhi-govt-to-set-up-dedicated-treatment-centres-in-3-hospitals-101621499938724.html
20-05-2021||Patna||Ignorance, poor infrastructure makes rural Bihar more vulnerable to Covid-19||Babban Singh (62) is confined in a room at his home for the last 20 days after testing positive for Covid-19. Singh, a farmer under Hardiya panchayat of Bihar’s Samastipur district, travelled 50kms from his Singhia block residence to a Darbhanga private lab for the Covid test. He did it on the advice of his son, who lives in Mumbai.“I had a fever for 6-7 days, but for the last 7-8 days there is no fever, though there is a lot of weakness. I also got in touch with a doctor in Patna and took the prescribed medicines, including injections. I also got my wife tested, but fortunately, she was negative. Now I will again go to Darbhanga, 50 kms from Hardiya, for tests,” he said.But there are not many like Babban Singh in rural Bihar. Most ignore apparent Covid symptoms and act foolishly brave, still not ready to accept the fatal consequences of Covid infection. “People cough and sneeze, but they carry on, treating it as seasonal flu... A couple of weeks ago, some officials came for testing after some villagers fell ill and detected positive cases in Bangrahtta, Hardiya, Sumaha and adjoining places. The infection seems to be spreading, but we don’t know to what extent,” said Singh.Similar reports from other districts too, suggest the rural population is mostly either ignorant or complacent apart from nurturing a false sense of immunity.Dr Vikas R Keshri, currently a senior research fellow at the George Institute for Global Health in New Delhi, says the challenge posed by the pandemic is much bigger for rural areas in states like Bihar due to a number of factors, viz. high population density, limited healthcare, false sense of immunity, ignorant beliefs such as Covid-19 being a high society and urban phenomenon, apart from exposure to migrant natives arriving from the urban hotspots of the disease.“After the first wave, people got complacent and so did the authorities. When the second wave struck, all were caught off-guard. I fear that the government’s continued claims of a drop in the test positivity rate may prove counterproductive by instilling a sense of complacency while the real magnitude of the infection is still not known and will be difficult to even assess due to harsh ground realities. Rural societies are very close knit and even in pandemic times, they continue to perform social customs, attend social functions and puja etc.,” he said.Reports from rural areas point to large gatherings for marriages, thread ceremonies, last rites and other social occasions being held, despite the restrictions imposed. Masadha village in Bhojpur has seen a number of deaths in the last one month. “So far, only four deaths have been confirmed due to Covid-19, but the actual number may be much higher,” said former deputy mukhiya Satyendra Singh.Another report from Ghoswar village in Vaishali district said villagers were concerned following 17 deaths in 25 days and several others suffering from unknown ailments.Rural lifestyle is not to be blamed alone for the situation; the creaking healthcare infrastructure too has a big role to play in precipitating the crisis, say health experts.Dr Anil Kumar, an assistant professor with the department of history in Delhi university’s Rajdhani College, recently drew the attention of Madhubani district magistrate towards the lack of basic health facilities at Kanhauli (Khajauli)-- his native village. “There is just one health centre for more than 8,000 people but it is not functioning even in the midst of pandemic. Villagers are suffering and dying in the absence of health facilities. One doctor on alternate days or at least on a weekly basis will immensely help,” he wrote to the DM after one person died with Covid symptoms but without a test report to confirm. The DM has assured him to look into the request.In absence of formal healthcare set up, people are forced to rely on ‘jhola chap’ doctors or quacks due to their accessibility and affordability.Under the National Health Mission (NHM), Primary Health Centre (PHC) is established to cover a population of 30,000 in rural areas and 20,000 in hilly, tribal and desert areas. Then there are other smaller health centres, but how many of them are actually able to meet the challenge is a big question. The Patna high court has also sought details of the situation in the rural areas.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/ignorance-poor-infrastructure-makes-rural-bihar-more-vulnerable-to-covid19-101621496762481.html
20-05-2021||Gurugram||Gurugrammers pedal to serve denizens, make essentials available at doorstep||Fighting the second wave of coronavirus, many are finding it difficult to get access to medicines and some essentials of day to day use. This has inspired a group of cyclists in the Millennium City, to come to the rescue of denizens, including the senior citizens. Referred to as the Relief Riders, these cyclists are overcoming the Covid scare to run errands for those in need, even in the hot weather; and in return are receiving good wishes and gratitude! “I used to bicycle regularly with my cycling group RockRiders in Gurugram. But during the lockdown, I realised how senior citizens were most vulnerable at this time, and needed help to get access to a lot things... Going on our rides was a pleasure, but being useful to those with need has been immensely satisfying,” says Vineet Chopra, who is leading the Gurugram Relief Riders initiative. The group is operational from 8am to 8pm seven days a week, and prioritises requests from senior citizens and Covid positive individuals, who are unable to step out in their neighbourhoods to procure medicines and food. “We are helping deliver medicines and other essentials at their doorstep. All they need to do is call up the helpline numbers and reach out to us,” adds Chopra. They have riders from different localities, who ride within their areas to ensure that they are able to work timely and stay safe. Payall Gupta, a Gurugrammer who manages the group’s helpline, informs that they get around 40 to 50 delivery requests, daily. “We do five to six deliveries in a day, but have to filter out calls that don’t fall within our purview such as those that require oxygen, beds and concentrators. When someone calls, the task gets shared on our common group, and the rider connects directly with the caller to coordinate the deliveries. Callers have to pay only the price of the goods that are purchased on their behalf,” she explains. The initiative started this month, and since it received participation from the cycling community group, PedalYatri, its number of volunteers rose to more than two dozen. An e-bike service provider has also offered their bikes for free, for this group to be able to undertake longer delivery rides. This has enabled a number of residents in the city, reeling under the effect of the pandemic, avail the crucial voluntary services amid the ongoing lockdown. When Ramona Keelor, a resident of Gurugram’s sector 22, was down with Covid, these angels on bikes brought a great source of comfort for her. She recalls, “I contacted them, and after that all my problems were solved! Vineet put me in touch with Isha in the group, and she picked up 10 tender coconuts for me the first day, and every day after that. If I got stuck and needed anything, say medicines or just a friendly voice, they were there to help with just about everything! I’m extremely grateful to these riders, for their assistance in my time of need!” Author tweets @bhagat_mallikaFollow more stories on Facebook and Twitter||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/gurugrammers-pedal-to-serve-denizens-make-essentials-available-at-doorstep-101621496743095.html

The perpetual rainfall was due to the impact of cyclonic storm Tauktae and a western disturbance ending 8.30am on Thursday. This was double the previous record rainfall received by Delhi on May 24, 1976, which was 60 mm, according to news agency ANI."A record 119.3 mm rain fell in Delhi between 8.30am on Wednesday and 8.30am on Thursday, which is a new record for May," Kuldeep Srivastava, the head of IMD's regional forecasting Centre, said.Delhi has received highest ever Rainfall of 119.3 mm since 1951 for the month of May pic.twitter.com/NnUkMfIJMjRainfall recorded below 15 mm is considered light, while that recorded between 15 mm and 64.5 mm is moderate. If recorded between 64.5 mm and 115.5 mm, it is heavy and between 115.6 mm and 204.4 mm is considered very heavy. Rainfall above 204.4 mm is considered extremely heavy rainfall.The city's maximum temperature also fell 16 degrees below normal, to 23.8 degrees Celsius, after a day-long spell of rainfall on Wednesday. This was the lowest maximum temperature in May for at least 70 years. Delhi's minimum temperature was 21.4 degrees Celsius, five degrees below the season’s normal.According to Srivastava, Cylcone Tauktae is not likely to have any impact on Delhi's weather for the next couple of days. “The maximum temperature will rise by three or four degrees on Thursday, and will continue to rise over the next four days. The cyclone is not forecast to have any impact on or around Delhi at least in the coming four to five days,” he said.On Wednesday, meanwhile, Delhi's maximum temperature was less than that of Srinagar (25.8 degrees Celsius) and Dharamshala (27.2 degrees Celsius), IMD said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-receives-highest-rainfall-since-1951-in-the-month-of-may-imd-101621490919052.html
20-05-2021||Patna||Most Covid vaccination sites in Patna to stay closed on Thursday||Only 11 out of 56 vaccination sites in Patna will be operational on Thursday to serve the 18-44 years age group as the state is low on Covid vaccines. As a result, many vaccination sites have been shut down in remote areas of other districts. The extent of the vaccination squeeze is evident as the state managed to vaccinate only 25, 037 people on Wednesday against its daily target of 2.50 lakh people.Officers associated with the vaccination programme said the state capital has received 14,000 doses of vaccine to be used over the next two days. Ever since the state began vaccinating the 18-44 years age group from May 9, Patna received two tranches of 38,000 and 25,000 doses. The quantity received on Wednesday, with the instruction to use it over the next two days, was the lowest so far.This is well below the number Bihar’s additional chief secretary (health) Pratyaya Amrit suggested will be made available by the Centre. On Tuesday, he said 200,000 doses of Covishield vaccine were expected on May 20 and 23 and another batch of 289,250 doses was expected on May 24.He, however, parried away a question on current vaccine availability in the state and on the closure of many vaccination sites.Manoj Kumar, executive director, state health society, Bihar, too did not respond to phone calls or text messages on availability of vaccines and curtailment of vaccination sites.Among the bigger centres, which would operate on Thursday, are the Patna Women’s College, the three Kendriya Vidyalayas at Danapur, Sheikhpura and Kankarbagh, the ITI at Digha, Aryabhatta Knowledge University and the Sri Krishna Memorial Hall.Most states are going through the problem of vaccine shortage as the Central government promises to make 2.16 billion vaccine doses available in the country in five months. This will include 750 million doses of Covishield and 550 million doses of Covaxin between August to December. India has stopped the exports of Covid-19 vaccines--blamed for the shortage in the country during the second wave of Covid-19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/most-covid-vaccination-sites-in-patna-to-stay-closed-on-thursday-101621488763136.html
20-05-2021||Lucknow||Uttar Pradesh MSMEs finding it difficult to operate amid Corona curfew||A body representing Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) says restrictions on transport and shortage of manpower has made continuation of operations difficult during the Covid-19 lockdown in Uttar Pradesh. They said they may be forced to consider shutting down shops till the situation normalises.Indian Industries Association (IIA) has pointed out that though the state government has exempted industrial activity from the ongoing corona curfew, production and maintenance work has been affected in almost all units“As transport services are off the roads, industries are finding it difficult to procure raw material and send finished products to stockists,” says Manmohan Agarwal, senior vice president, IIA.Agarwal adds that the state has not accepted some of their demands making resolution of the problem difficult.“We have requested the state government to exempt transport companies from the purview of corona curfew. Unless offices of transport companies are allowed to open, there will be no movement of trucks on roads. In such a scenario, industries cannot be run,” Agarwal said.He adds that if the situation continues like this, MSMES will have to shut down for the time being.Another association member pointed out that MSME units in Noida and Meerut were working at minimum capacity due the disrupted supply chain and low work force.“...Workers have left for their homes, fearing the pandemic,” said Rajiv Bansal, national secretary, IIA.According to the association, Uttar Pradesh has around 30 lakh MSMEs comprising 90% micro units and 8% small units. The body says that while 180 out of the 240 units at Noida Special Economic Zone (NSEZ) are currently operational, the manpower has shrunk significantly due migrants returning to their hometowns.Bansal says only around 5,000 workers are currently available in Noida against 50,000 capacity and since all shops are closed except for those related with essential items, it is also hard to get maintenance work done at industrial units.“We have also requested the government to allow all essential shops related with industries to open at least for two days in a week so that maintenance work may be carried out, if required,” said Bansal.Uttar Pradesh government has imposed curfew like restrictions till 7 am on May 24 to contain the spread of coronavirus in the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/uttar-pradesh-msmes-finding-it-difficult-to-operate-amid-corona-curfew-101621488427664.html
20-05-2021||Lucknow||Lucknow to use machines to clean sewer hotspots to protect staff amid Covid-19||The Lucknow municipal corporation (LMC) and the Jal Sansthan will use jetting machines to clean at least 50 sewer overflow hotspots in the city identified through geographic information system (GIS) mapping as it moves from manual scavenging to mechanical cleaning to protect sanitation workers from health hazards amid Covid-19 pandemic, said officials.Areas near Civil Hospital in Hazratganj, Lalkuan, road near Raj Bhawan, Hewett road, Chitta Khera, Billauchpura, Alambagh bus station, Chander Nagar, Balaganj and Thakurganj, are among areas identified for cleaning through machines. Mayor Sanyukta Bhatia said Sewage India has been entrusted with the work.“Lucknow is also moving from non-mechanical systems to more mechanical and automated systems. The latest equipment has been introduced for cleaning of drains and sewage to save sanitation workers from health hazards. During the pandemic, it is the duty of the civic body to take care of its workforce. Currently, over 525 workers are into cleaning of sewers. They will be trained to operate advanced cleaning machines,” Bhatia said.She added this use of machines has become important due to the need to complete a high volume of work in a short period. “More than 800 nullahs and 1,500 small drains have to be cleaned before May 31. Similarly, all the sewer lines have to be cleaned before this date.”Amit Kumar, additional municipal commissioner said the use of machines will likely cut down the risks associated with manual scavenging.Lucknow recorded 493 fresh Covid-19 cases and 29 deaths on Wednesday, even as the state-wide Covid tally rose by 7,336 fresh cases to reach 1,644,851.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/lucknow-to-use-machines-to-clean-sewer-hotspots-to-protect-staff-amid-covid19-101621487861936.html
20-05-2021||Chandigarh||World’s highest motorable village Komic achieves 100% Covid vaccination||The world’s highest motorable village of Komic in the remote Spiti valley of Himachal’s tribal Lahaul and Spiti district has achieved 100% vaccination against Covid-19 for residents above the age of 44 years. Situated at 15,500 feet, the villagers rarely leave their houses and adhere strictly to the guidelines by the state government to protect themselves against Covid-19. “If we walk out of our houses, it’s only for farming. The older generation stays home with the children,” says local resident Palzor, 37. Villagers have been keen to get vaccinated and a majority took their doses ahead of the second lethal wave. “We are happy that the villagers have taken their second dose, too,” says Kaza block medical officer Tenzin Norbu. Also read: India logs 276,110 Covid-19 cases in a single-day; fatalities below 4,000A health department team, comprising vaccinator Prem Singh, verifier Kulwant Singh and ASHA worker Padma, have been visiting the high-altitude villages in Langza panchayat to vaccinate the residents. Besides Langza, the panchayat comprises Komic, which has the highest motorable road, and Hikkim at 14,400 ft with the highest post office in the world. In the 60-plus age group, 101 people have been vaccinated,while 150 villagers have got both doses in the 44-60 age group. Langza panchayat has a total population of 330. Climbing over connectivity challenges “After seniors, now youngsters are enthusiastic about getting vaccinated. The challenge in this area is limited internet connectivity so it becomes difficult for them to log on to the Co-Win portal to get registered,” says Padma, the accredited social health activist (ASHA). Kaza additional district magistrate Gian Sagar Negi says the state government was requested to allow offline registration for vaccination. Chief minister Jai Ram Thakur has now allowed it due to lack of internet facility. “Now 80% of the registration for vaccination is being done offline. Booking is done by calling up the health department and the slot is allotted based on lottery. 20% of the registration are still being done online but everyone has to first register for vaccination,” Lahaul and Spiti deputy commissioner Pankaj Rai says. Tough terrain, climate no deterrent Despite its tough terrain and the valley receiving heavy snowfall at regular intervals, the Kaza block, comprising 13 panchayats, has taken the lead on vaccination. “People have no hesitancy in getting inoculated as they know that the health infrastructure in the region is limited. Everyone here wants to be protected from the virus,” says Padma. The health authorities at Kaza have been able to vaccinate 89% of the healthcare workers. Of the total 174 healthcare workers, 154 have got both doses. As many as 743 of the 914 people aged above 60 years have got the first dose of the vaccine, which is 82% of the total number, while 722 (79%) have been given the second dose as well. In the 45-59 age group, the Kaza health block has achieved 95% of the target by administering the first dose to 1,490 of the 1,578 residents. Ninety-six frontline workers have been given the first dose and 105 the second dose in Kaza. Among the vaccinated, 16 people had comorbidities. Till date, a total of 2,499 people have been administered the first dose and 997 the second dose in the valley.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/worlds-highest-village-komic-in-hp-achieves-100-covid-vaccination-101621487263505.html

The case could not be heard by the bench,” said an advocate who is also a TMC leader. The division bench of acting Chief Justice Rajesh Bindal and Justice Arijit Banerjee was supposed to hear the case today. The bench heard the bail pleas of the arrested leaders on Wednesday for around two hours. The hearing, however, didn’t end and the court decided to hear it again on Thursday.Cabinet ministers Firhad Hakim and Subrata Mukherjee, TMC legislator Madan Mitra, and former mayor Sovan Chatterjee, who were arrested by the CBI on Monday, have spent three nights in judicial custody after the high court stayed the interim bail granted to them by a special CBI court. The CBI had opposed the bail of the leaders on the ground that they can influence the witnesses and investigation, and has also sought transfer of the trial of the case. Wednesday saw a pitched courtroom battle with senior advocates Abhishek Manu Singhvi, Siddharth Luthra and Kalyan Banerjee, who also happens to be a TMC MP, pleading for the arrested leaders. Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, appearing for the CBI, opposed the bail. Also Read | CBI makes Mamata party to Narada plea; TMC files FIREven though the leaders were sent to judicial custody, they all had to be admitted in hospitals after their complaint of illness on Tuesday. While Hakim is admitted in the hospital of Presidency Correctional Home, the rest were admitted to the state-run SSKM hospital. “They (four leaders) are not in jail. They are in hospital. They should be in jail. That is my case,” Mehta told the court The SSKM hospital authorities have set up a medical board for their treatment. Hakim, who was suffering from fever, tested negative for Covid-19. Singhvi, however, argued that the CBI was trying to keep the leaders in jail for a few more days “by hook or crook, more by hook than crook”. “All the accused are in hospital. Where can they run away?” Singhvi asked, while seeking bail. The case pertains to a two-year-long sting operation whose videos were uploaded months ahead of the 2016 assembly elections. The sting operation, conducted by online news portal Narada News, purportedly caught several senior TMC leaders accepting money in exchange for alleged favours to a fictitious company. On Monday, soon after the arrests, chief minister Mamata Banerjee staged a dharna at the CBI’s office in Kolkata, while state law minister had led nearly 3,000 TMC workers and supporters to the court premises. Outside the CBI’s office in south Kolkata, hundreds of TMC supporters staged a protest hurling bricks, bottles and shoes at the central forces. “I don’t think anywhere else in the country such shocking incidents have happened where a premier investigating agency, which has been entrusted with the investigation by this court, is stopped from doing its job,” Mehta told the court. In response, Singhvi described the chief minister’s dharna at the agency’s office for six hours as a ”Gandhian way of protest” without any exhortation of violence. Meanwhile, the CBI on Wednesday named Mamata Banerjee, law minister Moloy Ghatak and senior lawmaker Kalyan Banerjee as respondents in its plea to transfer the case out of the state, claiming violent protests orchestrated by Trinamool Congress hampered its probe and intimidated lower courts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/narada-sting-calcutta-hc-to-take-up-bail-pleas-of-4-arrested-politicians-today-101621486181537.html

The rains also led to a dip in the maximum temperature, making it the lowest maximum temperature since 1951.IMD recordings showed that till 8.30pm on Wednesday, Delhi’s Safdarjung observatory had recorded 60mm rainfall. IMD officials said that till now, the all-time record of rainfall for May for Safdarjung is 60.0 mm, recorded on May 24, 1976, and since the rain continued through the night in most parts of the city, this record has been broken. Palam observatory recorded 36.8mm rain and the Najafgarh station recorded 57mm rainfall.Recordings for overall rainfall between Wednesday and early Thursday will be released by IMD by afternoon.Delhi and NCR received moderate rainfall throughout Wednesday, which resulted in a drop of 16 degrees Celsius (°C), IMD said. The drop in temperature resulted in the lowest maximum temperature recorded in the month of May in at least 70 years.Kuldeep Srivastava, head of IMD’s regional weather forecasting centre, said, “Some parts of Delhi might receive light rain till Thursday afternoon as well,” Srivastava said.Srivastava said that Wednesday’s rain and the resultant drop in temperature was similar to what the city usually experiences during peak monsoon season, in August.Also Read | Covid-19 cases down, Delhi begins 3rd wave prepWednesday’s rain led to a drastic drop in the temperatures, with the maximum temperature at the Safdarjung observatory falling to 23.8°C, 16°C below the normal for this time of the year. The minimum temperature was 21.4°C, five notches below the season’s normal. The Palam observatory recorded a maximum temperature of 25.7°C, 15°C. The minimum temperature here was 20.2°C.“We need to understand that this weather was induced by a rare phenomenon, the cyclonic storms. But it is true that even during peak monsoons, Delhi seldom experiences consistent rains,” a senior IMD official said.According to IMD, Wednesday’s temperatures were the lowest since 1951, the oldest recorded temperature available. Before this, the lowest maximum temperature was 24.8°C, recorded on May 13, 1982.“The maximum temperature will rise by 3-4°C degrees on Thursday and then will continue to rise in the coming four days. There is no impact of the cyclone seen in and around Delhi at least in the coming four to five days,” Srivastava said.IMD officials explained that rainfall activity began in parts of Delhi starting Tuesday night under the residual impact of cyclone Tauktae. The IMD issued an orange alert over Delhi and NCR on Tuesday, to alert authorities to be prepared for the possibility of heavy rain and gusty winds.Cyclone Tauktae (pronounced as Tau’Te) that intensified into an extremely severe cyclonic storm made a landfall on Gujarat coast late on Monday evening with wind speed between 150kmph and 160kmph.

In Kolkata, minister of state for health Chandrima Bhattacharya filed an FIR against CBI over the arrest of senior ministers Firhad Hakim and Subrata Mukherjee, and legislator Madan Mitra, alleging they were held illegally.The three leaders, along with former Kolkata mayor Sovan Chatterjee, were arrested on Monday morning in connection with the 2014 sting operation (details of which went public in 2016), setting off fierce protests by the TMC and a six-hour long agitation at CBI office by Banerjee.In its transfer petition, the agency claimed the protests and stone-pelting mob prevented CBI officers from physically producing the accused in the court. “The CBI court passed the order granting bail to the four under the cloud of mobocracy, pressure, threat and violence and is a nullity in the eyes of law,” the federal agency said, marking the first time in recent history that a sitting chief minister was named in a case transfer petition. The bail granted by the special CBI court on Monday evening was stayed by the high court hours later.TMC rejected the charge and blamed the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).“I am not going into the merits of the case it is sub judice. But the timing of the arrest and the manner in which the case is being dealt clearly shows BJP is behaving in a vindictive manner. It is not being able to digest the humiliating defeat and accept the people’s mandate. We have full faith on the judiciary,” said Kunal Ghosh, TMC spokespersonWednesday saw a pitched courtroom battle before the division bench of acting chief justice Rajesh Bindal and justice Arijit Banerjee. All four leaders are in hospital currently. Hakim is admitted in the hospital of Presidency Correctional Home, the other three are at state-run SSKM hospital.“They (four leaders) are not in jail. They are in hospital. They should be in jail. That is my case,” solicitor general Tushar Mehta, representing CBI, told the court, adding that all the four accused were highly influential and can influence the witnesses and investigation.But Abhishek Manu Singhvi, representing the four leaders, argued CBI was trying to keep the leaders in jail for one more day or two more days, “by hook or crook, more by hook than crook”.“All the accused are in hospital. Where can they run away?” Singhvi questioned while seeking bail, adding that no court can stay interim bail without giving notice to the accused.The case pertains to a two-year-long sting operation whose videos were uploaded months ahead of the 2016 assembly elections. The sting, conducted by online news portal Narada News, purportedly caught several senior TMC leaders accepting money in exchange for alleged favours to a fictitious company.TMC alleged the arrests were political vendetta by BJP,which lost the recent assembly polls, and questioned why CBI hasn’t arrested Suvendu Adhikari and Mukul Roy, who were also seen in the sting but have since switched from the TMC to the BJP.On Monday, soon after the four were arrested, Banerjee staged a dharna at the CBI’s office in Kolkata, while state law minister Moloy Ghatak led nearly 3,000 workers and supporters to the court premises. Outside CBI’s office in south Kolkata, hundreds of TMC supporters staged a protest hurling bricks, bottles and shoes at central forces.CBI said it was an orchestrated attempt to frustrate the course of justice and that there was “unprecedented hooliganism”.“I don’t think anywhere else in the country such shocking incidents have happened where a premier investigating agency, which has been entrusted with the investigation by this court, is stopped from doing its job,” Mehta told the court.In response, Singhvi described the chief minister’s dharna as a “Gandhian way of protest” without any exhortation of violence.“Merely because a matter has gone to court, it will not stop democratic dissent. It would be negation of democracy to say that just because the matter is before court you cannot peacefully protest outside,” Singhvi told the court.BJP dismissed TMC’s allegations.“We don’t want to comment on what the CBI is doing or on the court proceedings. Law will take its own course and BJP is no way associated with this. But we have seen that if the CBI goes slow in a case the Left and the Congress allege that there is a secret pact between the TMC and BJP. If there is any activity, the TMC cries political vendetta. Not only is the BJP tired of listening to such allegations, even the people of Bengal are tired,” said Samik Bhattacharya, BJP spokesperson .||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/cbi-makes-mamata-party-to-narada-plea-tmc-files-fir-101621476316897.html
20-05-2021||Mumbai||Cyclone Tauktae: At least 26 dead on Arabian Sea barge amid rescue ops||The Indian Navy and Coast Guard’s ships and aircraft trawled the waters off Mumbai’s coast on Wednesday after Cyclone Tauktae sank a barge and battered at least three other vessels and facilities in the Arabian Sea, with 26 confirmed dead and 49 still missing more than 48 hours into a challenging rescue operation.The “extremely severe” cyclone, the most powerful one to barrel through the region in over two decades, caused gusts of wind up to 210kmph and nine-metre waves as it raced past Mumbai and made landfall in Gujarat on Monday night. It led to the evacuation of hundreds of thousands of people in coastal states, with at least five dozen others losing their lives in storm-related incidents.“Indian Navy’s Search and Rescue (SAR) operations off Mumbai and Gujarat entered their third day today (Wednesday). Indian Naval ships and aircraft are presently undertaking SAR of the missing crew members of Accommodation Barge P305, which sank on May 17, 35 miles off Mumbai… As of now, 186 crew members of Accommodation barge P305, and two from Tug Varaprada have been rescued by Indian Navy ships and aircraft,” the Indian Navy said.Also Read| PM Modi reviews Tauktae damage in GujaratThe barge named P305 (Papaa 305), with living quarters for 261 people working offshore, sank after the storm battered the Bombay High oilfield on Monday near Mumbai, where some of the country’s biggest offshore oil rigs are located. The facility and two other barges that were hit by the cyclone were deployed by Afcons for a contract from state-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corporation Limited (ONGC).All 137 people on board barge Gal Constructor, which ran aground about 90km north of Mumbai’s Colaba Point, were rescued on Tuesday by the navy and the Indian Coast Guard, a person involved in the operation said. The 196 people on barge SS-3 and 101 personnel on board oil rig Sagar Bhushan were also brought to safety, he added. The three barges and the oil rig housed 695 people in total.In a challenging air and sea mission, rescuers secured 180 of the 261 crew members from P305 by Tuesday evening, about 20 hours after they were forced to jump into the extremely rough sea after the barge sank.Six more people were picked up by the rescuers on Wednesday, the navy said. An officer said search and rescue operations were on for the remaining 49 crew members of the accommodation barge.“Search and rescue operations are still on. However, the chances of finding more survivors are getting bleaker by the hour,” the official said, asking not to be named.The oil ministry on Wednesday constituted a high-level committee to investigate the sequence of events leading to the stranding of three vessels of the contractor of ONGC.“The stranding, drifting and subsequent events have led to loss of several lives,” a ministry statement said without giving details.The Mumbai Police will conduct a probe as to why P305 stayed in the area despite warnings about Cyclone Tauktae, an official said on condition of anonymity.Also Read| Firm that ran cyclone-hit barges says people on board had life jackets, raftsIn a statement, Afcons said: “P305 had a full complement of safety equipment including life jackets and life rafts for all persons on board.” ONGC said it was extending help to the navy and coast guard in the rescue effort.Hundreds of thousands of people were evacuated on Monday, with electricity supply and transport services badly hit on land as the most powerful Arabian Sea cyclone in over two decades moved up the country’s western coast, making landfall in Gujarat after leaving a trail of destruction in Kerala, Karnataka, Goa and Maharashtra, and killing dozens of people.According to deputy chief of naval staff, vice admiral Murlidhar Sadashiv Pawar, the barge sank at 7pm on Monday in choppy waters and rough weather.The navy received SOS calls from P305 on Monday morning. Warships INS Kochi, INS Kolkata, INS Beas, INS Betwa, INS Teg, P8I maritime surveillance aircraft, Chetak, ALH & Sea King helicopters are involved in the operation.“INS Kochi which entered Mumbai harbour on Wednesday to disembark 125 survivors and mortal remains of four crew members, was immediately sailed out in the evening again to continue the search effort,” the navy said.On completion of its operations off the Gujarat coast, INS Talwar has also been diverted to join other three naval ships searching for the missing crew of barge P305 off Mumbai. INS Talwar assisted in securing SS-3 and Sagar Bhushan, which were now being safely towed back to Mumbai by ONGC support vessels, the navy said.The navy also rescued two crew members of a tugboat, Varprada. They were picked up by INS Kolkata on Monday while it was on its way to join rescue efforts at P305. The two people informed naval officers that they were part of the crew of a tugboat that went missing along with 11 other crew members. It wasn’t immediately clear if this was the same tugboat that was being used to secure the barge named Gal Constructor.“No one would have had survived if not for the help that came... We are thankful they saved our lives,” a survivor told news agency ANIAnother survivor said he jumped into the sea with his life jacket and was later picked up by the navy. “We saw our ship sink and several people on the deck were falling into the sea. [We] spent more than 10 hours in stormy water when the Navy rescued 12 people out of our group of 14 on Tuesday morning. Two are still missing,” said 22-year-old Sunil Kumar Madhesia, who worked as a helper on the barge.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/cyclone-tauktae-at-least-26-dead-on-arabian-sea-barge-amid-rescue-ops-101621476292908.html

The last date for submission was May 18, but after failing to receive any bids, BMC extended the deadline to May 25.Mumbai has 11 million people over the age of 18 years, the current eligible group for vaccines.In an interview with Bloomberg TV, Chahal said BMC estimates that it will spend about ₹700 crore to buy the shots. “Once we get 15 million vaccine shots, I plan to vaccinate the entire city in the next 60 days and by doing so, I am very sure we will be able to stop the third wave from coming.”Meanwhile, the three proposals for Sputnik V vaccines have come from a United Kingdom-based firm and two companies from India. According to BMC officials, their paperwork was incomplete so the companies have been asked to send revised proposals as formal bids. The identity of the companies was not revealed by BMC; nor was it immediately clear.Additional municipal commissioner P Velrasuadded: “We have received three proposals. All of them are for Sputnik vaccine but have come with incomplete paperwork. So we have given the extension.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/got-proposals-from-3-firms-for-import-of-sputnik-v-says-bmc-101621474110215.html
20-05-2021||Delhi||SOS calls for black fungus drug as cases rise in Delhi||With cases of mucormycosis on the rise, families of patients are struggling to procure Amphotericin B — an anti-fungal drug prescribed for the treatment of the disease, with pharmacies in Delhi citing unavailability due to increase in demand.Mucormycosis, or black fungus, is a life-threatening disease that is affecting recovered Covid-19 patients. It is more common among those who have high blood sugar levels, are immuno-compromised or have been administered too many steroids during the treatment of Covid-19, say doctors.The government is regulating the supply of the drug to prevent its indiscriminate use and black marketing. Delhi health minister Satyendar Jain said: “The treatment of the infection can be done only in hospitals, so the drug is directly being given to hospitals.”Also Read| Delhi reports 185 cases of black fungus, in possible fallout of Covid-19 surgeTwo days ago, Payal, a Pune-resident, lost her uncle who was getting treated for black fungus in Delhi. The family was unable to procure the drug after trying for days. "We made more than 100 calls for two straight days but couldn't get hold of the drug. The hospital had shared a prescription with us. We went from pillar to post to no avail. Before we could procure the medicine, my uncle died following a heart attack," said Payal. The family reached out to pharmacies in Pune and Delhi but most didn't have a stock. Multiple pharmacies in the city said that Liposomal Amphotericin B is not available in the market and there is no clarity on when the supply will regularise.Sandeep Nangia, organising secretary of the All India Organisation of Chemists and Druggists (AIOCD), said Amphotericin B was not available in the market and clarity on its supply was awaited. “Amphotericin B is not available right now. We will have to wait for the supply chain to be regularised. Due to a sudden spike in demand, we have run out of stock. Once the stock is replenished, we can expect an improvement in the situation,” said Nangia.Ashok Malik, proprietor of Malik International Pharmaceutical, said the demand for the drug has increased substantially in the past week. “Amphotericin B is not available with us. We are getting at least 500 calls daily but can’t do anything if there is no supply. As per a government directive, manufacturers will send the stock straight to hospitals,” he said.Sai Distributors said the drug is not available for the past two weeks.“We have four callers all of them have been receiving at least 500 calls each, seeking amphotericin B,” said Gaurav, an associate at Sai Distributors.Volunteer networks said on Wednesday they have been receiving SOS calls for the drug. Dr Suvrankar Datta, a junior resident at AIIMS, who is a member of a network of doctors helping patients with resources, said the distribution of the anti-fungal drug was not equitable. “Many hospitals have an adequate stock, which is likely to last for months whereas other hospitals don’t have any stock. We are continuously getting SOS calls,” said Datta.Bhavreen Kandhari, an activist, who has been involved in verifying leads and sharing credible information pertaining to bed availability, oxygen, and plasma, said while the government has put out a new notification, hospitals are asking patients to procure the drug from outside. “While the government has said that hospitals will arrange the medicine for the patients, we don’t see it happening since family members of patients are reaching out to us with requests,” said Kandhari.Yogita Bhayana, another activist, who has been dealing with Covid-related SOS calls, said sourcing medicines for mucormycosis was proving to be a new challenge. Stating that she has been receiving many calls seeking help in arranging Amphotericin B, Bhavana said, “I made many calls but it’s difficult to find Liposomal Amphotericin B. Pharmacies are telling us that the drug is not available in the market for the past 15 days. In such a situation, we are unable to help people.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/sos-calls-for-black-fungus-drug-as-cases-rise-in-delhi-101621468372473.html

Two such patients also died, but senior health department officials said they could only attribute it to mucormycosis after an audit.According to the hospitals that treated them, the patients suffered a cardiac arrest.“The deaths are suspected to be due to mucormycosis. A 12-member state-level committee has been constituted to audit both cases and give their final report,” said Dr Virender Yadav, Gurugram chief medical officer.The first death was reported from Max Super Specialty Hospital on May 16, and the second death happened a day later at Fortis Memorial Research Institute (FMRI).The patient at Max Hospital, a 29-year-old, arrived at the emergency unit in a critical condition on May 15 morning. “He was bleeding from the nose, complained of nausea (and) headache. He was disoriented and had a severely damaged right eye with loss of vision. He had been ill with Covid-19 since April 23 and was undergoing treatment from outside (not from the hospital).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/covid19-2-dead-of-black-fungus-in-gurugram-say-hospitals-101621468414461.html
20-05-2021||Delhi||Singapore calls in Indian envoy, objects to Delhi CM’s comments on Covid strain||Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal’s remarks about a new coronavirus strain being detected in Singapore led to the South-east Asian country on Wednesday calling in the Indian envoy to lodge an objection, and to a political war of words between the Centre and the Delhi government.External affairs minister S Jaishankar said the chief minister “does not speak for India”, and external affairs ministry spokesperson Arindam Bagchi said in a tweet that the Indian high commissioner P Kumaran clarified the matter with his Singapore counterparts. It is rare for the external affairs ministry to acknowledge that an Indian envoy has been called in by a foreign government to lodge a protest, and to publicly criticise an elected Indian representative.In response to the foreign ministry’s comments, Delhi’s deputy CM Manish Sisodia hit out at India’s handling of the situation, and contended that Centre and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) were only concerned about their image globally, and not about the well-being of the country’s children.“[Kejriwal] said that the danger of Covid-19 infecting more children is increasing. That is what it looks like going by the strain there [Singapore]... which is why it is necessary that we also remain alert... Singapore’s education minister had also given a statement that the risk of children getting infected is increasing. But today the BJP has started dirty politics on the issue,” Sisodia said.“Had the foreign ministry been as quick to get vaccines from other countries as it was in reacting to Kejriwal’s statement, the children of India would have got vaccines,” he said.Meanwhile, Singapore’s high commissioner Simon Wong told a virtual news conference his country was satisfied with the Indian government’s clarification, but reserved the right to invoke a domestic fake news law to prevent the spreading of misinformation.Jaishankar tweeted that Singapore and India are solid partners in the fight against Covid-19, and appreciated Singapore’s role as a logistics hub and oxygen supplier. “However, irresponsible comments from those who should know better can damage long-standing partnerships,” he added.Earlier on Wednesday, Singapore foreign minister Vivian Balakrishnan quoted the CM’s original tweet and said: “There is no ‘Singapore variant’.”On Tuesday, Kejriwal said in his tweet in Hindi: “The new form of Covid-19 that has come to Singapore is being said to be extremely dangerous for children. In India, it may come as a third wave. My appeal to the Central government: 1. Air services with Singapore be cancelled with immediate effect 2. Priority on vaccine options should be worked out for children too.”Hours after his tweet, Singapore’s health ministry dismissed his assertions, and said the variant prevalent in many Covid-19 cases in recent weeks was the “B.1.617.2 variant, which originated in India”.Some experts have said India’s third Covid wave could affect children, but there is no scientific evidence to suggest that the virus specifically targets younger people. Children, however, are the only demographic group to be completely unprotected because vaccines are currently only given to those over 18.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/singapore-calls-in-indian-envoy-objects-to-delhi-cm-s-comments-on-covid-strain-101621468459039.html

20-05-2021||Delhi||Delhiwale: The Covid care he deserved, and got||His quarantine lasted 14 days.“It was like chaudah saal ka vanvaas,” says Shailesh Singh, comparing his ordeal to Lord Ram’s 14 years of exile.Except that his banishment from the familiar world wasn’t in a forest, but in an apartment complex, in Gurugram’s Sector 31—the address where he has been serving as a much-cherished security officer for a decade. Mr Singh’s brush with the coronavirus pandemic gave him a terrifying glimpse of life’s frailty, but also showed him the generosity of his immediate world, especially of the people among whom he works.This afternoon, the fresh Covid veteran is chatting from his home in Sainikhera village, a 10-minute bike ride to work, surrounded by wife, Shobha Devi, and sons, Aman and Aryan.He was on duty when tested positive early this month. On notifying the apartment complex residents, reassuring words flowed in instantly. “Brigadier Anand Mohan (resident welfare association’s president) called me on phone saying—‘Shailesh, don’t go home, we are giving you a place to quarantine. We are with you’.”Mr Singh was put up in a one-room flat for the next two weeks. It had a bed, AC, fridge, and a kitchenette. “Everyone [in the complex] looked after me as if I were a family member... Brigadier Sahab would send home-made meals, so would Karunesh Bhalla-ji (RWA secretary) and many others... somebody would send fruits, somebody would send nariyal paani (coconut water), somebody would send breakfast…”He also got medical care. “Doctor Anurag Singh, who lives in the same complex, would monitor my symptoms and send me medicines.”Such care helped Mr Singh cope with the infection, but he was still alone in the flat. “I was going mad thinking of my wife and sons, of what would become of them if something awful were to happen to me.” His anxieties amplified on hearing the deaths of relatives to Covid in home town, Gaya. The most consoling part of the day would be the phone chat with wife. In fact, Shobha Devi made him fish curry to mark his return home two days ago.The security officer feels that his recovery, where so many others succumbed to the deadly virus, is a matter of chance. “From now on I will help people as generously as I can,” he says in a voice emotional with a naked earnestness. He plans to get back to “duty” in a few days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhiwale-the-covid-care-he-deserved-and-got-101621468151077.html
20-05-2021||Delhi||Covid-19 cases down, Delhi begins preparations for third wave||Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Wednesday said that the Delhi government has set in motion a plan to prepare for the next wave of Covid-19 infections in the Capital, which could require nearly 40,000 oxygen beds and 10,000 ICU beds, and potentially hit younger people, particularly children, harder.The move comes at a time when experts have warned that a new wave of infections cannot be ruled out, especially due to the threat of more transmissible Sars-Cov-2 variants, low vaccination coverage, and the lifting of the lockdown that was put in place in an effort to flatten the pandemic’s curve.“If the third wave of the coronavirus emerges, we have to be prepared in advance to fight it. Took some important decisions today at a meeting with officials: 1. We will have a special task force to protect children from the third wave; 2 There will be better arrangements than before for adequate number of beds, oxygen, and essential medicines,” Kejriwal said in a tweet after the meeting.Also Read| Covid-19: Delhi makes new tracing push with revised targets“In the meeting (on Wednesday), the need for advance preparations for the third wave of Covid-19 were discussed. The third wave may require Delhi to be prepared with 40,000 oxygen beds, and the Delhi government is making preparations to install 10,000 ICU beds. Along with beds and oxygen management, management of medicine was also discussed. A committee comprising officials will be formed to overlook the availability of medicines, oxygen, and beds,” the chief minister’s office later said in a statement.Over the last four weeks, the Capital was battered by a devastating wave of infections – the fourth wave for city and the second nationwide since the pandemic began – with health care capacities inundated and critical medical supplies such as oxygen running out.With the test positivity rate clocking in at under 6% on Wednesday, the city appears to have all but crossed this wave of infections, which began in the first week of April and has claimed over 11,000 lives – as many as the previous three waves put together. The city had 11,133 deaths till April 7 and between April 8, when the positivity crept back up above 5% on average, and May 19, it added 11,213 more fatalities.Kejriwal said he has asked officials to stay alert of any possible outbreak among children and directed for a special task force to monitor the pattern of infection among the young and make the necessary interventions.He also asked for another committee to be set up to oversee availability of medical oxygen, medicines and beds.While Covid-19 typically manifests more mildly in children compared to adults, some experts have in recent days flagged the growing risks to children in the future, who are yet to be made eligible for vaccine doses since these are yet to be fully tested among them. This is now the second academic year in which children have had to stay at home and learn remotely, which not many have been able to access.Also Read| Delhi reports 185 cases of black fungus, in possible fallout of Covid-19 surge“If the third wave does happen, it will affect the children because others would have either had the infection or received a vaccine. So far, there are no vaccines for children in India. This is the reason we need to start preparing for management of Covid-19 in children,” said Dr Lalit Kant, former head of the department of epidemiology at the Indian Council of Medical Research.“The physiology of children is different, so the case management is also different. We would need fresh treatment protocols and SOPs. We will need to arrange for appropriate medicines and equipment,” he added.A senior government official said the special task force will have paediatricians, experts, and senior IAS officers as members. The chief minister has also asked health officials to closely monitor developments regarding Covid-19 vaccination, especially for children, and to stay in constant touch with the central government to place orders as soon as doses are made available for them.Even as the number of new cases reduces – they have fallen by 71% in the last two weeks alone -- departments and district administrations have been asked not to dismantle any Covid care centre (CCC) built over the past month, according to a second official, who asked not to be named. Delhi went into a lockdown on April 17; the government has extended this till May 24, and it is likely to see at least one more extension.The chief minister’s office said that while addressing officials in the meeting, Kejriwal said: “Increased numbers of Covid beds also require increased amount of oxygen allocation to hospitals. We need to keep enough oxygen tankers at hand so that we do not fall short of supply. We also need to ensure optimum oxygen storage and proper functioning of oxygen plants.”Also Read| On Kejriwal's comment, Singapore says reserve right to invoke fake news lawIn a separate meeting, lieutenant governor Anil Baijal held a review on the Covid-19 situation and directed officials to take “immediate steps” to ensure availability of drugs related to black fungus and the newly launched 2-DG for people in genuine and medically prescribed need.The L-G also asked officials to ensure that distributors and retailers of drugs and equipment related to Covid are made to mandatorily display their stocks and prices to the customers.“The L-G also instructed that achievable and compressed timelines for setting up of oxygen plants in hospitals and other related infrastructure be put in place immediately. He stressed that testing, especially RT-PCR should not go down, since owing to the lockdown, rapid antigen tests (RAT) have naturally gone down. With regards to the hospital infrastructure to deal with future eventualities, LG instructed that preparedness thereof should take into account the worst case, best case and the likely scenarios in consultation with experts,” an official in the L-G office said on condition of anonymity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/covid19-cases-down-delhi-begins-3rd-wave-prep-101621463841607.html
20-05-2021||Delhi||Oxygen concentrator hoarding: ED registers money-laundering case against Kalra||The Enforcement Directorate (ED) has registered a money laundering case against businessman and restauranteur Navneet Kalra, who was arrested by Delhi Police on Sunday evening for allegedly hoarding oxygen concentrators at three of his restaurants and selling them at inflated prices, ED officials said on Wednesday.The money laundering probe will lead to the agency looking at any suspicious financial transactions made by Kalra in the past, ED officers said.Kalra was arrested from a farmhouse in Gurugram on Sunday even as lawyers were trying to obtain anticipatory bail for him from the Delhi high court through the week.Police were on the lookout for him since the recovery of 524 oxygen concentrators from three of his restaurants – Khan Chacha, Town Hall and Nege & Ju – and from the office of Matrix Cellular on May 7.Kalra is alleged to have purchased the concentrators from Matrix Cellular which had imported them.As part of its probe under Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA), ED will look into the money trail of the sale and purchase of oxygen concentrators, whether they were being given to Covid-19 patients and caregivers at exorbitant prices, and to ascertain if others were involved, said an ED officer who asked not to be named.A second ED officer said they have already taken all case documents from the police and a probe has begun after registering an ECIR (Enforcement Case Information Report) – equivalent to an FIR – a few days ago.Delhi Police claims that it has evidence to prove concentrators, which were bought for ₹14,000 to ₹15,000, were being sold for prices upwards of Rs75,000.Demand for oxygen concentrators swelled during the fourth wave of Covid-19 in the Capital with many hospitals running out of medical oxygen as the number of critically ill patients rose. The devices, which can derive 80-90% pure oxygen from ambient air, were also a crucial part of supplies and aid provided by many foreign countries to India.Four employees of Matrix Cellular Company, including its CEO and vice-president, were also arrested in this case by the police. They were, however, granted bail by the court.The high court while granting bail to the four said it was unable to understand the offence they had committed, since the terms that they were charged under weren’t defined by the Acts being considered by the court.A lawyer, who represented Kalra in the HC, refused to comment saying they have not been told by the ED about the probe.Meanwhile, police on Wednesday said Kalra was “evasive” and “non-cooperative” with the probe team during three days of custodial interrogation. On Wednesday, the team took Kalra to his in-laws’ farmhouse in Gurugram for a search to recover “more evidence”.However, no fresh evidence related to the case was seized from the farmhouse unlike Tuesday, when similar searches at his restaurants, his optical shop-- Dayal Opticals, and an office in Okhla led to the recovery of a laptop and “crucial documents”, investigators said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/oxygen-concentrator-hoarding-ed-registers-money-laundering-case-against-kalra-101621459570103.html

The man turned to the police for help,” said Rajiv Ranjan, DCP (outer-north).Police said Aamir was a serial offender, who confessed to targeting several other young girls and women. It is learnt that he deleted all the chats with his victims, including the one with the 13-year-old girl, from his mobile phone. Police have sent his phone for forensic examination to retrieve the lost chats.Aamir belongs to Bijnaur in Uttar Pradesh and is a barber by profession. He operated an Instagram account in which he posed as a young rich man. “He would befriend girls on social media, fake a relationship with them, and then trick them into sending him their images,” said the DCP.As soon as he received these private images, Aamir would allegedly threaten to circulate them on social media. “He gave his victims an option of arranging extortion money for him if they did not want their images to go viral on social media,” said the officer.While his victims usually did not report the matter to the police or their parents, a 13-year-old girl living in outer Delhi’s Alipur could neither take the blackmailing any more nor arrange the money. She finally decided to confide in her father, said police.Her father approached the police earlier this month, following which a case under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act was registered at Alipur police station. “We sought technical help to identify the suspect and nabbed him. We have seized the phone which he was using for the crime,” the DCP said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/police-arrest-man-who-first-befriended-then-extorted-girls-on-social-media-101621459176154.html
20-05-2021||Delhi||‘Can judicial officers be treated as frontline staff?’: HC asks Delhi govt||The Delhi high court on Wednesday asked the Delhi government to consider whether judicial officers can also be considered frontline workers, remarking that three judicial officers have already succumbed to Covid-19.The court said the exposure of the district judiciary is greater than others due to the nature of their profession, and added that authorities should take steps to declare them frontline workers.“It is necessary. Many of them are getting exposed to the virus because of the nature of their work. It is also important for their mental peace,” the bench said, while hearing a plea by the Delhi Judicial Officers Association represented by senior advocate Dayan Krishnan.The plea sought that the judicial officers (judges of the lower court) be declared as frontline workers. Krishnan said that the district nodal officers’ facility is not working in case of emergencies and there is a need for a centralised nodal officer of Delhi government.Senior advocate Rahul Mehra, appearing for the Delhi government, told the court every possible step would be taken, and the association can send a representation to the government. He said the state government will convene a virtual meeting with the members of the association.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/can-judicial-officers-be-treated-as-frontline-staff-hc-asks-delhi-govt-101621453348411.html
20-05-2021||Chandigarh||Ensure five-bed Covid care centre in every panchayat: L-G Manoj Sinha||J&K Lieutenant Governor Manoj Sinha on Wednesday directed all 20 deputy commissioners and health departments to ensure five-bed Covid care centre in every panchayat. In a series of tweets, he relayed the information. “Directed DCs & Health Department to ensure 5-bed Covid Care Centre in every Panchayat of J&K as many households may not have the option for isolation of Covid positive patients in their own residence. Each Centre to have One Oxygen-Supported Bed for immediate patient care (sic),” he wrote on his Twitter handle. “ ₹1 Lakh approved from District Capex Budget for creation of facilities in School, Community hall or Panchayat ghar in consultation with nearest Health Centre and Panchayat representatives. These Centres shall be equipped with necessary medical kit and linked to nearest health centres. This will strengthen health infrastructure in Rural Areas (sic),” he added. “The persons needing isolation shall be identified by the Panchayats/ concerned Medical Staff / ASHA Workers. Mobile testing vans to be utilized to cover villages for testing with the help of PRIs and volunteers. Medical officers to establish referral linkage with dedicated Covid Health Centres and dedicated Covid Hospitals. Ambulance services in rural areas to have oxygen support for safely transporting the patients to Covid dedicated Hospitals,” read another post of the LG. Meanwhile, amid surge in Covid cases in rural areas of Jammu and Kashmir, the president of All Jammu Kashmir Panchayat Conference, Anil Sharma, sought 100% testing and vaccination of the rural populace, which, he said, “was staring right into the eyes of death in view of lethargic approach of the authorities”.There are total 4,129 panchayats in all 20 districts of J&K. “There has been no vaccination at all for the past one month, that too, at a time when second wave is peaking. Zero work is being done to contain the virus in rural areas,” he claimed. “There is no vaccination among the 18- 45 age group in rural areas and 20% population above the 45 years of age is still to be vaccinated. The virus is travelling fast to rural areas and the villagers face a grave risk to their lives,” he added. Sharma said he had been receiving at least 100 calls daily from sarpanches and panches, informing about villagers testing positive in their areas. “We also volunteer to open all our panchayat ghars to convert them into Covid care centres for the patients, but the government should show some urgency,” he added. “People in villages, being robust, tend to overlook mild symptoms and in turn they are multiplying the virus. It is high time the government undertakes 100% testing and vaccination in right earnest,” he added. It may be stated here that vaccination drive for 18+ category in Jammu and Kashmir has been moving at a snail’s pace . “I, along with my wife, went to get the first jab, but we were told that there are no doses available for us,” said Hira Lal of Chachwal village in Samba district. Hari Singh, another villager of the same area, said that the health authorities themselves were not aware of how and when they would be getting supplies. Annual report on good governance releasedMeanwhile, L-G Sinha Wednesday released “Annual Report- Promoting Good Governance” compiled by the finance department showcasing major initiatives undertaken by it during 2020-21 to bring transparency and accountability in the execution of the public works. Arun Kumar Mehta, financial commissioner, finance department, and Nitishwar Kumar, principal secretary to the L-G, were present on the occasion. The report in the form of e-book provides insight into reforms, steps taken by the department to institutionalise prudence in financial management in J&K.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ensure-five-bed-covid-care-centre-in-every-panchayat-l-g-manoj-sinha-101621455458231.html
20-05-2021||Chandigarh||Black fungus cases up but Punjab yet to declare it as notified disease||The cases of mucormycosis, popularly known as black fungus, are on the rise among Covid patients in Punjab, with nine such infections reported in Amritsar district on Wednesday. The state authorities, however, don’t have a data on the exact number of black fungus cases as it has yet to declare it as a notified disease. In Haryana¸ mucormycosis is already a notified disease, making it imperative that government authorities be informed about each case. This allows tracking and management of any outbreak. The pandemic has catalysed the spread of mucormycosis, a rare but serious fungal infection, which can disfigure people even when it is not fatal. The disease is caused by a group of molds called ‘mucormycetes’. The infection can badly affect the nose, sinus, eyes, lungs and sometimes brain of the patient. Health experts believe that Covid patients/survivors, who are not following the post- recovery instructions of the doctor, especially pertaining to blood sugar levels and intake of medicines, are more prone to the fungal infection. Amritsar civil surgeon Dr Charanjit Singh said of the nine patients, three have already lost their vision. No casualty has been reported so far in the district due to this fungal infection, he said. In some cases, doctors have to remove the eye to stop the infection from spreading to the central nervous system, the civil surgeon added. “All nine patients --- five women and three men --- are suffering from diabetes mellitus. They have infection in their ‘orbit’ bone, which is located in the middle part of the eye and nose. They all are undergoing treatment at various hospitals in Amritsar”, said Dr Charanjit. On Tuesday, two Covid positive patients, who also tested positive for black fungus, died at Patiala’s Rajindra hospital. However, doctors have ruled out black fungus as the main cause behind their deaths. Ludhiana is also witnessing a spike in such infections. “Till now, 22 Covid patients have been diagnosed with black fungus in the district. No casualty has been reported so far,” said civil surgeon Dr Kiran. Dr Rajesh Bhaskar, state nodal officer for Covid-19, said: “The exact number of black fungus cases in Punjab will be ascertained only when the government will declare the disease as notified.” “Health department is talking to the government and the decision will be approved soon,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/black-fungus-cases-up-but-punjab-yet-to-declare-it-as-notified-disease-101621455457159.html

The officials said that 48,565 tests were conducted in the past 24 hours taking overall tests to 8.04 million.Dr Hardeep Singh, professor of medicine, Government Medical College (GMC), Srinagar, said that the second wave of Covid is highly contagious and the virus transmits from infected person to others at a faster pace.“Earlier, during the first wave, it was observed that the affected person could infect only a few persons around him, but now the same person infects almost all around him which is cause of great concern,” he said.Of the 62 deaths in the UT, 39 were reported in Jammu division and 23 in Kashmir. Of the new cases, 2,594 are from Kashmir while 1,375 are from Jammu, besides 24 travellers.The people of UT have witnessed the worst effects of the pandemic in May since the outbreak as the monthly infections have reached 79,805 and fatalities to 1,073 on Wednesday.

The number of active cases has reached 50,494, officials said. Regarding the third wave, Dr Singh said if we do not adhere to SOPs, undergo vaccination and achieve herd immunity through vaccination, the virus may come again in a different form.“It can have more dangerous consequences,” he said.Srinagar and Jammu districts have together contributed for about 1.05 lakh cases and 1,593 deaths of the total. The Jammu district has taken over as the one with the highest number of 884 fatalities followed by Srinagar with 709 deaths.Adviser to L-G, Baseer Ahmad Khan said that there is no shortage of oxygen, vaccines, drugs or other medical infrastructure. “The huge consignment of vaccines has already arrived and the vaccination drive as per the micro-plans, already prepared, shall go unabated,” he said. The J&K government has formed a committee, mostly comprising health experts, to formulate an action plan to tackle a possible third wave of Covid pandemic in the UT.The general administration department on Tuesday gave sanction for the constitution of a 10-member committee to be chaired by Dr MS Khuroo, senior doctor and former director of Kashmir’s premier tertiary care hospital, Sheri Kashmir Institute of Medical Sciences, Soura. The co-chairman of the committee is Dr Shakti Gupta, executive director and CEO at AIIMS, Jammu.The committee will specially focus on preparedness in terms of creation of health infrastructure, enhancement in testing capacities, arrangement of essential drugs/logistics, treatment protocols, arrangement of machinery and equipment, oxygen supply and manpower.“The committee will look into issues like ramping up Covid hospital beds and critical care units, especially for paediatrics/neo-natal age group, which is likely to be affected more,” said the order by Manoj Kumar Dwivedi, commissioner secretary to the government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/jk-sees-highest-single-day-recovery-as-4-338-patients-recuperate-101621454976879.html
20-05-2021||Chandigarh||Labour shortage looms over paddy transplantation this year again||Farmers in Punjab are staring at a severe shortage of labour for transplantation of paddy amid the Covid-19 lockdown that has forced thousands of migrant workers to return to their native states, particularly Bihar and Uttar Pradesh. The same trend was witnessed last year when restrictions were imposed for the first time in the wake of the pandemic.Since the majority of paddy growers opt for transplantation of paddy, the conventional and labour-intensive method of sowing of the crop in Punjab, they need lots of manpower besides water for irrigation. Though local workers are roped in for the task, they alone are not enough to fulfill the required need. Paddy transplantation is expected to begin in the first week of June.Tajinderpal Singh, a farmer from Rasoolpur village of Tarn Taran district, said, “the cost of labour will go high this time again due to shortage. Last year, many farmers opted for the direct seeding of rice (DSR), a less labour-intensive method, but experience of many was not good. Therefore, such farmers are in a dilemma over other methods of sowing.” “The situation will be clear once paddy transplantation starts. But there is a strong apprehension among farmers that they will have to face the same situation and bear losses,” said Sandeep Singh Randhawa, a progressive farmer from Talwandi Lal Singh village of Gurdaspur district.Randhawa, who is also director of Punjab State Co-operative Supply and Marketing Federation (Markfed), added, “The farmers have a reason to worry about. First, the railways has increased train fares. Now, travelling from UP and Bihar to Punjab will be costlier for migrant labourers. If they hire buses, they will have to pay extra in the pandemic situation. Second, they will have to complete Covid-related formalities. So, they are least likely to come to Punjab for paddy transplantation.”“Because of labour shortage, the state government is giving power supply to farmers from May 25 for the DSR technique of sowing which has started in our area,” said Gurbinder Singh Bajwa, another farmer from Gurdaspur district.Kuljit Singh Saini, chief agriculture officer of Amritsar and Tarn Taran, said the situation is not so grim for paddy growers. “Machines have already reduced dependence on the labour for sowing paddy”, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/labour-shortage-looms-over-paddy-transplantation-this-year-again-101621454920071.html
20-05-2021||Chandigarh||Punjab’s Covid positivity rate hits 5-week low||Punjab is showing signs of recovery from Covid-19 as its positivity rate on Wednesday reached the lowest in the past five weeks at 8.71%, with experts suggesting that the state may well be past its pandemic peak. The state’s overall positivity rate, the ratio of infected people against the total tests done in a day, had seen a sharp spike since April 13 from 8.4% to 14.2%, the highest so far, on May 12. The daily addition of cases in the state also came down to 6,407 after the highest single-day addition of 9,100 cases on May 14. With the number of recovered patients remaining higher than the fresh cases for the fifth consecutive day, the state’ active caseload also registered a fall of 12% in the past one week. The state’s highest tally of fresh cases was 79,963 on May 12, against 70,499 on Wednesday (May 19). Fall in the number of patients on O2 support An analysis of the state government’s media bulletin reveals that the number of patients on oxygen support in Punjab has decreased. A fall of 2000 patients in the patients on oxygen support has been witnessed in past one week. Head of expert group of Covid-19 management in Punjab and former PGIMER director Dr KK Talwar said, “The trend in the past week reflects that the state may have passed its peak. But we should not lower our guard as the virus takes longer time to settle down. The nature of this virus is such that any prediction can go wrong. We should continue with stricter curbs and implementation of Covid protocol in the days to come,” he said.Deaths remain on higher side However, the high number of deaths of Covid-19 patients remains a cause of concern. After registering highest ever fatalities (231) on Tuesday, the death toll in the state was 208 on Wednesday. In the past one week, state has recorded 1,414 deaths due to Covid-19. A senior health department official said most of the deaths were reported in rural areas. State Covid-19 nodal officer Dr Rajesh Bhaskar said Mohali, Bathinda, Muktsar, Ferozepur and Mansa districts continue to report high number of deaths.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/punjabs-covid-positivity-rate-hits-5-week-low-101621454918904.html
20-05-2021||Chandigarh||Villages in Punjab’s Majha belt devoid of basic Covid care||Even as the Punjab government is making claims of focusing on controlling the coronavirus surge in rural areas, most of the villages in the state’s Majha region comprising Amritsar, Gurdaspur, Pathankot and Tarn Taran districts lack basic Covid care facilities such as testing and vaccination. Due to inadequate testing, surveillance and treatment facilities, the villages in the region are turning into hotspots of infection with high positivity and fatality rates. Also, people are still reluctant to come forward for testing while they are also not checking movement of outsiders in their villages.Satnam Singh, a resident of Rajian village in Amritsar district’s Ajnala sub-division said, “Our village does not have any Covid care centre. If any person develops virus symptoms, they have to travel to Rokhey village to get them tested for the disease. Even the health centre at Rokhey lacks basic facilities like medicines and medical staff. People have no other option but to go to private hospitals that charge hefty money.”“Doctors held a vaccination camp in our village but not many showed up. People in rural areas are still hesitant to disclose their symptoms to the health department staff, fearing the authorities will admit them to hospital where they will succumb to the virus. We urge the government to open testing facilities in every village of the state,” he added.Amritsar is reporting hundreds of fresh infection daily but the district health department has collected only 2.76 lakh samples from the district’s rural areas in nearly 14 months of the pandemic. Angrej Singh, a resident of Dall village in Tarn Taran district’s Bhikhiwind sub-division said, “Our village has the population of 7,000 but the local sub-health centre does not have Covid-19 testing facility. People have to travel 15-20 kilometres to get tested for the virus. Also, people are not cooperating with the health staff as they are not keeping tabs on movement of outsiders in the village.”“Despite the virus surge, a group of farmers is set to leave for Delhi on May 27 to protest against the central government’s three farm laws. In these challenging times, villagers are focusing less on the pandemic,” Angrej Singh added. The situation at Gurdaspur district’s Jhawar village is no different as there is no testing facility even as vaccination camps were held there. Tarsem Lal, a local resident, said, “Our village has a government dispensary but it lacks Covid testing facilities and medicines. Some accredited social health activist (ASHA) workers and auxiliary nurse midwives (ANMs) come to the dispensary but people are reluctant to share their health status with them. Besides, residents are not following Covid-19 protocol while authorities are not keeping tabs on the violators. The government should increase surveillance in rural areas.” Villagers in Amritsar, Tarn Taran start thikri pehra As many as 661 villages in Amritsar and 122 in Tarn Taran district have started ‘thikri pehra’ (community policing) to curb the movement of people in and out of villages —except emergency and essential services. Station house officers (SHO) and deputy superintendent of police (DSPs) concerned have also been asked to regularly check and ensure the thikri pehras.Satnam Singh, sarpanch of Chahowali village in Amritsar’s Majitha block, said, “With the help of the police, we started the practice for a few days. A team of police regularly checks our thikri pehra. Our village with a population of 2,500 has no positive case so far. But we still have designated our village government school as an isolation centre.”A doctor in Tarn Taran said, “Many people are still not willing to get tested for Covid-19. They still prefer quacks instead of approaching hospitals. The police should also issue instructions against all those quacks working in the villages to help in containing the virus.”(With inputs by Anil Sharma)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/villages-in-punjab-s-majha-belt-devoid-of-basic-covid-care-101621454737076.html
20-05-2021||Mumbai||Elgar Parishad case: HC allows Hany Babu to be shifted to Breach Candy Hospital for treating eye infection||The Bombay high court (HC) has directed the state prison authorities to shift Elgar Parishad accused Hany Babu who is lodged in Taloja jail since his arrest on July 28, 2020, to a private hospital of his choice, provided his family is willing to foot the bill for treating an opthalmology problem due to an infection. While Babu was taken to Sir JJ Hospital to examine his eyes, he tested positive for Covid-19, and was hence shifted to GT Hospital.However, after GT Hospital said that they were not equipped to treat Babu’s opthalmology problem, he was to be shifted back to Sir JJ Hospital for further treatment. Babu’s family sought permission from the court to transfer him to Breach Candy Hospital on the assurance that they would foot the bill for treating his eye problem, which the court allowed. Babu will be shifted to Breach Candy Hospital on Thursday. A division bench of justice SJ Kathwalla and justice SP Tavade, while hearing the urgent bail application of Babu on medical grounds, was informed by advocates Yug Choudhary and Payoshi Roy that the Delhi University associate professor had developed a swelling in his left eye on May 3, was having double vision and was in pain. After repeated requests by Babu’s family, the prison authorities took him to Sir JJ Hospital for examining his eye on May 12 where he tested positive for Covid-19.Choudhary submitted that as Babu was to be shifted to Sir JJ Hospital for treating the eye problem the family wanted him to be moved to a private hospital and hence sought bail for him.However, the application was opposed by the National Investigation Agency (NIA). Additional solicitor general Anil Singh for NIA submitted that Sir JJ Hospital, KEM and Nair hospital were well equipped to treat the eye problem, hence the application should not be allowed. He further submitted that allowing Babu to be shifted to a private hospital would set a wrong precedent and other prisoners would also seek such facilities.After hearing the submissions and speaking to Babu over video conferencing wherein he said he was satisfied with the treatment at GT Hospital, the court directed that he be shifted to Breach Candy Hospital. In response to NIA’s objection, the court said, “Let the family get the psychological satisfaction at least that he is treated in a hospital of their choice. There is nothing wrong if this becomes a precedent, more so in these times.”The court further stated that as Babu’s family had assured of footing the bill at Breach Candy hospital he should be shifted there on Thursday and also allowed Babu to communicate with his family and lawyers and posted a hearing of his application on June 9.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/elgar-parishad-case-hc-allows-hany-babu-to-be-shifted-to-breach-candy-hospital-for-treating-eye-infection-101621454436952.html
20-05-2021||Mumbai||Elgar Parishad case: HC directs Stan Swamy to be checked at JJ Hospital on May 20||The Bombay high court (HC) has directed the Taloja jail superintendent to take Elgar Parishad accused Fr Stan Swamy, 84, to Sir JJ Hospital for his medical check-up on May 20 at noon. The HC has also directed the dean of Sir JJ Hospital to constitute an expert committee which includes a neuro physician, orthopaedic surgeon, ENT specialist and any other doctor to examine Swamy and submit its report by May 21. The court also directed the state prison authorities to bring Swamy before the court through a video conference on May 21. The vacation bench of justice SJ Kathawalla and justice SP Tavade was hearing the bail application on the medical ground which was filed in the HC by Swamy’s relatives after the special court rejected his application for substantive bail in March 2021. On May 4, while hearing the appeal by Swamy against the special court order the court had directed the relatives to file a separate application for interim bail on the medical ground which was heard on Wednesday. Swamy was arrested in October 2020 and has been kept at Taloja jail since then. Senior advocate Mihir Desai informed the bench that on Monday a note seeking urgent hearing of Swamy’s medical bail application was moved as his condition had deteriorated over the past week and he had developed cough and fever and he was not even tested for Covid though 26 jail inmates and staff had tested positive. The note also claimed that the jail hospital did not have proper medical facilities to treat and monitor the octogenarian who had underlying conditions. Desai further submitted that as Swamy was in an advanced stage of Parkinson’s disease and could not hear or stand on his own and hence in light of the spread of Covid-19 in prisons he should be released on temporary bail or shifted to a private hospital.The note also claimed that as per statistics posted on the Maharashtra State prison website on April 13, Taloja prison had 3,251 inmates while its capacity was of 2124 inmates only. The note further stated that while the jail required to have 2/3rd of its capacity to maintain physical distancing norms it was not complying with the decongestion norms laid down by the Supreme Court (SC). The note also stated that Swamy was taking allopathic medicines along with the antibiotics prescribed by Ayurveda doctors in Taloja Jail hospital. The lawyer further submitted that given his ill health and severe comorbidities, Swamy is at risk of getting infected by Covid-19.Additional solicitor general Anil Singh for the National Investigation Agency (NIA), a probing agency opposed the plea and submitted that Swamy was being provided proper medical treatment and his health was being regularly monitored. Singh’s submissions were corroborated by the prison report which stated that the general condition of Swamy was stable and that he was provided with a high protein diet, hot water for bathing and provided two attendants- the prisoners at their willingness. Additional public prosecutor JP Yagnik for the state referred to the report and stated that Swamy had been provided with a mattress, bed sheet, pillow, sipper, walker and walking sticks, commode, was being examined by psychiatrists at regular intervals and had a stable pumping heart and good blood circulation. However, Desai disputed the accuracy of the report and said that there was no mention of Swamy’s complaint of abdomen pain and pain due to lumbar spondylitis, in the report. After hearing the submissions, the bench ordered Swamy’s health checkup and sought a report to be submitted by 11 am on Friday. “In the event of Taloja prison having video conference facility, it shall produce appellant Swamy before the court on May 21,” said HC.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/elgar-parishad-case-hc-directs-stan-swamy-to-be-checked-at-jj-hospital-on-may-20-101621454436267.html
20-05-2021||Chandigarh||Chintpurni temple helps fight Covid, seeks donation of medical equipment||Extending a helping hand to the Himachal Pradesh government that is struggling to control the Covid-19 surge, the Chintpurni temple trust has launched an online service accepting the donation of medical equipment for coronavirus patients. The temple, also known as Chinmastika Dham, has provided a link on its website for devotees who wish to donate towards the cause. Devotees can donate 13 types of medical equipment through the link. These include pulse oximeters, oxygen concentrators, PPE kits, masks, oxygen cylinders and medicines. The devotees can also courier the donated goods to the temple officer, Mata Chintpurni Tehsil, Una district. “Devotees keen on making the donation in person can visit Chintpurni House or register themselves on the link after which a trust official will contact them. People should donate in kind (medical material) instead of cash,” temple officer Abhishek Bhaskar said. Amb sub divisional magistrate Manesh Kumar has urged people to come forward and help fight the war against coronavirus. “Medical equipment is the need of the hour, so if someone wants to donate it to the temple trust, they can send the goods through courier or get registered on the temple trust website,” he said. Richest temple in Himachal Last year, the Chintpurni temple trust made a donation of ₹5 crore towards the Covid relief fund. The temple, also known as the Tirupati of Himachal, is the richest in the state with a cash deposit of more than ₹1.5 crore, fixed deposits of ₹102 crore, around quintals of gold and 71 quintals of silver. Mata Chintpurni Devi is one of the many manifestations of Goddess Durga. In this form, she is also called Maa Chinnamasta or Maa Chinnamastika, the one with a detached head. Meanwhile, the state branch of spiritual organisation Radha Soami Satsang Beas has offered its satsang bhawan to create a Covid facility at Paravur in Kangra.

20-05-2021||Mumbai||INS Kochi baack with 125 survivors of P305||Two days after conducting search and rescue operation (SAR), the Indian Naval Ship (INS) Kochi returned to Tiger Gate in Mumbai harbour on Wednesday morning carrying 125 survivors of Barge P305, one of the three barges that was carried adrift after Cyclone Tautkae, an extremely severe cyclonic storm, passed over the Arabian Sea between May 16 and 17. The barge, anchored near a rig in Heera Oil Fields, roughly 40 nautical miles (72 km) west of Mumbai in Arabian Sea, began to drift around 10.15pm on Sunday after all of its 12 anchors broke off. As the cyclone began to cross Mumbai latitude at 12.37 pm, 120-130 km off the coast of the city, water began to enter the barge, forcing all of its 261 occupants to move to the deck. Around 2 pm, the barge began to tilt and go underwater. Within five hours, it sank completely. Some, like Indrajeet Sharma, 33, started jumping into the water before the barge finally went underwater at 7pm. “I had no other option except jumping into the sea to save my life on Monday. I jumped around 6pm, an hour before the barge sank,” Sharma, a senior engineer who had been working on the barge since last May, said. “After spending 8 hours in the water, I was rescued by INS Kochi at 2am on Tuesday. I could not open my eyes for almost 24 hours as I spent several hours in the salty water,” he said. The barge, owned and operated by Durmast Enterprises Limited, had been chartered by a consortium led by Afcons Infrastructure Limited for an Oil and Natural Gas (ONGC) project in the Western Offshore fields in the Arabian Sea. The people on board comprised marine crew, labourers on contract, and employee of Afcons. On Monday morning, the Indian Navy received a distress call from P305 and immediately dispatched three ships -- INS Kochi, Talwar and Kolkata -- to rescue the people, even as inclement weather made the search and rescue operations difficult. INS Kochi, which left Mumbai harbour around 10am on Monday, was the first to reach the site at 4pm. INS Kolkata reached around midnight. The Navy also deployed helicopters and aircraft to conduct aerial surveys. Other ships, including offshore support vessels, multipurpose support vessels and Coast Guard vessels got involved in the SAR operations the following day. “Our employer thought that nothing would happen in the cyclone due to which we faced the most terrifying day of our lives,” said Faraz Nadkar, 22, an architect who joined the barge a few months ago. “We waited till the last moment when the ship was just about to sink. We (five to six people) jumped in wearing life jackets. We held each other’s hands for courage. We decided that if we would die, we’d die together. We spent around 12 hours in the water and for most of the time we spoke of our families,” Nadkar said. “The Indian Naval Ship reached in the evening and rescued us at 6am on Tuesday,” said Nadkar. “I lost everything including my passport and prayed to God all night that I would live to see my parents again,” said Sunil Kumar Madhesia (22), who hails from Kushinagar, Uttar Pradesh. “We saw our ship sink and several people on the deck were falling into the sea. [We] spent more than 10 hours in stormy water when the Navy rescued 12 people out of our group of 14 on Tuesday morning. Two are still missing,” said Madhesia, who worked as a helper on the barge. “It is the mistake of the company to not take the decision to send us to Mumbai from the high sea,” said Dombivali resident Deepak Ingle, 30, a technician who started work on the barge in December.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/ins-kochi-baack-with-125-survivors-of-p305-101621454196099.html
20-05-2021||Mumbai||HC restrains BMC from felling trees for coastal road till next hearing||The Bombay high court restrained the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation on Wednesday from felling and transplanting 61 and 70 trees, respectively at Tata Garden at Bhulabhai Desai Road, based on the January 6 order of the BMC’s tree authority. The permission was granted by the authority to make way for the coastal road interchange. A division bench of justice S J Kathawalla and justice S P Tavade while hearing the petition filed by NGO Society of Improvement of Greenery was informed by advocate Ankit Kulkarni that it was not aware of the January 6 permission granted by the tree authority to fell 140 trees at Breach Candy for the coastal road. He informed the court that while an earlier proposal involved fewer trees, it was opposed to the decision and wanted to challenge it. However, senior advocate Aspi Chinoy and advocate Joel Carlos for the BMC and coastal road project opposed the submission of the NGO and said the order was uploaded on the civic administration’s website on January 19, and the NGO could not claim it had no knowledge of it to seek a stay. Chinoy further submitted that when the NGO’s petition had come up for hearing in March and the BMC had mentioned about the decision in its affidavit, the NGO had not raised any objection against it. Kulkarni, however, informed the court that the BMC served the affidavit on the NGO only on Wednesday morning hence it wanted time to challenge the decision. After hearing the submissions, the bench restrained the BMC from going ahead with the felling till the NGO added the challenge to the authority’s order in its petition filed in March 2020 and posted the hearing on Friday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/hc-restrains-bmc-from-felling-trees-for-coastal-road-till-next-hearing-101621454075993.html
20-05-2021||Mumbai||Sena compares WB-Centre tussle to Israel-Palestine conflict||Comparing the ongoing tussle between the Centre and West Bengal government to Israel-Palestine conflict, the Shiv Sena mouthpiece on Wednesday said that PM Narendra Modi-home minister Amit Shah duo has taken the defeat in the Assembly polls to heart and have decided to make Mamata Banerjee bow before the Centre. Amid Central Bureau of Investigation’s (CBI) action against Trinamool Congress legislators and West Bengal ministers in the Narada sting operation case, an editorial on Wednesday said that West Bengal governor was acting unconstitutionally and that he should be recalled. On Monday, the CBI arrested West Bengal ministers Firhad Hakim and Subrata Mukherjee, TMC MLA Madan Mitra and former party legislator Sovan Chatterjee in the Narada bribery case sparking another row between the Centre and the Mamata Banerjee government. The editorial said that the attempts were being made to create political instability in the state.Taking on WB governor Jagdeep Dhankar, the editorial said, “Dhankar said that he gave the go-ahead for action against the legislators. The conduct of the governor is against the constitution… Attempts are being made to create instability and unrest in West Bengal ... the governor should be immediately recalled,” said the editorial. It further said that the political career of Dhankar has not been “sparkling”. “He has not done anything great in his politics. Therefore, if he has been given a specific brief to harass a woman chief minister given by the Centre, then the National Women’s Commission must take cognizance of it.”The editorial Marathi daily added that the action against TMC MLAs is “political vendetta”. “They were caught on camera taking bribes in the 2014 Narada string operation. But why no action against the other two accused - Mukul Roy and Suvendu Adhikari - who are now with the BJP? Have they become clean since they are now in the BJP?” it asked.It added that the struggle between the Centre and Banerjee will give a “new direction to the country”. “There was no reason for Modi-Shah to take the victory of Mamata Banerjee to heart... If the Centre has decided to make the victorious Mamata bow before them, it is not good democracy.”The Pydhonie police on Tuesday registered a case against chief managing director and editor-in-chief of Sudarshan News TV Suresh Chavhanke and two others panelists of a TV show aired on May 13, for allegedly showing objectionable content on the ongoing Israel-Palestine conflict and outraging religious feelings of a community. The FIR is based on the complaint filed by Irfan Shaikh, joint secretary, Raza Academy, Mumbai. Raza Academy president Saeed Noori said, “The content has hurt the religious sentiments of the community.” “Senior police officers will take call on the probe,” said Subhash Dudhgaonkar, senior inspector, Pydhonie police station.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/sena-compares-wb-centre-tussle-to-israel-palestine-conflict-101621454016808.html
20-05-2021||Mumbai||HC to hear state petition against CBI FIR in graft case against ex-home minister||The Bombay high court (HC) heard the petition filed by the Maharashtra government alleging that the first information report (FIR) filed by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI,) based on the complaint by advocate Dr Jaishri Patil, after completing the preliminary probe as directed by the HC in the allegations of corruption and interference in police posting and appointments made by former Mumbai Police commissioner against former home minister Anil Deshmukh is aimed at destabilising the government. In a late night hearing which started around 11pm on Wednesday, the division bench of justice SJ Kathawalla and justice SP Tavade was informed by senior advocate Rafique Dada and Darius Khambatta that they would require around 45 minutes to argue. Additional solicitor generals SV Raju and Anil Singh, for CBI, submitted they would require another hour to respond to the arguments made by the state of Maharashtra. While apprising the bench of the contents, Dada submitted that the CBI FIR filed after completion of the preliminary probe had dealt with the issue of former deputy general of police (DGP) Rashmi Shukla’s claim that there was political interference in posting and transfer of police officers. Dada submitted that as the issue had been heard and the inquiry was closed, negating the claims of Shukla by a high-power committee, there was no need for CBI to include the issue in the FIR. He added that as per CBI manual, it could only investigate issues with the consent of the state, which was withdrawn in October 2020. Raju referred to the two unnumbered paragraphs in the order passed by the division bench headed by chief justice Dipankar Datta on April 5 and said the order did not put any restrictions on CBI from investigating any aspect of the case and had left it to the discretion of CBI director to take appropriate action after completion of the preliminary probe. In view of this, he said CBI was justified in including the issues which were being opposed by the state. He further submitted that the Apex court had, in numerous cases, permitted investigation agencies to go beyond the ambit of the rules. After hearing the preliminary arguments, the bench said it wanted to understand the matter and asked both counsels to furnish their arguments in short written submission by Thursday evening and posted hearing of the matter on Friday 3 pm.Meanwhile, the Enforcement Directorate (ED) on Wednesday recorded statement of advocate Jaishri Patil in connection with the money laundering case against Deshmukh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/hc-to-hear-state-petition-against-cbi-fir-in-graft-case-against-ex-home-minister-101621454016157.html
20-05-2021||Chandigarh||Treatment plant deadline lapse: PPCB slaps ₹1.27-cr penalty on Ludhiana dyers’ body||With the Punjab Dyers Association (PDA, Tajpur Road module) missing the January 31 deadline for making operational the common effluent treatment plant (CETP), the Punjab Pollution Control Board (PPCB) has imposed an environmental compensation of ₹1.27 crore on the body. According to the information, the PPCB imposed the penalty under Section 33-A of the Water (prevention and control of pollution) Act, 1974.A 50MLD (million litres per day) plant on Tajpur Road is being constructed to stop the discharge of untreated dyeing waste into Buddha Nullah. The project commenced in 2014, but the work came to a halt in 2016 as the state and Union governments failed to issue grants worth ₹22.5 crore to the PDA. Out of ₹22.5-crore grant, the state’s share was ₹7.5 crore while Centre was to provide ₹15 crore. The total cost of the project is over ₹55 crore and the rest of the cost will be borne by the industry.The work on the project resumed in April 2019 after the PDA got a partial subsidy released through the National Green Tribunal and the authorities claimed that the project will be completed in a year’s time. However, the project missed several deadlines and January 2021 was the latest deadline for its completion.PPCB senior environmental engineer, Sandeep Bahl said, “The environmental compensation of ₹30,000 per day has been imposed on PDA and the office-bearers have been directed to submit ₹1.27 crore as penalty. The amount of penalty will increase with every passing day.” PDA chairman Ashok Makkar said, “The PDA cannot pay such a hefty penalty and we will take up the matter with the PPCB. The project got delayed due to delay in releasing the subsidy and the ongoing pandemic. The plant is ready but it has not been made operational as the PSPCL has not yet provided the power connection. We will take up the matter with PPCB officials.” Three CETPs have been approved for the city, of which only one on Bahadurke road with 15MLD capacity is operational. Another 40MLD plant is not operational for want of power connection.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/treatment-plant-deadline-lapse-ppcb-slaps-1-27-cr-penalty-on-ludhiana-dyers-body-101621453836008.html
20-05-2021||Chandigarh||2015 sacrilege case: Named as accused, dera chief yet to be grilled by SIT||Even 11 months after jailed Sirsa dera chief Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh was named accused in a case connected with Bargari sacrilege, Punjab Police’s special investigation team (SIT) probing the 2015 sacrilege cases never attempted to question him. In July 2020, after the arrest of seven dera Sacha Sauda followers in a case relating to the theft of a ‘bir’ (copy) of Guru Granth Sahib from a gurdwara at Burj Jawahar Singh Wala in 2015, the SIT-led by former inspector general of police Ranbir Singh Khatra had named Ram Rahim and dera’s three national committee members—Sandeep Bareta, Pardeep Kler and Harsh Dhuri—accused in this case. The new SIT led by inspector general of police SPS Parmar, too, has not initiated process to question dera chief so farDespite claiming in the charge sheet filed in the ‘bir’ theft case that the order to carry out sacrilege was given by Ram Rahim, who currently in jail in Haryana, the SIT is yet to file any official request for permission to interrogate him. The SIT probing sacrilege cases never visited the dera headquarters in Sirsa even as it claimed the conspiracy was hatched there. The ‘bir’ was stolen from Burj Jawahar Singh Wala village gurdwara on June 1, 2015. On October 12, 2015, torn pages of the ‘bir’ were found scattered in front of a gurdwara in the adjoining Bargari village, resulting in an outrage across the state and death of two Sikh protesters in police firing. The SIT in its charge sheet had claimed that it was Ram Rahim who ordered to carry out sacrilege to avenge insult of sect followers by a Sikh preacher. “Some dera followers arrested in connection with sacrilege revealed that Mohinderpal Singh Bittu, who was killed in a Nabha jail in 2019, told them that the sacrilege was executed at the behest of the dera chief. During a diwan (religious congregation) in on March 22, 2015, Harjinder Singh Manjhi, a Sikh preacher, asked some dera followers to remove their lockets or leave. Bittu raised the issue with Bareta, Kler and Dhuri, who saw it as an act of sacrilege and decided to take revenge. The sacrilege conspiracy was hatched thereafter,” the SIT charge sheet says. However, the SIT had immediately initiated the process to declare the accused national committee members proclaimed offenders (PO) after which the court declared them PO in January. An SIT member said, “Ram Rahim was named accused on the basis of statements of accused dera followers, who claimed Bareta, Kler and Dhuri had told them that orders were given by dera chief. But right now, all the three are absconding, so there is absence of linking evidence in this case so far. Dera head questioning is on the list but our priority is to nab the absconding dera committee members first. After which we will question him.” SIT probing police firing too didn’t reach Ram Rahim In April 2019, the SIT probing Kotkapura and Behabl Kalan police firing cases secured orders from a Faridkot court to question Ram Rahim. However, the Sunaria jail authorities refused to let the team meet the Dera head stating that permission from the local deputy commissioner was not there. After initial denial by Rohtak administration, the SIT got permission from the Haryana government in June 2019 for questioning Dera head in jail. However, the SIT never went to question Ram Rahim.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/2015-sacrilege-case-named-as-accused-dera-chief-yet-to-be-grilled-by-sit-101621453597448.html

The daily cases, however, continued to decline for the fourth consecutive day with 731 cases being detected.Among the latest fatalities, 15 were women and 12 were men. The oldest to succumb is a 72-year-old resident of BRS Nagar while the youngest is a 44-year-old resident of Maharana Partap Nagar.The maximum number of deaths continued to be in the 50 to 60 age group. Ten fatalities were in their 50s while another eight were in their 60s. Five of the deceased were in their 70s while four were in their 40s.The district’s toll now stands at 1,788 while fatality rate, as on Wednesday, was 2.28%. The total number of positive cases since the pandemic outbreak last year is 78,368.There are 11,373 active cases at present.17-hour curfew has started yielding results: DCDeputy commissioner (DC) Varinder Kumar Sharma on Wednesday said that the current 17-hour daily curfew imposed in Ludhiana has started to yield results as daily cases have started to decline. He said collective efforts of all stakeholders in the society and people’s support have been instrumental in stabilising the wave.Speaking to the residents of Ludhiana during the weekly Facebook Live session on the official page of DPRO, the DC said that non-pharmaceutical interventions like curfew, tireless functioning of civil and police administration teams and the wholehearted support of people have slowed down the spread of the disease but it does not mean we can lower our guard.He said the administration has increased testing for Covid-19 on a war footing and more than 1.5 lakh samples are now being tested every week. DC visits rural area to spread Covid awarenessGiving a clarion call to people residing in rural areas to understand the importance of Covid appropriate behaviour, early testing and vaccination, deputy commissioner (DC) Varinder Kumar Sharma on Wednesday interacted with people residing in villages of Ghaloti and Raqba.During the interaction, Sharma urged people to wearing the mask correctly, maintaining two-yard distance, and wash their hands frequently to keep the virus at bay. He also advised people to get vaccinated and take a Covid test as soon as they see any symptoms.He said that the early testing and treatment would help save the lives of the people. The DC also warned the residents against self-medication as it delays the detection of infection and can lead to health complications. He said the second wave has taken the rural areas into its grip so the villagers must keep tabs on unauthorised movement by holding ‘thikri pehras’ (community policing) to restrict the entry of persons having symptoms of cough, cold, fever, sore throat, and others. Dr Bishav Mohan from Dayanand Medical College and Hospital spoke about the symptoms of Covid-19.Team constituted to ensure availability of essential drugsLudhiana: Deputy commissioner (DC) Varinder Kumar Sharma on Wednesday constituted a committee of experts to ensure the availability of essential drugs for patients in the district.The committee was constituted in wake of a few hospitals prescribing Remdesivir and Tocilizumab even though these are short in supply. Punjab health advisor Dr KK Talwar has already prescribed alternative medicines --Itolizumab and Dexamethasone— for treatment of Covid patients. The expert group is headed by Dr KK Talwar, advisor, health and medical education, Government of Punjab, with Dr Hatinder Kaur Kaler, Ludhiana’s medical nodal officer, Dr Rajesh Mahajan from DMCH Ludhiana, Dr Rajiv Kundara from SPS Hospital, Dr Anil Luther from Christian Medical College and Hospital, Dr Shelly from Fortis Hospital, and Zonal Licensing Authority (ZLA) Kulwinder Singh as its members. The group would take a call on which drugs are urgently required and where these can be sourced from, provided any patient or attendant approaches the administration.He said now there is a shortage of other antifungal or essential Covid drugs due to which family members of the patients run from pillar to post to get these drugs. It has been observed that some major private hospitals and stockists/chemists have available stock of essential drugs but these institutions offer these drugs only to patients admitted on their premises.The DC said that in these unprecedented times, the essential drugs should be offered to patients who need them the most as per medical condition, no matter where they are admitted.The DC said the committee will decide on which patient requires which essential drug and from where it is to be sourced.The prescribing doctor would have to describe to the committee the patient’s record to justify the requirement of medicine, whenever summoned by the committee. ZLA would ensure the presence of stock position with all hospitals/stockists/chemists about these drugs.The DC made it clear that all essential Covid drugs available in Ludhiana are a common resource pool available for all Covid patients admitted in various hospitals of the Ludhiana district. Once any essential drug is allocated by the committee to any particular patient then the stocking hospital/stockist/chemist would be responsible under National Disaster Management Act 2005 and Epidemic Diseases Act 1897 to sell that drug to a particular patient.He said that violation by any hospital/stockist/chemist would be dealt with strictly under National Disaster Management Act, 2005 and Epidemic Diseases Act 1897.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/ludhianas-daily-deaths-shoot-up-again-27-recorded-in-24-hours-101621453596495.html
20-05-2021||Chandigarh||Special Covid testing drive begins in rural Bathinda||A special drive under ‘Pendu Covid Fateh Mission’ for Covid-19 testing started on Wednesday in nine villages of Bathinda, one of the six worst-hit districts of Punjab. Under the drive, a task force comprising officials from the departments of health, panchayat, police and education will visit one village each in nine administrative blocks of the district daily. Deputy commissioner B Srinivasan said 200-300 samples will be taken at each camp and the entire district population will be covered by June 16. “In the last few days, most people who tested positive are from villages. Owing to a more village-intensive approach, the special drive will give more clarity on virus infection in rural pockets,” he added. To make the drive result-oriented, panchayats and local community leaders have been taken on board and announcements are being made a day prior to the visit, he said. Civil surgeon Dr TS Dhillon said All India Institute of Medical Science (AIIMS), Bathinda, has deputed 20 nurses to intensify the Covid management drive. On the first day, about 1,000 samples were taken and data of positive cases is being compiled, he added. “Covid infection is taking a toll at the village level. Owing to rumours and misinformation, the rural population was reluctant to testing, the only cornerstone to combat the virus. A coordinated drive will clear the confusion among villagers,” said Dhillon. On Wednesday, 23 deaths were reported in Bathinda, and about 10 were from rural belts, he said. The district had 6,739 active Covid cases till Tuesday and 743 mortalities have been reported so far. Villages go for self-imposed lockdowns, ‘thikri pehra’ Sarpanch of Bhokhra village Fulel Singh said after 14 positive cases and six deaths within a fortnight this month, the panchayat decided to seal the village for two weeks. “Two members of a family died of Covid and there were many others with symptoms. The entire village agreed to a self-imposed lockdown. Nobody is allowed to enter or exit the village except in an emergency. All shops will remain close this week,” said the sarpanch. Similarly, ‘thikri pehra’ (community surveillance) in the south Malwa region, including Bathinda, Mansa and Muktsar, is going on for the last several days. In Mansa, the hotbed of farmer agitation, nearly 200 panchayats have volunteered to seal their respective villages. Senior superintendent of police (SSP) Surender Lamba said village police officers are assisting the panchayats in implementing self-imposed lockdown to break the virus chain. A community leader from Mansa’s Khiala Kalan village, Chanana Singh, said after weeks of hesitation, villagers have now started accepting the significance of testing and vaccination. “Media played a crucial role in removing misconceptions. Visuals and reports of patients struggling for hospitalisation and queues in cremation grounds made people realising the severity of the crisis,” he said. Fazilka deputy commissioner Harish Nayyar said an inter-department team will coordinate with community leaders to motivate villagers for vaccination.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/special-covid-testing-drive-begins-in-rural-bathinda-101621453478335.html
20-05-2021||Chandigarh||Despite SC stricture, Pearls group properties worth crores sold illegally||Despite a ban from the Supreme Court, properties of PACL India Limited, also known as Pearls Group, worth hundreds of crores were fraudulently sold by company representatives and family members of main accused Nirmal Singh Bhangu, including his son-in-law Har Satinder Singh Hayer, police investigations have revealed. Bhangu is in jail in connection with a ponzi scam involving over ₹48,000 crore. In April this year, the special investigation team (SIT) of Punjab Police probing the case, filed a charge sheet, against the multiple accused in a Ferozepur court. As many as 45 people, including company officials and family members of Bhangu, were booked for cheating, criminal conspiracy and other sections of the Indian Penal Code at Zira police station in Ferozepur district on July 16, 2020. Several arrests were made by the police on the complaint of one Pardeep Singh of Bhadson in Patiala district. In 2016, the Supreme Court restrained the PACL or its directors, promoters and others or its associate companies from selling or transferring properties in or outside India. In December 2015, the Securities and Exchange Board Board of India (Sebi) had ordered attachment of all assets of PACL and its nine promoters and directors for their failure to refund money to investors. A panel headed by Justice RM Lodha (retired) had initiated the process of refunds to investors. The chargesheet says that despite the ban, PACL and its associated companies started disposing of land worth hundreds of crores in and outside India. It says that one Pardeep Singh produced a power of attorney of Bhangu’s daughter Barinder Kaur of Mohali given to one Sarabjit Singh Sanghera of Australia to sell property worth of 6-crore Australian dollars. Sanghera had multiple powers of attorney given by Bahngu’s kin. The powers of attorney were prepared in Zira town of Ferozepur district. There were also financial transactions between Sanghera and Har Satinder Singh, says the challan.

This was because deaths typically lag after fall in cases.Experts consider the spread of the infection to be under control when the positivity rate remains below 5% for at least two weeks.Delhi’s positivity rate remained below 1% for 82 days from December-end through the third week of March.“The cases have been going down since April 24; it has gone down to 4,000 now after the lockdown. Our target is to have a positivity rate of 2%; the positivity rate was 1 to 2% when the cases had suddenly gone up. Experts believe in a target of 5%; anything over that is considered to be high,” said Delhi health minister Satyendar Jain in a press briefing on Wednesday.Also Read| Centre concerned only about global image: Delhi govt on Singapore controversyHe also said the government was preparing for a third wave, which might affect children as well. “Delhi is also working on preparations for cases in adults as well as children.

20-05-2021||Mumbai||Covid-19 cases on decline, lockdown unlikely to be extended in Maharashtra||Maharashtra on Wednesday recorded 34,031 daily infections pushing the count to 5,467,537. The tally of active cases dipped to 401,695 as 51,457 recoveries were reported in the last 24 hours. Significantly, state health minister Rajesh Tope also hinted that the state may not extend complete lockdown as the situation in the state is improving.The state saw 594 casualties taking the toll up to 84,371. Kolhapur reported the highest toll with 80 deaths. The district recorded 68 deaths while the city reported 12 fatalities. It was followed by Mumbai and Pune with 57 and 49 casualties respectively.Dr Rahul Pandit, member of the state task force, said that those who are succumbing to the disease are not new patients and were admitted to the hospital at least three weeks ago. He also said that the virus is fatal and patients are coming in a critical position. “The deaths that are happening are of the patients that were admitted a few weeks ago. These are the patients who were admitted almost three weeks ago but could not be recovered and succumbed to the disease. They are not new patients,” Dr Pandit said, who is also director, critical care, Fortis Hospital, Mulund. After over three months of surge, the daily cases in Maharashtra have started declining gradually. The situation started changing ever since the state government imposed a complete lockdown on April 22, which has been extended till the early morning of June 1. For the straight six days, Maharashtra is reporting less than 40,000 cases.However, the case fatality rate (CFR) of the state has been on the rise for the first time since July 2020. This is because the state is reporting a significant number of casualties daily. Till May 19 — 14,462 fatalities have been reported in this month alone, which is record highest in any of the months since March 2020 when Covid-19 hit Maharashtra, according to the statistics provided by the state health department.There are 12 days still left for this month to be completed.Previously, April had reported the highest number of fatalities — 12,496.On May 19, the case fatality rate (CFR) recorded at 1.54% from 1.49% reported on May 1. In the last three months — February, March and April, CFR were 2.42%, 1.94% and 1.5%.The average daily casualties of this month also reached an all-time high — 770. In April, it was 416.Four districts — Nanded (9.17%), Nandurbar (7.74%), Hingoli (5.46%) and Bhandara (4.92%) — have reported the highest death rate across the state past week (between May 12-18). Districts having the highest number of casualties are — Mumbai — 14,373, Pune — 8,987, Nagpur — 6,252, Nashik — 3,940 and Solapur — 3532, according to a weekly analysis report prepared by the state health department.Mumbai also clocked 1,329 cases and reported a total 691,352 cases to date.In the last 24 hours, the state tested 285,647 samples and had a positivity rate of 11.91%. However, the overall positivity rate of the state stood at 17.15%, according to the data issued by the state health department on Wednesday.Tope said, “Our tally of active cases has come down to around 400,000 from close to 700,000 in 25 days. Our daily growth rate has also declined to 0.5% and Maharashtra is currently at 34th position among states in the terms of growth rate across the country.”He also hinted that the current lockdown restrictions could be eased to some extent, subject to the prevailing situation towards the end of the month when the ongoing lockdown is scheduled to end.“Lockdown will remain in force till early morning of June 1. The thumb rules for imposing lockdown are the availability of beds, medicines and in case healthcare services are likely to get crumbled. Today, we have beds and medicines available in all the districts. We also have an adequate number of doctors and healthcare workers,” he said in response to a question related to extending lockdown restrictions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/covid19-cases-on-decline-lockdown-unlikely-to-be-extended-in-maharashtra-101621452876428.html

20-05-2021||Mumbai||At 1,329 new cases, Mumbai sees a slight jump||A day after the city reported below 1,000 cases - the lowest in the last two months, the daily case figure jumped by 38% as the city recorded 1,329 cases on Wednesday along with 57 deaths compared to 44 deaths being reported on Tuesday. However, the silver lining is that the daily positivity rate has remained around 5%.The number of cases on Wednesday increased owing to the increase in the number of testing. On Tuesday, 961 cases were reported out of the 17,920 tests that were conducted in the city meaning a daily positivity rate of 5.36%. On Wednesday, the testing went up to 22,788 of which 1,329 were positive meaning a daily positivity rate of 5.83%.According to state health department data, the city’s total case tally is 691,352 followed by a death toll is 14,373. The city’s recovery rate is 93.37% with 645,516 recoveries. The city’s fatality rate is 2.07% and there are 29,445 active cases.Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner of the BMC said, “We have directed our officials to ramp up testing as they had gone down in the last few days. We have not set any target but have asked officials to ensure proper contact tracing. Though the test has gone down, our daily positivity rate has not increased, which is a good sign.”The city had increased its testing since March 23 owing to the second wave and for one straight month, there were above 40,000 tests being reported in the city. But the number of tests started falling in the last 10 days owing to the positivity rate going down. According to BMC officials, the number of cases is going down as there are very less citizens who are taking up self-testing.Meanwhile, Dr Siddarth Paliwal a city-based physician said, “This means citizens are not getting tested on time, and are waiting for their condition to get worse. This in a way also leads to an increase in fatality rate to a certain point. Hence, BMC has to ensure that the testing number does not go down.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/at-1-329-new-cases-mumbai-sees-a-slight-jump-101621452756839.html
20-05-2021||Other||₹100-cr scam: HC accepts LIT’s plea to stop plot allotment to co-op society||The Punjab and Haryana high court (HC) has accepted the petition filed by Ludhiana Improvement Trust (LIT) in the decades-old ₹100-crore scam for stopping the allotment of 33 plots (150 square yards each) to the members of a cooperative society.In its order dated May 12, the HC has directed the Ludhiana police department to submit a report of the special investigation team (SIT) formed to investigate the case within three months.As per the LIT officials, members of Shaheed Bhagat Singh Cooperative Society fraudulently got 55 plots allotted to their members under the Model Town scheme in 1990. While the LIT was developing the scheme, it had planned to acquire the land which belonged to the society in present Model Town Extension Block-C.Even as the society got the land exempted from the state government, it still managed to get 55 plots allotted to the members stating that the cooperative’s land was acquired by the LIT. The land (now in Ambedkar Nagar) was under encroachment at the time and not in possession of the society.While the society got 25 plots allotted in connivance with LIT officials, it sought 33 more plots at some other place.The scam was initially unearthed in 1996 and an FIR was also lodged in 2001. But no proper follow-up was done. The LIT also lost the case in the state and national consumer dispute redressal commissions and the Supreme Court.When the society got execution orders from the consumer court for allotment of 33 plots, the LIT filed a special leave petition (SLP) in the HC against the same and police investigation was reinitiated in the case recently.LIT chairman Raman Balasubramaniam said, “It is a major breakthrough in the scam worth around ₹100 crore. The court has observed that the allotment was done in a fraudulent manner. The LIT will not allot the 33 plots and cancel the previous allotments as well.”“We have been regularly pursuing the case in coordination with the state department and action will be taken against all the culprits. We have also decided that from now on, criminal proceedings will be initiated apart from taking departmental action for fraud to discipline the fraudsters,” he added.Six ex-LIT officials were involved in fraud While BD Aggarwal and then executive officer KR Garg were nominated in the FIR lodged in 2001, the police have recommended nomination of four others in the FIR during recent investigation. They include then legal assistant Paramjeet Singh, superintendent Naveen Malhotra, sale superintendent ML Malhotra and assistant town planner BS Sohi. While Garg has been arrested by the police, Naveen Malhotra is on the run. The others have died.Fate of 17 plots uncertain After the LIT commenced the process of cancelling the allotment of remaining 25 plots, uncertainty looms over the fate of 17 bonafide plot holders as they have purchased the same from the original allottees, unaware of the fraud.LIT officials said total 25 plots were allotted, but only eight are situated on the land belonging to the society, while the rest are on LIT land. Some of the current plot holders have also approached the HC over the cancellation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/100cr-scam-hc-accepts-lit-s-plea-to-stop-plot-allotment-to-co-op-society-101621452756306.html

20-05-2021||Other||Keep your furry friends away from summer heat, say experts||Summer can mean lots of fun outside with your dog. But when the temperatures soar, take steps to protect your pets as the heat can be hard on them, say experts.According to Dr C S Randhawa, head of veterinary medicine department, Guru Angad Dev Veterinary and Animal Sciences University (GADVASU), Ludhiana, the most common problems during hot weather are heat stroke and dehydration. Any dog exercising on a hot and humid day, even with plenty of water, can get overheated, so ideally, take your dog for walks during cool hours of the day, he said.Overheating is more common in dark-coloured dogs or those with hairy coats. Never leave your dog in the car. No, not even if you think you’ll only be a few minutes. Even when it isn’t that hot outside, the temperature can soar to dangerous levels in a matter of minutes inside a closed car, even with partially open windows, the veterinarian said.A dog’s normal body temperature is 100.5-102.5 degrees Fahrenheit. While human beings invariably sweat to cool down, dogs cannot sweat and lose heat by panting. Dogs breathe in through the nose and out through the mouth, directing the air over the mucous membranes of the tongue, throat and trachea to facilitate cooling by evaporation of fluid, explained Randhawa.“Dogs also dissipate heat by dilation of the blood vessels in the surface of the skin in the face, ears and feet. If their body temperature rises to 105 or 106°F, they are at a risk of developing heat exhaustion. Its damage to the body’s cellular system and organs may become irreversible,” caution Randhawa.Once the signs of heatstroke are detected, there is precious little time before serious damage, or even death, can occur. Heat stroke is a very serious condition that requires immediate medical attention. Do not take your dog for a walk on a hot surface as it may cause burns on their foot pads, the vet said.Summarising his suggestions, he said never leave your dog alone in the car; avoid vigorous exercise on warm days; when outside, opt for areas under shade; keep cool water available at all times.Certain types of dogs are more sensitive to heat, so use extreme caution in their case. Many dogs enjoy playing and lounging in cool water. Providing them with a tub or kiddie pool or running a sprinkler can be a good option, said Dr Randhawa suggesting to keep an eye on your dog always.This period is quite congenial for the growth and activity of external parasites like ticks and fleas. Many of these can transmit or cause diseases. Consult a veterinarian to keep your dog free from these parasites. You can also consider shaving dogs with long and hairy coats to reduce heat stress.Tips to cool offNever leave your dog alone in the carAvoid vigorous exercise on warm daysWhen outside, opt for playing in shadeKeep fresh cool water available at all timesShave hairy pets to reduce heat stress||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/keep-your-furry-friends-away-from-summer-heat-say-experts-101621452636528.html

20-05-2021||Mumbai||Mucormycosis claims 90 lives in Maharashtra||Maharashtra has recorded 90 deaths of recovered Covid-19 patients owing to mucormycosis, also called black fungus. So far, Maharashtra has reported around 1,500 infections and has around 850 active patients across the state, state health minister Rajesh Tope said on Wednesday. He also asked the Centre to immediately release allocation of Amphotericin B injections, which is used to treat the disease, as the state is getting around 300-400 cases every week.The issue was also discussed in the state cabinet meeting as ministers raised concern over rising cases of mucormycosis. The state has a stock of only 16,000 doses which were distributed among the districts based on the number of active cases, officials said.Mucormycosis is a rare fungal infection that is found in immunodeficient patients.The state government has placed an order of 190,000 doses of Amphotericin B, but the companies are unable to supply the stock as the Centre has decided to regulate its supply and will determine its allocation based on the availability in the market, Tope said.“Around 1,500 patients are found infected with mucormycosis in the state till date. Of them, the state has around 850 active patients who are getting treatment in various districts, the rest have been discharged from hospitals after recovery. There are also 90 casualties recorded owing to the disease thus far,” Tope told reporters on Wednesday after the cabinet meeting.“We want the Centre to make allocations of Amphotericin B immediately as its cases in the state are rising continuously. Last week, the state clocked around 400 cases. We have also floated a global tender to get doses from the international market. There is no reason for the state to take it lightly and we are exploring all the possible options available with us,” he added.Covid patients who were treated with excessive use of steroids and those with high diabetes are usually found infected with the disease. This is the reason the state government has recently issued detailed guidelines on its symptom, medical investigation, prevention and treatment protocol for local authorities and doctors on May 17. HT was the first to report this on May 18.The guidelines were issued with an aim to reduce morbidity and mortality among mucormycosis patients. It asked for strict glycemic control during management of Covid-19 patients which means blood sugar levels must be continuously controlled. It added that systemic steroids can be used only in patients with hypoxemia, and if used blood sugar level should be monitored.The state government has also declared to treat patients suffering from mucormycosis under Mahatma Jyotirao Phule Jan Aarogya Yojana (MJPJAY) for free. It has also decided to remove the cap of ₹150,000 for treating a patient under the scheme only for this disease, Tope said.“Strict infection control measures including cleaning and replacement of humidifiers (to be implemented). Sterile normal saline should be used in the humidifier bottle and changed daily and masks should be disinfected daily. Local public health laboratory should be asked to take swabs of humidifiers, masks, tubing and common touch areas for culture of mucormycosis,” stated the order issued by Ramaswami N, commissioner, health services and mission director, National Health Mission (NHM), Maharashtra on May 17.It has asked the doctors not to miss warning signs and symptoms and also to not consider all cases of blocked nose as cases of bacterial sinusitis, especially in the context of immunosuppression and Covid-19 patients on immunomodulators.It also described signs and symptoms of mucormycosis comprising pain and redness around eyes and nose, fever — usually mid, epistaxis (bleeding from the nose), headache, cough, shortness of breath, blood vomiting and altered mental status.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mucormycosis-claims-90-lives-in-maharashtra-101621452275787.html
20-05-2021||Mumbai||Verbal spat between MVA ministers over quota in promotion for reserved category govt staff||Two Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) ministers — deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar of the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) and energy minister Nitin Raut of the Congress — were involved in a verbal dual over quota in promotion in government jobs for reserved category employees. The state government had, on May 7, issued an order to scrap reservation in promotions in accordance with a Bombay high court (HC) order given in August 2017. The issue was about quota in promotions in government jobs which, according to Dalit activists, was introduced nationally to ensure that employees do not face discrimination in promotions. It was meant for government employees from Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes and other sections in the quota. During a cabinet sub-committee meeting on Wednesday, Raut questioned the order which scrapped the reservation saying it was unjust. He also asked Pawar how could the government issue the order without taking the sub-committee of ministers, appointed to take a decision on reservation, into confidence. He also said that despite the court order, the Central government has been implementing reservation in promotions on the basis of the Supreme Court ruling in Jarnail Singh case. Raut demanded that the order be immediately scrapped and a fresh legal opinion be sought on the issue. Pawar is head of the cabinet sub-committee.Raut’s office issued a press statement saying that the May 7 order has been scrapped. However, the deputy chief minister’s office clarified that no such decision has been taken and Pawar has agreed to the legal review of the decision.Maharashtra government has given 33% reservation in promotion in government jobs to SC, ST, VJNT and SBC employees. It was challenged in the Bombay HC which, in 2017, ruled against it and asked the government to reverse the promotions given under the decision.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/verbal-spat-between-mva-ministers-over-quota-in-promotion-for-reserved-category-govt-staff-101621452215811.html
20-05-2021||Mumbai||HC lauds BMC, pulls up Centre, state for lapses in dealing with Covid||The Bombay high court (HC) on Wednesday lauded the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) for its great vision of having civic-run hospitals with affiliated medical colleges which enabled it to control the number of Covid-19 cases in the city, and said the same should be emulated by other civic bodies. The HC then pulled up the state for not complying with its earlier orders pertaining to alleged mismanagement of Covid-19 treatment during the second wave and for not taking steps to curb black-marketing and profiteering during procurement and distribution of Covid-19 drugs. The bench also blasted the Centre for allowing politicians and celebrities to procure and provide antiviral drugs and oxygen. The division bench of chief justice Dipankar Datta and justice Girish Kulkarni, while hearing public interest litigations (PILs) citing mismanagement of Covid-19 second wave by the state and civic authorities, was informed there was little to no compliance of the court’s earlier orders by any of the respondents. The bench was told the replies and affidavits filed were incomplete and vague as they failed to address the issues raised in the petitions conclusively. The affidavit filed by the state while pointing out that there was no shortage of remdesivir was silent on the administration of the drug in private hospitals. The bench took note of the same and questioned the state as to how they could substantiate its claim of no shortage. The court also noted that though Covid-19 cases were going down, the need for oxygen had not reduced and hence there was a doubt about the facts and figures furnished by the state. In light of concerns raised by advocate Rajesh Inamdar for one of the petitioners over celebrities and politicians procuring drugs and oxygen to help patients, HC asked the Centre, “Allocation is by Union, collection is by state. Where is the window of collection by these personalities? That is our anxiety.” Additional solicitor general Anil Singh submitted that the Centre would file a report on the issue along with compliances of the earlier orders of HC. He added that the Central authority had asked all state drugs controllers to conduct investigation drives to prevent hoarding and black marketing of remdesivir. Senior advocate Anil Sakhare for BMC informed the bench that the civic body was taking measures for expanding the scope of vaccination and infrastructure for paediatric treatment.After hearing the submissions, the bench said, “We make it clear that we are concerned with the lives of citizens; there cannot be any mileage for popularity or for other things. We are deeply pained if needy patients are being deprived of it. This is sorry state of affairs.” The bench then warned, “By the next hearing, if we find you (state) are not serious in compliance of our orders, we will be compelled to seek presence of the chief secretary of Maharashtra.”Lauding the BMC’s vision of having big hospitals and affiliated medical colleges, the HC said other civic bodies should have followed such mechanism.It observed that while every district has civil hospitals, all of them did not have medical colleges. “The pandemic is an eye opener. Think of future generations. They should not be under fear of doctors not being available to treat. It is high time for policymakers to sit down and decide. We can only echo our sentiments,” said the bench.

Following chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh’s directions, Amritsar deputy commissioner Gurpreet Singh Khaira set up a two-member committee comprising deputy director (local bodies) Rajat Oberoi, who is also in-charge of the death analysis committee in the district, and Amritsar civil surgeon Dr Charanjit Singh to look into the matter.The probe report submitted to the DC on Wednesday says the private hospital did not meet the criteria required for the treatment of Covid-19 patients.The committee said the hospital was authorised to admit level-2 Covid patients only, but it allowed even level-3 (critical) patients without informing the health department.“There is a shortage of specialist doctors in the hospital. The hospital does not have any anaesthesiologist, which is required for looking after the critical patients on ventilators. The hospital management did not have any provision of buffer stock of oxygen for the treatment of critical patients and on the day of the incident, the hospital management had not informed the district administration about the oxygen shortage,” said the DC, adding that Neelkanth Hospital has been excluded from the list of hospitals listed for the treatment of Covid patients in Amritsar.The probe committee also revealed that attendants of patients alleged that the hospital had been overcharging for Covid treatment.DC Khaira has also directed health department to write a letter to the National Accreditation Board for Hospitals and Healthcare Providers (NABH) to reconsider the certification of the hospital.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/deaths-due-to-o2-shortage-amritsar-pvt-hospital-barred-from-treating-covid-patients-101621452098425.html
20-05-2021||Mumbai||Why is PM visiting only Gujarat when Maharashtra too is hit by cyclone, asks MVA||Ruling parties in Maharashtra on Wednesday asked why Prime Minister (PM) Narendra Modi did not visit Maharashtra and announced aid only for his home state Gujarat when both the states were hit by Cyclone Tauktae. Meanwhile, politicians from ruling parties as well as opposition Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) started touring cyclone-hit coastal districts.In the backdrop of PM Modi’s Gujarat tour on Wednesday, Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) leaders criticised him for giving Maharashtra a different treatment.The Congress asked why Modi gave a miss to other states hit by Cyclone Tauktae. Maharashtra Congress chief Nana Patole asked why Modi did not visit Maharashtra which was one of the worst-hit states due to the cyclone. “Coastal districts (in Maharashtra) have sustained huge losses due to losses of coconut, mango trees and damages to fishing boats and housing structures. Despite this, the PM visited parts of his home state and announced relief package. Is he the PM of only Gujarat,” he questioned.Shiv Sena MP and chief spokesperson Sanjay Raut said that PM Modi visited Gujarat because the government in his home state was weak. “I do not want to say anything on his Gujarat tour, because the prime minister should visit the battered parts of the country. Maharashtra has faced similar losses as other states due to the cyclone, but he must have thought of Gujarat first because of the weak leadership in that state. He knows that Maharashtra is in able hands of chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, but it may not be the case of Gujarat. He must have felt about more need of giving helping hands to the people of Gujarat,” he said.Nationalist Congress Party’s (NCP) chief spokesperson and minority affairs minister Nawab Malik said, “Is this not clear discrimination towards Maharashtra?”BJP vice-president Madhav Bhandari has hit back and asked why the chief minister did not visit the affected districts in his own state. “Before raising questions about Modi’s tour, MVA leaders should first reply why the CM did not visit Ratnagiri or other districts hit by the cyclone immediately, as the PM did. They should also reveal about the quantum of losses Maharashtra has sustained while comparing it with Gujarat. The losses in Gujarat are many times more than here. MVA leaders are busy in politicising everything including a natural calamity like this, without maintaining even a minimum amount of decency,” he said.Meanwhile, leaders from ruling as well as opposition parties have started touring coastal districts hit by the cyclone. Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray will visit Ratnagiri and Sindhudurg on Friday and Saturday, while relief and rehabilitation minister Vijay Wadettiwar will tour five districts over the next four days. Patole too is visiting parts of Konkan on Thursday. Leader of opposition in the legislative Assembly Devendra Fadnavis is on three-day tour of Konkan. After visiting affected villages of Raigad on Wednesday, he took stock of the relief work at the district collectorate. “Villagers in Raigad sustained huge losses as crops and horticulture across around 5,000 hectares have been destroyed. 70,000 households in 172 villages are still in the dark owing to disconnection of electricity supply. The villagers have been complaining about not having received compensation for their losses in Cyclone Nisarga last year. The state government should announce a sizable package to give relief to these residents,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/why-is-pm-visiting-only-gujarat-when-maharashtra-too-is-hit-by-cyclone-asks-mva-101621452096371.html
20-05-2021||Mumbai||Compared to Cyclone Nisarga, 150% more trees fell during Cyclone Tauktae: BMC data||Over 150% more tree falls were reported in the city during Cyclone Tauktae when compared to the figured during Cyclone Nisarga that hit the city last year, according to data of the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC). This, BMC claims, was due to high wind speed of 114kmph (kilometer per hour) during Cyclone Tauktae.BMC on Wednesday said that between May 16 and 18, 812 tree falls was reported in the city compared to 323 tree falls reported between June 3 and 6, 2020 at the time of Cyclone Nisarga. The civic body claims that during both the cyclones, the majority of the tree falls were reported in private properties and not on public roads or places where trees are maintained by BMC. According to BMC data, of the total 812 trees that fell during Cyclone Tauktae, 504 were in private areas and 308 were in public spaces. During last year’s Cyclone Nisarga, of the total 323 trees that fell, 221 were in private areas and 102 trees were in public spaces. The data further adds that this year the highest tree fall was reported in Chembur followed by Bandra and Kurla. The civic body in a statement on Wednesday said, “About 70% of the fallen trees between May 16 and May 18 are of foreign species. These mainly include tree species like Peltoforum, gulmohar, thespesia, rain-tree, royal palm (nautal palm) etc. With this in mind, it has been underlined once again that while planting trees in the BMC area, it is necessary to give priority to native species.”BMC has been appealing citizens to plant native species that include kusum, also known as lac tree, which is a large forest tree with smooth green bark, followed by krishna’s buttercup which is associated with the legend of child deity Krishna.However, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) slammed BMC over tree falls in the city. Abhijit Samant, BJP corporator in BMC’s tree authority, said, “The number of tree fall increased this year when compared to last year. This means BMC did not learn anything form Cyclone Nisarga. Even after tree falls, there is not enough manpower available to come and pick the trees.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/compared-to-cyclone-nisarga-150-more-trees-fell-during-cyclone-tauktae-bmc-data-101621452095807.html
20-05-2021||Mumbai||We’ll permit door-to-door vaccination if Centre does not: HC to BMC, state||The Bombay high court (HC) has directed the Maharashtra government and Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) not to wait for the Central government’s permission to conduct door-to-door vaccination drive for the elderly and differently abled persons who cannot go out to get inoculated. The HC, while rapping the Centre for consulting experts who did not recommend door-to-door vaccination initiative, said the experts were probably unaware of ground realities such as people living in houses where even a stretcher cannot be manoeuvered. The court has asked the state and BMC to file an affidavit on how it proposes to conduct the door-to-door vaccination by Thursday. The division bench of chief justice Dipankar Datta and justice Girish Kulkarni, while hearing the public interest litigation (PIL) filed by advocates Dhruti Kapadia and Kunal Tiwari, was informed that the Centre failed to give a favourable response to the court’s direction in an earlier hearing on May 12 on whether the door-to-door vaccination could be implemented. The PIL sought directions to the Centre, the state government and BMC to provide door-to-door vaccination for people over 75 years of age, differently abled people and those who are bed-ridden. Kapadia further added that BMC had failed to devise a formula to identify beggars without photo IDs required for vaccination and to provide a helpline number to enable advanced age senior citizens to book an appointment for home visit for vaccination as all citizens cannot access the online platform.Additional solicitor general Anil Singh, for the Union of India, informed the court that the direction was referred to the committee of experts and they had filed a response stating that as there were post-vaccination protocols to be observed and the same could not be facilitated at individual homes, door-to-door vaccination could not be permitted. He, however, added that transport arrangements could be made to take elderly citizens to the centres. Kapadia submitted that some of the elderly and differently abled persons lived in extremely difficult conditions and if they had to go to centres they would have to be taken on wheelchairs or stretchers. However, due to the constrained spaces they live in, it was not possible to take such persons to the centres. Thus, in light of the committee’s denial, such persons would not be able to get vaccinated at all. After hearing the submissions, the court expressed dissatisfaction at the expert committee’s recommendations and termed it to be the opposite of door-to-door vaccination and said, “I am not aware of Mumbai, but in north Kolkata, there are buildings wherein even stretchers cannot be taken inside. If somebody is bedridden and there is no room for stretcher to manoeuver, how will you bring them outside for vaccination?” Justice Kulkarni then pointed out that there are old buildings in congested areas with wooden staircases even in Mumbai, and that the elderly citizens and differently abled persons living there may not be able to come out. “They (expert committee members) are all academic experts, but they seem to have zero knowledge about ground reality. If this decision is taken from Delhi, you should think about the local situation...if the corporation wants to start door-to-door vaccination. If the Centre does not permit it, we will. Saving lives is more important,” said the bench.The bench then directed the BMC commissioner to apprise it as to whether it was possible for the civic body to introduce door-to-door vaccination under proper medical care and upon consent of citizens/beneficiaries to be administered being well aware of the consequences. HC will hear the PIL next on May 20.Dr Mangala Gomare, chief of BMC’s public health department, said, “We have currently allowed walk-in vaccination for those wanting first dose among senior citizens and differently abled persons. If the court is allowing us to do door-to-door vaccination, we will make our stand clear by filing affidavit after discussing it with senior officials.”BMC had, two months ago, sought permission from the Central government to start door-to-door vaccination, but the Centre had not given permission for the same.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/well-permit-door-to-door-vaccination-if-centre-does-not-hc-to-bmc-state-101621452036336.html
20-05-2021||Mumbai||Mucormycosis claims 19 lives at 3 Mumbai hospitals in the second wave amid medicine shortages||Since the beginning of the second wave in February, a total of 19 recovered Covid patients have succumbed to the black fungus—mucormycosis – at three major government and civic-run hospitals in Mumbai. Doctors attribute the death to the delay in diagnosis and unavailability of life-saving antifungal medicine — Liposomal Amphotericin B – which delayed the timely treatment. Mucormycosis is a serious, but rare fungal infection caused by a group of mould called mucormycetes. It causes blindness, organ dysfunction, loss of body tissue and even death if not treated in time, as per doctors. “This infection has a 50% mortality rate. Since the second wave, we have treated over 45 patients suffering from mucormycosis. Of these, 15 have succumbed, which makes the mortality rate 33%,” said Dr Renuka Bradoo, head of department of ENT, Lokmanya Tilak General Hospital, which is also known as Sion Hospital. Additionally, three deaths have been reported at government-run Sir JJ Hospital since February. At present, the hospital is treating 51 patients with mucormycosis. Another patient from King Edward Memorial (KEM) hospital in Parel died of the infection last week. Almost 80% of the patients are not residents of Mumbai. BYL Nair Hospital is currently treating 11 patients, but none of them are Mumbai residents. After Covid-19 recovery, patients often hesitate to visit hospitals, even if they develop symptoms such as headache, stuffy nose and droopy eyes, according to doctors. “When it aggravates and they develop black patches on noses or eyes turn completely red, they rush to hospitals. Doctors then have to debride the dead tissues and patients lose their noses, eyes and palate,” said Dr Ramesh Bharmal, dean of Nair Hospital. “In severe cases, when the infection reaches the brain, patients die,” he added. Due to the sudden rise in mucormycosis cases, hospitals are running out of the life-saving drug. “We are seeing a lot of patients. We have to monitor the patients for four-six weeks. The best medicine is Liposomal Amphotericin B injection, which is not available for weeks now. Similarly, the other Amphotericin B has also gone off the shelves. Now, we are mostly treating patients with another anti-fungal medicine—Posaconazole,” said Dr Bradoo. Dr Hetal Marfatia, head of the department, ENT at KEM hospital, also confirmed the shortage of medicines. “There is a shortage of medicines. Our procurement department is working on it.” The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has also taken note of the shortage and floated tenders last week to procure the medicines. FDA commissioner Parimal Singh said currently they had around 16,000 vials of Amphotericin B. “We are in talks with the Central government to procure more injections,” he said. Dr Bradoo emphasised that the authorities need to expedite the process as these are life-saving drugs. “Earlier, we used to get around 10 cases annually. But since the start of the second wave, we are getting three-four cases on a daily basis. These antifungal medicines have become as essential as oxygen to save the lives of patients,” she added. The Retail and Dispensing Chemists Association has also requested the manufactures to increase the production to meet the sudden demand. “As we have been informed, individuals won’t be able to procure the injection directly from the chemists. They will have to approach their respective collectors’ offices. The admitted patients will get it through the hospitals,” said Prasad Danave, president of the association.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mucormycosis-claims-19-lives-at-3-mumbai-hospitals-in-the-second-wave-amid-medicine-shortages-101621452035768.html

20-05-2021||Mumbai||NIOS cancels Class 10 exams, postpones Class 12||With the rising number of Covid-19 cases across the country and the resultant lockdown restrictions in many states, the National Institute of Open Schooling (NIOS) has decided to cancel its Class 10 board exams and has said that Class 12 exams under the board shall be postponed. The board issued a notification to this effect on Wednesday. “The NIOS is keeping a close watch on the situation and will be reviewed by June 20, 2021. The notification in this regard will be issued 15 days before the actual date of examinations,” stated the notification while announcing the postponement of Class 12 exams. For Class 10, “the NIOS will devise suitable criteria for assessment and result will be prepared in the best interest of learners. Any learner who is not satisfied with the result so computed will be allowed to appear in public examinations or through on-demand examinations as and when the situation becomes conducive to hold the examinations,” it states about Class 10 exams. As per the earlier scheduled exams for the board, exams were held in June. However, due to Covid-19 and the resultant lockdown, the board has decided to cancel and postpone them respectively. Parents said that the decision comes as a relief to them and the students. “It was becoming very stressful for students because of the risk involved in writing an offline exam. The board has taken the right decision,” said a parent. A large number of students from the board are students with special needs and those with learning challenges. “It is especially good for such students to be evaluated on internal assessments,” added the parent.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/nios-cancels-class-10-exams-postpones-class-12-101621451855719.html
20-05-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra MBBS exams to be held offline between June 10 and 30||Putting an end to the ambiguity regarding the pending second- and third-year undergraduate as well as first-year postgraduate medical and dental exams, state minister of medical education Amit Deshmukh on Wednesday announced that exams will be conducted between June 10 and 30 in physical mode. This decision affects at least 6,000 undergraduate and a few hundred postgraduate medical students in the state.A circular to this effect was released by the Maharashtra University of Health Sciences (MUHS) on Wednesday evening, and a detailed schedule will be released soon, said officials.“This decision was taken after a series of discussion with several stakeholders. In a meeting with the MUHS controller of examination on Wednesday, we finalised the exam period,” Deshmukh said via a post on a social media network. This decision will be applicable for all pending undergraduate, postgraduate and certificate courses under MUHS, he added.Second- and third-year MBBS exams, which usually take place in December-January, were postponed three times this year due to the rising Covid-19 cases recorded across the state. At first the exams were postponed to February from January, and then to April. However due to the second wave of Covid-19 gripping the nation, these exams were once again postponed to first week of June by the state government.Earlier this week, MUHS had approached the state seeking permission to start all pending exams from June 2. Since the current lockdown restrictions are in effect across Maharashtra till June 1, MUHS had requested that state allow MBBS and postgraduate medical and dental exams to be conducted with proper social distancing and safety regulations in place.Students and parents have raised concerns about the state’s decision to conduct physical exams. “Most of us are part of the Covid-19 work force and many of us are currently infected by the virus. Several students also have family members fighting for their life at present, so holding exams in such a scenario will be unfair to us all,” said Anup Thorve, a third-year MBBS student. He added that at present, Covid-19 cases are still on the rise and the different variants of the virus are leaving patients with severe issues, including black fungus, which has left more students against the idea of physical exams any time soon.Many students also highlighted how lack of vaccine in the state has left at least 75% of the second- and third-year MBBS students without vaccination, and expecting such students to appear for physical exams will be unfair. “Most of us are living on multiple sharing basis in hostel rooms with common shared bathroom facilities. If any one student is infected, the same will spread among others in no time. We, therefore, suggest either online exams or that the authorities promote us to the next academic year,” said Piyush Dusane, another MBBS student.Officials have assured anxious students and parents that exams will be conducted keeping in mind all safety precautions. “All affiliated colleges are ready and students, too, have been aware that exams would begin in the first week of June. All MBBS and postgraduate students will have enough time to prepare for their exams now, and they can do so knowing that their health and safety is of utmost importance to us,” said a senior official from MUHS.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-mbbs-exams-to-be-held-offline-between-june-10-and-30-101621451796327.html
20-05-2021||Mumbai||Uddhav to visit cyclone-hit districts this weekend||The state cabinet on Wednesday took stock of the losses caused by cyclone Tauktae, which hit the coastal districts of Maharashtra on Sunday and Monday. The state government is expected to announce a relief package after the tours of chief minister Uddhav Thackeray this weekend, by when the assessment of losses is expected to be completed. Thackeray is visiting the cyclone-affected districts on Friday and Saturday.The cyclone that affected 11 districts, including seven in coastal parts, has so far claimed 18 lives. Of them, 16 are from coastal districts (four in Raigad; three each in Sindhudurg, Thane, Palghar; two in Ratnagiri and one in Mumbai) and two from Jalgaon in north Maharashtra. The three who died in Sindhudurg are fisherfolk who died in two separate boat mishaps in Devgad tehsil. Two fisherfolk are still missing. Some deaths were due to tree falls or electrocution.According to primary estimates, crops and horticulture on more than 10,000 hectares have been damaged. Orchards of alphonso mangoes and plantation of chickoo and betelnut have been damaged to a large extent, against which the losses to the seasonal crops were minimum as the coastal parts of the state do not grow summer crops. As per the figures collated by Wednesday evening, highest agricultural losses were registered in Sindhudurg as crops on 3,375 hectares has been affected, followed by 2,500 hectares in Ratnagiri and 1,500 hectares in Raigad.“In comparison with the losses sustained due to cyclone Nisarg last year, the damages due to the cyclone Tauktae is less. The actual monetary losses are not expected to be more than ₹20 crore, as per the preliminary estimates,” said an official from Mantralaya.In Ratnagiri, the financial losses estimated as per the assessment done till Wednesday was ₹3.75 crore. “The spot punchanamas are being held and are expected to be completed by Thursday. All the 4,563 residents who were shifted to safer places have returned to their homes. Until 7 am on Wednesday, power supply of 478,000 of 745,000 affected households were restored,” said Datta Bhadkamwad, resident deputy collector, Ratnagiri.According to the energy department, 4.64 million consumers in Thane, Raigad, Palghar, Ratnagiri, Sindhudurg and other districts of Maharashtra faced power outage. “More than 25% of them are still waiting for the restoration of the supply. We have deployed more than 13,172 workers on the restoration work by diverting staff from other districts as well,” said an offiicla from energy department.The state government is expected to announce relief package for the affected people in coastal districts in the next few days. “As per the set norms of National Disaster Relief Fund, the compensation for the crop losses ranges between ₹6,800 and ₹18,000 per hectare. It’s from ₹6,000 to ₹95,000 for the damages to the houses and ex-gratia of ₹4 lakh is given to the next of kin of the deceased. We have currently decided to go ahead with the set norms and distribute compensation. There may be a special package announced later after the visits of the political leadership,” said a Congress minister, requesting anonymity.Guardian ministers of coastal districts affected have demanded special package for the affected districts, keeping the NDRF norms aside. The state government had announced a special package by increasing amount of the compensation last year after Nisarg.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/uddhav-to-visit-cyclone-hit-districts-this-weekend-101621451375625.html

The Kalyan Dombivli Municipal Corporation (KDMC), which recently intensified its action against those roaming on road unnecessarily since May 15, claimed that this has helped reduce the cases. Although the number of testings has also decreased from 5,000-6,000 last month to 2,300-2,800 this month. On Wednesday the civic body recorded 168 cases, while the tests conducted were 3,123. On Tuesday, the KDMC recorded 180 cases, while it conducted 2,380 tests. The positivity rate was 7.7%.“The cases have reduced in the past two days because we have intensified the lockdown for 15 days. The number of high and low-risk contacts has also decreased. The tests conducted are less now, however, we conducted antigen testing on random people roaming on streets, not many positive cases were found,” said Dr Pratibha Panpatil, epidemic officer, KDMC. Of the 800 antigen tests conducted on those roaming on streets unnecessarily in the past five days, only one positive case has been detected, claimed the civic body. “We are doing testing at railway station rigorously so that we trace as many as cases. The positivity rate has also reduced,” added Panpatil. On April 21, the KDMC recorded the highest single-day spike with 2,552 cases with 5,992 tests carried out for the day. Earlier in May, when the civic body carried out 3,000 testings an average of 500-600 cases were recorded. Earlier in October 2020, the civic body when conducted 2000-2500 tests on an average of 200-250 cases were recorded. The current positivity rate in KDMC is 15%, while the death rate is 1.32% and recovery rate 95.08%. The civic body has so far conducted 6.81 lakhs Covid testings. “Recently the KDMC has started testing those who roam around and do not follow the norms. This will help keep track of cases.

20-05-2021||Mumbai||April saw most air passenger plaints for refunds in six months: DGCA Report||While India has been struggling to fight the second wave of Covid-19, air passengers continue to fight against airlines for their refund. According to the Directorate General of Civil Aviation’s (DGCA) monthly report, 75% air passengers have registered their complaints against the airlines, making them the highest in six months. These passengers are either the ones who are affected due to travel restrictions in their destination states or the ones who have been tested positive for the virus themselves and despite such challenges, airlines are seen to be deducting a major amount of cancellation charges. According to previous DGCA reports, October had seen 83.9% passenger complaints on refund, November had seen 62.4%, December had seen 61.4%, January saw 41.%, February saw 54.6% and March saw 65.7% refund-related complaints. According to DGCA’s monthly report, domestic carriers together registered 57.25 lakh air travellers in April compared to 78.22 lakh in March. In April 2020, commercial flight operations were suspended due to the nationwide lockdown.A recovering Indian aviation industry went back into hazy skies after the impact of the second wave of Covid-19 pandemic was largely seen in April. As a result of this, the air traffic across the country declined, especially after foreign countries banned travel to/ from India. While the government has allowed the airlines to operate 80% of their seating capacities, it is learnt the airlines are seeing poor seating capacity, due to the fear of getting exposed to the virus. The second wave of the pandemic has also brought in several travel restrictions/lockdowns in various states, not allowing people to travel. Moreover, a significant number of passengers are also seen avoiding travel voluntarily. Due to these, passengers are demanding a full refund, whereas few airlines allegedly are charging cancellation amounts from them, leading to an increase in such complaints.Saurabh Jain, a Malad resident who was to travel to Jaipur, could not go ahead with his travel plan as he along with his wife was detected with Sars CoV-2 last month. He was however not considered to have had a valid reason for not being able to board. “Initially the airline did not bother to refund me and even refused to consider our covid positive reports. I had to chase GoAir for twenty days to get my full amount back.

Smaller facilities are referring their patients to larger public and private hospitals such as the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), which was treating 61 patients with the infection as on Wednesday, and Sir Ganga Ram hospital, which was treating 69.AIIMS, which gets patients from across the country, used to otherwise see only 12 to 15 cases of the rare infection in a year.Black fungus has been found mostly among people with uncontrolled diabetes, whose immunity is compromised, or among people who are given excessive steroids or immunity-modulating drugs such as tocilizumab. According to doctors, if left untreated, it could kill up to 80% of those infected. If not detected early, it affects the orbit of the eye and the mouth, resulting in people losing their vision or jaw during debridement — the process of removing dead tissue from an infection or wound.Also Read| Covid-19: Delhi makes new tracing push with revised targetsDoctors at Sir Ganga Ram hospital said they saw a small surge in cases last December as well, after the November surge in Covid-19 cases in the city. In December, Ganga Ram reported 10 cases in two weeks.“We have seen almost 100 cases of the infection from May 7 or 8. Several smaller hospitals across the city are also referring patients to us,” said Dr Ajay Swaroop, head of the ENT department at Sir Ganga Ram hospital.There were 25 patients with the infection admitted across Max hospitals in Delhi, 15 at Indraprastha Apollo, 10 at Manipal Hospital, and at least three at Fortis (Vasant Kunj). The Delhi government-run Lok Nayak hospital got its first case of black fungus on Wednesday.“We currently have two patients confirmed to have the infection and two others suspected to have the infection, undergoing tests. The cases have been referred to us from small nursing homes. There has been an increase in mucormycosis cases mainly due to the overuse of steroids,” said a senior doctor at Lok Nayak hospital.“We are seeing a high number of mucormycosis, probably because of two reasons. One, this wave of Covid-19 was massive in comparison to last year; and two, the treatment protocol has evolved since last year. While the evidence shows that steroids make a difference in Covid-19 patients, they were used beyond the recommended guidelines,” said Dr Alok Thakar, head of the ENT department at AIIMS.Doctors said they have also seen cases of mucormycosis among Covid-19 patients who took steroids at home without adequate medical consultation.Also Read| Delhi: Fewest Covid cases in a day since April 5, positivity rate falls to 5.78%Dr Sumit Mrig, head of the ENT department at Max hospital, Saket, said, “People have been taking steroids at home without supervision; many of them were pre-diabetic and not aware of their sugar levels, thus causing mucormycosis.”The sudden increase in black fungus cases has led to a sharp rise in demand for the drug Amphotericin B. “It is the only drug to treat mucormycosis,” said Dr Swaroop.To prevent black-marketing and overuse, the Delhi government has set up a four-member committee that will meet twice a day to review hospitals’ applications for the use of the medicine.Health minister Satyendar Jain on Wednesday said, “The treatment of the infection can be done only in hospitals, so the drug is directly being given to hospitals. Production is not too much, but we’ve asked for extra doses -- we have asked for one lakh doses of the medicine.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-reports-185-cases-of-black-fungus-in-possible-fallout-of-covid-19-surge-101621450475424.html
20-05-2021||Delhi||Delhi: Incessant rain brings day temperature to 70-year low||The maximum temperature in the Capital fell 16 degrees below normal, weather officials said, after a day-long spell of moderate rainfall, with Delhi recording a maximum temperature of 23.8 degrees Celsius on Wednesday -- the lowest maximum temperature in May for at least 70 years.The India Meteorological Department (IMD) said the rains, caused under the residual impact of Cyclone Tauktae, may continue till Thursday afternoon in some parts of the city.The incessant showers led to a sharp drop in the mercury, with the day’s maximum at the Safdarjung weather station, which is considered the official marker for the entire city, falling to 23.8°C, 16 notches below what is considered normal for this time of the year. The minimum temperature was 21.4°C, five degrees below the season’s normal. The Palam observatory recorded a maximum temperature of 25.7°C, 15 degrees below normal. The minimum temperature here was 20.2°C.“We need to understand that this weather was induced by a rare phenomenon, the cyclonic storms. But it is true that even during peak monsoon, Delhi seldom experiences consistent rain,” a senior Met official said.According to IMD recordings, Wednesday’s recording was the lowest since at least 1951 -- the year from when IMD started preserving weather recordings in a digitised format. Before Wednesday (May 19), the lowest maximum temperature recorded in the month was 24.8°C, logged on May 13, 1982.Kuldeep Srivastava, head of IMD’s regional weather forecasting centre, said till 8.30pm on Wednesday, Safdarjung weather station received 60mm rainfall, Palam observatory recorded 36.8mm rain and Najafgarh station 57mm rain.Met officials said the all-time record rainfall for May was 60mm, logged at the Safdarjung weather observatory on May 24, 1976.“Rainfall between 15mm and 65mm is considered moderate. There is a forecast of the rains continuing through Wednesday night. Some parts of Delhi might receive light rain till Thursday afternoon as well,” Srivastava said.He added that Wednesday’s rain and the consequent drop in temperature were similar to what the city usually experiences during the peak of monsoon in August.“The maximum temperature will rise by three or four degrees on Thursday, and will continue to rise over the next four days. The cyclone is not forecast to have any impact on or around Delhi at least in the coming four to five days,” Srivastava said.Met officials explained that the rainfall began in parts of Delhi on Tuesday night under the residual impact of Cyclone Tauktae. The IMD issued an orange alert for Delhi and the National Capital Region on Tuesday, to alert authorities to the possibility of heavy rain and gusty winds.Cyclone Tauktae (pronounced Tau’Te), which intensified into an “extremely severe cyclonic storm” made landfall on the Gujarat coast late on Monday evening, with wind speed between 150kmph and 160kmph.A tropical cyclone is an intense circular storm that originates over warm tropical oceans and is characterised by low atmospheric pressure, strong winds followed by heavy rainfall.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/tauktae-induced-rainfall-in-delhi-drops-temp-to-70-year-low-weather-officer-101621450355437.html
20-05-2021||Chandigarh||Cyclonic movement shifts eastward, Chandigarh receives only drizzle||The cyclonic movement, remnant of Cyclone Tauktae, has moved east towards Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand, causing only cloudy skies and faint drizzling in Chandigarh on Wednesday, according to the India Meteorological Department (IMD). Now, Thursday is likely to remain clear, while Friday may see rain up to 10mm.“The cyclonic movement had been moving towards the region due to pressure differences, however it shifted eastward on Wednesday. There is no specific reason for this deviation, but change by even a small angle can lead to a shift by hundreds of kilometres,” said Shivinder Singh, scientist at IMD, Chandigarh.Due to this, Singh said, there was no impact in Punjab, and only mild rain was seen in southern and south-eastern parts of Haryana. In Chandigarh, trace rainfall was recorded between 8am and 5pm at the Sector 39 IMD observatory.Coldest May day in over 10 years The cloudy weather and cool winds caused the maximum temperature to drop to 27.4°C degrees on Wednesday, 10 degrees below normal, making it the coldest May day in over 10 years.According to IMD, it was only in May 2013 last that a similar day temperature of 27.6°C was recorded.With a night temperature of 25°C, there was only a two-degree gap between the maximum and minimum temperatures on Wednesday. “The sky remained cloudy since morning with little sunlight even in the afternoon. This caused the temperature to drop. The weather is likely to remain clear from Thursday onwards, which will cause the maximum temperature to rise again,” Singh said.In the next three days, the maximum temperature will remain between 32°C and 35°C, while the minimum temperature will hover between 21°C and 25°C.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/cyclonic-movement-shifts-eastward-chandigarh-receives-only-drizzle-101621450236049.html
20-05-2021||Delhi||Four from Bihar held for cheating people on pretext of selling oxygen cylinders||The Delhi Police have arrested four people from Bihar Sharif in Nalanda, Bihar, for allegedly cheating several people in Delhi on the pretext of providing them oxygen cylinders. Police said the gang has duped at least 300 people of more than ₹1.5 crore till date.Police said all the arrested-- Deepak Ram (21), Pankaj (26), Sarvan Malakar (35), and Mithlesh Prasad (36)--are members of a gang named Chhote Chaudhary, which operates from Bihar’s Nalanda. Police have recovered around ₹20,000 cash, 21 mobile phones, 22 SIM cards, 23 ATM cards of different banks, other valuables and bank related documents from them.Shibesh Singh, additional commissioner of police (ACP), crime, said a complainant, who was in dire need of oxygen cylinder for his relative admitted in DDU hospital, had contacted one Sachin, whose number he got from a social media post. “The suspect offered him two cylinders for Rs. 23,950. The complainant paid the money online but the cylinder never reached him. On his complaint, a case of cheating was registered,” said Singh.The ACP said they followed the trail of the money and found that the amount was transferred to a UCO bank account in Mumbai’s Malad branch belonging to one Ruksana Khatoon. “After a detailed technical investigation, we found that the operators of the scam are based in Nalanda. Our teams zeroed in on Mithilesh Prasad, whose interrogation led to the arrest of the other suspects,” he said.Singh said the arrested suspects claimed to be members of Chhote Chaudhary gang. “Chhote Chaudhary is also a resident of Nalanda and has been running the gang for the past 2-3 years. During the pandemic, Chaudhary found an opportunity amid the rising demand for oxygen cylinders and concentrators. He roped in Deepak, who arranged the bank accounts to receive the cheated money.”“Sarvan used to help Deepak open bank accounts with fake documents and charged ₹25,000 per account. While Mithlesh withdrew the money using the ATM cards that Deepak gave him at a rate of 2% per transaction, Pankaj used to collect the money, for which Deepak paid him ₹4,500 per week,” said Singh.Enquiry of the contact numbers given by the suspects has revealed that several people had paid them various amounts for oxygen regulators, oxygen cylinders and concentrators. “Three bank accounts have so far been seized with ₹1.28 crore, ₹2.17 lakh and ₹96,000,” respectively.Further investigation is on to trace and arrest gang leader Chhote Choudhary and his other associates, police said.Delhi Police spokesperson Chinmoy Biswal said in the last one month since the lockdown in Delhi, the Covid helpline of Delhi Polic, 112 and cyber helpline have received many complaints and reports of people being cheated online by unscrupulous elements who are cashing in on the short supply of Covid essentials.“Most of these cheating and frauds took place using social media and instant payment transfer methods. Over 500 cases have been registered and investigations are being done by district cyber units and crime branch,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/four-from-bihar-held-for-cheating-people-on-pretext-of-selling-oxygen-cylinders-101621450115413.html
20-05-2021||Chandigarh||10kg cocaine haul in Chandigarh: Mastermind, aide nabbed||Police have arrested two more Chennai men for their involvement in the smuggling of the 10.24kg cocaine recovered from their aide here on May 13. The accused have been identified as Vijay Kumar, 41, and N Jaffer Shariff, 28. They were arrested from Chennai on the disclosure of Ashfaq Rahman, who was the first to be arrested on May 13 following the recovery of the cocaine in one of the biggest narcotic seizures ever in Chandigarh. According to investigators, Shariff is among the masterminds of the racket wherein the accused smuggled drugs abroad through couriers. The duo will be produced before a Chandigarh court on Thursday. Rahman was caught while preparing to courier the contraband to Australia. The cocaine, packed in two cartons of crockery boxes, was discovered by the employees at Excel Worldwide Courier Agency in Industrial Area, Phase 2, who further alerted the police. The UT Police have also informed the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) regarding a consignment of drugs sent via courier to Australia in April this year. “Investigations have pointed out that in April, the accused had succeeded in shipping a big consignment of drugs to Australia through Fedex company. The drugs were concealed in medical equipment in six cartons weighing more than 150kg,” said Kuldeep Singh Chahal, senior superintendent of police, Chandigarh. He added that NCB had been informed regarding this consignment, which was still on its way to Australia. “The bureau has been alerted to track the consignment through proper channel with the respective countries,” the SSP added. Apart from this, police have also shared information in this regard with the Enforcement Directorate; special branch, counter intelligence, Delhi; and special task force of Punjab Police.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/10kg-cocaine-haul-in-chandigarh-mastermind-aide-nabbed-101621450058098.html
20-05-2021||Chandigarh||Chandigarh admn slashes oxygen cylinder security deposit||The Chandigarh administration has reduced the security deposit for an oxygen cylinder to ₹8,000, a day after it informed the Punjab and Haryana high court that it is examining the issue.The administration had come under severe criticism from the civil society for charging a hefty amount of ₹25,000 as security for the oxygen cylinder, following which the amount was reduced to ₹10,000 for certain types of cylinders.Nodal officer for oxygen supply in Chandigarh, Yashpal Garg, on Wednesday said that the refundable amount for B-type cylinders has now been reduced to ₹8,000. A person having their own B-type cylinder would pay ₹196 including taxes as refilling charges.The administration has clarified that the security amount was prescribed on the insistence of the vendor to get back the cylinders in time and to keep the supply continuous. However, if the vendor was satisfied, they may provide the cylinder to the person without any security.An application for e-permit can be submitted on the Chandigarh administration’s website http://chandigarh.gov.in/health_covid19.html and cylinders will be provided by the firm, Super Agencies, 40-MW Industrial Area-I, Chandigarh. The firm can be contacted by phone at 9888035000 or by email at superchandigarh@gmail.com.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarh-admn-slashes-oxygen-cylinder-security-deposit-101621450056853.html
20-05-2021||Delhi||Covid-19: Delhi makes new tracing push with revised targets||With Delhi’s Covid-19 case trajectory and positivity rate falling, the state government has given district administrations fresh guidelines for home isolation, and updated their contact tracing targets in an attempt to revive the test-trace-treat system that went on the back-burner due to the unprecedented surge in infections since mid-April.All district administrations have been asked to trace 30 contacts for each Covid-positive patient in their jurisdiction, a senior Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) official said.Between May 15 and 17, the city’s 11 districts traced an average of 31.3 contacts for each person tested positive. With 35.30 contacts per case, east Delhi recorded the highest and west Delhi the lowest with 28.37 per case, showed government records.Neither Delhi government nor DDMA officials shared contact tracing data for all areas for March and April.Also Read| On Kejriwal's comment, Singapore says reserve right to invoke fake news lawOn March 15, government data showed, districts traced around 32 contacts on an average, against the target of 30 per Covid-19 case.HT reported last month that the contact tracing process had slowed as cases surged.With the fourth wave of infections adding record numbers of cases, some patients reached out to control rooms complaining that they did not receive any calls from the administration after they tested positive.“When things went out of hand, most subdivision level control rooms and dispensary level teams, which were set up to call up patients, could not keep up with the load. Doctors got busy in hospitals, and hardly anyone could be spared to check on home isolation patients, or help with telephonic consultancy on a large scale, even though the government issued helpline numbers from time to time,” said a district surveillance official who asked not to be named.The Delhi government on Tuesday revised its home isolation guidelines in line with those of the Union health ministry to include people who might be clinically presumed to have a mild case of Covid-19, as well as those diagnosed with mild or asymptomatic infection, in a move to ensure that people get help from the administration, whether or not they have a confirmed Covid-19 test.At its peak, Delhi recorded 28,395 cases in a day on April 20, while on April 22, the city recorded a test positivity rate of more than 36%. But the surge has eased in recent days, with cases, deaths, and the positivity rate all coming down.Also Read| Don’t let your guard down, even if Covid wave wanes: Delhi L-G to Kejriwal govtDelhi on Wednesday recorded 3,846 new cases, the lowest since April 5, while the positivity rate fell to 5.78%, the lowest in 44 days.The Capital has recorded a daily average of 6,390 cases over the past seven days, down sharply from the average of 15,441 daily infections it added a week ago.As on Wednesday, Delhi had 45,047 active cases, nearly half of the 82,725 active cases it had a week ago.The virus has infected 1.4 million people in the city so far, claiming 22,346 lives, state government health records showed.Experts said the government should take the present decline in cases as an opportunity to strengthen its home isolation and contact tracing systems, and scale up protocols such as triaging before another potential wave.Triaging is determining the priority of patients’ treatments by the severity of their condition or likelihood of recovery with and without treatment.“Delhi cannot afford to let things go out of hand. In Covid-19 management, there is no alternative to home isolation and contact tracing. In contact tracing, the government should not only reach out to people, but also guide them in quarantining themselves, test them and isolate the ones who test positive. Delhi now should learn and establish a strong model of triaging at a district model or subdivisional model. And ensure that investment on Covid-19 strategies are data driven,” said Dr Lalit Kant, former head of epidemiology and communicable diseases division in the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR).Dr Jugal Kishore, head of the community medicines department in Delhi’s Safdarjung Hospital, said, “The home isolation system is bound to fail if patients are not monitored through periodic calls and visits. This is an opportunity to strengthen the model. They should also have a triaging model in place.”Delhi government spokespersons did not respond to requests for comment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-makes-new-tracing-push-with-revised-targets-101621450055427.html
20-05-2021||Chandigarh||Covid-affected clusters getting bigger in Chandigarh||The size of Covid-affected clusters is getting bigger in congested parts of Chandigarh.There are currently 280 active containment and micro-containment zones that demarcate these clusters with higher incidence of infections. Around one-third people in these containment zones are in just seven clusters, with Manimajra accounting for four (see box). Since March this year, when the city was hit by the pandemic’s second wave, the administration has notified curbs in more than 400 areas, which, after the Centre’s push, has emerged as a key strategy to contain the virus spread. In the initial months of the pandemic, Bapu Dham Colony had become its epicentre in the city. With large clusters spread across the colony, the administration had declared nearly all of its pockets as containment zones. After the first wave receded, the administration had started creating micro-containment zones, which generally had three to four houses with 10 to 20 people. The strategy continued as the city was hit by the second wave, with multiple such zones carved out in March and April. However, now the cluster size has gone up in peripheral areas, such as Manimajra, where there is high population density with more people living in relatively smaller houses in congested neighbourhoods. With this, the administration has again started creating containment zones, such as the one in Manimajra’s Shanti Nagar that was notified on May 17 and has a population of 400.‘In congested areas, size has increased’“We are creating containment zones on the basis of contact tracing report and infection incidence in a locality. The aim is to limit the spread and break the infection. In congested areas, the size of the cluster has increased,” said deputy commissioner Mandip Singh Brar.Another senior official said that in the earlier weeks of the second wave, cases were mainly coming from sectors. “In May, villages and rehabilitation colonies also started reporting positive cases. As these areas are congested, more people are coming under containment restrictions for every new positive case reported than in relatively sparsely populated sectors,” said the official, who didn’t want to be named. Manimajra is becoming the new hub with the highest number of houses and a major chunk of population under containment curbs. Micro-containment zones were being created here since the start of the second wave, but, worryingly, it is in the last one week that the size of clusters has become bigger. Dr Rajesh Kumar, former head of the department of community medicine and public health, PGIMER, said, “Congested areas are more prone to spread of the infection. This indicates more people can be exposed to the infection in these areas. In a locality with less than five positive cases, a micro-containment zone is created. If cases are 5-15 in a contiguous area, then containment zone has to be created.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/covidaffected-clusters-getting-bigger-in-chandigarh-101621449876582.html

Police have arrested three people and are on the look-out for two others. SP (city), Bijnor Praveen Ranjan said that five people, including former gram pradhan Ajab Singh, his son Nikhil Kumar and three others had been named in the FIR registered on the complaint of slain teacher Sanjay Singh’s family. He further said that prime accused Ajab Singh also got injured in the scuffle with villagers and was presently undergoing treatment in police custody. His son Nikhil and another accused had been arrested and sent to jail and teams had been formed to arrest the other two named accused, he said. Ranjan said that Ajab Singh was village pradhan for two terms but this year the villagers lobbied against him because of his criminal record. “He is recorded as a history shooter in Chandpur police station with six cases against him”, said Ranjan and added that Ajab was annoyed with villagers due to his defeat in the panchayat election. On Tuesday night, Ajab Singh and his supporters were abusing villagers after consuming liquor. The villagers approached him and told him to stop abusing them. This led to an altercation which eventually turned into a scuffle between the villagers and supporters of Ajab Singh. Ajab Singh and his son allegedly opened fire on the villagers and teacher Sanjay Singh, 37, who was also in the crowd, sustained bullet injury and later died while being taken for treatment. The incident was reported to Chandpur police and senior officials also visited the spot.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/teacher-killed-as-ex-pradhan-his-son-open-fire-on-villagers-101621449877106.html

The drive will take place on Friday and Saturday for three hours in the morning and two hours in the evening, said immunisation officer Dr Meenu Sasan. Pre-registration is compulsory, she said.The decision was taken by the deputy commissioner in order to intensify the vaccination campaign, which has become sluggish in the recent days. A committee comprising administrative, traffic police and medical officials will ensure the drive-through facility runs smoothly, while the civil surgeon will provide technical inputs.Meanwhile, after a gap of at least two weeks, the Panchkula health department has also started administering the first vaccine dose to the people in 45+ age category. It was suspended a few days after the drive for 18-44 age group was launched. Meanwhile, the number of vaccination sites for the younger group has been reduced to two.To date, 1,82,314 people have been vaccinated in Panchkula, including 1,888 in the age group of 18-44 years.Vax for 45+, drive-through centres resume in Mohali After five days, the vaccination drive for the 45+ age category also resumed in Mohali on Wednesday.The two drive-through facilities at the sports complex in Sector 78 and New Chandigarh, which were closed within three days of their May 12 launch due to the non-availability of vaccine, were also reopened.According to the Co-WIN portal, the drive was carried out at 44 government centres and eight private centres.Dr Vikrant Nagra, district immunisation officer, said: “We have got 11,000 doses of Covishield and 10,000 doses of Covaxin for the second dose. We have also got 6,000 doses from the Punjab government for the 18-44 age group. We are hopeful that the drive will run smoothly now.” From around 10,000 doses being administered daily till around May 10, the number had dropped to a paltry 875 on May 16, as the drive had been restricted to construction workers and family members of health care workers and frontline workers in the 18-44 age category.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/panchkula-to-launch-drive-through-vaccination-facility-101621449816533.html

Meanwhile, Chandigarh reported nine deaths and four patients succumbed in Panchkula, taking the tricity’s toll to 28.However, in some respite, with 1,382 people testing positive, the tricity registered the lowest number of cases since the 2,000 mark was breached on April 22. As many as 603 people were diagnosed with the virus in Mohali, followed by 414 in Chandigarh and 378 in Panchkula.Though the second wave of infections is ebbing but experts have said there is likely to now be a spurt in fatalities as people who have been battling for their life from when the cases hit a peak begin to either recover or succumb after prolonged critical care stay.The peak was hit on May 10 with 2,612 cases, with even Mohali logging a record 1,382 cases. Chandigarh registered its all-time high of 890 twice, on May 3 and 7, while Panchkula’s cases peaked at 654 on May 5. The total has remained below 2,000 since May 14. In terms of deaths, the tricity had reported an all-time high of 38 on May 5, Mohali recorded 17 deaths on May 5 and 9, Chandigarh hit the peak of 14 twice, on May 5 and 12, and Panchkula logged record nine deaths on May 17.Meanwhile, with more people getting cured than those testing positive, the tricity’s active case load dropped to 16,958 from the peak of 24,201 a week ago.After 2 weeks, 5 ICU beds become available in MohaliFinally, after two weeks, five intensive care unit (ICU) beds for Covid-19 patients became available at some private hospitals in Mohali on Wednesday.

Meanwhile, the civil hospital in Phase 6, which is the government’s lone Covid-19 facility in the district, has no ICU bed while all its 120 oxygen beds remain occupied.Mohali has also become the first city in Punjab where the a makeshift Covid hospital will come up under a new scheme of the state government. Under the scheme, Invest Punjab will coordinate with all departments concerned to ensure the grant of approval within 24 hours of the submission of application with self declaration. On Wednesday, it issued an NOC to Mohali Medical Group Private Limited to set up an 80-bed temporary facility.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/15-covid-patients-die-in-mohali-for-second-day-in-a-row-101621449216710.html
20-05-2021||Delhi||Mucormycosis: HC quizzes Delhi govt, Centre on medicine stock||The Delhi high court on Wednesday sought to know from the Delhi government what steps it had taken to resolve the shortage of amphotericin- B, an antifungal drug used in the treatment of Mucormycosis, or black fungus, is a life-threatening disease that is affecting recovered Covid-19 patients.A bench of justices Vipin Sanghi and Jasmeet Singh asked the government to provide them the details of the drug stock; how much is required and how it is being distributed currently to hospitals. The court also sought to know the rationale of the Delhi government in putting out a circular by which it had constituted a technical expert committee (TEC) to vet hospital requests for the drug.In its circular, the city government has said all Covid hospitals requiring amphotericin-B will have to apply to the experts committee, which will meet twice a day to scrutinise applications and facilitate rapid decision-making.“What is the rationale? What is the stock? What are your supplies and how are you distributing it? Why suddenly it (amphotericin- B) is in shortage if it is locally manufactured? You have to point out the bottleneck. This time we will not be caught unawares. This cannot be a case of artificial shortage,” the bench said while also seeking the Centre’s stand on the issue.The discussion ensued after petitioner lawyer Rakesh Malhotra told the court that there is a shortage of amphotericin- B, the antifungal drug used in the treatment of black fungus. He said even last year, there were Covid-19 recovered patients who had developed black fungus. However, the authorities still had not taken enough steps to augment the production of the medicine.He also submitted that hospitals have to presently go through a lengthy process to acquire the medicine, after sending requisition and completion of necessary formalities.Senior advocate Rahul Mehra said the demand of this drug has shot up in the past four days and the situation is even worse than that of remdesivir, not just in Delhi but in the entire country. A shortage of antiviral drug remdesivir had led to widespread hoarding and black marketing of the drug -- each vial with an MRP of ₹900-3000 was being sold for as high as ₹40,000, especially during the month of April and the first half of May, when Covid-19 cases were at an all-time high across the country.Mehra said that even though the amicus curiae has suggested a buffer stock should be created for hospitals, the same could not be done because they do not have any stock.He said the requirement for one patient is 90 vials of amphotericin- B and they have sent necessary requisitions to the Centre which has taken over the supply of the drug. He submitted that the Centre’s counsel can also take instructions on the issue and the matter can be considered on Thursday.“Let the Union (govt) come tomorrow. They have taken over the supply. We are getting it in a rationed way. We have made requisitions which we will place before this court. We have written to the Centre that 90 vials are required for a patient,” Mehra said disputing the stand of the petitioner who said that the city government has 1,000 vials.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/black-fungus-hc-quizzes-delhi-govt-centre-on-medicine-stock-101621449095157.html
20-05-2021||Other||‘Those killed in Sukma were from frontal outfits of Maoists’: Police||Three people who were killed in an exchange of fire between security forces and Maoists near a new police camp in Chhattisgarh’s Sukma district earlier this week have been identified as members of frontal outfits of the outlawed CPI (Maoist), police officials said on Wednesday.The incident took place on Monday afternoon when a group of villagers were protesting against the camp which opened on May 12 near Silger village - a Maoist stronghold along the border of Sukma-Bijapur districts. While villagers claimed that security forces opened fire unilaterally on protestors, police had said Maoists were part of the crowd that was protesting against the camp and the ultras started the gun battle.According to police, three people were killed in the exchange of fire while five others sustained injuries in the incident. Local villagers claimed that the deceased and the injured were villagers and not Maoists.Inspector-General of Police (Bastar range) Sundarraj P on Wednesday said, the preliminary investigation revealed that the deceased were allegedly linked with frontal organizations of banned CPI (Maoist) but police are trying to ascertain this input.Prima facie, the deceased have been identified as Uska Pandu, a Bhumkal commander from Timmapur village (Sukma); Kowasi Waga, DAKMS (Dandakaranya Adivasi Kisan Majdoor Sangthan) member from Chhutwahi; and Kursam bhima, militia member from Gundem village (Bijapur), the IGP said.All these formations are frontal wings of Maoists which function at the village level, he added. The bodies have been handed over to their relatives, he added.Of the five injured in the firing, four have also been identified as members of frontal outfits of the Maoists, he added.The camp, where personnel from CRPF’s 153rd and 168th battalions, CRPF’s elite unit CoBRA, Special Task Force (STF) and District Reserve Guard (DRG) are stationed, was opened on May 12. Residents from the nearby villages were protesting and demanding its removal since May 14.Briefing the sequence of the incident, the IGP said, the protesting villagers had returned on Sunday night after being pacified by police officials and the executive magistrate but the Maoists again forcefully sent them near the camp on Monday.Around 3,000 villagers, wielded with bows-arrows, axes and other sharp-edged weapons, sticks and stones, charged towards the camp shouting slogans to remove it, he said. The crowd pelted stones at security personnel positioned at the outer cordon leaving many of them injured and causing damage to two Mine Protected Vehicles (MPVs) parked there, the IGP added. The crowd also tried to dismantle the barricading around the camp and snatch rifles and magazine from security personnel, he said.Meanwhile, ultras belonging to Jagargunda, Pamed and Kerlapal area committees of Maoists and other lower rung cadres who were hiding in the crowd opened fire at security personnel.Despite warnings, they continued firing that triggered a stampede-like situation and villagers started fleeing from the spot, he said. At that moment, security forces had no option but to retaliate in self-defence, he said.After the situation normalised, the bodies of the three killed were recovered and later five injured were admitted to hospital, he said.Villagers later claimed that the police resorted to lathi-charge and unilateral firing, a charge denied by the police.Alok Shukla, convener of Chhattisgarh Bachao Andolan (CBA), a group of activists, on Tuesday alleged that the police opened fire on the tribals who were protesting against the camp. Shukla demanded that the incident be probed by a retired judge of the High Court in a time-bound manner and an FIR be registered against those found guilty.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/those-killed-in-sukma-were-from-frontal-outfits-of-maoists-police-101621448976230.html
20-05-2021||Pune||PMC guidelines keep political interference away from vax centres||Pune: A day after vaccines arrived in the city and the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) issued guidelines on vaccination at the centres, the process went on smoothly. The city got its stock of vaccines four days later which meant that the drive had to be shut for two days. On Wednesday too, the drive was restricted to only the second dose for those aged above 45 years. In view of the shortage of vaccines, the civic body had issued fresh guidelines to restrict any outside interference at the vaccination centres and even avoided giving out tokens from Wednesday which lead to a smoother vaccination drive in the day. On Tuesday, PMC issued guidelines that all vaccinations have to be registered on the CoWIN portal under the eligible criteria. In view of political party workers hijacking the vaccination centres to provide tokens to their recommended people, PMC had stated that no person, except the health workers, is allowed to enter the centre without due permission and that only those who have an online slot booked and those who have come for walk-ins will enter the premises. With limited vaccines in the city and no slots available for those aged between 18-44 year age group, the vaccination centres saw no rush and the process went on smoothly. In the case of token system too, only civic officials present at the spot are allowed to distribute tokens and the process for the same would begin at 10 am. The civic chief Vikram kumar in his guidelines also stated that the local ward officer or the health officials concerned at the ward can also seek police protection to maintain law and order if need be. Meanwhile, the Pimpri Chnchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC) administration issued a statement on Wednesday stating that the vaccination drive for any age group will not carried out within the civic limits on Thursday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/pmc-guidelines-keep-political-interference-away-from-vax-centres-101621440033861.html
20-05-2021||Pune||PMC standing committee approves ₹733 crore for Swargate-Katraj Metro route||Already battling paucity of funds due to Covid pandemic, the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) has approved a proposal to spend ₹733 crore for Swargate-Katraj Metro rail extension. The estimated share of the PMC in the fresh proposal approved on Tuesday by the standing committee of PMC is 15 per cent of the overall project cost, compared to 5.44 per cent decided earlier. PMC municipal commissioner Vikram Kumar had earlier tabled a proposal in the standing committee to approve 15 per cent financial contribution for Swargate-Katraj Metro extension project which is expected to be a major relief for those living on Satara road. His proposal came after Centre reduced its own share, passing the additional burden on the civic body. On Tuesday, the standing committee approved the proposal and passed on the general body meeting for final approval. However, most opposition parties have taken objection on the approval of the proposal and pointed out the financial condition of PMC. Political parties including Congress, Shiv Sena and NCP alleged that the fresh proposal puts an additional pressure on taxpayers as Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has failed to get money from Centre. Aba Bagul, Congress party leader in PMC said, “The Congress party has given a proposal to reconsider Swargate-Katraj extended Metro route proposal to give permission to take responsibility of 10 per cent of the project cost. Actually, the Central government should have to give us 20 per cent share as per other Metro extension project such as Mumbai and Nagpur.” He further said, “If PMC will have to bear the cost of the project, there is no need to continue the project. The Swargate-Katraj BRTS route is going well. If the Metro starts on this route, Pune Mahanagar Parivahan Mahamandal limited (PMPML) will have to face a financial loss on this route. It is a contradictory decision. After all, taxpayers’ money will be wasted.” Prithviraj Sutar, Shiv Sena Party leader in PMC said, “We are not against the Metro, we have supported the Swargate-Katraj Metro route, but the Central government suddenly reduced its share and put a burden on the PMC. The PMC is already facing a financial crunch; we have given priority to Covid. It is not feasible to allocate more money to Swargate-Katraj Metro. It will adversely affect other development projects of PMC. The BJP should have to convince the Central government to give 20 per cent share to PMC as BJP is in power at centre. We will not allow putting an extra burden on taxpayers.” Deepali Dhumal, Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) leader in PMC said, “The BJP should have to correspond with the Central government and restore 20 per cent share in Swargate-Katraj Metro route. Earlier, the Central government was ready to pay 20 per cent, how can they suddenly decide to reduce their share. In the pandemic situation, it is difficult to raise money as the revenue is declining.” Hemant Rasane, PMC standing committee chairman said, “The state has also reduced its share in the project. We will not share right now. We gave node to the proposal as it should not be delayed. There are options to approach the Central and state governments and request them to increase their share in the project. The project has already been delayed. We don’t want to delay it further.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/pmc-standing-committee-approves-rs-733-crore-for-swargate-katraj-metro-route-101621437513503.html
20-05-2021||Pune||Autos pack passengers, flout Covid norms in Pune||Pune: The continuous lockdowns in the state have left residents who use public transportation face a lot of inconvenience. As those in emergency services are allowed to use public transport buses, commuters are seen sharing autorickshaws across the city. It is observed that share autorickshaw drivers take 4 to 5 passengers at one time in violation of social distancing norms and risking the lives of passengers. “I have been daily using share auto for work from Swargate to Katraj since the past one month. Sometimes, I see the auto ply with 4 passengers. With Pune Mahanagar Parivahan Mahamandal Ltd (PMPML) buses off roads, we have no option but to bank on these autos,” said Shailesh Pandey, a worker. Autos carrying passengers beyond permissible limits are seen on major routes, including Sinhgad road, Katraj to Warje on the bypass highway, Swargate to Hadapsar and Katraj and Ahmednagar road. These autos mainly ply between 7 and 11 am when essential shops are allowed to remain open as per the Covid lockdown restrictions. “People should not risk their lives as the second wave of Covid has claimed many lives. Using share auto poses risk of getting infected. The state government should now allow commuters to travel by public transport buses by following the Covid protocol,” said Atul Namekar, secretary, Sinhgad Road - Warje residents association. Rahul Shrirame, deputy commissioner of police (traffic) said, “More than taking action, auto drivers and passengers should realise the risk of getting infected when they travel in groups. Only two passengers are allowed at one time in an auto. We will review busy roads and take action against violators.” As per the Covid lockdown restrictions, transport vehicles are allowed to travel to and from place of residence to virus testing centre, vaccination centre, airport/ railway station, emergency medical requirements, personnel of essential services, marriage, funeral/ last rites. Rickshaw drivers are allowed to not carry more than two passengers at a time and maintain social distancing. Autos are allowed with driver plus two passengers in the back seat for the permitted purposes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/autos-pack-passengers-flout-covid-norms-in-pune-101621431692857.html

"Do you want them breathing in your face on the strength of their honor?"Pelosi has clashed over masks with the chamber's top Republican Kevin McCarthy, who introduced a resolution that would allow lawmakers to be maskless on the House floor.House Democrats killed the measure.Some lawmakers have grown openly defiant. Republican Brian Mast said Tuesday he was fined $500 for refusing to wear a mask on the House floor.Pelosi announced such punishments for mask violations in January."This is nothing more than political theatre," House Republican Ralph Norman tweeted Thursday. "All over the Capitol complex, staff and members are maskless. It is time for @SpeakerPelosi to drop the charade."A recent Morning Consult poll found that unvaccinated Americans are about twice as likely as vaccinated people to say they are comfortable not wearing masks while doing activities like attending a work conference.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/unvaccinated-us-lawmakers-a-danger-to-congress-says-nancy-pelosi-101621532162066.html
20-05-2021||World||European Union-US trade officials move towards resolving 'key differences'||European Union and U.S. top trade officials on Thursday further cemented recent advances on some key differences that have soured trans-Atlantic relations over the past few years.EU trade ministers used a virtual meeting with U.S. trade representative Katherine Tai to highlight the breakthroughs in the longstanding dispute over airplane production subsidies and a fight over steel tariffs.“We agreed that finding effective solutions together is essential to preserve our critical industries,” EU Vice President Valdis Dombrovskis said.“It is spring here in Brussels and there is a spirit of optimism," German Trade Minster Peter Altmaier said. It stood in sharp contrast with the four years of divisive relations under President Donald Trump.U.S. President Joe Biden will visit the EU next month seeking to further increase cooperation on anything from battling the COVID-19 pandemic and confronting a surging China as a disruptive rival.“I stressed the importance of sticking together regarding what happens in China,” Dutch Foreign Trade Minister Sigrid Kaag said.Germany's optimism was boosted further when the Biden administration on Wednesday spared the German company overseeing a natural gas pipeline from Russia into the EU, underscoring how Biden wants to mend relations with a key ally that were unsettled during the Trump administration.Even if Germany is the juggernaut of the EU's economies, France is its strategic partner in dealing with Washington, and French Foreign Trade Minister Franck Riester equally lauded “the very positive signals coming from the United States.”And the European Union has done its part too. Just on Monday, it hit the pause button and temporarily suspended some upcoming measures at the heart of a steel tariff dispute. With it, the bloc wouldn't increase some tariffs targeting U.S products, including Harley-Davidson motocycles and bourbon.And they agree to address together the global steel and aluminum excess capacity, where they see China as a common adversary.It already followed the four-month suspension of tariffs used in the longstanding Airbus-Boeing dispute. Both sides now face a July 10 deadline to find a new breakthrough.“Work is advancing. So I would say that this timeline is realistic,” Dombrovskis said. “Of course, it requires effort on both sides, but it’s possible.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/european-union-team-biden-take-one-more-step-towards-resolving-key-differences-101621529513467.html

Secretary-General Antonio Guterres on Thursday described Gaza as "hell on earth" for children, appealing to Israel for rapid and unhindered aid access and telling the 193-member General Assembly he would launch an appeal for humanitarian funding.Diplomatic efforts toward a ceasefire in the Gaza war gathered pace on Thursday amid a worsening humanitarian crisis in the Palestinian territory, but fighting between Israel and Palestinian militant group Hamas continued.The 193-member U.N. General Assembly met on Thursday to discuss the renewed violence, but no action was expected."If there is a hell on earth, it is the lives of children in Gaza today," said Guterres, adding that he would launch a full humanitarian appeal for funding as soon as possible."The hostilities have caused serious damage to vital civilian infrastructure in Gaza, including roads and electricity lines, contributing to a humanitarian emergency. Crossings into Gaza have been closed and power shortages are affecting water supplies," Guterres added.Guterres called for an immediate ceasefire and urged Israel's military to exercise maximum restraint and Hamas to stop indiscriminate rocket fire. He also called on Israel to stop demolitions and evictions in the Palestinian Territories."Access for humanitarian goods is paramount. Attacks by militant groups on areas surrounding crossing points are unacceptable," Guterres said. "At the same time, Israel has a duty to allow and facilitate rapid and unhindered access for humanitarian aid ... into Gaza."Hundreds of buildings and homes have been destroyed or damaged, Guterres said, and airstrikes have damaged several hospitals. Some 50,000 people were seeking shelter in U.N. schools, mosques and other places with little access to water, food, hygiene or health services, Guterres added.The U.S. mission to the United Nations on Wednesday expressed opposition to a French push for a Security Council resolution on the conflict. France has circulated a draft text to council members, diplomats said. The United States has traditionally shielded its ally Israel at the United Nations.The French draft text, seen by Reuters, demands an immediate cessation of hostilities and condemns "the indiscriminate firing of rockets against civilian areas," without laying blame. It urges protection of civilians and revival of the peace process between Israel and the Palestinians with the aim of creating two states.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/gaza-hell-on-earth-for-children-un-chief-urges-israel-to-exercise-maximum-restraint-101621526772676.html
20-05-2021||World||Two AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine doses 85-90% effective: UK real-world analysis||Two doses of the Oxford/AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine are around 85% to 90% effective against symptomatic disease, Public Health England (PHE) said on Thursday, citing an analysis of real-world data from the rollout of the shot.Britain has suffered one of the worst death tolls globally from the pandemic, but has also had one of the fastest vaccine rollouts, generating a lot of data about the use of the shots in real world settings.In a weekly surveillance report, Public Health England said the estimated effectiveness of the AstraZeneca vaccine, invented at the University of Oxford, was 89% compared to unvaccinated people.That compares to 90% estimated effectiveness against symptomatic disease for the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine."This new data highlights the incredible impact that both doses of the vaccine can have, with a second dose of the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine providing up to 90% protection," vaccines minister Nadhim Zahawi said.PHE said the analysis was the first of its kind on the effectiveness of two doses of AstraZeneca in a real-world setting but was not yet published in a journal, adding more data would boost its confidence in the finding.Britain has been rolling out the shots manufactured by Pfizer and AstraZeneca since December and January respectively, and in April also started rolling out Moderna's vaccine.PHE said there was a "small reduction in vaccine effectiveness" from 10 weeks after the first dose of the Pfizer shot before the second shot is given.Britain extended the gap between doses to 12 weeks, though Pfizer warned there was a lack of evidence of its efficacy outside the three-week gap used in trials.Last week, Britain cut the gap between doses down to 8 weeks for the over 50s, aiming to give maximum protection to more vulnerable people in light of concern about the B.1.617.2 variant first found in India.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/two-astrazeneca-covid-19-doses-85-90-effective-uk-real-world-analysis-101621525474421.html
20-05-2021||World||China, US again engage in war of words over transit of warship||China on Thursday slammed the latest transit by a US warship through the South China Sea, calling it a “violation”, and adding that its navy “warned away” the American vessel from the contested waters.The US navy denied the claim by China, saying the warship “USS Curtis Wilbur was not ‘expelled’ from any nation’s territory” from near the Paracel islands in the South China Sea.“The PLA’s statement about this mission is false. USS Curtis Wilbur was not ‘expelled’ from any nation’s territory. USS Curtis Wilbur conducted this FONOP (freedom of navigation operation) in accordance with international law and then continued on to conduct normal operations in international waters. The operation reflects our commitment to uphold freedom of navigation and lawful uses of the sea as a principle. The United States will continue to fly, sail and operate wherever international law allows, as USS Curtis Wilbur did here,” the US Navy’s 7th Fleet said.China, Taiwan and Vietnam claim sovereignty over the Paracel islands, known as Xisha islands in China.It is the second time in two days that China and the US have sparred over the passage of the same warship, which sailed through the sensitive Taiwan Strait, which separates the self-ruled Island from China on Wednesday.The Chinese foreign ministry said it warned the US over its “provocations” in the disputed South China Sea. “China urges the US to stop infringements and provocations,” ministry spokesperson, Zhao Lijian said on Thursday.Zhao’s remarks came after the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) said it “warned away” the American warship, the USS Curtis Wilbur, after it allegedly “broke into China’s Xisha territorial waters”.The Southern Theatre Command of the PLA warned the US destroyer that “its behaviour severely violated China’s sovereignty and security and undermined South China Sea’s peace and stability”.“China will continue to take necessary measures to safeguard its national sovereignty and security,” Zhao said.China claims nearly the entire South China Sea but that claim is disputed by several maritime neighbours including Philippines, Brunei, Malaysia and Indonesia besides Vietnam and Taiwan (which China says is a breakaway region).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-us-again-engage-in-war-of-words-over-transit-of-warship-101621515944087.html

In April, Bourla told CNBC people will "likely" need a third booster dose of COVID-19 vaccines within 12 months.Scientists, however, are questioning the need for COVID-19 booster shots due to a lack of data to make an informed decision.There has been significant headway in ensuring vaccine equity, Fauci added, highlighting that the shots should be available in geographic locations easily accessible to minorities as a lesson for the next pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/fauci-expects-covid-19-vaccines-for-children-by-late-2021-or-early-2022-101621514485442.html
20-05-2021||World||Chinese vaccines effective against Covid variant detected in India: Expert||China’s current Covid-19 vaccines are effective against the coronavirus variant first detected in India, a leading Chinese disease control expert said on Thursday.Based on preliminary studies, the vaccines in use in China can provide protection against coronavirus infection “to a certain extent”, Shao Yiming, an expert with the Chinese Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), said in Beijing on Thursday.Shao did not share specific details of which vaccines are effective.Chinese experts had said last week that at least 18 cases of the Covid-19 variant first detected in India had been detected in China.China has been paying close attention to the variant of the coronavirus detected in India, and is conducting research and accumulating data on it, Shao said.The virus will continue mutating, therefore more changes will appear, Shao, was quoted as saying by the official news agency, Xinhua.He said that China is capable of putting new, effective vaccines into use if new variants render current vaccines ineffective.Shao added that if an emerging mutated variant reaches beyond the protection efficacy of the existing vaccines, China has the capability to respond to it quickly “…because the production process is mature enough and does not require much change to produce a new vaccine against the mutation”.India until last week had not approached Chinese companies to import vaccines to tackle the current surge in Covid-19 cases, the Chinese foreign ministry told HT on May 14.China, according to agency reports, has five vaccines in use in its mass immunization campaign: Three inactivated-virus vaccines from Sinovac and Sinopharm, a one-shot vaccine from CanSino, and the last one from CDC in partnership with Anhui Zhifei Longcom.More than 449.5 million doses of Covid-19 vaccines had been administered in China as of Wednesday, the National Health Commission said in an update on Thursday.Earlier this month, the World Health Organisation gave the green light to China’s Sinopharm Covid-19 vaccine for emergency use, approving the vaccine to be rolled out globally.It is the first vaccine developed by a non-Western country to get the UN health agency’s backing though China has already vaccinated millions of people at home, since last year, and in dozens of other countries with it.“On the basis of all available evidence, WHO recommends the vaccine for adults 18 years and older, in a two-dose schedule with a spacing of three to four weeks. Vaccine efficacy for symptomatic and hospitalised disease was estimated to be 79%, all age groups combined,” the WHO said.China had provided vaccine assistance to over 80 countries, three international organisations and exported jabs to over 50 countries, the Chinese foreign ministry said earlier this week.“We are also working with over 10 developing countries including Egypt and the UAE on technological transfer and cooperative production to quickly advance large-scale production of vaccines,” ministry spokesperson, Zhao Lijian said.China has also promised to supply 10 million vaccines to Covax, a global vaccine distribution campaign backed by the WHO.India recorded 276,110 new Covid-19 cases in the last 24 hours, Indian health ministry data showed on Thursday.The total tally now stands at 25,772,440. The country also recorded 3,874 deaths, pushing the overall death toll to 287,122.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinese-vaccines-effective-against-covid-variant-detected-in-india-expert-101621514385159.html
20-05-2021||World||Canada taps female generals amid military misconduct cases||Canada is putting women generals into some of its most senior military posts, including one to run logistics for the Covid-19 vaccine rollout, after a series of misconduct allegations were levied against top male officers.Critics have complained the armed forces were not doing enough to address systemic problems with sexual harassment, identified in a landmark 2015 report.Admiral Art McDonald lasted barely six weeks in the job of chief of the defense staff, Canada's top soldier, before stepping down in February for what were later revealed to be sexual misconduct allegations. He has not commented on the case.His predecessor, General Jonathan Vance, is being probed over complaints about inappropriate behavior with two female subordinates. Vance has acknowledged one relationship but denied impropriety.Late on Friday, the defense ministry announced that Major-General Dany Fortin, who was running the vaccine rollout, had stepped aside pending a probe. Fortin's lawyer did not respond to requests for comment from Reuters but told the Globe and Mail his client denied the allegations, which have not been revealed."This is ... not an ideal situation to be in, particularly in this moment of crisis," Prime Minister Justin Trudeau told reporters. The furor could damage Trudeau, an avowed feminist, ahead of an election aides say he is likely to call this year. The opposition Conservative Party accuses Ottawa of acting too slowly and covering up allegations.On Monday, Fortin was replaced by Brigadier-General Krista Brodie, who health officials said had already played a pivotal role in the vaccine rollout.In March, General Mike Rouleau, vice-chief of the defense staff, was replaced by Lieutenant-General Frances Allen, the first woman to hold the job. On Friday, the armed forces announced promotions for three female generals."Part of this is trying to demonstrate that the Canadian armed forces is a place where women can fully serve," said David Perry, defense analyst at the Canadian Global Affairs Institute think tank, "that no matter what your background is, you do have a chance to succeed."The office of Defence Minister Harjit Sajjan did not respond to a request for comment.Defense ministry data show that as of May 7, women made up just 10% of the top military and naval ranks.Last month, Ottawa put newly promoted Lieutenant-General Jennie Carignan in charge of a team addressing systemic misconduct inside the armed forces. It also asked former supreme court justice Louise Arbour to lead a probe into military harassment and sexual misconduct.This came too late for a senior female officer who quit in March, sickened by the allegations."I am not encouraged that we are 'investigating our top officers'. I am disgusted that it has taken us so long to do so," Lieutenant-Colonel Eleanor Taylor wrote in a resignation letter cited by the Canadian Broadcasting Corp.Former officer Leah West welcomed the Arbour probe but said the 2015 report had already revealed the size of the problem. West said she was assaulted in 2008 by a senior officer but found no support from her immediate superior and ended up staying silent."Despite years of clear evidence that sexual misconduct is rampant in our military's culture, nothing has changed," she wrote in the Globe and Mail this month.Perry said the system had clearly failed, noting some allegations stretched back decades."What we've seen over these past months is that there is a ... culture of unacceptable actions in the military that have gone on for far too long," Trudeau said on Tuesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canada-taps-female-generals-amid-military-misconduct-cases-101621513781722.html

To all those working on the vaccine rollout – thank you for everything you’ve done and continue to do,” said William, the Duke of Cambridge, in his message on Twitter.On Tuesday I received my first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine. To all those working on the vaccine rollout - thank you for everything you’ve done and continue to do. pic.twitter.com/8QP6ao5fEbIt is not yet known if his 39-year-old wife, Kate Middleton, has received her first vaccine dose as well. His 95-year-old grandmother, Queen Elizabeth II, and his father Prince Charles, 72, have all spoken about receiving their first doses earlier this year.William’s confirmation comes as the National Health Service (NHS) expanded its vaccination programme further from over-36s to now cover all those aged 34 and over. Text messages inviting people to book a vaccination will be sent to those aged 34 and 35 from Thursday. Younger groups in their thirties are expected to be invited over the next few days and weeks, with all adults expected to be eligible from next month.“This is incredible news and means we remain on track to hit our target of offering a vaccine to all adults by the end of July,” said UK Health Secretary Matt Hancock.The minister had told a Downing Street briefing on Wednesday evening that there is “increasing confidence” that the vaccines are effective against all variants, including the B1.617.2 variant first discovered in India currently under strict monitoring in the UK.“The early evidence suggests that the B.1.617.2 variant, first discovered in India, passes on more easily from person to person than the B.117 variant, first discovered in Kent,” said Hancock.“We’ve always known one of the things that has the potential to knock us off track would be a new variant. That’s why we made the presence of a new variant that could do that one of our four tests when we set out the roadmap, which are the steps we must pass before going down each step of the roadmap,” he said, in reference to plans to completely lift lockdown restrictions from June 21 under the government's current roadmap.As the UK registered 2,967 cases of the B.1.617.2 variant, the minister said the data remains under constant review even as additional measures are being deployed.“Mobility data shows travel patterns in different areas, and we look at this in deciding where the virus is at risk of spreading. Next, we now analyse wastewater in 70 per cent of the country, and we can spot the virus, and the variants in the water, and that can help us identify communities where there is spread,” said Hancock.“What this means in practice is putting in place more testing – more testing sites – and on vaccinations, we are making more vaccinations available to everyone who’s eligible. To everybody across the whole country, I’d urge vigilance as we open up and of course, as soon as you’re able to, to get the jab,” he said.Meanwhile, on the advice of the government and Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI), the NHS said people aged 50 and over and the clinically vulnerable are having their second doses brought forward to counter the spread of the B.1.617.2 variant.“Getting the vaccine is the single most important step we can take to protect ourselves, our families and our communities against Covid-19, so when you’re called forward, book your appointment and join the tens of millions who have already been jabbed,” said Professor Stephen Powis, National NHS Medical Director.People 39 and under are being offered the Pfizer/BioNTech or Moderna vaccine in line with recently updated JCVI guidance, while all other age groups are being administered either of the two or the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccines based on supplies.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/prince-william-gets-covid-19-jab-as-expands-uk-vaccine-programme-further-101621509415381.html
20-05-2021||World||China builds key highway in Tibet||China has completed building a highway including a 2km mountain tunnel in a remote part of southeastern Tibet Autonomous Region (TAR), which ends near the border with Arunachal Pradesh, posing a security challenge to India.The highway cuts through the world’s deepest canyon, the Yarlung Zangbo Grand Canyon, and its likely terminus is Baibung county (known as Drepung in Tibetan), close to the Indian border village of Bishing in the Upper Siang district of Arunachal Pradesh.The village of Bishing is located in Arunachal’s Gelling circle, which touches the McMahon Line, the de-facto Sino-India border in the region.The highway is part of China’s ambitious plans to build roads and tunnels along the length of the Line of Actual Control (LAC) with India, connecting far-flung areas to inland cities and airports.The new highway has cut down the travelling time between the Chinese border county and the nearest city area of Nyingchi prefecture by eight hours.The highway is also expected to play a key role in the surveying of and planning for the mega Yarlung Zangbo hydro-power project China is planning to build at the canyon in the same Medog county, triggering unease among downstream countries like India.Rising in TAR, the Yarlung Zangbo flows into Arunachal Pradesh as Siang, and then as Brahmaputra in Assam before flowing into Bangladesh.The construction of the highway passing through the world’s deepest canyon with a maximum depth of 6,009 metres was completed on May 16, Chinese state media reported.It was completed after the Laohuzui 2,114-metre tunnel was built on the 67.22km road connecting Pad township in the city of Nyingchi and Medog county near the India border.The project, which was executed by China’s Huaneng Group, started in 2014, and cost 2 billion yuan ($310 million).The highway was completed 228 days ahead of its scheduled opening. “It is the second significant passageway to Medog, following the first one connecting the county and Zhamog township in Bomi county. After the new highway opens to traffic, the road length connecting the city of Nyingchi and Medog county will be shortened to 180km from 346km, cutting travel time by eight hours,” Xinhua reported.The highway was built on the “…former hiking route between Nyingchi’s Pad township and Baibung township, Medog county, with an altitude difference of up to 2,892 metres between the highest and lowest spots of the road”.All the places named in the state media report are located near the border with India.“This road has obviously an important strategic significance, first due to the proximity of the border/LAC and also due to the fact that all infrastructure development in the TAR is dual use, military and civilian. It also means more tourists at the border,” India-based Tibet specialist Claude Arpi said. “The new route will probably facilitate the survey for the mega hydro power project announced as part of the 14th Five-year plan.”Interestingly, in December, in a report on the highway, the official Tibet news website had said that the constructing the highway had proven difficult and the project was affected by geological disasters such as heavy rain during the flood season, ice and snow in winter, landslides, mudslides and avalanches.In 2018, a landslide caused by a melting glacier blocked the Yarlung Zangbo at the Sedongpu Basin in Milin county, close to the proposed site of the dam, forming an unstable lake of around 600 cubic metres of water, the Hong Kong-based South China Morning Post (SCMP) reported in April.Across the border, India is also building a 150-km-long Yingkiong-Bishing national highway in the Upper Siang district.Arunachal Pradesh health and family welfare minister Alo Libang said in November that the satellite survey for construction of the highway had been completed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-builds-key-highway-in-tibet-101621504363053.html

The 2020 edition was also canceled due to the pandemic.Singapore's defence ministry said it supported the decision to cancel, calling it regretful but the responsible course."The cancellation of the SLD in no way reflects any reduced commitment to dialogue and engagement to ensure peace and stability in Asia and beyond," the ministry said, adding it will "find alternative and safer avenues for these important goals".||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/shangrila-dialogue-summit-in-singapore-cancelled-due-to-covid-19-pandemic-101621500868092.html
20-05-2021||World||World’s largest iceberg breaks off in Antarctica as glaciers retreat||An iceberg the size of the Spanish island of Majorca has broken off the coast of Antarctica, with measurements taken from satellites and planes confirming it’s now the world’s largest.  Iceberg A-76 calved from the western side of the Ronne Ice Shelf in Antarctica and is now floating on the Weddell Sea, the European Space Agency said. It measures around 170 kilometers (105 miles) long and 25 kilometers (15 miles) wide. That's larger than New York’s Long Island and half the size of Puerto Rico. The Antarctica ice sheet is warming faster than the rest of the planet, causing melting of snow and ice covers as well as the retreat of glaciers, especially around the Weddell Sea. As glaciers retreat, chunks of ice break off and float adrift until they break apart or crash into land. Last year, currents took iceberg A-68A, the world’s largest at the time, from Antarctica to the coast of the South Georgia Island. Scientists feared the berg would collide with an island that’s a breeding ground for sea lions and penguins, but it ended up splitting and breaking into pieces instead. Average sea levels have risen about nine inches since 1880, and about a quarter of that increase comes from ice melting in the Greenland and Antarctica ice sheets, along with  land-based glaciers elsewhere, according to a study published in Nature earlier this month.The study by 84 scientists from 15 countries concluded that the more ambitious national goals to cut greenhouse gas emissions and slow down climate change set recently are not enough to stop sea levels from rising. In fact, melting glaciers and ice sheets will raise sea levels twice as fast as they would if countries fulfilled their earlier pledges under the Paris Agreement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/worlds-largest-iceberg-3-times-the-size-of-delhi-breaks-off-in-antarctica-101621497626358.html

The proposed system involves allowing only those people who are fully vaccinated against Covid-19 to travel and attend public gatherings such as music concerts and sports events. On May 12, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau had said that Canada was among the countries considering such immunity certification, particularly for international travel.But despite being open to considering vaccine passports, Trudeau himself had cautioned against the possibility of the proposed passes becoming discriminatory. “The idea of certificates of vaccination for domestic use does bring in questions of equity. There are questions of fairness and justice. There could be discrimination,” the Canadian PM had said.A statement issued jointly by privacy commissioners and ombuds across Canada, however, cautioned, “While this may offer substantial public benefit, it is an encroachment on civil liberties that should be taken only after careful consideration.”They said that while vaccine passports would allow people to travel and attend public gatherings, also supporting economic recovery while protecting public health, the system would require individuals to disclose personal health information about their vaccination status “in exchange, potentially, for access to goods and services, for example, restaurants, sporting events and airline travel”.“Vaccine passports must be developed and implemented in compliance with applicable privacy laws,” the statement said. “They should also incorporate best practices in order to achieve the highest level of privacy protection commensurate with the sensitivity of the personal health information that will be collected, used or disclosed.” The privacy commissioners also said that whether introduced by governments or by private organisations, the proposed certificates, whether digital or in paper, need to have “clear legal authority”.They were also categorical that vaccine passports should “not be used for any purpose other than Covid-19”. The statement also noted that personal health information collected for this purpose “should be destroyed and vaccine passports decommissioned when the pandemic is declared over by public health officials or when vaccine passports are determined not to be a necessary, effective or proportionate response to address their public health purposes”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-canada-s-privacy-commissioners-express-concern-over-vaccine-passports-101621492061938.html
20-05-2021||World||Long before divorce, Bill Gates' conduct upset Melinda: Report||Microsoft co-founder and billionaire Bill Gates and his philanthropist wife Melinda Gates announced earlier this month that they are getting a divorce. The breakup of one of the world's most wealthy and powerful couples has given rise to scrutiny over what may have caused them to take the step. One of the main reasons for the divorce is believed to be the world-famous software pioneer's questionable behaviour in work-related settings, highlighted by several leading newspapers in their reports.Bill Gates pursued women who worked for him at Microsoft and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation on several occasions, the New York Times reported, quoting people familiar with the developments.Also Read: Here's what Melinda Gates may spend her fortune on after her divorceIn 2018, a sexual harassment claim against the billionaire's longtime money manager Michael Larson came to light. While Bill Gates insisted that the matter be settled internally, Melinda Gates wanted an outside investigation. At the end of the investigation, Melinda Gates was reportedly not satisfied with her husband’s handling of the matter, according to NYT. Michael Larson still works for Gates.The following year, Microsoft’s board of directors, of which Bill Gates was a part, initiated investigation into a case after being told that their co-founder had “sought to initiate an intimate relationship with a company employee in the year 2000,” according to Frank X Shaw, a Microsoft spokesperson. The incident was reported by Wall Street Journal. In 2020, Bill Gates stepped down from Microsoft’s board. However, Bridgitt Arnold, spokesperson for Bill Gates, said the affair took place 20 years ago and ended 'amicably'. “Gates’s decision to transition off the board was in no way related to this matter,” she added.Also Read: Bill and Melinda Gates to divorce after 27 years of marriageThe nail in the coffin is said to be the billionaire's relationship with Jeffrey Epstein, who faced accusations of sex trafficking and pleaded guilty to soliciting prostitution from a minor. When Bill Gates started spending time with him in 2011, three years after Epstein's confession, Melinda Gates expressed her discomfort. When Bill Gates did not put an end to his association with Epstein and their relationship became public in October, 2019, Melinda Gates hired divorce lawyers, according to people who attended or were briefed on gatherings with the two men, NYT reported.Arnold, however, said that characterisation of his conduct was not right. “It is extremely disappointing that there have been so many untruths published about the cause, the circumstances and the timeline of Bill Gates’s divorce,” she said.“Any claim that Gates spoke of his marriage or Melinda in a disparaging manner is false. The claim of mistreatment of employees is also false. The rumours and speculation surrounding Gates’s divorce are becoming increasingly absurd, and it’s unfortunate that people who have little to no knowledge of the situation are being characterised as ‘sources’,” she added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/long-before-divorce-bill-gates-conduct-upset-melinda-report-101621486969396.html

Kejriwal's Covid comments cause stormThe South-east Asian country on Wednesday called in the Indian envoy to lodge an objection over Kejriwal's statement. The ministry of external affairs said that the chief minister “does not speak for India” and Indian high commissioner P Kumaran clarified the matter with his Singapore counterparts.Singapore’s high commissioner Simon Wong later told a virtual news conference his country was satisfied with the Indian government’s clarification, but reserved the right to invoke a domestic fake news law to prevent the spreading of misinformation.The correction orders to social media platforms were issued under Singapore's fake news law, or the Protection from Online Falsehoods and Manipulation Act (POFMA).Facebook confirmed receipt of the order and said it was legally compelled to issue the correction notice, news agency Reuters reported. A prompt on users' Facebook news feeds will link to a government website that will clarify there is no new 'Singapore' variant of Covid-19, neither there is evidence of any Covid-19 variant that is 'extremely dangerous for kid - the two claims made by Kejriwal.Twitter has so far not responded to Singapore's move.Dismissing the assertions made by Kejriwal, Singapore's health ministry said that the variant prevalent in many Covid-19 cases in recent weeks was the “B.1.617.2 variant, which originated in India”.(With inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/singapore-tells-facebook-twitter-to-carry-correction-notice-on-covid-strain-101621488106379.html

As many as 35 Republicans supported the move, joining Democrats to hand former US president Donald Trump, a fellow Republican, a resounding rebuke by ignoring his appeal to reject such a panel.The measure passed 252-175. It has to now secure the support of the evenly split Senate where at least 10 Republicans will need to join Democrats to see it through.The legislation, which was negotiated by Democratic and Republican leaders of the House committee on homeland security, proposes to create a 10-member commission with five each from the two main parties, who will exercise equal powers of issuing subpoenas to summon witnesses. Modelled on the commission that investigated the September 11, 2001 terror attacks, it will look into the storming of the US Capitol by a huge mob incited by Trump to prevent a joint session of Congress from certifying Joe Biden as the winner of the 2020 presidential election.Trump, who was impeached over the insurrection and has continued to falsely claim that he lost because of election fraud, had in a statement issued just hours before the vote called for Republicans to defeat the legislation, calling it “partisan unfairness”.Charlie Crist, a Republican congressman who voted to pass the legislation, told CNN, “I voted for it is because when I saw the events of January 6, I saw a breakdown in communications. I saw a breakdown in coordination, in anticipation; and I want to get to the bottom of how our security forces allowed a breach of the people’s House, the Capitol.”Crist is among 35 Republicans who rebuffed Trump’s appeal to vote against the legislation. There is growing opposition within the Republican Party to Trump and his control over the GOP.It is a major increase from 10 House Republicans who had voted to impeach Trump for the US Capitol insurrection in January, which in itself was a huge leap from zero Republicans who had voted to impeach him in December 2019, when two Democrats had voted against the motion.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/rebuffing-trump-republicans-join-democrats-in-bid-to-set-up-capitol-riot-probe-101621485282512.html

Right now, it is working through an interagency process," Psaki said in response to a question.The interagency team including National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan and those from the State Department are discussing to determine how the United States is going to distribute and share these vaccine doses."Certainly, the plight of everything the people of India had been through is obviously on our minds… but there are also a range of countries and regions around the world that have been deeply impacted that are also in need. So, these are all factors.

In another sign of potential escalation, militants in Lebanon fired a rocket barrage into northern Israel.After a visit to military headquarters, Netanyahu said he appreciated “the support of the American president”, but he said Israel would push ahead to return “calm and security” to Israeli citizens. He said he was “determined to continue this operation until its aim is met”.Earlier on Wednesday, Biden told Netanyahu he “expected significant de-escalation today on the path to a ceasefire” in the ongoing Israel-Hamas conflict, setting a deadline amid growing calls for an end to hostilities.The fourth call in a week between the two leaders came after Netanyahu, fondly referred to as “Bibi”, was quoted by the Israeli media as saying he is not setting a time frame for an end to the hostilities.“The [US] president conveyed to the [Israeli] prime minister that he expected a significant de-escalation today on the path to a ceasefire,” the White House said in a readout of their call.US may veto French draft resolution on ceasefireA US spokesperson said Washington won’t support a UN Security Council draft resolution proposed by France calling for a ceasefire, saying it may undermine efforts at de-escalation.Israel said earlier that it was not setting a time frame for an end to hostilities with Gaza as its military pounded the Palestinian enclave with airstrikes and Hamas militants unleashed new cross-border rocket attacks.In a 25-minute attack overnight, Israel bombarded targets including what its military said were tunnels in the southern Gaza Strip used by Hamas. Some 50 rockets were fired from the enclave, the Israeli military said, with sirens sounding in the coastal city of Ashdod.With inputs from agencies||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/bibi-defies-biden-vows-more-strikes-101621477549394.html

Nearly three fifths of the total have been given in three countries: China (421.9 million), the United States (274.4 million) and India (184.4 million).In terms of population, Israel is leading the pack: nearly six Israelis out of 10 have been completely vaccinated with two shots. The UK follows, with 54% of its population having received at least one dose.EU to allow tourists fully vaccinated against CovidThe EU took a step towards relaxing tourism travel for visitors from outside the bloc, with EU ambassadors agreeing on measures to allow fully vaccinated visitors in. They have also agreed on easing the criteria for nations to be considered a safe country, from which all tourists can travel.

Biden announced on Monday the US will share 20 million doses from its surplus stocks of Pfizer, Moderna and Johnson & Johnson vaccines by the end of June. This will be in addition to the earlier commitment to share 60 million doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine.“We intend that the allocation of the vaccines will include a substantial portion through Covax, but we have not made final decisions,” Smith, a former USAID director, told reporters.The US is confident that Covax, the largest vaccine delivery platform, will undertake fair and science and data-based allocation of Covid-19 vaccines, she added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/majority-of-80-million-jabs-to-be-routed-via-covax-us-official-101621477677479.html

20-05-2021||World||US oil pipeline paid $4.4 million to hackers after attack||The operator of the nation’s largest fuel pipeline confirmed it paid $4.4 million to a gang of hackers who broke into its computer systems.Colonial Pipeline said Wednesday that after it learned of the May 7 ransomware attack, the company took its pipeline system offline and needed to do everything in its power to restart it quickly and safely, and made the decision then to pay the ransom.“This decision was not made lightly," but it was one that had to be made, a company spokesman said. “Tens of millions of Americans rely on Colonial – hospitals, emergency medical services, law enforcement agencies, fire departments, airports, truck drivers and the traveling public.”Also Read: Why the Colonial Pipeline hack matters. ExplainedColonial Pipeline’s CEO, Joseph Blount, told The Wall Street Journal he authorized the payment because the company didn't know the extent of the damage and wasn't sure how long it would take to bring the pipeline's systems back.The FBI discourages making ransom payments to ransomware attackers, because paying encourages criminal networks around the globe who have hit thousands of businesses and health care systems in the U.S. in the past year alone. But many victims of ransomware attacks, where hackers demand large sums of money to decrypt stolen data or to prevent it from being leaked online, opt to pay.“I know that’s a highly controversial decision,” Blount told the Journal. “But it was the right thing to do for the country."Blount said Colonial paid the ransom in consultation with experts who previously dealt with the group behind the attacks, DarkSide, which rents out its ransomware to partners to carry out the actual attacks.Multiple sources had confirmed to The Associated Press that Colonial Pipeline had paid the criminals who committed the cyberattack a ransom of nearly $5 million in cryptocurrency for the software decryption key required to unscramble their data network.A ransom payment of 75 Bitcoin was paid the day after the criminals locked up Colonial’s corporate network, according to Tom Robinson, co-founder of the cryptocurrency-tracking firm Elliptic. Prior to Robinson’s blog post, two people briefed on the case had confirmed the payment amount to AP.Blount told the Journal the attack was discovered around 5:30 a.m. on May 7. It took Colonial about an hour to shut down the pipeline, which has 260 delivery points across 13 states and Washington, D.C., Blount said. That helped prevent the infection from potentially migrating to the pipeline's operational controls. But there are lingering issues. Blount said Colonial is still unable to bill customers following an outage of that system.The pipeline system delivers about 45% of the gasoline consumed on the East Coast, and Colonial, which is based in Alpharetta, Georgia, halted fuel supplies for nearly a week. That led to panic-buying and shortages at gas stations from Washington, D.C. to Florida.Colonial restarted its pipeline a week ago, but it took time to resume a full delivery schedule, and the panic-buying led to gasoline shortages. More than 9,500 gas stations were out of fuel on Wednesday, including half of the gas stations in D.C. and 40% of stations in North Carolina, according to Gasbuddy.com, which tracks fuel prices and station outages.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-oil-pipeline-paid-4-4-million-to-hackers-after-attack-101621470226579.html
20-05-2021||World||Twitter finds its AI tends to crop out Black people, men from photos||Twitter Inc's image-cropping algorithm has a problematic bias toward excluding Black people and men, the company said in new research on Wednesday, adding that "how to crop an image is a decision best made by people."The study by three of its machine learning researchers was conducted after user criticism last year about image previews in posts excluding Black people's faces.It found an 8% difference from demographic parity in favor of women, and a 4% favor toward white individuals.The paper cited several possible reasons, including issues with image backgrounds and eye color, but said none were an excuse."Machine learning based cropping is fundamentally flawed because it removes user agency and restricts user's expression of their own identity and values, instead imposing a normative gaze about which part of the image is considered the most interesting," the researchers wrote.To counter the problem, Twitter recently started showing standard aspect ratio photos in full - without any crop - on its mobile apps and is trying to expand that effort.The researchers also assessed whether crops favored women's bodies over heads, reflecting what is known as the "male gaze," but found that does not appear to be the case.The findings are another example of the disparate impact from artificial intelligence systems including demographic biases identified in facial recognition and text analysis, the paper said.Work by researchers at Microsoft Corp and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 2018 and a later U.S. government study found that facial analysis systems misidentify people of color more often than white people.Amazon Inc in 2018 scrapped an AI recruiting tool that showed bias against women.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/twitter-finds-its-ai-tends-to-crop-out-black-people-men-from-photos-101621469163582.html
20-05-2021||World||Facebook running special center to respond to content on Israeli-Gaza conflict||Facebook Inc set up a 24-7 "special operations center" last week to respond to content posted on its platform about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and address any moderation mistakes amid violence in the region, the company said on Wednesday.Misinformation, hate speech and calls for violence about the conflict have circulated on social media platforms amid the deadly fighting.Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed to continue fighting against Gaza militants after US President Joe Biden urged him to seek a "de-escalation" on Wednesday in the 10-day conflict on the path to a ceasefire."This operations center allows us to closely monitor the situation so we can remove content that violates our community standards faster, while also addressing possible errors in enforcement," Monika Bickert, Facebook's vice president of content policy, told reporters on a conference call.Facebook has previously set up similar operations centers to focus on situations like global elections.Facebook spokesman Andy Stone told Reuters that Facebook's head of global affairs, Nick Clegg, and other executives had on Tuesday talked to Palestinian Prime Minister Mohammad Shtayyeh. Facebook executives previously met with Israeli Defense Minister Benny Gantz via Zoom, Politico reported last week.A Reuters fact-checking team has debunked images shared on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram that falsely claim to be related to the conflict.The New York Times reported on Wednesday that there has also been a surge of new groups formed on WhatsApp, the Facebook-owned encrypted messaging service, by Jewish extremists for the purpose of committing violence against Palestinians."As a private messaging service, we do not have access to the contents of people's personal chats though when information is reported to us, we take action to ban accounts we believe may be involved in causing imminent harm," a WhatsApp spokesman said. "We also quickly respond to valid legal requests from law enforcement for the limited information available to us."Social media platforms have also come under fire over allegations of censorship amid the conflict. Last week, BuzzFeed News reported that Facebook-owned Instagram had mistakenly removed content about the Al-Aqsa Mosque.The Thomson Reuters Foundation also reported that Instagram and Twitter Inc had blamed glitches https://reut.rs/3ouaf0t for the deletion of posts mentioning the possible eviction of Palestinians from East Jerusalem.On Facebook's call with reporters on Wednesday, Bickert said the Facebook operations center was staffed by experts across the company, including native Arabic and Hebrew speakers. Facebook, which is based in California, has been criticized in the past for lacking local language expertise and resources amid violent situations in other countries.Bickert also said Facebook had activated a feature for its third-party fact-checking partners - of which Reuters is one - to use keyword detection for grouping related content around the conflict. She said it had been used in the past, for content about COVID-19, elections and U.S. and Australian wildfires.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/facebook-running-special-center-to-respond-to-content-on-israeli-gaza-conflict-101621468849673.html
20-05-2021||World||Blinken, Lavrov stress dialogue despite 'serious differences' in first meeting||Top diplomats from the Biden administration and Russia in their first in-person meeting on Wednesday stressed that the former Cold War foes have serious differences in how they view world affairs but struck an optimistic tone for the talks, saying the two sides can still find ways to work together.U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, in his first meeting with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, a veteran diplomat, said it was "no secret that we have our differences" and that Washington would respond to aggressive acts by Russia, but that the world would be safer if the two countries' leaders worked together.Lavrov, speaking through a translator at the opening of the meeting in Reykjavik on the sidelines of an Arctic Council meeting, said Russia and the United States have "serious differences" but have to cooperate "in spheres where our interests collide."Blinken said Biden wanted "a predictable, stable relationship with Russia" and said the two countries could work together on tackling the coronavirus pandemic, combating climate change, dealing with Iran and North Korea's nuclear programs, and the war in Afghanistan."We think that's good for our people, good for the Russian people and indeed good for the world," Blinken said.The meeting was the first high-level, in-person discussion between the Biden administration and a Russian counterpart ahead of a possible presidential summit in June in an attempt to improve their dire relations.Ties have been fraught since March when U.S. President Joe Biden - not long into his presidency - said he regarded President Vladimir Putin as a "killer", prompting Moscow to recall its U.S. ambassador for consultations. The envoy still has not returned.Half an hour into Wednesday's meeting, the U.S. imposed sanctions on some ships and entities involved in construction of the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline that would take Russian gas from the Arctic to Germany, a deal Biden has opposed. The administration decided, however, to waive sanctions on the company behind the pipeline and its chief executive.After his brief remarks, Lavrov did not respond to shouted questions on the sanctions. Before the announcement, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov had said the waiving of those sanctions would help normalise ties between Moscow and Washington.Lavrov, summarizing Russia's posture toward the United States, described it as "very simple.""We are ready to discuss all the issues without exception, but under the perception that the discussion will be honest, with the facts on the table, and of course on the basis of mutual respect."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-seeks-cooperation-with-russia-but-will-respond-to-aggression-blinken-101621460317150.html
20-05-2021||World||Lawmakers clash over commission to probe US Capitol riot||Congress was divided over creation of a bipartisan commission to investigate January's deadly US Capitol storming, with Republican opposition coalescing ahead of a House vote Wednesday on the truth-seeking panel.One day after the top House Republican came out against the commission, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell also expressed opposition, raising new hurdles to getting the fact-finding probe off the ground more than four months after the riot.In January McConnell blamed then-president Donald Trump for inciting violence at the Capitol, which was overrun by Trump supporters seeking to block certification of the election won by Joe Biden.This week McConnell said he remained open to supporting a commission if changes were made to its structure, but by Wednesday he hardened his opposition."After careful consideration, I've made a decision to oppose the House Democrats' slanted and unbalanced proposal for another commission to study the events of January the 6th," McConnell said.He pointed to ongoing law enforcement investigations that have already resulted in hundreds of arrests, and said a new panel might cause unnecessary overlap.The gridlock came hours before the House of Representatives was to vote on legislation that would create a commission evenly split between five members chosen by Democrats and five chosen by Republicans.The measure is expected to pass the House with overwhelming support from Democrats and at least some Republicans.But McConnell's opposition, coming a day after Trump urged Republicans to oppose it, complicates passage in the Senate.The chamber is divided 50-50, but at least 10 Republicans would have to join Democrats for the measure to become law."It sounds like they are afraid of the truth, and that's most unfortunate," Pelosi told reporters, referring to Republicans.While McCarthy had slammed Pelosi's tactics for the panel, Pelosi herself said she yielded to several Republican demands including a 50-50 commission split, and equal subpoena power from the panel's chair and vice chair.John Katko, the Republican congressman who helped craft the bipartisan deal, told the House that the commission would would "depoliticized entirely."Other Republicans though say they would like broader scope to allow investigation into last year's violence at Black Lives Matter protests, but Pelosi refused.She said the panel would be similar to the high-profile 9/11 commission created in 2002.That body's two chairs, former New Jersey governor Tom Kean and ex-congressman Lee Hamilton, have endorsed a January 6 commission."As we did in the wake of September 11, it's time to set aside partisan politics and come together as Americans in common pursuit of truth and justice," the pair said in a statement Wednesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/lawmakers-clash-over-commission-to-probe-us-capitol-riot-101621459853898.html

The announcements came from a notice issued by state health secretary J Radhakrishnan.Governor Banwarilal Purohit declared mucormycosis or black fungus as a notified disease under the provisions of the Tamil Nadu Public Health Act, 1939, which means from now on all hospitals treating this fungal infection will have to notify the public health department. Nine people have been identified with mucormycosis in Tamil Nadu. “Of the nine, seven patients are diabetic,” Radhakrishnan said at a press briefing.“Treatment has been started for all of them. There is no death reported till now,” he said.The government reduced the price of RT-PCR tests from ₹1,200 to ₹900 in private labs across the state. For those who are covered under the Tamil Nadu Chief Minister’s Comprehensive Health Insurance Scheme (CMCHIS) the price has been reduced from ₹800 to ₹550. The prices of pooled samples are reduced from ₹600 to ₹400.Additionally, ₹300 can be levied for testing at home. After last year, this is the second time that prices are being capped. Tamil Nadu, as a policy, conducts only RT-PCR tests and not rapid antigen tests.Meanwhile, chief minister MK Stalin launched the vaccination drive for the 18-44 age group in the state from Tiruppur district. The state received 9.6 lakh vaccines from the Centre for this age group and has another 4.2 lakh to be received.Tamil Nadu was among several states who couldn’t roll out vaccines for this age group on May 1 due to shortage. However, private hospitals, which had procured more vaccines, initiated it for the age group. The state plans to procure 1.5 crore doses through the Centre and 3.5 crore doses through a global tender.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tamil-nadu-cuts-rt-pcr-price-declares-black-fungus-as-notified-disease-101621533705917.html
20-05-2021||India||MHA asks states to help vulnerable sections, kids orphaned due to Covid-19||The Union home ministry on Thursday asked states and union territories to immediately review the facilities available for vulnerable groups, particularly children orphaned due to the Covid-19 disease, and coordinate with the agencies concerned as well as civil society groups to get them timely help.It asked the states to give priority to vulnerable sections including orphaned children, women, senior citizens and people from scheduled castes and scheduled tribes and sensitise police personnel in this context.In a detailed advisory issued on Thursday, MHA said: “Several states/UTs have initiated action and strengthened their machineries to support the vulnerable groups and various success stories and best practices are now available with states/UTs where emergency services have been provided to the vulnerable groups impacted by Covid-19.” “However, in order to meet the new challenges arising out of recent wave of Covid-19 affliction, it is requested to undertake an immediate review of the existing facilities for vulnerable groups interalia on the lines of the measures given in the various advisories issued by the MHA, especially for children who have been orphaned, senior citizens who may require timely assistance and support (medical as well as safety and security), and members of scheduled castes/ scheduled tribes who may need guidance to access government support facilities,” it added.There is no official data on how many children have been orphaned due to the pandemic but several state governments have announced various measures for the kids. Delhi government has said that children who have lost both their parents to Covid-19 will get an aid of ₹2,500 per month till they turn 25 years old and their education will also be taken care of by the government. Karnataka too has said it will rehabilitate orphaned children up to the age of 18 years. Madhya Pradesh has announced ₹5,000 per month to such children while Andhra Pradesh has announced fixed deposits worth ₹10 lakh for orphaned kids.Thursday’s communication reminded states about several advisories and standard operating procedures issued last year for the protection of vulnerable sections of the society. This includes release of ₹107.49 crore to state governments for setting up/strengthening women help desks in police stations. These help desks envisage to have an enlisted panel of experts like lawyers, psychologists, NGOs who can assist in accessing support, provide shelter, rehabilitation etc. and help in registration and follow-up in the cases giving required assurance and support to the women approaching them.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mha-asks-states-to-help-vulnerable-sections-kids-orphaned-due-to-covid19-101621532805091.html

"There is no direct scientific comparison between the two available vaccines. So one can not choose one over the other. Both the vaccines work well in preventing the infection as well as in preventing severe illness. You can choose any of these, subject to the availability at your vaccine centre," the Centre said.There is no direct scientific comparison between the two Vaccines, Both work well in preventing the infection as well as in preventing severe illness.#IndiaFightsCOVID19 #Unite2FightCorona pic.twitter.com/MZsGyJfAueBoth these vaccines are available at present in the country though they are not available in the same centre. People can choose centres according to their vaccine preference on the Co-win app as centres are displaying the name of the vaccine they have on the site.The government has recently said that 26 potential cases of bleeding and clotting have been reported after the administration of the Covishield vaccine, which is minuscule. Since the beginning of the vaccination drive in January, 23,000 adverse events have been reported involving both Covishield and Covaxin and 700 were reported to be serious, while India's cumulative vaccination coverage exceeds 187 million.As far as the price per dose is concerned, Covishield comes cheaper than Covaxin. The Centre is hopeful to add Russia-made Sputnik-V to the list soon. The government has recently accepted the finding that the protection offered by the first dose of Covishield stays long and that's why the timing of the second dose has been delayed by 12 to 6 weeks. But Covaxin doses are supposed to be taken at the existing gap of 28 days.The composition of both the vaccines is different. Covishield, which is the Oxford-Astrazeneca vaccine, is made from a weakened version of a common cold virus that infects chimpansees. It also contains the genetic material of the SARS-CoV-2 virus spike protein. On the other hand, Covaxin has been developed from live inactive virus.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covishield-versus-covaxin-what-government-says-about-comparing-two-covid-19-vaccines-101621529875829.html

20-05-2021||India||‘India-China ties at crossroads... tensions continue on LAC’: Jaishankar||The India-China relationship is at the crossroads and New Delhi cannot think of cooperating with Beijing in other areas as long as tensions continue on the Line of Actual Control (LAC), external affairs minister S Jaishankar said on Thursday.The external affairs ministry too said the process of disengagement of Indian and Chinese troops at friction points in Ladakh sector remains “unfinished” and the full restoration of peace and tranquillity in border areas alone will lead to progress in bilateral ties.Jaishankar’s remarks, made during a virtual interview at the FT-Indian Express webinar, came in the wake of calls by the Chinese leadership for setting aside the border standoff that began a year ago and focusing on cooperation in other areas such as trade and investment.He accused China of moving away from the consensus on stabilising the border, which emerged from former prime minister Rajiv Gandhi’s groundbreaking visit to China in 1988. This consensus led to important border agreements in 1993 and 1996 that created three decades of peace and tranquillity on the LAC, he noted.“I think the relationship is at a crossroads and which direction we go depends on whether the Chinese side would adhere to the consensus, whether it would follow through on the agreements which we both have done for so many decades,” Jaishankar said.“Because what is very clear in the last year is that border tensions cannot continue with cooperation in other areas,” he added.Jaishankar pointed out it took 26 years for the two sides to recover from the fallout of the border war of 1962 and to forge consensus on the handling of the LAC, including two border agreements.“Those agreements essentially stipulated that you wouldn’t bring large armed forces to the border and that peace and tranquillity on the LAC would be observed, there would be no attempt to change the status quo unilaterally. What we saw last year was actually China departing from the 1988 consensus,” he said.“If you disturb the peace and tranquillity, if you have bloodshed, if there is intimidation, if there is continuing friction at the border, then obviously it is going to tell on the relationship,” he added.Twenty Indian soldiers and at least four Chinese troops were killed in a brutal clash in Galwan Valley last June, the first incident involving fatalities along the LAC in 45 years. The two sides pulled back frontline troops from the north and south banks of Pangong Lake in February but the disengagement process stalled soon after despite more rounds of military and diplomatic talks.When external affairs ministry spokesperson Arindam Bagchi was asked about the situation on the LAC at a weekly news briefing, he replied that Jaishankar had told his Chinese counterpart Wang Yi in their most recent conversation on April 30 that “while the process of disengagement had commenced earlier this year, it remained unfinished”.Jaishankar had emphasised this process should be completed at the earliest, Bagchi said. “Full restoration of peace and tranquillity in the border areas would enable progress in this bilateral relationship,” he added.The two sides had agreed to maintain stability on the ground and “avoid any new incidents”, and India expects that neither side would take “any action that is not in keeping with these understandings,” Bagchi said.Jaishankar also told the webinar that India’s interest extends from deep into the Indo-Pacific region to Africa and Europe, and that the country’s growing relationship with the US shouldn’t be viewed through a Cold War prism. The Quadrilateral Security Dialogue or Quad, he said, brings together countries with a growing degree of comfort with each other and a shared interest in global and regional challenges such as connectivity, maritime security, resilient supply chains and vaccines.“Today, the Quad fills a gap which cannot be addressed simply by four bilateral relationships aggregated, and a multilateral or regional structure which isn’t there. Something has to fill that space [and the] Quad helps to fill the gap,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/indiachina-ties-at-crossroads-tensions-continue-on-lac-jaishankar-101621524105195.html
20-05-2021||India||Himanta Biswa Sarma floats crowdfunding campaign to help keep ‘free vaccine’ pledge||Assam chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma on Thursday appealed to the state’s residents to donate money to help the state fund Covid-19 vaccines for people in the 18-44 age group.Sarma estimated the government would have to spend ₹800 crore to vaccinate nearly 12 million residents in this age bracket and hoped the donations would raise about ₹100 crore. “I appeal to the state’s residents to make the ‘gift a vaccine’ campaign a mass movement. Gifting a vaccine is like giving life to someone. While two doses of Covishield cost ₹600, the same for Covaxin costs ₹800. People can give amounts equal to one dose or more depending on their financial capacity,” he said.Sarma’s Bharatiya Janata Party had promised free vaccines to people in the run-up to the state elections.The Centre only provides free Covishield and Covaxin doses to vaccinate those above 45 years. State governments have to bear the cost of vaccinating residents in the 18-44 age category. It is a promise, Sarma said on Thursday, that his government will deliver on irrespective of how the crowdfunding campaign shapes out. A similar appeal for donations for Covid-19 relief last year had yielded ₹119 crores in the Arogya Nidhi bank account set up for this purpose by the state government.“All of that amount would be used to procure vaccines. On top of that, I will hand over ₹50 crore from the CM’s Relief Fund to the health department to buy vaccines,” the chief minister said.The chief minister said the state government has vaccinated over 3.5 million people till now. The state has the capacity to vaccinate nearly 100,000 people daily, but because of the scarcity of vaccines, the government is vaccinating only 50,000 people daily. But vaccines will be more easily available in coming months Sarma asked the public to send their contributions to the Arogya Nidhi bank account set up last year to collect funds for Covid19 relief or even the CM Relief Fund.He said Reliance Industries Limited has contributed ₹15 crore for Assam’s vaccination fund and several other organisations have pledged to donate a day’s salary of their employees or substantial sums for the initiative. “We hope to collect nearly ₹100 cr from the campaign. The government’s commitment to provide free vaccines for all still stands and irrespective of how much funds we are able to generate from the public, our vaccination drive will continue unabated,” said Sarma. On Wednesday, Assam recorded 6,143 new cases and 89 deaths. At present, the state has nearly 48,000 active Covid19 cases. The chief minister said while Assam’s Covid-19 situation hasn’t seen a significant improvement - the state still has 48,000 active Covid-19 cases and recorded 6,143 new cases on Wednesday - he saw the decline in the positive rate from 9% to 6% as a good sign.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/himanta-biswa-sarma-floats-crowdfunding-campaign-to-help-keep-free-vaccine-pledge-101621523804638.html

"The existing pharma companies have already started ramping up the production. Indian Companies have also placed orders for importing 6 lakh vials of Amphotericin B. We are leaving no stone unturned to smoothen the situation," the minister tweeted as the Centre asked all states and Union territories to make black fungus or mucormycosis a notifiable disease under the Epidemic Act.Mucormycosis: A rare infection being found commonly in Covid patientsAmid the raging second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic, the emergence of mucormycosis, a fungal infection which can affect the eyes and the brain, has thrown a bigger challenge to states as there has been a sudden rise in the number of cases.At Delhi's AIIMS, the number of mucormycosis cases has surpassed the three-digit mark, head of the neurology department Prof MV Padma Srivastava said on Wednesday.Make Mucormycosis a notifiable disease under epidemic act, urges CentreAs PM Modi interacted with the health ministers of several states on Thursday, Maharashtra health minister Rajesh Tope told him that at present black fungus the major concern for Maharashtra as the state is gradually recovering from the second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic with a steady decline in the positivity. But 90 people have died of mucormycosis in the state, Tope has said.

Dr Faheem Younus answersWhy mucormycosis is being considered as a bigger threat than Covid-19 nowWhile for the past year, states prepared their healthcare infrastructure to treat Covid-19, the emergence of mucormycosis caught many states unawares as states have been focussing on ramping up Covid-19 treatment so far. Mucormycosis is also not a new infection as experts have said that this infection was reported after 2003's SARS outbreak too. But this time the outbreak has been rapid and Covid-19 treatment is being partially blamed for the surge. use of steroids in Covid-19 cases, when not necessary, is weakening the immune system of the patients, while an unchecked blood sugar level is worsening the situation, experts have said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/shortage-of-black-fungus-drug-amphotericin-b-to-be-resolved-soon-says-minister-101621520914634.html
20-05-2021||India||After black fungus, reports of white fungus infections surface. What we know so far||Mucormycosis or black fungus cases in India are on a massive surge. After coronavirus disease (Covid-19), the biggest healthcare concern is the fungal infection for India presently. The Central government on Thursday urged the states and Union territories (UTs) to make black fungus a notifiable disease under the Epidemic Diseases Act, 1897. A notifiable disease requires the medical practitioners to notify the government about the disease in a prescribed format within three days or 24 hours, in case of urgency.Also read: Delhi HC asks Centre for affidavit on Amphotericin-B, an anti-black fungus drugHowever, a new threat is an emerging white fungus that is concerning medical experts. Though there has been no official confirmation about such cases, various media reports claimed Bihar has reported around four cases of white fungus, which according to the health experts is more dangerous than Mucormycosis. Director general of the Indian Council of Medical Research, Dr Balram Bhargava on Thursday said the colour of the fungus depends on its growth. Fungal infections are common when there is dampness, Dr Bhargava said, without specifically mentioning anything about white fungus.All what has been reported about white fungusWhite fungus is being suggested to be more dangerous than black fungus by health experts as it can affect other parts of the body like skin, stomach, kidney, brain, private parts and mouth besides lungs, according to the reports.Not much evidence has been found of the white fungus spreading to other states, but experts feel that it can be as virulent as the virus, as per the reports. The mortality rate of white fungus is currently unknown.The patients infected with white fungus showed Covid-like symptoms, however, were tested negative. The medical experts believe an HRCT scan may be required to trace the fungal infection, as the reports claimed.Also read: Cases of black fungus on the rise in Andhra PradeshAn HRCT scan is an additional diagnosis done in patients suffering from severe Covid-19.Much like Covid-19 and black fungus, people with low immunity, pre-existing medical issues, people with diabetes and people on or using steroids are at a high risk of contracting the infection, according to the reports.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/after-black-fungus-reports-of-white-fungus-infections-surface-what-we-know-so-far-101621515569667.html

As an Assamese, it is my humble request to Paresh Baruah to release him at the earliest,” Sarma said.ULFA-I chief responded minutes later.“I heard the CM’s responsible appeal on TV and in response, ULFA-I assured the release of Saikia in a matter of days. It should take 3-4 days for him to be reunited with his family,” Baruah told NEWSLIVE, an Assamese news channel, over phone from an undisclosed location.Saikia, a junior engineer assistant, was abducted along with two colleagues, Mohini Mohan Gogoi (junior engineer assistant) and Alakesh Saikia (junior technician), from ONGC’s workover rig site in Sivasagar district of Assam on April 21.Alakesh Saikia and Mohini Mohan Gogoi were rescued three days later by security forces from Nagaland, close to the Indo-Myanmar border, in a joint operation.On Tuesday, Baruah had confirmed that Saikia was still in the outfit’s custody and was safe.Himanta Biswa Sarma has said Saikia was being kept at a location in Myanmar close to the border with India.Chief minister Sarma said he considers reports of ULFA-I chief’s promise as a positive step. “But I will be able to give a formal response only after I hear what Baruah has said,” he said.Soon after the abduction, ULFA-I had issued a seven-point list of demands to three major oil companies, ONGC, Oil India Limited and Indian Oil Corporation Limited that included a demand for 95% quota in jobs for indigenous residents of Assam.The chief minister appeared to respond to this demand at his Press conference on Thursday, underlining that people often forget how Assam benefited due to the petroleum companies. The state earns ₹18,000 crore from the oil sector annually and anyone who wants the sector to contribute more to Assam should hold discussions with the state government which can raise it with the Centre. “As the CM, it will be my government’s task to ensure that these companies do more for the state in coming years,” he added.“If this sector is targeted, our state’s economic backbone will be broken,” said Sarma.The banned insurgent last week announced a three-month unilateral ceasefire and suspension of all operations citing the Covid-19 pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ulfai-to-released-abducted-ongc-employee-after-himanta-biswa-sarma-s-appeal-101621519424716.html
20-05-2021||India||'406 people can be infected in a month by 1 person if...': Centre on Covid-appropriate behaviour||If social distancing is not properly maintained, then one individual carrying the SARS-CoV-2 virus can infect about 406 people in a month, joint secretary of the Union health ministry Lav Agarwal said on Thursday during the press briefing of the health ministry. On the contrary, if social distancing is maintained by 75 per cent, the same person can infect around two to three people in a month, the secretary said citing studies.The numbers, cited by the ministry, is not new as this was the finding of a recent ICMR study. The current RO or R Naught for the infection is between 1.5 and 4. Taking this number as 2.5, it has been calculated that one person can infect 406 people in 30 days. R Naught is a term used to show how contagious the virus is.45 lakh Covid tests per day by June end, 3 more self-test home kits on pipeline: ICMRSocial distancing, however, is not enough if people are not wearing masks properly as a guideline published by the office of the principal scientific adviser said droplets from an infected person can be carried in the air up to 10 metres through aerosols and infect another person at a distance if that both are not wearing masks. Hence, wearing masks properly, not covering only the mouth or keeping it in the chin, is of equal importance, the ministry reminded again.So is keeping a distance of 10 meters advisable now? Replying to this question, the Indian Council of Medical Research director-general Dr Balram Bhargava said more and more things about this virus and its transmission are emerging every day. "First, it was found that the virus transmits through droplets. Now it has been found that there are microdroplets that can remain suspended in the air for at least 2-3 hours. Some studies have pointed out that microdroplets can remain in the air for 3 hours. For droplets, we recommend a distance of six feet. For micro-droplets, we recommend well ventilation so that these can be dispersed," Dr Bhargava said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/406-can-be-infected-in-a-month-if-centre-on-covid-appropriate-behaviour-101621515431132.html
20-05-2021||India||Telangana declares black fungus a notifiable disease after Centre's nudge||The Telangana government on Thursday declared Mucormycosis, commonly known as the balck fungus, a notifiable disease under the Epidemic Diseases Act 1897. The move came soon after the Union health ministry sent a directive to the states and the Union territories earlier in the day on the fungal infection.A notifiable disease is a disease that needs to be notified by medical practitioners to the government in a prescribed format within three days or in case of urgency, within 24 hours.ALSO READ: What is Mucormycosis and how deadly is it? Know everything about Black FungusAccording to the notification, all government-run and private healthcare facilities will be required to follow the guidelines for screening, diagnosis and management of Mucormycosis as issued by the Centre and the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR). The state health department also made the failure to report such cases of Mucormycosis a punishable offence.Meanwhile, state minister and TRS president K T Rama Rao took to Twitter to share a format and said that anyone requiring medicines for black fungus can send an send an official email request to the director of medical education and the superintendent of the ENT hospital at the Gandhi General Hospital, which has been designated as the nodal centre for the treatment of the condition.To all those who’ve been seeking medicines for Black Fungus/Mucormycosis, please send an email to dme@telangana.Gov.in and ent-mcrm@telangana.Gov.in in the format given below 👇You can also send the same via Twitter to @DMETELANGANA with a copy to @KTRoffice so we can follow up pic.twitter.com/e4hYHln7tJOnce the disease has been made notifiable, failure to report it is treated as a criminal offence. Black fungus is a condition seen in some patients who have recovered from coronavirus disease (Covid-19). The disease can lead to blackening or discoloration over the nose, blurred or double vision, chest pain, breathing difficulties and coughing of blood.Making a disease notifiable helps governments monitor the geographical spread of the disease and devise containment strategies. In case of highly infectious disease, a prompt notification often allows for close surveillance of the disease and gives authorities time and data to plan, monitor and prevent further spread of the disease.The black fungus is caused by the steroid administered in the treatment of Covid-19 infection.ALSO READ: Misuse of steroids major cause behind mucormycosis infection: AIIMS chiefIn the past, the Centre had declared several diseases such as AIDS, cholera, dengue, tuberculosis etc., as notifiable diseases. Although the total number of black fungus cases in the state could not be immediately verified by the Hindustan Times, according to local media the cases of the disease are being reported from Adilabad, Khammam and Rajanna Sircilla districts.Meanwhile, Andhra Pradesh has recorded cases of Mucormycosis from Visakhapatnam, Srikakulam, Guntur, West Godavari and Kurnool districts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/telangana-declares-black-fungus-a-notifiable-disease-after-centre-s-nudge-101621514441511.html

Only 14 per cent of the people wear the mask correctly, the ministry said citing a study conducted in 25 cities, which was reported by the media earlier.The ministry said that of half the population who wear a mask, 64 per cent of them cover the mouth but not nose, 20 per cent of them wear it on the chin, two per cent have the mask on the neck and only 14 per cent wear it correctly covering the nose, mouth, chin and with a clip on the nose.Also read: Covid self-testing kit to be available in market by end of next week"Half of India isn't wearing a mask!

In a document titled 'Stop the Transmission, Crush the Pandemic,' the government issued guidelines on how to contain the spread of the virus as it said aerosols can be carried in the air up to a distance of 10 meters.The SARS-CoV-2 virus transmits majorly through aerosol and droplets, which makes wearing a mask very important to curtail its spread. "The virus is released in the saliva and nasal discharge of an infected person through exhalation, talking, speaking, singing, laughing, coughing, and sneezing etc," the document read.As per the advisory, the mask should fit snugly on the face leaving no air gaps around the nose and chin, cloth masks should be washed and sun-dried every day.Click here for complete coverage of Covid-19The government highly recommended 'double masking' to prevent transmission. For double masking, one should wear a surgical mask and another tight-fitting cloth mask over it. In case the surgical mask is not available then one is recommended to wear two cotton masks together."Ideally the surgical mask should be used only once, but when pairing, you can use it up to 5 times by leaving it in a dry place for 7 days after one use (ideally give it some sun exposure) and then reuse as a double layer," the government advised, adding that the surgical masks should never be washed.India on Thursday reported 276,110 new Covid-19 infections, and a drop in daily deaths as 3,874 people succumbed to the virus in the last 24 hours, according to the official data.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid19-half-the-indian-population-do-not-wear-mask-says-govt-101621512213896.html
20-05-2021||India||Meeting with PM casual, ‘sat like puppets’ and were not allowed to speak: Mamata||West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee on Thursday described Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s meeting with chief ministers and district magistrates of 10 states as “casual and super flop” and said they “sat like puppets” and “none was allowed to say a single word”.“We felt insulted. Only four to five district magistrates, mostly from BJP [Bharatiya Janata Party]-ruled states, were allowed to speak. The meeting ended with Prime Minister’s speech in which he claimed that Covid-19 cases were going down,” said Banerjee. She claimed there was no discussion on the supply of vaccines, medicines, and oxygen or the black fungus, which has emerged as one of the major Covid-19 complications.BJP leader Suvendu Adhikari hit out at Banerjee over her comments and said she has once again shown “her total disinterest” in administration while pointing out the meeting was convened to discuss grassroots level practices to fight the pandemic. “True to her style, she has politicised a meeting Hon’ble PM @narendramodi held with District Officials, where grassroots level practices to fight Covid-19 were being discussed,” tweeted Adhikari, who is also the leader of Opposition in West Bengal assembly. He added five of the seven district officials, who spoke at the meeting belonged to non-BJP ruled states--Chhattisgarh, Kerala, Maharashtra, Rajasthan, and Andhra Pradesh.In his address, Modi said India’s battle against Covid-19 requires continuous change and up-gradation of plans and innovations while cautioning it will not be over if the virus remains even in a small area of the country. He said there is more concern now about young people and children.Also Read | Mamata writes to PM Modi for Covid-19 vaccines for state, central govt employeesModi said the vaccine supplies would be strengthened and emphasised the need to save the villages as he sought more ideas and new practices to tackle the pandemic. He described the virus as “dhurt bahurupiya”, while referring to its mutations. “Every phase of the pandemic has taught us that constant change, up-gradation, and constant innovation is key to fight the pandemic. This virus is famous for changing itself through mutations. It is like a bahurupia and it is clever as well. So, our strategies and plans should also be dynamic,” he said.Modi commended the Union health ministry’s plan of providing vaccine stocks that will last 15 days and called for a need for a vaccination calendar. He added more transparency in the supply of vaccines will make the inoculation campaign easier.In his earlier meeting with district administrators on Tuesday, Modi called them the “field commanders” in the fight against the pandemic and spoke about their determination when they cleared the civil services exams. “You solved problems with your own abilities. Today, you are facing the toughest test and now, you are using your abilities to solve even the smallest problems of your district.”Modi said sensitivity and patience were essential in this battle. He called earning people’s trust the key to success. Modi said the field experience was more valuable than intellectual debate. As infections have been spreading in smaller cities and rural areas, Modi urged the district administrators to reach out to the people and convince them to follow Covid-appropriate behaviour to curb the spread. “Your presence, your speeches can remove fear among people.”Modi urged the magistrates to find unique solutions to their local problems and to do a separate analysis of the spread of the virus in tier two and three cities. He expressed confidence that a solution to check the virus from spreading in the rural areas can be found. “My experience says that if you convey the right things at the right time, people will follow religiously.”Also Read | Sonia Gandhi writes to PM, seeks free education for kids orphaned by CovidAfter the meeting, Banerjee in Kolkata referred to black fungus and said it emerged from Surat in Gujarat and that Rajasthan has already declared it as an epidemic. She added four cases of the disease have been detected in West Bengal and blamed the Centre for failing to supply medicines to treat it. Banerjee said the Centre was not providing vaccines to her state and as a result, vaccination has slowed down in West Bengal.Banerjee separately wrote to Modi demanding more vaccines. “Earlier we had demanded three crore [30 million] vaccines. Now we are demanding 8.6 crore [over 86 million] doses so that we can vaccinate all citizens. If we get the vaccines, we can vaccinate every citizen within three months. But if we adopt his [Modi] formula it may take 10 years to vaccinate all,” she said.Banerjee expressed doubts over the gap prescribed between two doses of Covid-19 vaccines. She questioned whether the gap was being increased to cover up for the scarcity of vaccines. “We are running a state. But Delhi’s shahenshah [emperor] is not even looking at us and just saying sab thik hai [everything is fine]. When representatives of Uttar Pradesh spoke at the meeting, the Prime Minister said ‘bahut badiya chal raha hai [it is going very well]’, without questioning why corpses were being dumped into the river,” she said.Banerjee was referring to corpses fished out the Ganga in Bihar’s Buxar district and Ghazipur in neighbouring Uttar Pradesh. The recovery of the bodies triggered probes in both states and speculation that they belonged to Covid patients. More dead bodies were later found in Uttar Pradesh’s Unnao.Banerjee also lashed out at the BJP-led Central government over the arrest of her two cabinet ministers, including Firhad Hakim who was heading the Covid-19 task force, and one legislator. The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) arrested them on charges of bribery on Monday in connection with the 2016 Narada sting operation. They are now in judicial custody.“I am not commenting on the case as it is sub-judice. Kolkata’s [outgoing] mayor [Hakim] used to work in the field round the clock. Now we have to do the job in another way. They [BJP-led Centre] can do vendetta politics [even] during the time of Covid-19,” said Banerjee.Banerjee returned to power in the state this month after one of the most keenly contested elections in which Modi and Union home minister Amit Shah led the BJP from the front. Her Trinamool Congress (TMC) has linked the arrested in the Narda case to BJP’s political vendetta driven by its loss of the assembly polls.The CBI on Wednesday named Banerjee, law minister Moloy Ghatak, and lawmaker Kalyan Banerjee as respondents in its plea to transfer the Narada case out of the state. It claimed violent protests orchestrated by the TMC against the arrests have hampered its probe and intimidated lower courts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/meeting-with-pm-casual-sat-like-puppets-and-were-not-allowed-to-speakmamata-101621514384024.html

The unnamed Indian national’s death was confirmed by New Zealand foreign minister Nanaia Mahuta, who said she was “deeply saddened” to learn of his passing. “The deceased joined the high commission in 1986 during the time that Sir Edmund Hillary was our high commissioner to India, and New Zealand truly values the support he gave to our country,” she said. “New Zealand truly values the support, the work that he gave to subsequent heads of mission, New Zealand staff and our country,” she told reporters. She added the staff member had died in an Indian hospital on May 16. Mahuta also confirmed to the media that an appeal for oxygen by the high commission on Twitter on May 2 was for the same staff member. “While they used the wrong channels, they did as much as they could to ensure that his care could be provided for...The intent was legitimate, which was to secure oxygen for this person,” she said. Six more local staff members of the New Zealand mission were infected by the Coronavirus, though three of them subsequently tested negative. Also Read | A broken polity, a ghost StateThere was no immediate word from Indian officials on the development.The New Zealand high commission had apologised for breaching diplomatic protocol through its tweet and deleted it after a war of words broke out between the government and the opposition Congress party over the supply of oxygen to foreign missions by the Youth Congress. The youth wing of the Congress has played a key role in responding to urgent requests for medical equipment and supplies. The mission had tagged the Youth Congress and its president BV Srinivas in the deleted tweet, which said: “Could you please help with oxygen cylinder urgently at the New Zealand High Commission? Thank you.” In a subsequent tweet, the mission said: “We are trying all sources to arrange for oxygen cylinders urgently and our appeal has unfortunately been misinterpreted, for which we are sorry.” External affairs minister S Jaishankar had accused the Congress of indulging in “cheap publicity” and the foreign ministry had said that foreign missions should not “hoard essential supplies, including oxygen”. At the time, New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern had said the appeal on Twitter for oxygen was inappropriate and that the mission should have used “normal channels and protocols”. But she also acknowledged that oxygen was needed for a “very unwell” Indian staff member and ruled out disciplinary action.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/local-staff-member-of-new-zealand-mission-dies-after-contracting-covid19-101621513783880.html

As of now, the health infrastructure has the capacity of conducting around 12-13 lakh RTPCR tests and 17 lakh rapid antigen tests per day. Though the workforce of testing laboratories has been hit by the infection, labs are working round the clock to meet the increased testing demand, Dr Bhargava said.Watch: Now, rapid Covid-19 testing at home with CoviSelf: All you need to knowSonia Gandhi writes to PM, seeks free education for kids orphaned by CovidExplaining the continuous increase in the number of tests, Dr Bhargava said if the case positivity rates of April and May are compared, then there has been a sharp fall as between May 13 and May 19, the weekly positivity rate of Covid-19 was 15 per cent. But this decline is being reported despite a sharp increase in the number of tests. From about eight lakh tests per day in February, March, India reported more than 20 lakh tests on May 18 and 19, the ICMR chief said adding that by the end of this month, there will be 25 lakh tests every day and 45 lakh tests by the end of June. "Unless the positivity rate comes down to 5 per cent, the testing number will go up," he said.On doctors already prescribing DRDO's 2-DG for Covid-19 treatment, Dr Bhargava said it can be written on prescriptions as this is not a new drug. "It is an old drug meant for cancer treatment.

20-05-2021||India||Cases of black fungus on the rise in Andhra Pradesh||Andhra Pradesh is reporting a rising cases of Mucormycosis, or black fungus, at a time when the second wave of coronavirus disease (Covid-19) cases are already ravaging the state. As many as 200 cases of Mucormycosis have been detected in districts as such Nellore, Krishna, West Godavari, Visakhapatnam, Chitoor and Anantapur. A private hospital in Guntur has recorded 50 cases of black fungus.READ MORE: Make Mucormycosis a notifiable disease under epidemic act, urges CentreThe number of cases has risen to hundreds with the infection showing up among people who have recovered from Covid-19. Black fungus is most commonly seen in people with diabetes. People have been queuing up at hospitals with symptoms such as red eyes and swollen cheeks.However, some doctors predict that this could likely be the side effects of Covid-19 medication. The infection is rare but not new and caused by exposure to mucor moulds found in soil, plants, manure, and decaying fruits and vegetables.ALSO READ: What is Mucormycosis and how deadly is it? Know everything about Black FungusDoctors pointed out that the steroids being prescribed for Covid-19 patients to strengthen their respiratory system are affecting the good bacteria in the body, making them vulnerable to the black fungal infection.Presently, 80% of the Covid-19 patients are being given steroids, which could lead to black fungus infection. This is more common among those with diabetes whose system weakens much more than those without the condition after a Covid-19 attack. Doctors are specifically advising diabetics to be extra cautious and minimise the use of anti-viral drugs.Meanwhile, the Centre is examining ways to procure Amphotericin-B, an anti-fungal medication which can help stop the spread of black fungus in the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cases-of-black-fungus-on-the-rise-in-andhra-pradesh-101621508136213.html
20-05-2021||India||Cyclone Tauktae maintained intensity even after landfall, affected hit 9 states||Tauktae is among the few cyclones that didn’t lose steam even after landfall. On May 17 evening, Tauktae made landfall in Gujarat but it maintained its intensity till late May 18 evening, bringing rain over many parts of Gujarat and Rajasthan.Then, as a depression over southeast Rajasthan it interacted with a western disturbance over the western Himalayan region, bringing widespread and long spells of rain over the entire northwest India.Extremely severe cyclonic ttorm, Tauktae, which started its journey as a depression over Lakshadweep area on May 14, degenerated into a low-pressure area only on Thursday over east Rajasthan. During its lifetime, Tauktae impacted Kerala, Karnataka, Goa, Maharashtra, Gujarat, Rajasthan, Haryana, Uttarakhand, and Delhi.Delhi received the highest-ever rainfall of 119.3 mm in May for the first time since 1951, India Meteorological Department (IMD) said on Thursday.“Tauktae has maintained energy...It did not degenerate which is uncommon. Very severe cyclone Vayu, which also developed over Arabian Sea in 2019, had a long life over the ocean. It formed on May 10 and sustained till May 18. What is unique about Tauktae that is it was a cyclonic storm over land for more than a day,” said Sunitha Devi, in charge, cyclones, at IMD.Also Read | ‘No option but to jump into the sea’: Survivors recount harrowing escape“Tauktae sustained as a cyclone for 24 hours over Gujarat for a long time even after landfall and then it started interacting with a western disturbance which was affecting the western Himalayan region. It was already an extremely severe storm. The two systems supported each other. Even now, its remnants haven’t degenerated. Something similar had happened during the Uttarakhand floods of 2013. A low-pressure area had formed over Bay of Bengal which was over west Uttar Pradesh and started interacting with mid latitude westerlies and then floods started,” explained M Mohapatra, director general, IMD.“I don’t know if we should call this long life of Tauktae rare but this can happen whenever a tropical system interacts with westerlies. The good thing is the showers over Delhi were continuous and not a downpour in a couple of hours. So there has been some run-off. In fact, ground water aquifers have recharged as this is a dry season,” Mohapatra added.Experts said the cyclone’s long life over land could be because of the intensity it had already gained over ocean. “This might be due to two reasons. One, the cyclone was of very severe intensity when it had landfall and had already acquired its supply of heat and moisture from the Arabian Sea. Second, north India might have been humid (and warm since it’s summer) considering the fact that there was an unusual amount of rainfall prior to the cyclone itself. These are possibilities and need in-depth research to point out the reasons,” said Matthew Roxy Koll, a climate scientist at the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology.“Another reason is that the upper-level winds are eastward. So that helped the cyclone and the rains to move further eastward,” he added.Meanwhile, southwest monsoon is very likely to advance over south Andaman Sea and adjoining southeast Bay of Bengal around May 21, one day in advance in association with the strengthening and deepening of southwesterly winds over the region.A low-pressure area is very likely to form over north Andaman Sea and adjoining eastcentral Bay of Bengal around May 22. It is very likely to intensify into a Cyclonic storm Yaas by May 24. It would move northwestwards and reach near Odisha- West Bengal coasts around May 26 morning.“We cannot rule out Amphan-like intensification. The only good thing is that models as of now are showing that the system is moving very fast over the ocean. Its intensification will be restricted if its time over the sea is less. But if there is slow movement of the cyclone, it can intensify to very severe or higher category,” Sunitha Devi said on Wednesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tauktae-maintained-intensity-even-after-landfall-affected-hit-nine-states-101621509103481.html
20-05-2021||India||Reduced to a rubber stamp, says Srinagar DDC chairman Aftab Malik||Aftab Malik, the Jammu and Kashmir Apni Party leader and chairman of Srinagar’s district development council (DDC), on Thursday complained that they had been reduced to “rubber stamps” and asked the government to involve the elected representatives in the battle against the coronavirus pandemic.Malik was elected to the 14-member council in Srinagar, one of the 20 councils set up as the third tier of the panchayati raj system in the union territory. The eight-phase election to the DDCs in November-December 2020 was described as a “new chapter” in Jammu and Kashmir’s history. Aftab Malik said it was not even close.“In the last five months, neither I nor my members have been able to do a single developmental work. I and my members feel that we are just mere rubber stamps,” Aftab Malik said, complaining that he was mostly confined to a room at Srinagar’s circuit house, his new home due to security considerations.“Even the people who came out to vote for me or my DDC members last year feel we can’t do anything for them, which hurts us,” said Malik.Malik said Srinagar was reporting the maximum number of Covid-19 cases and deaths in Jammu and Kashmir, but neither he or his DDC members were involved in the fight against Covid-19. On Wednesday evening, Srinagar had 7,328 active Covid cases and reported a total of 709 deaths.“The officials are doing everything of their own and don’t feel that representatives of the people need to be involved… nobody asks us (for our views) or bothers to involve us,” he said, adding that the DDC had been left to fend for themselves and struggle to make payments even for fuel or the circuit house.Tariq Ahmad, director in the rural development department, said it was wrong to say that the DDCs weren’t involved and panchayati raj institutions are closely involved in the fight against Covid at the panchayat levels.The newly-elected district development councils did get off to a rocky start when the freshly-elected members across party lines boycotted a training programme organised by the government to demand what they called a “dignified monthly honorarium” and a better status in the warrant of precedence.In April, the government did make changes to the warrant of precedence to place the DDC chairman on par with ministers of state. But Malik said it didn’t bring about any real difference on the ground.“Since the Covid outbreak (second wave), I was called for just one meeting but it was a last-minute invitation. So I declined to attend,” he said.The DDC chairman, who has been assigned three security guards, said he hardly went to his designated office since it was about 20 km from Srinagar city; “too far for other members of the council to travel”.Malik said his only consolation is that Deputy Commissioner Srinagar picks his phone.The rural development department, which is responsible for DDCs, “is our parent department but the officials never bother to inform us where the money for developmental projects is.”Rural development department’s Tariq Ahmad said funds for the district development councils come from the capital expenditure budget which is prepared by respective deputy commissioners. “Every council is supposed to get ₹10 crore through CAPEX budget. I am not aware why the Srinagar DDC hasn’t got the money released yet.”“Even the new setups for Covid which will come up in every panchayat will get the money from the panchayat funds only,” he said, a reference to Lt Governor Manoj Sinha’s direction to set up five Covid beds including one with oxygen in every panchayat.“Directed DCs & Health Department to ensure 5-bedded Covid Care Centre in every Panchayat of J&K as many households may not have the option for isolation of Covid positive patients in their own residence. Each Centre to have One Oxygen-Supported Bed for immediate patient care,” Sinha’s office said in a tweet.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/reduced-to-a-rubber-stamp-says-srinagar-ddc-chairman-aftab-malik-101621506825159.html

Governor Arif Mohammad Khan administered the oath in the swearing-in ceremony which the Kerala high court allowed on the condition of only 500 invitees.Vijayan's association with the Communist Paty of India Marxist goes back a long way as the 76-year-old started as a youth leader while he was studying at Government Brennen College.In 1964, he joined the Communist Party, eventually became Kannur district secretary of Kerala Students' Federation (KSF), which became the Students Federation of India (SFI). He was arrested in 1975, during the Emergency. In 2002, he was elected to the politburo.Thiruvananthapuram: 20 ministers of the new Kerala cabinet, including NCP's AK Saseendran, Indian National League's (INL) Ahammad Devarkovil, R Bindu and PA Mohammed Riyas, take oath along with CM Pinarayi Vijayan. pic.twitter.com/Zp5FWSRBjFVijayan's rising popularity in the last year of the pandemic came under scrutiny following the party's decision to drop KK Shailaja — the former health minister — from the cabinet, as it was interpreted as a race of popularity between Vijayan and Shailaja. Commenting on this, Vijayan said it was the party's decision to not include anyone for two consecutive terms. On continuing as the CM for the two consecutive terms, he said, "I am continuing as CM as the party asked me to."Except for the CM face, all ministers of the new cabinet will be fresh faces, a blend of youngsters and veterans, CPI(M) leader AN Shamseer has said.In a departure from Kerala's political tradition in which the state switches between LDF and UDF, the CPM-led Left Democratic Front retained power winning 99 seats against UDF's 41.Vijayan has also been subjected to criticism as his son-in-law Mohammad Riyas is getting a berth in the new cabinet.

20-05-2021||India||'Infection transmission risk is much lower in outdoor areas': Key points from govt advisory on Covid-19||Principal scientific adviser to the government of India on Thursday released a guideline which listed things to follow in order to check the spread of the raging Covid-19 pandemic which has claimed more than 287,000 lives in the country so far.In the advisory, the role of face masks, social distancing and sanitisation was highlighted as crucial to beat Covid-19. It also said that the well-ventilated spaces play a crucial role in diluting the Covid-19 viral load of infected air and help in decreasing the risk of transmission from one infected person to the other.India recorded 276,110 new cases of the Covid-19 in a 24-hour span, the Union health ministry data showed on Thursday morning. The total tally of the viral infection now stands at 25,772,440.Here are the key points from the advisory:1) Aerosols, one of the key transmission modes of the Sars-CoV-2, can travel in the air up to 10 meters. The advisory also stated that the droplets fall within 2 meters from an infected person.2) Even one infected person showing no symptoms can release enough droplets to create a “viral load” that can infect several others.3) Infection transmission risk is much lower in outdoor areas as virus particles get quickly dispersed in the air. Meanwhile, in closed un-ventilated spaces, droplets and aerosols become quickly concentrated and greatly increase the risk of transmission to people in the area.4) Symptoms can take up to two weeks to appear in an infected person, during which time they may continue to transmit the virus to others. Some people never show symptoms and still transmit the virus.5) These virus-laden droplets can survive on non-porous surfaces such as glass, plastic and stainless steel for a fairly long time. Hence the advisory asked for frequent cleaning of high contact point6s such as door handles, light switches, tables, chairs and the floor with disinfectants, like bleach and phenyl. It can remove the virus contamination from surfaces.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/infection-transmission-risk-is-much-lower-in-outdoor-areas-key-points-from-govt-advisory-on-covid19-101621503159537.html
20-05-2021||India||Covid underscored need for reliable supply chain: Jaishankar at Future of Asia meet||The global Covid-19 crisis has highlighted the importance of strategic autonomy for decision-making by nations and the need for reliable supply chains that won’t be affected by events such as pandemics, external affairs minister S Jaishankar said on Thursday. Addressing the Future of Asia conference organised by Nikkei, Jaishankar said India is working to “strengthen and de-risk the global economy” through partnerships such as the Supply Chain Resilience Initiative with Japan and Australia. “We in India are going through a particularly difficult situation right now. Understandably, the world’s attention is focused primarily on the public health response...What perhaps is yet to be fully comprehended is [the pandemic’s] long-term impact on the global order, including on the future of Asia,” he said. The Covid-19 crisis has underscored the value of trust and transparency and importance of reliable supply chains, while also heightening risk aversion and encouraging strategic autonomy to address over-dependence, he added. Jaishankar said countries around the world are now focused on creating greater global capacities so that pandemic-scale challenges can be faced effectively, and establishing resilient supply chains. “Covid-19 has certainly triggered debates on issues like supply chains, global governance, social responsibility and even ethics,” he said. In an apparent reference to China’s dominance of supply chains, the minister said parts of the world that were previously more sanguine about globalisation have begun attaching more importance to strategic autonomy. “The efficiency of others may have strengthened bottom-lines in good times; they are now seen as too vulnerable in difficult ones. Disruptions also raised natural concerns about long-term reliability and resilience. In many areas, it became apparent that the global economy was dangerously dependent on specific production centres,” he said.Also Read | ‘Majority of 80 million jabs to be routed via Covax’: US official“The nature of the Covid experience has also brought to fore concerns of trust and transparency. Opacity can no longer be overlooked; it has real implications for the rest of the world. It was bad enough to be confronted with shortages and disruptions; worse that they could become pressure points,” he added. India can help “de-risk” the global economy through more effective partnerships, and it is working with Japan and Australia on the Supply Chain Resilience Initiative. “Where the Quad arrangement that also involves the US is concerned, its agenda today covers vaccine collaboration, critical and emerging technologies, semi-conductors, supply chains, critical materials and of course connectivity,” he said. Recent summits with the European Union and the UK had witnessed advances towards free trade pacts, he noted. India has also taken steps to improve its national capacities, including reforms such as production-linked incentive (PLI) schemes to encourage manufacturing in 13 sectors such as mobiles, APIs for pharmaceuticals, medical devices, electronic products, networking products, food items and auto components. “By creating a level-playing field and encouraging a component eco-system, it will integrate India deeper into the global supply chain,” Jaishankar said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-underscored-need-for-reliable-supply-chain-jaishankar-at-future-of-asia-meet-101621503763051.html

Terming the meeting a "superflop," Banerjee said that chief ministers were not allowed to speak in the meeting which was also attended by 54 district magistrates of 10 states with high Covid-19 caseload.Banerjee also said that the chief ministers "feel humiliated" as they were reduced to puppets.Earlier in the day, PM Modi held an interaction with district officials along with the respective chief ministers to discuss Covid-19 management strategy as the deadly virus seems to be spreading more in the rural areas. During the meeting, PM Modi spoke about developing a strategy based on the local experiences of the districts. He also said the infection was now a cause of concern for young people and children.PM Modi will interact with the district magistrates and field officials of 10 States-Chhattisgarh, Haryana, Kerala, Maharashtra, Odisha, Puducherry, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal, Andhra Pradesh.On May 18 as well, PM Modi had interacted with 46 district magistrates from nine states virtually.West Bengal chief minister's participation at the high-level meet comes after several such meetings being missed by her over the past few months.On April 8, Banerjee who is known for her vocal criticism of the Centre, reportedly skipped a meeting called by PM Modi to discuss the Covid-19 situation in the state. On March 17 as well, She skipped the meeting of chief ministers chaired by the Prime Minister over growing cases of Covid-19 and the vaccination drive.According to an ANI report, she has also skipped several meetings convened by Niti Aayog over the past few years.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-s-covid-19-meeting-super-flop-feel-humiliated-mamata-banerjee-101621502874078.html
20-05-2021||India||Covid self-testing kit to be available in market by end of next week, says Pune-based manufacturer||CoviSelf, the first self-testing home kit for Covid testing, will be available in the market by the end of next week, the director of Pune's MyLab Discovery Solutions, Sujjet Jain, told news agency ANI. This is the first home kit to have got the approval of the Indian Council of Medical Research for home testing in the country. The manufacturer aims at reaching 90 per cent of the pin codes in India, while the kit will also be available for online purchase. "It will be available by end of next week in more than 7 lakh pharmacies & our online pharmacy partners across India," Jain said.The kit is priced at ₹250, including taxes and will come with a detailed manual on how to conduct the test at home, without the help of any medical practitioner. Since it is a Rapid Antigen Test, it will only require nasal swab. While the do-it-yourself test will take two minutes, the result will come within 15 minutes. A positive result, however, may come sooner than that. Any result coming after 20 minutes will be considered invalid, the manufacturer's video manual said.The concept of self-testing is not new as several countries have already allowed such kits for home use for early detection. As India has been battling with the second wave of the pandemic since March-April, the testing facilities have also become overburdened resulting in a longer wait for results.While the ICMR has already notified that people with Covid symptoms can be considered as Covid suspects and be subjected to treatment without waiting for the results, this home testing kit will help in quick detections.Apprehending indiscriminate use, the ICMR has made it clear that not everyone should opt for this test. Only those with symptoms and those who have come in contact with positive cases are advised to take this home testing.Mylab's current production capacity is 70 lakh tests per week and, within 14 days, the firm plans to increase the capacity to one crore test kits per week.A regular laboratory RAT test costs around ₹400 (approx) and an RT-PCR test costs around ₹800 (approx).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-self-testing-kit-to-be-available-in-market-by-next-week-says-manufacturer-101621502027860.html

20-05-2021||India||PM Narendra Modi asks for constant upgradation of ideas to defeat Covid-19||India’s battle against the Coved-19 pandemic requires continuous change, upgradation and innovations, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on Thursday while cautioning district-level administrators that the fight against the pandemic will be over only when it is wiped out from even the smallest area. He also said the infection was now a cause of concern for young people and children.The PM was confident that vaccine supplies will be strengthened and emphasised “we have to save our villages” as he sought more ideas and new practices to tackle the virus. Modi also described the virus as a “Dhurt Bahurupiya”, referring to its mutations.Addressing a virtual meeting of district magistrates, Modi said, “Every phase of the pandemic has taught us that constant change, upgradation and constant innovation is the key to fighting the pandemic. This virus is famous for changing itself through mutation. It is like a bahurupia and it is clever as well. So, our strategies and plans should also be dynamic.”The PM hailed the health ministry’s plan for providing the vaccine supply schedule 15 days in advance and said a vaccination calendar and more transparency in its supply would make the inoculation campaign easier.On Tuesday, during a similar interaction, the PM described the local administration officials as the “field commanders” in the fight against the Covid-19 pandemic. In the latest meeting, Modi reminded the district magistrates how they had prepared for the civil service exams. “You showed determination when you appeared for the exam. You solved problems with your own abilities. Today, you are facing the toughest test and now, you are using your abilities to solve even the smallest problems of your district.”Modi reminded that sensitivities and patience are essential in this battle and the “biggest jaributi (medicinal herbal) of success is earning people’s trust. He sought their ideas and quipped that field experience is more valuable than intellectual debate.As Covid cases are rapidly spreading to smaller cities and rural belts, Modi urged the district administrators to reach out to the people and convince them to follow Covid-appropriate behaviour to curb the infection. “Your presence, your speeches can remove fear among people. We have to send message to the villages that we have to save our villages.”The district magistrates were also urged to find unique solutions to their local problems and to do a separate analysis of the spread of virus in Tier two and Tier three cities. Modi was confident that the solution to check the virus from spreading in the rural areas can be found and told the administrators, “My experience says that if you convey the right things at the right time, people will follow religiously.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-narendra-modi-asks-for-constant-upgradation-of-ideas-to-defeat-covid19-101621499805037.html

The "easy to follow guidelines" highlight the role of masks, social distancing, sanitation and ventilation in the country's fight against Covid-19, according to a release issued by the office of the principal scientific adviser to the government.Droplets fall within 2 meters from an infected person: Office of Principal Scientific Adviser to GoI pic.twitter.com/rxTsgl5nbQThrowing light on how well-ventilated spaces can reduce the risk of transmission from one infected person to the other, the guidelines say, "Just as smells can be diluted from the air through opening windows and doors and using exhaust systems, ventilating spaces with improved directional air flow decreases the accumulated viral land in the air, reducing the risk of transmission."Click here for full Covid-19 coverageIt is important to remember that those with no symptoms could also spread the virus, the guidelines said. Saliva and nasal discharge in the form of droplets and aerosols are the primary mode of transmission of the virus from an infected person, it added. To prevent this from happening, everyone should continue to wear double masks as these droplets are transmitted while exhaling, talking, speaking, singing, laughing, coughing, sneezing etc."Droplets fall within 2 meters from an infected person and aerosols can be carried in the air up to 10 meters," the government said.The virus infects human hosts, where it can multiply, and in the absence of the host, it cannot survive, the government said. "Stopping the transmission of the virus from a person to another person will decrease the infection rate of the disease to a level where it can eventually die. This can be achieved only with the support and cooperation of individuals, communities, local bodies and authorities. Use of masks, ventilation, distancing, and sanitation, the battle against the virus can be won," it added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/aerosols-from-covid-19-infected-person-can-travel-in-air-upto-10-metres-govt-101621495587388.html

They belonged to Samnathanpettai in Nagapattinam district. The group ventured into the sea from Kochi on April 29 and while returning in the early hours of May 14, were caught in the storm and went missing.Tamil Nadu fisheries minister Anitha R Radhakrishnan on Tuesday visited the families of the nine fishermen and handed over ₹50,000 to each member of the family as financial assistance.Cyclone Tauktae unleashed waves of up to 7.6 metres as it moved along India's western coast before hitting the states of Maharashtra and Gujarat over the past two days. It left a trail of destruction that killed dozens of people, authorities said.Among those killed are those present on an oilfield accommodation barge. With 261 people on board, the barge sank after the storm smashed into the Bombay High oilfield near Mumbai, where India's biggest offshore oil rigs are located.The navy said 186 people have been rescued from the barge contracted to state-run energy explorer Oil and Natural Gas Corp.Prime Minister Narendra Modi conducted an aerial survey of the damage in Gujarat and announced a financial package of ₹1,000 crore to carry out "immediate relief activities".Cyclone Tauktae has weakened since making landfall in Gujarat on Monday with gusts of up to 210 kph (130 mph) and is expected to lose strength overnight, India Meteorological Department (IMD) officials said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/palaniswami-urges-pm-modi-to-ask-navy-to-search-for-9-missing-tn-fishermen-101621497219576.html

20-05-2021||India||‘Covid active cases declining but…’: PM Modi sounds a note of caution||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday laid emphasis on the Covid-19 management strategy based on the local experiences as he interacted with district officials of 10 states reporting high caseload via virtual conference. Speaking at the meeting, the Prime Minister said, "If Covid-19 can mutate, so should our fighting strategies. In the midst of new challenges, we need new strategies and solutions. It becomes important to use local experiences and we need to work together as a country."Lauding 54 district magistrates in the 10 states for their covid-19 management work, PM Modi highlighted that the active cases have started coming down in the country. He, however, said that challenges will remain as long as the virus is present even on a minor scale."In these one and a half years, you have experienced that as long as this infection is present even on the minor scale, the challenge remains," said PM Modi.He also addressed the topic of vaccine wastage and said, "Wastage of a single vaccine means not being able to provide the necessary protective cover to one life. Therefore, it is necessary to stop vaccine waste."PM Modi asked district magistrates to prioritise making life easier for their people by providing free ration and other essential supplies. "Along with saving lives, our priority is the ease of living of every person," he said, adding, "There should be facilities for free ration for the poor, other essential supplies, black marketing should be stopped, all these are also necessary to win this fight, and it is also necessary to move forward."After witnessing an unprecedented spike of 400,000 cases a day, India is seeing a steady decline in the daily cases of infection.

But now, the focus of the government has shifted to rural areas, which are reporting a surge in the number of Covid-19 cases. The government recently released guidelines for controlling the spread of the infection in these areas.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-active-cases-declining-but-pm-modi-sounds-a-note-of-caution-101621495908475.html

20-05-2021||India||India can help change global supply chains: Foreign minister Jaishankar||Union minister of external affairs S Jaishankar on Thursday spoke on shaping the post-coronavirus era with a specific relevance to the role that Asia would play at the 26th ‘Future of Asia’ Conference organized by Nikkei.He said among other things coronavirus disease (Covid-19) has reshaped the world by changing the perceptions and calculations of nations about each other and the world by bringing out the value of trust and transparency and the importance of reliable supply chains."It has heightened the risk aversion in a world now more insecure and encouraged strategic autonomy to address over-dependence by focusing on the need to create greater global capacities so that pandemic-scale challenges are more effectively met," the minister said."What we will now have to conceptualize is re-engineering the way the world works to prepare for and mitigate such cataclysmic events. Covid-19 has certainly triggered debates on issues like supply chains, global governance, social responsibility and even ethics. But for many of us gathered here today, it equally encourages an objective assessment of the contemporary world so that we are better prepared for tomorrow," he further said.The foreign minister said making that happen requires decisions, initiatives and consultations at many levels. "India, on its part, can help strengthen and de-risk the global economy through more effective partnerships. With Japan and Australia, we are working on a supply chain resilience initiative. Where the Quad arrangement that also involves the US is concerned, its agenda today covers vaccine collaboration, critical and emerging technologies, semi-conductors, supply chains, critical materials and connectivity, amongst others. Recent Indian summits with the European Union and the United Kingdom, that saw advancement on FTAs, are also noteworthy in that regard," he said.The minister outlined that better international cooperation can also be facilitated by improved national capacities."If India is to make a real contribution to Asian and global economic recovery, it can start by helping itself more. Even while the Covid-19 was ongoing last year, bold reforms were undertaken in industry, agriculture, labour and education. Perhaps most relevant to this audience are the production-linked incentive (PLI) schemes to attract manufacturing in 13 sectors: mobiles and electronic components, KSM and APIs for pharmaceuticals, medical devices, electronic and technology products, drugs, telecom and networking products, food products, white goods, high efficiency solar PV models, auto and auto components, ACC battery, textile products and speciality steel."The minister further said that India aims to make manufacturing in India globally competitive by removing sectoral disabilities, creating economies of scale and ensuring efficiencies. "By creating a level-playing field and encouraging a component eco-system, it will integrate India deeper into the global supply chain. Already, the global response to the PLI initiative has been strong. Coupled with an improvement in India’s position in the World Bank’s Ease of Doing Business rankings – 63 (2020) from 142 (2014) – it would enhance our economic relevance," he added.The foreign minister also reiterated India's renewable energy target of 450GW by 2030. "As one of the few G20 economies adhering to its Paris commitments, India's 15% energy efficiency savings, shift to LED lighting with 367 million bulbs, moving 80 million households from biomass to LPG cooking and being among the top three nations to expand forest cover in the last decade are examples of seriousness," Jaishankar outlined at the gathering.In ensuring economic recovery, Indo-Japan relations have a notable role, even beyond Asia, the minister said, adding that New Delhi's partnership is seen as among the most natural in the region."Japan is a valuable partner in the national campaigns and is consistently supportive of our infrastructure development. In fact, Japanese-supported projects are among the most successful infrastructure examples, most recent examples being the Delhi-Mumbai Industrial Corridor and the Dedicated Western Freight Corridor. Its long-standing FDI footprint in India is steadily expanding, covering 1455 companies as of 2021, more than half in manufacturing. New industrial collaborations are in the making even as we speak. Its contribution in skills enhancements is visible in 16 Japan-India Institutes for Manufacturing and 5 Japan Endowed Courses," the minister added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-can-help-change-global-supply-chains-foreign-minister-jaishankar-101621487033404.html
20-05-2021||India||Rising cases, overstretched health infra: TN struggles to battle 2nd Covid wave||On May 19, Tamil Nadu reported 35,875 new Covid-19 cases — the highest in terms of daily count in India. The state’s active cases crossed 200,000 on May 15. While the Covid-19 curve is dropping in several pockets of the country, the outbreak in Tamil Nadu is the fastest rising among India’s 20 most populous regions. But the real cause of concern for the state is the rate at which these infections are rising.The seven-day average of new infections (a number used to denote the case curve of a region) in the state has gone from 24,735 new cases a day a week ago to 31,137 for the week ending Sunday, an increase of 26% in seven days — the highest week-on-week growth of any major state in the country. In contrast, the national case curve has contracted 16% in the same time period.The average positivity rate — the proportion of tests that return positive for Covid-19 — in the state also underlines the worrying situation. On average, 19.7% samples tested in the state have returned positive for Sars-CoV-2 in the past week. This number is nearly four times the threshold of 5% recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) in order to establish if a region is testing adequately and has the outbreak under control. This number, which is a crucial statistic that shows how prevalent the virus is in society, is still rising. A rising positivity rate in a region, when coupled with increasing new cases, indicates that the virus is spreading fast within the community.The testing gap To arrest the magnitude of the transmission owing to the presence of new variants, the state went into a lockdown starting May 10 which will go on until May 24. However, during this period, new cases and deaths have continued to rise but testing has remained the same. An average of 158,000 tests per day were conducted in the past week.Experts say that Tamil Nadu needs to double its testing. “We aren’t testing adequately but it is a challenge to scale up RT-PCR tests,” says Dr Prabhdeep Kaur, deputy director, National Institute of Epidemiology.Also Read | India logs 276,110 Covid-19 cases in a single-day; fatalities below 4,000As a policy, Tamil Nadu only follows RT-PCR testing — the gold standard to detect the novel coronavirus. “But now is the time to consider adding rapid antigen tests,” says Kaur. “RT-PCR testing labs are stretched out and if turnaround time for results is late, it defeats the purpose.” With 267 labs (198 private and 69 government labs), the state already has one of the highest number of labs approved for Covid-19 labs.“We have the capacity to test 300,000 samples a day,” says health secretary J Radhakrishnan. During the first wave, the state’s thumb rule was to test a minimum of 10 people for every positive case. That’s how experts have arrived at a figure of conducting 300,000 tests daily as the average of new cases reported daily in the past week is 31,137. This is a rapid increase from 17,865 average daily cases between April 26 up to May 2 — the day of election counting in the state. The following week, the average daily cases went up to 24,735.Testing also varies district-wise depending on the number of infections as well as lab facilities. Chennai accounts for 27% of the cases in the state which is the highest among the 37 districts.“But we need to worry more where there are less cases also,” says Kaur. “If you see the pattern of the virus transmission in the second wave such as in Maharashtra and UP, there was rapid transmission in smaller districts also while we saw only a majority of cities being affected in the first wave. The lockdown has bought us time, and we have to assess our capacity in smaller districts. Epidemiologically speaking, the virus spreads faster among those who haven’t been infected and vaccinated already. So sero prevalence surveys have indicated that half of Chennai is already infected so people in other districts and rural areas are more susceptible now.” She added that the government setting up buses with oxygen concentrators and oxygen support is a good move to stabilise them until they receive beds.The pressure on health infra The state’s key concern is to procure more oxygen and increase oxygenated beds. As of 3pm on May 19, in Chennai’s five government hospitals, there were no ICU beds available and only 49 oxygen supported beds that are vacant. The city’s private hospitals too didn’t have a single ICU bed available. Like elsewhere in the country, patients have been waiting for long hours outside hospitals and being treated inside ambulances before an oxygen supported bed becomes vacant.After repeatedly appealing to the Centre, Tamil Nadu has been receiving an allocation of 519 MTs of oxygen from the Centre’s pool daily. Additionally, the state has imported 80 MTs of oxygen from the Netherlands and procured 12 cryogenic containers from China.Also Read | Smaller states, difficut to reach areas showing upward Covid trend: Govt“Our own production is limited so we are trying every small avenue to meet the oxygen demand. We want to have a seamless operation so we are focussing on getting most of our oxygen from the east like Rourkela, Durgapur, Telangana, Jameshedpur etc,” says Thangam Tennarasu, minister for industries. They estimate the oxygen demand to shoot up to 800 MTS per day in the coming days.Due to shortage in vaccines, the Tamil Nadu government officially opens up vaccination for the 18-45 age category on Thursday. So far, the state has vaccinated seven million people. The state has also gone for a global tender for 35 million doses of Covid-19 vaccines.But for now, the rise in cases, the high positivity rate, inadequate testing, an overwhelmed medical infrastructure, and a much slower than desirable rate of vaccination mean that Tamil Nadu could well decide the next phase of India’s Covid trajectory.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rising-cases-overstretched-health-infra-tn-struggles-to-battle-2nd-covid-wave-101621492182066.html

The review said all districts of Mizoram are showing a rise in new cases. Nagaland shows a sharp increase in daily cases—from 15-20 per day to 300 cases per day— and weekly positivity rate is up from 1% to 34%. Positivity rate is the proportion of people testing positive for an infection among all those tested for it.In Assam, Kamrup, which is a metropolitan, is contributing almost 45% of the daily new cases, while in Meghalaya, East Khasi Hills and Righboi are reporting sharp increases in daily cases.Also Read | Kerala govt’s swearing-in today, 500 people expected to attendManipur’s recovery rate of 78% and case fatality rate (CFR) of more than 1% was also highlighted during the meeting as a matter of concern.CFR is the proportion of people dying from a disease among all those diagnosed with it.Sikkim was advised to strengthen community surveillance and ensure strict monitoring of home quarantine to address its high CFR.

20-05-2021||India||Congress, BJP exchange barbs over 'toolkit'||Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader Sambit Patra on Wednesday named Saumya Varma as the author of the toolkit, a social media campaign playbook, that his party said on Tuesday was prepared by the Congress to defame Prime Minister Narendra Modi and to build a biased narrative over the Indian government’s handling of the second wave of Covid-19 , and the Central Vista Project.The Congress accused Patra of naming the author of a real document (from its metadata) to claim that she also authored the fake documents. It reiterated that the document on Central Vista was genuine, but that the BJP had concocted the other one on Covid-19 to defame the Congress. “...We made a research note on Central Vista for the party It’s genuine and fact-based. I tweeted yesterday [Tuesday] that ‘Covid-19 toolkit’ is forged and is a ‘Made in BJP’ product. Patra is showing metadata/author of a real document and attributing it to a fake,” said Rajeev Gowda, the head of Congress’s Research Department.Congress leaders said Varma is part of the Congress’s Research Cell and that she is not a worker or a member of the party but one of the many professionals engaged by it. She draws a monthly salary from the party, they added. “After 2019, the research team was truncated just as many other branches of the Congress. Varma and few others are running the research team,” one Congress leader said on condition of anonymity.The party refused to give her contact details. Gowda said: “You question me... not my staff.”BJP leaders on Tuesday cited and shared a document circulating on social media. The document was on a letterhead of the All India Congress Committee’s Research Department . The Congress has said this letterhead is forged. The document asked its readers to tarnish Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s image and “erode his popularity”. It suggested using phrases such as “Indian strain” and “Modi strain” for the variants of Covid-19 that were first detected in the country. The document also spoke about briefing foreign journalists over India’s mismanagement of the second Covid-19 wave.The Congress maintained the document on Covid is fake and has been concocted and lodged a complaint of forgery and cybercrime with the Delhi Police. It said in its complaint, filed by Gowda that BJP president JP Nadda, spokesperson Sambit Patra, and Union minister Smriti Irani, among others, “shared forged” documents on Twitter. The Delhi police, however, said they haven’t registered any complaint yet.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/congress-bjp-exchange-barbs-over-toolkit-101621473996145.html
20-05-2021||India||Govt says WhatsApp stand on new privacy policy not acceptable, insists on rollback||The Indian government has for a second time asked messaging service provider WhatsApp to roll back an update of its terms of use as it undermines “informational privacy, data security, and user choice”, union IT ministry officials said on Wednesday, citing a notice that was sent to the Facebook-owned company with a warning of punitive action.According to a ministry of electronics and information technology (Meity) representative, WhatsApp informed the government that it had deferred the May 15 implementation of the terms. This is not what WhatsApp told the Delhi high court as recently as May 17. But the government has insisted that the new policy be withdrawn in entirety.“WhatsApp had earlier claimed that it officially deferred its new Privacy Policy beyond 15th May 2021,” an official familiar with the matter said, asking not to be named. The ministry told the company that the changes in its terms of use and the way they were implemented “undermine the sacrosanct values of informational privacy, data security and user choice for Indian users and harms the rights and interests of Indian citizens”.The new terms of use formalises WhatsApp’s years-old policy of sharing some data with its parent company in instances when a user interacts with a business account. The company first proposed to implement it in January and said users who do not accept it will have their accounts deleted, but delayed it to May 15 after a backlash from users as well as the government.The policy has come into force, the company on May 17 told the Delhi high court—where the matter is also being heard—adding that it will continue to “persuade” users to accept it before their accounts are eventually deleted if they don’t comply.On May 14, a WhatsApp representative told HT that users who had not lost lose any functionality till that point would not lose any additional features after May 15, a stand that appeared to be contradicted by its counsel in HC.“We continue to engage with the government and we reaffirm what we said before that this update does not impact the privacy of personal messages for anyone. Our goal is to provide information about new options we are building that people will have, to message a business on WhatsApp, in the future,” a WhatsApp spokesperson said on Wednesday.“While the majority of users who have received the new terms of service have accepted them, we appreciate some people haven’t had the chance to do so yet. No accounts were deleted on May 15 because of this update and no one in India lost functionality of WhatsApp either,” this person said, while adding that the company will continue to send “reminders to people over the next several weeks”.The ministry first wrote to WhatsApp on January 19, urging it to abandon its plans.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/whatsapp-asked-to-junk-privacy-policy-101621475291498.html

20-05-2021||India||‘Arabian Sea to get more severe cyclones’: Expert||One of the world’s top experts on cyclones, and the first to connect the climate crisis with an increased frequency of cyclones in the Arabian Sea, Hiroyuki Murakami, a climate scientist at the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’ Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory, spoke to Hindustan Times about Cyclone Tauktae and how India should prepare for such disasters in the future. Edited excerpts:Were you tracking the trajectory of Tauktae? What are your thoughts on its features and impact?Cyclone Tauktae propagated north westward along the western coast of India. In general, the right front quadrant of a storm is an area of strongest wind speed of tropical cyclones. The storm track of Cyclone Tauktae was actually very dangerous for people living on the west coast of India due to strong wind, storm surge, and heavy rainfall.Are weather models able to capture rapid intensification of cyclones over Arabian Sea?Some of the recent weather and climate prediction models capture rapid intensification of cyclones. However, it is still challenging to predict the exact timing of rapid intensification due to the complex nature of rapid intensification.What causes cyclones to suddenly gain such energy over a short period of time? How does the climate crisis influence development and intensification of cyclones over Arabian Sea?To reach such high intensity, multiple conditions of both atmosphere and ocean must be favourable. For example, an abnormally warm surface ocean can fuel a storm. Moreover, a sufficiently thick layer of warm water below the surface ocean is required as a necessary condition for intensification. The wind field in the atmosphere is also an important factor for storm intensification.Is the Arabian Sea warming faster than Bay of Bengal and does that mean more severe cyclones over the west coast of India in coming years?Climate models commonly project warmer surface ocean in the Arabian Sea than in the Bay of Bengal due to increased emission of green-house gases. This would in turn lead to increased frequency of severe cyclones in the Arabian Sea more than in the Bay of Bengal in the future.Is it normal for such severe cyclones to develop during the pre-monsoon season in May over Arabian Sea?It is rare, I think. Tauktae took only 2 days from tropical depression (<17 m/s) to very severe cyclonic storm (VSCS, >32 m/s). The recent case for rapid intensification over the Arabian Sea was Cyclone Vayu in 2019 that took only 36 hours to develop into a VSCS.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/arabian-sea-to-get-more-severe-cyclones-expert-101621471910731.html
20-05-2021||India||IMD warns of cyclone at east coast||Cyclone Yaas is likely to form over the Bay of Bengal around May 25, and move north-westwards, reaching West Bengal and the Odisha coast on May 26 evening, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) said on Wednesday.Experts said that atmospheric and oceanic conditions were favourable for persistent cloud cover over the Andaman Sea and the adjoining areas of east-central and southeast Bay of Bengal, where a low-pressure area is likely to form around May 22. In the next 72 hours, it is likely to intensify gradually into a cyclonic storm. “We cannot rule out an Amphan-like intensification. The only good thing is that models as of now are showing that the system is moving very fast over the sea. Its intensification will be restricted if its time over sea is less,” said Sunitha Devi who tracks cyclones at IMD. But if there is slow movement, it could intensify into a “very severe” or a higher category cyclone, she added.M Rajeevan, secretary, ministry of earth sciences, said the models indicate that the cyclone may cross the West Bengal and Odisha coasts. Devi anticipated a broader area of impact between West Bengal, Bangladesh, and Odisha.“The sea surface temperature has been above normal by 1-2 degrees Celsius in early May both over the Arabian Sea and the Bay of Bengal, making conditions strongly favourable for the development of cyclonic systems,” said Pushpendra Johari, senior vice president, sustainability, RMSI, a global disaster risk management firm.IMD has forecast light to moderate rain in the Bay of Bengal region on May 22 and 23, with heavy to very heavy showers at isolated places over Andaman and Nicobar Islands.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/imd-warns-of-cyclone-at-east-coast-101621471068005.html

He urged states to ensure that the healthcare and frontline workers are fully vaccinated, as they form the vulnerable categories.Interacting with the health ministers and principal secretaries/ additional chief secretaries of West Bengal and eight northeast states, Vardhan said, "Between August to December 2021, India will have procured 216 crore vaccine doses while, by July this year, 51 crore doses will be procured."He said that by the end of the year, the country will be in a position to vaccinate at least all of its adult population, according to the health ministry statement.West Bengal and the eight states of the North-eastern region are depicting a higher growth rate in the number of daily cases, high mortality and increasing positivity rate, the statement said.Pointing out the new emerging trend in the country, Vardhan highlighted that now smaller states are showing an upward trend in terms of number of infections and there is a need to be cautious about this.Speaking of the government's efforts towards fighting coronavirus, Vardhan said that from having just one Covid testing laboratory at the start of the pandemic, there are over 2000 across the country now."We have increased our capacity to test 25 lakh people daily. Yesterday, India achieved a historical first by testing the highest number of over 20 lakh people in a single day. This is a global record too," he was quoted as saying in the statement.He stressed on the continued need to follow Covid-appropriate behaviour along with renewed and stringent focus on containment measures.Underscoring the critical importance of vaccination drive, the minister highlighted that India has achieved another landmark by crossing 18 crore doses recently.He also pointed out that more than one crore doses are still in stock with the state governments.Highlighting the critical challenges faced by the NE states and West Bengal, Vardhan said in Mizoram, all districts are showing a rise in new cases.Nagaland has shown a sharp increase in daily cases (15-20 per day to 300 per day) and weekly positivity rate (1 per cent to 34 per cent); there is a need to strengthen testing facilities in peri-urban and rural areas, the statement said.In Assam, Kamrup (Metropolitan) is contributing almost 45 per cent of the daily new cases; while in Meghalaya, East Khasi Hills and Righboi are reporting sharp increases in daily cases. Manipur's recovery rate of 78 per cent and case fatality rate (CFR) of more than 1 per cent was highlighted as a matter of concern, it underlined.Sikkim was advised to strengthen community surveillance and ensure strict monitoring of home quarantine to address its high CFR, the statement said.In Arunachal Pradesh, ICU occupancy is almost 22.5 per cent while capital complex and Changlang districts are reporting maximum cases. All districts of West Bengal are showing a steep increase in positivity rate.Kolkata, North 24 Parganas, South 24 Parganas, Howrah and Nadia were flagged as districts of concern.In Tripura, there has been a steep rise in positivity from 1.3 per cent in April to around 8.7 per cent now. West Tripura, Unakoti, South Tripura were flagged as districts of concern, according to the statement.He asked the states to focus on increasing testing in a timely manner along with upgrading the health infrastructure.Minister of State for Health Ashwini Kumar Choubey reiterated that testing should be increased, particularly RT-PCR one. The Centre is also assisting states on medicines for Black Fungus and oxygen, he said. "We have to maintain Covid protocol and we will win this war against Covid."Dr Sujeet K Singh, Director, NCDC, presented an overview of the Covid trajectory in the states and suggested ramping up of RAT testing and vaccination in rural areas.Vikash Sheel, Additional Secretary (Health) presented on the optimal and judicious use of vaccine doses. All the states, barring Tripura, has had a lower coverage of HCW/FLW workers than the National average (90% and 82% respectively), the statement said.In the 45 plus category, Meghalaya (28%), Manipur (26%), West Bengal (25%), Assam (23%), Nagaland (22%) had a lower coverage than the national average (32 per cent), the statement stated.States were advised to ensure complete utilisation of available vaccination slots for 45+ age-group/HCW.State administrators were advised to reduce vaccine wastage. Assam, Manipur, Meghalaya and Nagaland had clocked substantial wastage and were advised to retrain their staff to achieve minimum wastage, the statement said.Vardhan assured the states of all support from the Centre in augmenting their vaccine drive.Biplab Kumar Deb, the Chief Minister and Health Minister of Tripura; Keshab Mahanta, the Health Minister of Assam; AK Hek, the Health Minister, Meghalaya,; Lalpoklakpam Jayantakumar Singh, the Health Minister of Manipur; Dr R Lalthangliana, the Health Minister of Mizoram; AloLibang, the Health Minister of Arunachal Pradesh; PangnyuPhom, the Health Minister (Nagaland) and Dr Mani Kumar Sharma, the Health Minister (Sikkim) were present virtually in this meeting.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/vaccines-to-all-adults-by-end-of-year-health-minister-harsh-vardhan-101621469939009.html
20-05-2021||India||Govt raises fertiliser subsidy by ₹14,775 crore as global rates soar||The Union government on Wednesday raised the subsidy on fertilisers ahead of the kharif or summer sown season by ₹14,775 crore to cushion prices following a sharp increase in international rates that have prompted domestic fertiliser firms to raise prices.Prices of some farm chemicals have risen sharply on account of costlier imports amid estimates that a normal monsoon would increase demand this year.The Union government hiked the subsidy on di-ammonium Phosphate (DAP), a key crop nutrient, by nearly 140%, from ₹500 a bag to ₹1200.“Thus, despite the rise in international market prices of DAP, it has been decided to continue selling it at the older price of Rs.1200 and the central government has decided to bear all the burden of price hike,” an official statement said.On May 17, HT had reported that the Centre was considering an increase in fertiliser subsidy following a May 13 meeting of Union fertilizer minister Sadananda Gowda, home minister Amit Shah, finance minister Nirmala Sithraman and agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar.International prices of raw materials for some key crop nutrients, such as di-ammonium Phosphate (DAP) and 22 grades of phosphatic and pottassic (P&K) category of fertilisers, have seen a jump of up to 70%.Millions of farmers depend on crop nutrients during the June-to September monsoon season to raise a variety of summer crops, including paddy, pulses, gram, onions and coarse cereals etc. The 2021-22 budget estimate for fertiliser subsidy is ₹80,000 crore.The consumption of fertilisers is also expected to be higher this year. “We expect a nearly 10% increase in fertiliser demand,” an official of the agriculture ministry said, requesting not to be named.Fertiliser demand could be around 35 million tonne during the upcoming summer-sown season, up from 32 million tonne last year.A key reason for an anticipated higher demand has been the forecast of a normal 2021 monsoon, the third straight year of optimal rains. The India Meteorological Department on April 16 forecast that rainfall during the June-to-September monsoon season to be 98%. Rainfall between 94-106% is considered “normal”.The government pays its subsidy to fertiliser companies, who sell it at a discount to farmers through a system called nutrient-based subsidy regime. The fertilizer subsidy is paid to manufacturers based on sales data generated through point of sale (PoS) devices by retail sellers.“The increase in international prices and, simultaneously, higher anticipated demand during the kharif season would have put pressure on farmers as well manufacturers. It could have led to a demand-supply mismatch. The subsidy will ensure adequate availability of DAP, whose consumption is generally more during kharif,” said Abhishek Agrawal of Comtrade, a commodities trading firm.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-raises-fertilizer-subsidy-by-rs-14-775-crore-as-global-rates-soar-101621455551588.html
20-05-2021||India||Tirupati LS bypoll result sinks BJP hopes to emerge as alternative to YSR Congress||Hyderabad The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)’s hopes to emerge as a potential alternative to the ruling YSR Congress party (YSRCP) in Andhra Pradesh and replace the Telugu Desam Party (TDP) as the principal opposition were completely dashed off following the recent by-election to Tirupati parliamentary seat. The BJP finished a poor third in the by-election with its candidate K Ratna Prabha, retired IAS officer and former chief secretary of Karnataka, securing only 57,080 votes, which was just 5.17 per cent of the total number of 11.05 lakh votes polled. The seat was won by YSRCP candidate Dr M Gurumurthy, who got 6.26 lakh votes, defeating his nearest rival Panabaka Lakshmi of TDP by over 2.70 lakh votes. The BJP, which could not win a single assembly and Lok Sabha seat in the 2019 general elections in Andhra Pradesh after severing its ties with former chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu-led TDP a year before, was hoping to emerge as a big force because of the miserable show put up by the latter, which ended up with just 23 assembly seats and three MP seats. The saffron party saw a chance to replace the TDP as a principal opposition after it felt that Naidu may not be in a position to put up a fight against Jagan Mohan Reddy’s YSRCP by 2024. The party quickly forged an alliance with Jana Sena Party floated by popular actor Pawan Kalyan, who has a considerable hold in the Kapu community which accounts for 15.2 per cent of the total population in the state. The BJP also played its traditional brand of politics by highlighting the attacks on Hindu temples and burning of chariot of the famed Antarvedi temple in East Godavari, besides launching a high-decibel campaign against alleged promotion of Christianity by the Jagan government. “But the Tirupati by-election has proved that its narrative doesn’t get acceptance in Andhra. Despite the campaign by top BJP leaders, including national president J P Nadda, the party was rejected even in Tirupati, the most revered place for the Hindus,” political analyst Suresh Dharur said. According to Dharur, the TDP is still a major force to reckon with in Andhra despite its poor show in the last elections. “It is a 40-year-old party with a vast cadre network and strong leadership in Naidu. It has every chance to bounce back by the next elections. So, when there are two strong regional parties like YSRCP and the TDP, there is hardly any space for a national party like the BJP, as is the case in Tamil Nadu,” he said. Another political analyst from Visakhapatnam, Mallu Rajesh, said the BJP was banking too much on the charisma of Kalyan, instead of building up its own base in the state. “Pawan Kalyan has a lot of craze among the youth but it is not enough for the BJP-Jana Sena combine to emerge as a strong political force. Neither of the two parties have any organisational structure in Andhra, unlike the TDP. So, they will always remain a poor and distant third,” Rajesh said. Soon after the Tirupati by-election, the BJP and Jana Sena leaders slipped into silent mode. While Kalyan, who returned to acting in films after two years, has kept himself busy with scripts for his forthcoming projects, BJP leaders have stopped making any political statements, even on the Covid-19 situation in the state. “There has not been any attempt by our party’s Andhra unit president Somu Veerraju to hold any internal meeting to review the Tirupati by-poll outcome and come out with an action plan. No meeting was held with Jana Sena to discuss the post-poll strategies and strengthen the alliance,” a BJP leader said on condition of anonymity. The leader added that there was nothing much for party leaders to criticise the YSRCP at this stage, as chief minister Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy has been maintaining friendly relations with the Narendra Modi government at the Centre.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tirupati-ls-bypoll-result-sinks-bjp-hopes-to-emerge-as-alternative-to-ysrcongress-101621453536083.html
20-05-2021||India||K’taka receives 200k Covishield doses||Bengaluru The Karnataka government on Wednesday said that it has received around 200,000 doses of vaccines from Pune-based Serum Institute of India (SII) as part of its purchase order for 20 million doses.“Karnataka received 2,00,000 doses of Covishied today as part of the order placed by the state govt. So far state has received 10,94,000 doses (9,50,000 Covishield and 1,44,000 Covaxin) as part of direct procurement from manufacturers in addition to 1,11,24,470 doses received from GoI,” K Sudhakar, Karnataka’s minister for health, family welfare and medical education tweeted.The state government has so far placed orders for at least 30 million doses of vaccines from both SII and Hyderabad-based Bharat Biotech that produces Covaxin.But late delivery of vaccines owing to demands from across the country, forced Karnataka to suspend its vaccination drive of the first dose for both persons above 45 years of age as well as those who fall in between the 18-44 category.The shortage of vaccines has brought down the daily inoculations to 65,181 on Tuesday (till 3.30 pm) that takes the total to 11,348,708. However, only 25,30,724 persons have received both doses which accounts for less than 4% of the state’s entire population, estimated at 60.5 million.Karnataka remains one of the most impacted regions in the country as cases continue to surge in most places even though it has shown signs of letting up in Bengaluru, which has the highest number of active cases in India.Though the decline raises hopes of some reprieve for the state, testing has dropped dramatically, which experts and others attributed as the cause for the lower number of new infections.“The second way forward for the state is that everyone in Karnataka should be administered the vaccines at the earliest. The government is striving towards ensuring 100% coverage to the entire population by October or November end,” Sudhakar said in Bengaluru on Wednesday.He said that the centre has so far provided the state with 1,11,26,340 doses. Of the purchases made directly by the state government, it has so far received 9.50 lakhs of covishield and 144,170 doses of Covaxin.He said that the centre and its own purchases takes the total doses received by the state to 12220510 so far.“We are looking to import vaccines from abroad and we are talking to Bharat Biotech and they have assured to provide the same,” the minister added.He added that even Russia-developed Sputnik will have a manufacturing plant in Karnataka which raises hopes of completing the vaccination drive to all its residents “before the entire country”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ktaka-receives-200k-covishield-doses-101621453476039.html
20-05-2021||India||Pharmaceuticals, beauty products add to pollution in Bengaluru’s water bodies: Study||Bengaluru: A new research paper that studies the impact of pharmaceutical and personal care products released into Bengaluru’s water bodies states that the risk of side effects to aquatic life and humans, who consume it indirectly, are increasing. The study, conducted between the monsoon period in October 2018 and pre-monsoon period in February 2019, across Arkavathi River in Bengaluru establishes high level of harmful content entering surface water streams. “ In the last few decades pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) have been responsible for water pollution with adverse effects on the aquatic biota because of their pseudo-persistence and bioaccumulation. Though detected at low concentrations in natural waters, they have the potential to cause harm to the ecological and human health especially in diverse trophic levels of aquatic ecosystems,” according to the research paper. PPCPs include diverse classes like parabens, antibiotics, UV-filters, plasticizers, antibacterial and analgesics. With a population of over 12 million, Bengaluru is among the most populous cities in the country. Its technology boom in the early 2000’s has attracted migrant workers--both white and blue--from across the country and the world which has led to rapid and unplanned expansion of the city. During this period, Bengaluru has witnessed an exponential increase in construction to accommodate the large migrant population, leading to rapid erosion of natural water bodies like lakes, green cover and its unplanned growth has also led to inefficient garbage and wastewater treatment. “There is disposal of such products directly Arkavathi and Vrishabhavathi, even though it does not join surface water, sedimentations and soil is likely to be impacted. Before wastewater is released, it should be treated first,” Gopal Chikmagalur Malappa, the lead author of the paper, told Hindustan Times. Arkavathi is a tributary of Cauvery River and flows for a length of 193 kms and the basin area is around 4253 square kilometers, according to the study. The rapid encroachment of lakes in Bengaluru, which at one point exceeded 250 in numbers, has left the city to quench its thirst by dipping into the Cauvery river that flows at least 100 kms away, depriving other districts of this precious resource and deflecting it to India’s IT capital. “The spatial abundance of PPCPs at the river’s midstream confirms the continuous discharge of wastewater from highly populated metropolitan and industrial areas through Byramangala reservoir into the river stream. Temporally, in the post-monsoon season, sulfamethoxazole, chloramphenicol, and diclofenac increased on account of undiluted sewage and their polar nature preventing its absorption into sediments. On the other hand there was a decrease in the concentrations of propylparaben, ibuprofen, BP1, oxybenzone, BPA and triclosan, in the post-monsoon, due to its hydrophobic nature and tendency to precipitate with the particulates/ sediments/ soil,” the paper states. According to the Karnataka State Pollution Control Board (KSPCB), over 708 kilometers of seven major rivers and its tributaries have levels of contamination ranging from Class ‘B’ or waters used for organised outdoor bathing all the way to “D” or waters to maintain aquatic life. Of the 98 water quality monitoring stations, at least 42 have reported serious, if not dangerous, levels of pollution, data shows. Water contamination is not unique to Karnataka as similar studies across the country have revealed alarming results of pollution in some of India’s biggest rivers including the Ganga. Untreated water, industrial effluent and other polluting elements are often let into these water bodies, which increases the presence of harmful pollutants and seeps into groundwater, food crops, animals and even humans when they consume the same. Bengaluru requires around 1400 million litres per day to quench its thirst and wastewater recycling infrastructure has a capacity of around half of that, and actual recycled water is around 500 mld (million litres per day), according to official data. A large portion of used water, including those with soaps, detergents and other cleaning products is let out in drains that in turn makes its way into other water bodies like rivers and lakes. Discharge of pharmaceuticals happens through humans. The anti-inflammatory drug ibuprofen was determined at comparatively (p = 0.083) higher concentrations (1835 ng/L) compared to other target PPCPs, according to the study, which further adds that this could be due to the large volume of consumption as it is easily available over the counter. A report by the KSPCB in 2020 states that none of the water in any of the lakes in Bengaluru are fit for drinking even though fish from these lakes are often consumed by locals. Bellandur lake, located in the eastern part of Bengaluru has made global headlines for its toxic content and foam that often catches fire largely due to the sewage, metal and other harmful contents within the lake. Though the release of PPCPs are not at alarming levels, the continuous consumption of these products--directly and indirectly--may lead to developing side-effects, the paper states. “How good the treatment in these (wastewater) plants is important. Because these pharmaceuticals are not very easy to treat. Conventional treatment will not work,” K Balakrishna, the co-author of the paper and faculty member of the department of Geology at Manipal Institute of Technology said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pharmaceuticals-beauty-products-add-to-pollution-in-bengaluru-s-water-bodies-study-101621453356007.html
20-05-2021||India||BSY extends ₹1,250 crore Covid relief||Bengaluru: Karnataka chief minister B S Yediyurappa on Wednesday announced a financial relief package of ₹1,250 crore for certain sections of people affected economically by the Covid-19 pandemic and the subsequent lockdown. The CM specified that the beneficiaries will be farmers, workers from the unorganised sector, autorickshaw and taxi drivers and street vendors among others. The package has come weeks after the government went back on its earlier decision not to announce a lockdown in the state on account of its own unpreparedness despite warnings of a second wave by a government-appointed technical advisory committee in November. The Yediyurappa government was under tremendous pressure from the Opposition to announce a relief package, with Congress demanding ₹10,000 for every EWS (economically weaker section) household hit hard by the lockdown, still in effect until May 24. However, a statement by the chief minister’s office shows that the package is worth ₹1,111.82 crore, less than the announced figure. “Even when our financial situation is not very good, we are telling the people that we are there with them,” the CM explained at the press conference while announcing the package. Last year too, CM Yediyurappa had announced a financial package of ₹1,610 crore. But multiple sources, including beneficiaries, had said that it did little to compensate for the loss of income and livelihood. With 15 droughts in the last two decades and four major floods during this period, the large farming population in Karnataka now has fewer sources of income. The recent devastation left behind by cyclone Tauktae has only added to the pre-existing woes of the people. So far, no separate relief package has been announced for those hit by the cyclone. Former chief minister and Congress leader, Siddaramaiah, claimed that CM Yediyurappa had announced total relief to the tune of ₹2,100 crore last year, but the money wasn’t spent, and less than 50% of the targeted beneficiaries received any help. Karnataka’s health situation has steadily deteriorated with Covid cases going up and the government hasn’t been able to do much about it on its own. While Bengaluru, which accounted for almost 60% of the cases and fatalities, has seen a sharp decline in new infections, data has also shown fewer tests that experts say explain why there are fewer cases. The financial package involves a one-time payment of ₹10,000 to about 20,000 flower growers and 69,000 farmers who produce fruit and vegetables costing the exchequer a total of around ₹81.73 crore. Relief ranging from ₹2,000 to 3,000 will be provided to around 2.10 lakh licensed autorickshaw, taxi and maxi cab drivers, and around 3.04 lakh people working as barbers, dhobis, hamalis (porters), ragpickers, potters, goldsmiths, mechanics, and domestic workers. Around 2.20 lakh street vendors would get around ₹2,000 each, totalling ₹44 crore, while 16,095 artists and artist groups would receive ₹3,000 each, costing the state exchequer ₹4.85 crore. Registered construction workers would get ₹3,000 from the welfare fund that would entail a total relief of ₹494 crore.The chief minister also extended the period for short, medium, and long-term loans availed by around 4.25 lakh farmers and others by three months that would cost the government ₹134.38 crore in interest payment. The chief minister also said that the state is extending the relief given by the Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana by giving an additional 30 lakh people 5kg rice that would in total benefit around 4.34 crore people or 1.26 crore ration card holders.Even those who do not have APL (above poverty line) or BPL (below poverty line) cards will receive relief, but those with BPL cards will receive 10kg food grains for May and June and those with APL cards will receive the same amount of food grains at ₹15 per kilo. Yediyurappa said that his government was spending around ₹25 crore to provide free food to around 6 lakh people daily through Indira Canteens. But the Opposition leaders claimed that the package is too inadequate. Former chief minister and Janata Dal (Secular) leader H D Kumaraswamy gave the example of Kerala to drive home this point. “Kerala announced a lockdown in March and announced a package of ₹20,000 crore. Kerala is a small state compared to Karnataka. Is ₹1,200 crore any compensation for Karnataka?” Kumaraswamy said, adding that he had asked for a lockdown in March, but the government paid no heed to it. The Congress repeated its demand for ₹10,000 for all EWS households and said that the money should be handed over to the panchayats. “The government should conduct a survey on how many people have lost jobs. This is not a government that thinks about the poor. Since we insisted on a package, they have announced it. But it has completely failed,” said D K Shivakumar, the president of Karnataka Pradesh Congress Committee.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bsy-extends-1-250-crore-covid-relief-101621452875905.html

Journalist-turned- politician Veena George (44) will be the new health minister replacing the high-profile K K Shailaja.Addressing the reporters in the state capital, the chief minister said that the party and government respect popular sentiment raised in this regard. Many left camp followers, cine artists, writers and students took to social media in a big way to vent their anger criticising the decision to drop health minister K K Shailaja who was the face of the fight against Covid-19 in the state.“We respect their sentiments. But the party has taken a decision much early to induct new faces. It can’t give exemptions to some. It was a collective decision. All ministers of the outgoing government worked well and it reflected in the election also,” he said, adding there was on plan to change the decision.When asked even central leaders of the party expressed serious reservation over Shailaja’s exclusion the CM said he was not aware of it.To a question whether Shailaja deserved an exemption in view of the pandemic situation the he said many of the outgoing ministers deserved such exemptions but the party took a firm decision on this. “You may ask why the CM got exemption then. It was also the decision of the party... there is no room for individual decision it is a collective one. Many are giving an interpretation that I was behind the move but it is not right,” he said adding ongoing fight against pandemic will not to be weakened by change in the ministry.“Our fight against the pandemic will continue with renewed vigour,” he said.Meanwhile the state reported 32,763 cases after testing 1.40,545 persons with a test positivity rate of 23.31per cent. It also reported 112 deaths, highest since the outbreak began taking total fatalities to 6724. Active caseload in the state is 3,31,860. The CM said the state has reported 15 black fungus cases so far.

These recommendations have been based on the evolving situation of the Covid-19 pandemic and emerging global scientific evidence and experience,” said Union health ministry in a statement, adding that the suggestions had been accepted and communicated to states.The advisory also recommends that there should be no screening of a vaccine recipient by rapid antigen test (RAT) prior to vaccination.Addressing concerns regarding blood donation, the health ministry has clarified that an individual can donate blood 14 days after they receive a Covid-19 vaccine, or if they have tested negative through an RT-PCR test if they were suffering from the viral disease.The authorities are yet to take a decision on whether pregnant women can be given the coronavirus vaccines. The matter is ‘under discussion and further deliberation by the National Technical Advisory Group on Immunization (NTAGI)’ is underway, the government said.The three-month embargo announced on vaccination for those that had the disease is not commonly followed elsewhere. According to UK’s Covid-19 vaccination Green Book, people should take their shots as soon as all of their symptoms have recovered, which has also been recommended by the United States’s Centers of Disease Control (CDC). The American agency, however, urges people to wait for 90 days in case they received treatment with monoclonal antibodies or plasma therapy.States in India have been advised to ensure effective dissemination of the information to service provides as well as the general public through use of all channels of information and communication in the local languages. States have also been advised to undertake training of the vaccination staff at all levels.“The Union Health Ministry has written to States and UTs to direct the concerned officials to take note of these recommendations and undertake necessary action for their effective implementation,” the statement further read.India is grappling with a shortage of doses, with many states saying they are fast running out of stocks. The expanded dosing schedule is likely to help address some of the shortage.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/take-vaccine-3-months-after-covid-recovery-centre-101621452276410.html
20-05-2021||India||Tamil Nadu CM Stalin grants Rajiv Gandhi case convict 30-day parole||Tamil Nadu chief minister MK Stalin on Wednesday granted a 30-day ordinary leave or parole to AG Perarivalan, one of the convicts in the assassination of former prime minister Rajiv Gandhi who is serving a life-term in the Puzhal Central Prison in Chennai.Considering Perarvialan’s mother Arputham Ammal’s plea, the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) chief granted him parole on medical grounds according to the provision in the Tamil Nadu prisons manual.Ammal had submitted a petition to Stalin on May 10 stating that the spread of the coronavirus inside the prison put her son at higher risk as he had several health issues.“After carefully reviewing D Aruputham Ammal’s petition, chief minister MK Stalin has ordered 30-day ordinary leave for A G Perarivalan,” the order stated.Soon after the order, Ammal thanked Stalin on Twitter. “Thanks to CM Stalin for considering a mother’s feelings and understanding the health of Perarivalan and taking immediate action,” she said in Tamil.After completing prison formalities, Perarivalan would be allowed parole.Last year, the Madras high court had granted Perarivalan 30-day parole and the Supreme Court in November had extended it by a week due to his ailing health.Perarivalan is among the seven convicts in the Rajiv Gandhi assasination case. The former PM was assassinated on May 21, 1991, at Sriperumbudur by a woman suicide bomber belonging to the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE). Ammal has been fighting for the release of her son and all other convicts for decades, which has been supported by several groups in the state, including political parties such as Viduthalai Chiruthaigal Katchi (VCK) and Marumalarchi Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (MDMK) -- who are also allies of the DMK-led government. His release has been opposed by the state Congress unit even as the Gandhi family has said that they have forgiven the convicts.In 2018, the Tamil Nadu cabinet unanimously passed a resolution for the release of all seven convicts and sent it to governor Banwarilal Purohit. Three years later, he declined to take a decision and said it was the President who was the competent authority to do so.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/stalin-grants-rajiv-gandhi-case-convict-30-day-parole-101621452156350.html
20-05-2021||India||'No option but to jump into the sea': Survivors recount harrowing escape||At 12.37pm on Monday afternoon, barge P305 started taking in water from the Arabian Sea.Cyclone Tauktae was intensifying and winds gusting up to 200 kmph had already snapped the barge’s 12 anchors the previous night, pushing the barge 50km farther into sea from its fixed position near an oil rig in the Heera fields.All 261 people on board the mega structure – marine crew, labourers and engineers – rushed to the deck, sensing danger. Indrajeet Sharma, 33, was one of them.By 2pm, water was gushing into the barge and it was tilting dangerously into the sea. As the barge sank slowly, Sharma and others faced two tough options: Jump into the stormy waters or take their chances with the submerging structure. By 6pm, the choice was clear.“I had no other option except jumping into the sea to save my life,” said Sharma, a senior engineer who had been working on the barge since last May. The barge finally sank at 7pm.For the next eight hours, Sharma and five or six of his colleagues from the barge bobbed up and down in their life jackets as the storm passed and the sea calmed down.Also Read| 49 missing from sunken barge as navy grapples with rescue effortsMany, like his colleague Faraz Nadkar, held hands with people they knew from the barge, and spoke about their families and loved ones. “We decided that if we would die, we’d die together,” said Nadkar, a 22-year-old architect who joined the barge a few months ago.They were finally picked up by navy rescue ships early Tuesday morning .“After spending 8 hours in the water, I was rescued by INS Kochi at 2am on Tuesday. I could not open my eyes for almost 24 hours as I spent several hours in the salty water,” he said.Nadkar was rescued four hours later. “We spent around 12 hours in the water and for most of the time we spoke of our families,” he said.P305 was one of three barges that were carried adrift by Tauktae, the most powerful storm to hit Mumbai in two decades, and has become the focal point of rescue operations. On Tuesday, rescuers pulled out 26 bodies and 49 people still missing.After two days of search and rescue operations, Indian Naval Ship (INS) Kochi returned to Tiger Gate in Mumbai harbour on Wednesday morning with 125 survivors of barge P305.On Monday morning, the Indian Navy received a distress call from P305 and immediately dispatched three ships -- INS Kochi, Talwar and Kolkata -- to rescue the people, even as inclement weather made the search and rescue operations difficult.Also Read| ‘Arabian Sea to get more severe cyclones’: ExpertINS Kochi, which left Mumbai harbour around 10am on Monday, was the first to reach the site at 4pm. INS Kolkata reached around midnight. The Navy also deployed helicopters and aircraft to conduct aerial surveys. Other ships, including offshore support vessels, multipurpose support vessels and Coast Guard vessels got involved in the SAR operations the following day.The barge, owned and operated by Durmast Enterprises Limited, had been chartered by a consortium led by Afcons Infrastructure Limited for an Oil and Natural Gas (ONGC) project in the Western Offshore fields in the Arabian Sea. The people on board comprised marine crew, labourers on contract, and employee of Afcons, some of whom blamed their employers for the predicament.“Our employer thought that nothing would happen in the cyclone due to which we faced the most terrifying day of our lives,” said Nadkar, who was rescued by INS Kochi around 6am on Tuesday. “We waited till the last moment when the ship was just about to sink,” he added.“It is the mistake of the company to not take the decision to send us to Mumbai from the high sea,” said Dombivali resident Deepak Ingle, 30, a technician who started work on the barge in December.Some survivors said they’d lost everything in the tragedy.“I prayed to God all night that I would live to see my parents again,” said Sunil Kumar Madhesia (22), who hails from Kushinagar, Uttar Pradesh.“We saw our ship sink and several people on the deck were falling into the sea. [We] spent more than 10 hours in stormy water when the Navy rescued 12 people out of our group of 14 on Tuesday morning. Two are still missing,” said Madhesia, who worked as a helper on the barge.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/survived-by-jumping-holding-hands-in-sea-101621451975790.html
20-05-2021||India||49 missing from sunken barge as navy grapples with rescue efforts||The Indian Navy has encountered an unforgiving sea off India’s west coast, where it has been at the centre of a challenging search and rescue mission for three days, involving warships, helicopters and surveillance aircraft, after Cyclone Tauktae killed dozens on land and at offshore facilities, said people familiar with the rescue effort launched on May 17.Winds blowing at speeds of more than 75 knots (140 kmph), furious 30-foot-high waves crashing on warships every nine seconds, and almost zero visibility – the sea has been battering rescuers, who were still looking for 49 people missing from a barge that sank because of the storm.While 434 people from two barges and an oil rig have been brought to safety, 26 people working at a third barge have died so far as the facility sank on Monday evening. Of the 261 people at the barge that sank, 186 people have been rescued, and 49 still missing.The rescuers and those being rescued faced the same perils, said Commodore Alok Ananda, an officer in the naval operations directorate, overseeing the demanding mission from New Delhi. “The intensity of the winds, the powerful waves, the heavy rain and zero visibility in the first crucial 24 hours of operations posed a giant challenge. In those conditions, it’s just you and the brute force of nature,” he said on Wednesday, the third day of the operations.On Tuesday, the navy’s deputy chief Vice Admiral Murlidhar Sadashiv Pawar described the navy’s effort as “one of the most challenging search and rescue operations” he had seen in his four-decade military career. Pawar wasn’t overstating the challenges being faced by the naval squads leading the operations.“Our warships sailed into the eye of the storm to carry out the mission. Everything had to be done with extreme caution. You didn’t want survivors to be slammed by a 7,500-tonne warship while being taken onboard,” said another officer, speaking on condition of anonymity.The warships were required to keep a safe distance from the distressed barges and scores of survivors in life vests bobbing up and down in the monstrous swells all around them.“If you are in the water and the warship as much as touches you, you are dead. It’s tricky maneuvering a warship in that environment,” said Ananda.Five warships – INS Kochi, INS Kolkata, INS Beas, INS Betwa and INS Teg – are currently involved in search and rescue operations off the country’s west coast, supported by P-8I maritime surveillance aircraft and Seaking and Chetak helicopters. Helicopters could not be deployed for operations on the first day because of extreme weather conditions.Also Read| PM Modi reviews Tauktae damage in Gujarat“It was enormously challenging to get the first two warships out of the harbour in Mumbai due to four-metre high waves and wind speeds between 120 and 140 kmph. Subsequently, we had to keep ourselves and the warships safe to carry out the operations in extremely hostile conditions,” Ananda said.The extremely severe cyclonic storm made landfall in Gujarat on Monday after strong winds and heavy rainfall battered Mumbai and other coastal areas. The maximum wind intensity at the eye of the storm at the time of the landfall was 160-170kmph, gusting to 200kmph. The system crossed the Gujarat coast between Porbandar and Mahuva (Bhavnagar district), east of Diu, with a maximum wind speed of 155-165 kmph, gusting to 185kmph.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/49-missing-from-sunken-barge-as-navy-grapples-with-rescue-efforts-101621451795735.html
20-05-2021||India||Army keeping an eye on drill by Chinese military near Ladakh region: Naravane||The Indian Army is keeping a constant eye on activities by the Chinese military including a drill it is conducting in its training areas near Ladakh region and there were no "violations" by either side since the implementation of the disengagement in Pangong lake areas, Chief of Army Staff Gen M M Naravane told news agency PTI on Wednesday.Gen Naravane also expressed hope that both sides will be able to make forward movement in resolving issues in other areas.The Chief of the Army Staff said the disengagement has been cordial so far, but added that Indian troops are maintaining an effective vigil to deal with any eventualities along the Line of Actual Control in eastern Ladakh.Asked about a military drill by the Chinese Army in their depth areas, he said Indian troops are keeping a constant eye on it."We have seen movements in training areas. It is an annual exercise. They come for training. We also go to training areas. We have been keeping a constant eye on it. We have forces along the LAC and they are adequate to deal with any action or activity," Gen Naravane told India Today channel.He said there were no "transgressions and violations" since the disengagement process took place in February and both sides are observing it in letter and spirit."What is important is that we are talking. And what is important to know is that between two phases, there are periods where the trust has to be built up. I think the trust has (been) built..because of that trust, maybe we will be able to make forward movement in other areas where issues are still to be resolved," he told CNN-News18.The Chief of Army Staff said India will maintain its enhanced presence on the northern front till de-escalation is achieved.India and China were locked in a military standoff at multiple friction points in eastern Ladakh since early May last year but they have completed the withdrawal of troops and weapons from the North and South banks of Pangong lake in February following a series of military and diplomatic talks.The two sides are now engaged in talks to extend the disengagement process to the remaining friction points.There was no visible forward movement in disengagement of troops in the remaining friction points as the Chinese side did not show flexibility in their approach on it at the 11th round of military talks with the Indian Army on April 9.About the coronavirus crisis, Gen Naravane said the Army is fully ready to extend all possible assistance in India's fight against the pandemic"We are an Army of the people, for the people," he said."There is no difference in mobilising for the pandemic. This is because time to time we also assist in dealing with other natural calamities. We are quite well geared up. All three branches of armed forces have been working collectively," he said.Naravane said 90 per cent of the forces' personnel have been administered the second dose of coronavirus vaccine and soon it will touch 95 per cent.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/army-keeping-an-eye-on-drill-by-chinese-military-near-ladakh-region-naravane-101621450395239.html
20-05-2021||NA||Highlights: Pune logs 4,557 new Covid cases, 114 deaths in last 24 hours||India reached a grim milestone on Wednesday after 4,529 people succumbed to Covid-19, the highest single day death toll since the beginning of the pandemic. Wednesday's death toll surpassed that of US and Brazil, the other two worst affected countries in the world. Experts have predicted that even as the daily number of cases have been on the decline the death toll will go up as people who were infected during the peak of the second wave are still battling the disease.Dr VK Paul, Niti Aayog member (health), said at a press briefing on Tuesday that the "pandemic curve" is stabilising in many states of India even as the country continues to record close to 3 lakh cases and over 4,000 deaths a day. The union government also flagged certain states where cases were high, including West Bengal and Tamil Nadu, the two states where polls were conducted recently.Follow all the updates here:Jharkhand records nearly 1,900 new Covid-19 cases, 53 deathsJharkhand reports 1894 new #COVID19 cases, 4528 recoveries and 53 deaths in the last 24 hoursTotal cases 3,20,934Active cases 28,841 pic.twitter.com/qEWixI16vvJharkhand's caseload of the Covid-19 disease climbed to 320,934 on Wednesday after 1,894 new cases, 53 more deaths and 4,528 recoveries, according to the state health department's bulletin.

20-05-2021||Today's||Cyber attacks on critical infrastructure: Is India ready?||Last week, a major cyber attack crippled one of the largest pipelines in the United States (US), Colonial Pipeline, which carries about 45% of all fuel consumed on the country’s East Coast. The attack disrupted fuel supplies and caused a surge in gas prices in some parts of the country.This was a case of ransomware attack, where hackers usually threaten to block the system or publish the targeted company or victim’s confidential data, unless a ransom is paid. US authorities have blamed Darkside, a Russia-based criminal group, for the attack, but so far have ruled out the Russian government’s involvement. Reportedly, the company has paid the hackers nearly $5 million in ransom.The attack on Colonial Pipeline fits the broader trend witnessed in recent years of cyberattacks on critical infrastructure which require to be operational at all times such as traffic systems, banks, power grids, oil pipelines and nuclear reactors. For years, security researchers have speculated about the possibility of the sabotaging of these operations. Now, States, keen to settle their geopolitical scores, have shown that such disruptions are no longer a piece of fiction.In recent years, attacks targeting critical infrastructure and businesses have surged. These include the 2017 WannaCry and NotPetya ransomware attacks, the 2015 attack on Ukrainian power grids and 2010 Stuxnet attack on Iranian nuclear reactor. The NotPetya ransomware attack impacted operations of multiple companies and reportedly cost $10 billion worldwide in damages. Moreover, to escape responsibility for such debilitating attacks, many States use hacking syndicates as proxies.Also Read | Irish ransomware attack to cost health service millions of eurosIndia too has not escaped the impact of such debilitating cyberattacks. The NotPetya attack had infected computer network of Maersk, the world’s largest shipping company. That infection led to further disruption of terminal operations, most prominently of APM Terminals Mumbai, at the Jawaharlal Nehru Port Trust, India’s biggest container port. This disruption further delayed cargo deliveries and interrupted global supply chains. Most recently, in 2020, a China-linked hacker group RedEcho targeted India’s power sector, ports and parts of the railway infrastructure, affecting Mumbai.India’s Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT) and National Critical Infrastructure Protection Centre (NCIIPC) have noted several such attacks on India’s critical infrastructure. Last year, National Security Advisor Ajit Doval mentioned that attacks targeting defence and critical infrastructure had surged during the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic.This has made critical infrastructure protection a major cybersecurity priority for India.The government established the NCIIPC in 2014 as the nodal agency to work with the public and private sectors for plugging gaps in their critical infrastructure systems. NCIIPC’s main contribution is detailed operational and technical guidelines for critical infrastructure operators to secure their systems. It also brings out the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures reports, which alert operators on incoming threats. Further, dedicated CERTs (CERT-Thermal, CERT-Hydro, CERT-Transmission) disseminate information about cyber incidents in the power sector.Yet, multiple issues complicate India’s comprehensive response. A significant challenge is the inhibition in the private (and public) sector to sharing information about the vulnerability of their systems. By revealing their vulnerabilities and, therefore, their proprietary information, businesses fear exposing themselves and losing a competitive edge over rivals. Critical infrastructure operators have resorted to plugging the security gaps in their systems whenever faced with a cyberattack or data breach. Indian regulators have often complained that this reticent approach of operators and businesses is tactical and short-term, overlooking the possibility of concerted cyber warfare by adversarial States against India.Also Read | UK to help vulnerable countries against Russia, China cyber threatGiven the mutual distrust and vulnerability of public and private sector, any solution involves sharing responsibility through a public-private partnership for critical infrastructure protection. These should focus on building an institutional framework, expanding and deepening capacity, creating security standards and strict audits and evolving a cybersecurity incident reporting framework.India may not have witnessed the kind of cyberattack depicted in the 2007 Hollywood film Die Hard 4.0, which cripples transportation, financial and other critical sectors across the US. But our threat canvas and vulnerabilities are expanding. Hence, only an integrated, whole-of-the-ecosystem approach for securing critical infrastructure will be successful.Sameer Patil is Fellow, International Security Studies Programme at Gateway House, Mumbai.

20-05-2021||Today's||Mirwaiz Maulana Farooq—A champion of Kashmiriyat||May 21 has been a black day in recent Indian political history. On May 21, 1990, Maulana Farooq, the Mirwaiz of Kashmir, was murdered in cold blood by three Hizb-ul-Mujahideen (HM) terrorists. The very next year, former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi was killed by a female suicide bomber of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam on the same date. And a little over a decade later, another Kashmiri political stalwart, Abdul Ghani Lone, was gunned down by pro-Pakistan terrorists, when he had just finished paying tributes to Maulana Farooq at the Idgah ground in Srinagar on May 21, 2002.Mirwaiz Maulana Farooq was the spiritual leader of the Muslims of the Kashmir Valley. He was a great preacher and religious scholar, whose services in the educational and social upliftment of Kashmiris are recalled with respect. Control over the pulpit of the Jama Masjid Srinagar gave him a large following, which listened to his views with respect and supported him. He was consistent in his propagation of the values of Kashmiriyat, Kashmir’s syncretic culture and communal harmony.Also Watch | 2 Al-Badr terrorists killed in encounter with security forces in J&K’s SrinagarThe Mirwaiz first rose to prominence as a young 19-year-old who led the popular agitation when the Moe-e-Muqqadas disappeared from the Haztarbal shrine in the early hours of December 27, 1963. The Moe-e-Muqqadas is a hair from the beard of the Prophet, which is kept attached to a silver pendulum in a glass tube one inch in diameter with a silver top. This tube is kept in a silver casket which is normally locked securely in the Hazratbal shrine and taken out only on special occasions for viewing by the faithful. There were massive protests when it was found to be missing, leading to violence not only in Srinagar but also in some cities of East and West Pakistan and West Bengal.Mirwaiz Maulana Farooq formed the Awami Action Committee (AAC) and made the protests a multi-faith affair, with Hindus and Sikhs also joining the demand for its recovery. The AAC gathered funds and set up arrangements to feed the thousands of protesters. It played a constructive role, urging the public to remain peaceful and also meeting officials to resolve the issue. The relic was finally recovered on January 4, 1964 and even though attempts were made by Pakistan to raise doubts of whether the recovered relic was genuine, the issue was satisfactorily resolved when senior religious leaders examined it and certified it to be genuine.Maulana Farooq played, mainly, a social and educational role though he had political influence in downtown Srinagar. In 1983, the then Jammu and Kashmir (J&K) chief minister (CM), Farooq Abdullah, was facing elections and made overtures to Maulana Farooq to form a political alliance. This was very difficult for Maulana Farooq as his family and the family of Sheikh Abdullah had been having a running feud since 1938.Also Read | 30 years later, the life and legacy of Rajiv GandhiTo end this 45-year-old enmity, statesmanship of a high order was required and Maulana Farooq joined hands with Farooq Abdullah to end this feud. More than attaining political power, Maulana Farooq was more interested to strength Kashmiriyat, and keeping fundamentalist forces such as the Jamaat-e-lslami (JeI), J&K at bay. This “double Farooq” accord paid rich dividends and Farooq Abdullah was re-elected as the CM.The Mirwaiz was steadfast in his opposition to fundamentalist Islam in general, and JeI (J&K) in particular, as its ideology was directly in conflict with Kashmiriyat and human values. When militancy started in J&K in 1988, Maulana Farooq was quick to condemn the killing of innocents, whether by militants or by security forces. He showed the strength of his moral courage in December 1989 when Rubiya Sayeed, daughter of Mufti Mohammad Sayeed, was kidnapped by a group of Jammu and Kashmir Liberation Front militants.The Mirwaiz appeared on Srinagar TV and unequivocally condemned this act as un-Islamic, and urged the kidnappers to release her unharmed if they were true Muslims. This appeal had such an impact that the father of one of the militants contacted a prominent journalist to convey that his son and the other militants had made a mistake and gave an assurance that no harm would befall Rubiya Sayeed and that she would be released safe and sound at the earliest. Unfortunately, her father, the Mufti, lost his nerve and agreed to release five militants in exchange for her, which led to a serious setback to anti-militancy operations in the valley.The pro-Kashmiriyat and anti Jel (J&K) attitude of Maulana Farooq was not to the liking of Islamic fundamentalists and their mentors in Pakistan. This made him a target, even though he was not pro-India but wanted peace in Jammu and Kashmir. On May 21, 1990, three HM terrorists entered his house in Nageen, Srinagar pretending to be his disciples. They were led into his study by his 67 years old gardener, Gulam Qadir. A few minutes later, Qadir heard gunshots and saw the terrorists running away. The mortally injured Maulana Farooq was rushed to the Shoura Medical Institute where he was declared dead.The HM is the militant arm of the JeI (J&K), and it was later learnt that his assassination was carried out at the behest of the Pakistan Inter-Services Intelligence. His tragic death clearly brings out that Pakistan is not a friend of the Kashmiris and cannot tolerate Kashmiriyat as it is not in consonance with making J&K a part of Pakistan.Unfortunately, India, on this day, lost a stalwart who was committed to the cause of “Insaniyat, Kashmiriyat and Jamooriyhat”.Kulbir Krishan is a former IPS officer and member of National Security Advisory Board.The views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/mirwaiz-maulana-farooq-a-champion-of-kashmiriyat-101621513123808.html
20-05-2021||Today's||A broken polity, a ghost State||The devastating second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic has caused an unfortunate and avoidable catastrophe. It is a crisis like no other in the living memory. As desperate scenes started beaming on television, and social media platforms were flooded with cries for help, India was forced to face the reality of its broken polity and a ghost State. And let there be no doubt — we, as a polity, have been found wanting when faced with the greatest challenge of our times.India lacks State capacity to ensure basic law and order and provide public services even in normal times. There are only 139 government employees for every 100,000 people, excluding railways and postal departments. In contrast, the United States (US), with its “minimum government”, has 668 government employees per 100,000 residents. Most government employees in India work in the railways, postal department, home ministry, and defence, while areas such as health and urban development have only a skeleton of the staffing they need. No one should be surprised that the State melted away when faced with the ferocity of the second wave.Also Watch | Now, rapid Covid-19 testing at home with CoviSelf: All you need to knowWhen did we ever invest in health care? The first five-year plan pointed out the lack of medical staff (doctors, radiologists, nurses etc) as the most critical challenge facing health care. Did we fix it? Despite the massive increase in seats in medical colleges in the last six years, we are still far from it. The apathy to the expansion of quality educational capacity in the realm of health in India is perplexing.India got its first National Health Policy only in 1983. The abysmal condition of public hospitals and primary health care centres is well-documented, and experienced by citizens on an every day basis. Government doctors are poorly paid, burdened with implementing random government policies under acute shortage of resources and infrastructure, forced to double up as administrative staff due to undeclared freeze on hiring in government departments, and treated humiliatingly by the administration. Even political parties that rose to power on the plank of social justice have mostly fared poorly on health and education.Despite the certainty of the second wave, state governments did little to ensure basic facilities such as oxygen supply or ramp up the creaking health care infrastructure in smaller towns and villages. In its zeal to show that normalcy has returned, the Uttarakhand government irresponsibly allowed Kumbh. Universities and educational institutes were asking professors to conduct online classes from the university premises rather than work from home. The judiciary in Uttar Pradesh pushed for panchayat elections in April. The government failed to oppose it vigorously, and the opposition, too, decried delay in elections as the “murder of democracy”. In fact, Opposition parties have been rejecting the push for a virtual election campaign since Bihar 2020.Even till the end of March, it was not uncommon to hear conspiracy theories and the dismissal of the threat of the virus — variously labelled as government-created hype or a grand capitalist conspiracy to restructure wealth distribution and benefit large corporations. In small towns and villages, hardly anyone was wearing masks. Political parties rampantly promoted anti-vaccine sentiments, and many in the 45-plus age group refused to get vaccinated. Marriages were still happening in mid-April in Delhi-NCR, despite the unfolding situation.Also Read | ‘Strategy to deal with Covid should be dynamic, innovative’: PM ModiProtests led by rich landlords and arhatiyas against the beneficial farm laws continued to block main roads to Delhi, forcing critical oxygen tankers to be re-routed. Farm protests and large meetings in the villages were one of the factors behind the spread of new variants in and around Delhi.The crisis has shown us the reality of what we are — a third world country with delusions of being a Vishwaguru and becoming a great power when we do not have oxygen plants even in large hospitals, as oxygen supplier lobbies subvert the decision-making process. Several hospital staff colluded in the black-marketing of medicines, and manufacturers did not hesitate to flood the market with fake life-saving drugs.And so here we are today: Where open post-poll violence in Bengal amid a pandemic is called victory of democracy. Where a chief minister is more interested in spending on advertisements and theatrics instead of placing the vaccine order. Where the Opposition is busy in creating toolkits of propaganda instead of interrogating the government on legitimate issues, of which there is no dearth. Where vaccine manufacturers are hounded and demonised. Where an eight-month pregnant schoolteacher is denied leave from panchayat election duty and dies.Where middle-class incomes are severely damaged because of repeated shocks — a wealth shock due to the collapse of real estate after demonetisation; the lockdown-induced job losses and salary cuts in the first wave; and catastrophic health expenditure and loss of lives in the second wave. Where small and medium enterprises and businesses will find it hard to recover for years to come. And where the rich and the powerful, including politicians and bureaucrats, have learnt, for the first time, that they are as safe as the last person on the street.It is a moment of reckoning for India. We need to start the painstaking task of building a high-end State with a genuine capacity to govern, protect and serve its people.Abhinav Prakash Singh is an assistant professor, economics, Sri Ram College of CommerceThe views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/a-broken-polity-a-ghost-state-101621512223792.html
20-05-2021||Editorials||30 years later, the life and legacy of Rajiv Gandhi||Rajiv Gandhi was an unusual Indian politician. He had seen both his grandfather and mother as prime ministers and grown up in a political home — yet he maintained a distinct professional identity as a pilot and attempted to live a regular urban upper middle class life, till his brother, Sanjay Gandhi’s air crash altered the trajectory of his family and Indian politics. Responding to the call of his mother, Indira, over the objections of his wife, Sonia, Rajiv Gandhi entered politics — only to become prime minister within three years, as his mother fell to assassins.This distinct background lent Rajiv Gandhi a fresh perspective when he swept to power. His historic 1985 address to the Congress, during its centenary, was a blistering critique of the way the party functioned (and it may not be coincidence that Rahul Gandhi is similarly ambivalent about his party’s political culture). He brought in technology to governance, empowered panchayati raj institutions, engineered domestic peace agreements, shepherded a rapprochement with China, promoted education for the marginalised, and mentored a generation of young leaders and technocrats who continue to play a role in Indian public life. But eventually, Rajiv Gandhi got ensnared in the same political culture he so disapproved. He practised identity politics with disastrous consequences (Shah Bano being the most obvious example), mishandled Kashmir (the scars of the rigged 1987 elections are still present), got accused of corruption (which, to be fair, never got proven in the case of Bofors but left questions about his political judgment), and led India into a disastrous military conflict in trying to keep peace in Sri Lanka, with tragic consequences.Rajiv Gandhi’s assassination on May 21,1991 was a national tragedy. To be true to his legacy, India must never allow terrorism to win, even as his party must build on his commitment to modernity and grassroots democracy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/30-years-later-the-life-and-legacy-of-rajiv-gandhi-101621511503845.html
20-05-2021||Editorials||In Myanmar, a coup-induced crisis||Nearly 15,000 people from Myanmar have entered India since February, a Mizoram government official told Reuters on Tuesday. More are expected to enter, as the fighting between the military regime and insurgents intensifies. On March 10, the Centre sent a note to Mizoram, Manipur, Nagaland and Arunachal Pradesh, asking them to stop the influx and deport anyone who managed to get in. However, Mizoram’s chief minister, Zoramthanga, said that his government would take a humanitarian approach. This was not surprising; communities in the region share deep cultural and ethnic ties across the political border.For Delhi, the coup in Myanmar presented a dilemma, since it was torn between its values (which would require standing with democracy) and interests (which would require working with the military). But it is quite clear that this distinction doesn’t hold, for Myanmar’s undemocratic turn is clearly impinging on Indian interests — including its connectivity efforts and security interests. Domestically, New Delhi’s stance on the conflict-generated migrants can also impact Centre-state relations, especially in a sensitive region such as the Northeast. To be sure, India is not under any legal obligation to provide shelter because it is not a party to the 1951 UN Refugee Convention and its 1967 Protocol. The lack of a formal legal framework, domestically and internationally, has allowed India to follow an ad hoc approach on conflict-generated migrants, depending on their salience in domestic politics and the larger public mood. However, the customary principle of non-refoulement prohibits any State from deporting an individual back to a country where they face a threat.Also Read | More than 15,000 people from Myanmar shelter in Mizoram: OfficialIndia has to reconcile its immediate interest (keeping the influx at a manageable level) with its long-term humanitarian and democratic traditions. New Delhi should have a calibrated approach, as it seems to be doing now, leaving the humanitarian assistance to the states. But in the long-term, India must debate and formulate a refugee policy, which should look at repatriation, engagement with United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, so that other executive authorities are not put to the test every time there is an inflow of migrants. In addition, to tackle the roots of the crisis, as academic Avinash Paliwal wrote in these pages, New Delhi must bury its Tatmadaw-centric approach and quickly build relations with other power centres that seek a federal and inclusive Myanmar. Supporting Asean’s mediation efforts in Myanmar will help, but so will bring India’s own diplomatic weight to strongly counsel and warn the military regime.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/in-myanmar-a-coup-induced-crisis-101621511263522.html
