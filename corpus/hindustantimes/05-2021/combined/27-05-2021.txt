27-05-2021||News||The political variables that will shape the 2024 verdict||The 2024 general elections are almost three years away. But then, thanks to intermittent state elections, India is in perpetual election mode. The prevailing circumstances in the country — a raging pandemic, slow pace of vaccinations, derailed economic recovery and strained government finances — entail turbulent times for incumbents both at the Centre and in the states. How will it translate into results? HT analyses what a countdown to 2024 might look like from here on.West Bengal has already put the BJP on a back foot There was a lot riding for the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on the West Bengal results. It had won 18 Lok Sabha segments in the state in 2019, which played an important role in pushing up its overall tally despite a loss of nine seats in the state of Uttar Pradesh. The All India Trinamool Congress (TMC) scored a massive victory over the BJP in the recently held elections in the state with a vote share of 48% and seat share of 73%. The BJP actually suffered a decline of two percentage points, when compared to 2019, in its vote share. Because the TMC’s vote share increased, it cut into the support base of both the BJP and the Left-Congress alliance (especially the latter), and seat shares changed disproportionately compared to vote share.If the 2021 assembly results are extrapolated at the Lok Sabha level, the BJP would get only 10 out of the 42 Lok Sabha segments in the state. To be sure, existing trends need not hold until 2024 and there is an increasing disjunct between national and state polls. The BJP is the only opposition voice in the state now and it would seize any opportunity given by a misstep of the Mamata Banerjee government. At the same time, the BJP organisation will be vulnerable to the TMC’s renewed hegemonic status in the state. However, between now and 2024, it is the TMC which will be seen as having a political edge in the state.Uttar Pradesh in 2022 will set the mood for 2024, BJP has a massive lead there The 2022 assembly elections in Uttar Pradesh will be the most important political contest before the 2024 general elections. This is so for two reasons. One, Uttar Pradesh sends the largest number of MPs to the Lok Sabha and the BJP has swept the state in both 2014 and 2019 elections. It won 71 and 62 out of the 80 Lok Sabha segments in the state in these polls in 2014 and 2019 respectively. Uttar Pradesh is also one of the biggest success stories of the BJP’s polarisation politics.The BJP’s 2014 and 2017 victories in Uttar Pradesh came against a divided opposition. The two regional heavyweights Samajwadi Party (SP) and Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) contested the elections separately. Their coming together in 2019 made the BJP look vulnerable in terms of pre-2019 arithmetic. But the BJP increased its vote share significantly and managed to cut its losses to just nine Lok Sabha segments. It is this massive lead in Uttar Pradesh which makes an upset in 2022 extremely unlikely for the BJP. The fact that an SP-BSP alliance is also unlikely in 2022 will only add to the BJP’s political advantage. To be sure, it could be the case that the BJP faces massive headwinds against the Yogi Adityanath government in the polls.Also Read | India runs the risk of losing its pharma edgeHT has analysed how different levels of swing at the AC-level could affect BJP’s tally at the state level. This shows that compared to the 2017 election, a swing of up to 5 percent of total votes at the AC-level away from the BJP and to its nearest rival in the AC would still leave the BJP with 211 of the 403 ACs in the state. The BJP had won 312 out of the 403 ACs in the 2017 election. At a swing of 10 percentage points, the BJP would not win a majority of ACs, but neither would any other party. To be sure, a 10 percentage points swing compared to the 2019 election disaggregated at the AC-level would make the SP, BSP alliance in that election a winner (but not a 5 percentage point swing).The anti-BJP baton will be with the Congress in the last lap Four out of the last five major state elections before the 2024 contest will see a direct contest between the BJP and the Congress. These are the states of Gujarat (which will go to poll at the end of 2022) and Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh elections (scheduled for the end of 2023). To be sure, Karnataka, which will have elections in first half of 2023 could also see a Congress-BJP contest in most parts of the state. The Janata Dal (Secular)’s pocket of influence is mostly confined to a few districts in southern Karnataka. It is these states which saw the most radical upsets between latest assembly election and Lok Sabha results in 2019.Also Read | Covid-19 and the disease of inequalityThe BJP’s seat share – calculated at the Lok Sabha level – increased from 47% to 92% between the state and national polls in these four states. This was achieved on the basis of a significant increase in vote share. The BJP’s ability to bounce back from these assembly elections upsets in 2019 is what created a big question mark on the Congress leadership’s ability to create a narrative against Narendra Modi. The BJP’s success or failure in the penultimate round before 2024 will be inversely dependent on the Congress’s ability to put its house in order.The latest election cycle has triggered talks of a federal front in the 2024 elections once again. The TMC, the Communist Party of India (Marxist) led Left Democratic Front in Kerala and the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) led alliance in Tamil Nadu has won 78 out of the 101 Lok Sabha Seats in these states. The BJP might face a stronger opposition in the Maharashtra on account of a combined alliance of Shiv Sena, Nationalist Congress Party and the Congress and suffer headwinds in Haryana because of the farmers’ movement. But it needs to be remembered that 182 out of its 303 Lok Sabha seats in 2019 came from the states of Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Karnataka. The National Democratic Alliance managed to retain Bihar in 2020. Without any serious reverses in the forthcoming state polls in its strongholds, the BJP will enter the 2024 contest as the favourite.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/the-political-variables-that-will-shape-the-2024-verdict-101622120759122.html
27-05-2021||News||How India’s water mission is overcoming the challenge in the Northeast||Sering, a small uphill village in Arunachal Pradesh’s Kamle district, home to the ethnic Nyishi tribe, seems like a relic from a lost century.Located 2,000 feet above mean sea level, it’s connected only by rough walking trails, turning and twisting through thickets and forested hills. The nearest motorable road is about 22 km away. Such remoteness has often thwarted even basic infrastructure creation in this eastern most Indian Himalayan state.To an outsider, the underpopulated hamlet, with just 140 people, feels like paradise, but life for the community can quickly turn into hell.Being rain-surplus, landslides and heavy rains often cut off links to the district headquarters, Raga. Winters are freezing at sub-zero temperatures. Monsoon rains are incessant. Weather patterns like these make trails to mountain springs, the only source of water, dangerous, slippery and sometimes inaccessible.Therefore, when, three months ago, the village blipped on a national grid showing India’s remotest places to be connected with piped drinking water facilities, it was a momentous occasion.Also Read | Dewas catches the rain where it fallsThe piped water facilities for the village was created under the flagship Jal Jeevan Mission, a programme to provide drinking water to every rural household by 2024. It is funded by the federal government, with states contributing their share. For most states, the funding pattern between the Centre and states stands at 60:40 ratio. For the disadvantaged northeastern states, the central government funds 90% of the costs.In the northeast, the Har Ghar Jal programme, or water for every home, faces challenges quite distinct from those that typically crop up while creating water facilities in parched plains.The engineering challengeIt is in the hilly states of India’s northeast where the water mission faces its toughest engineering challenges. For instance, unlike in Rajasthan, Arunachal Pradesh has surplus water. The problems are therefore not about scarcity but tapping water and channelling them into households in hilly topographies.Sering typifies these challenges. It was indeed an uphill task to get potable water to each of the homes. The Nyishis are one of the largest native tribes of Arunachal Pradesh, who depend on slash-and-burn terraced rice paddies for livelihood.For years, Sering’s small community has relied on arduous treks to nearby springs to fetch water. “In hilly areas, the challenge is to create gravity-based water supply system,” says Bharat Lal, the chief of Jal Jeevan Mission’s Har Ghar Jal programme at the Jal Shakti ministry.Quite simply, it means using the force of natural gravity to move water downhill from a highland source, such as spring or a waterfall. An intake structure is built to tap or collect water, which is then channelised into people’s homes through solar-powered pumps.“The biggest challenge for us was ferrying all the equipment because there is no motorable road,” says Kengu Ngondir, the village head. “Villagers carried cement, pipes, construction material and even boulders on their heads from the dumping site.”The engineering challenge was even more critical. It involved building a collection structure precisely at a point in a nearby stream where it moves the fastest because of gravitational force. The collection structure had to be built on top of another concrete structure to offer it stability.Broksarthang is another small village in West Kameng district of Arunachal Pradesh, located close to the international withBhutan at an altitude of around 2,900 meters above mean sea level.Broksarthang has 22 households of roughly 170 persons belonging to Brokpa tribe, which rear yaks for a living. The village is about 70 km from the district headquarters of Bomdila, the point till which Chinese troops had intruded during the 1962 Indo-China war.“Creating the infrastructure was tough for the public health engineering department because of the height at the which the village is situated. Even though there were 22 households, we had to provide them with drinking water because the village faced acute water crisis,” said Tage Lowang, an engineer with the state’s public health engineering department over the phone from Bomdila.Also Read | Jal Jeevan mission goes digital in five statesThe main water plant for Broksarthang is based on piped gravity system and has been designed for the future needs at a cost of ₹67 lakh, along with a treatment plant.Incentivising statesGiven their terrain and challenges, the Centre has provided the northeastern states of Arunachal Pradesh, Manipur, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Sikkim, a performance incentive grant of ₹465 crore for 2020-21 under Jal Jeevan Mission. The grant is also available for Gujarat and Himachal Pradesh. For FY 2020-21, the Centre has allocated ₹11,000 crore for the Jal Jeevan Mission.Meghalaya has proposed 100% tap connections to all 589,000 households by December 2022. Allocation for Meghalaya was hiked to ₹174.92 crore in 2020-21. With opening balance of ₹17.46 crore and along with this year’s allocation of ₹174.92 crore, Meghalaya has assured availability of ₹192.38 crore of funds, said Bonoy Sangma, a senior public health engineering official in Shillong.Meghalaya has installed over 68,000 functional household tap connections under the Jal Jeevan Mission so far.Manipur, another rain-surplus northeastern state, faces acute water shortage during lean seasons. The state has got ₹3,050-crore Manipur Water Supply Project under the Jal Jeevan Mission-Har Ghar Jal Scheme.The Centre has provided funds for household tap connections to 142,749 households, while the remaining 30% households will be covered by the state government through additional funding from the department for development of north eastern region.Overall, some northeastern states, such as Meghalaya, are behind the targets in creating water supply facilities. “Most far-flung difficult-to-reach areas, cut off from the modern world, have been tapped now. The rest of state will not be as difficult and we’ll catch up,” says Dylan Sangma, a Meghalaya official in charge of the works.(This is the final part of a four part series on India’s water crisis and the ambitious Jal Jeevan Mission)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/how-india-s-water-mission-is-overcoming-the-challenge-in-the-northeast-101622118539428.html
27-05-2021||News||What’s behind India’s acute shortage of life-saving medical devices?||When the coronavirus pandemic first hit India in 2020, the import-dependent medical devices industry — a cornerstone of the country’s health sector — was already in a churn, scrambling to establish new sources of raw materials and supply lines. This uncertainty would only prove catastrophic when a deadlier second wave suddenly took hold this summer.Most modern medical devices, on the inside, have high-end electronic components. The biomedical and electronics industries were trying to shift supply lines away from China when the pandemic hit, following India’s border conflagration with the neighbour in 2020.The industry is still caught in that transition, manufacturers said. Challenging problems of sourcing of raw materials in the electronics sector have rippled on to the medical-devices industry, experts point out.The crisis The second Covid wave, which has now shown signs of ebbing, brought India’s public health system to its knees. Shortages of life-saving equipment, from ventilators to oxygen concentrators, was at the heart of the crisis. Policies to incentivise domestic manufacturing of medical gear need a relook if the country is to stave off a similar situation in future, experts said.“During the second wave, in which there was a markedly higher demand for oxygen compared to the first wave, we simply could not cope with the demand,” said Shanta Kumar, the managing director of Southern Electronics (Bangalore) Pvt Ltd. Kumar’s company primarily makes oxygen concentrators and is affiliated to the Association of Indian Medical Device Industry, a lobby group. According to Kumar, the medical devices industry has apprised the government of critical issues faced by the industry, such as the issue of sourcing.The Indian medical devices sector, which has the highest potential within the health care market, was valued at ₹50,026 crore for 2018-19, according to latest official figures available. It is expected to reach to ₹86,840 crore by 2021-22. India depends on imports of up 85% to meet its total domestic demand for medical devices.Also Read | India runs the risk of losing its pharma edgeIndian manufacturers, who imported nearly ₹43,000 crore worth of medical equipment in 2018-19, haven’t been able to take enough advantage of key policies intended to boost domestic production due to a painful transition to alternative suppliers forced by India’s conflict with China, a large supplier of raw materials for India.The government’s push and its limitsThe government has a clutch of schemes running to boost domestic manufacturing medical devices. Two of these were approved by the Cabinet on March 21, 2020.One is the performance-linked incentive (PLI) scheme to boost domestic manufacturing of medical devices worth ₹3,420 crore over the next five fiscals.Two, the government also launched a scheme to finance promotion of medical device parks for bulk production with common infrastructure facilities in four designated medical device parks. The programme is worth ₹400 crore. The scheme for promotion of medical device parks also covers cancer-care devices, imaging devices, cardio-respiratory gear, cochlear implants and pacemakers.The PLI scheme offers eligible manufacturing companies and sectors a 4-6% incentive on incremental sales over the base year of 2019-20 for a five-year period. When a firm achieves a given sales target, it qualifies for the incentive. Since the electronics industry, which supplies to medical-equipment manufacturers, began shifting supply lines away from China in 2020, the “base year of 2019-20” designed into the PLI scheme for medical goods has proven to be of no help, analysts say.Here’s why. The base year is not simply a cut-off date. It has far-reaching consequences for the performance of the PLI scheme, especially in the electronics and medical devices sector.Also Read | Local trials for Covid shots scrapped to fast-track imports“The PLI scheme captures (sales) milestone over a base year of production. If you change the base year to 2021 from the existing 2020, then you can tackle a lot of these sourcing issues,” said economist Pronab Sen. Changing the base year to 2021 from 2020 would “base” the scheme in the year when supply disruptions have been most acute. “So, there is a fair amount of legitimacy to the demand to change the base year, but so far, the government hasn’t taken any decision,” Sen added.Switching the year base to 2021 will mean the industry doesn’t lose a precious year of financial incentives, because currently, it is focusing on transitioning to new supply sources, rather than ramping up manufacturing.Prior to the border dispute with China, supplies were not a problem. Firms are still scrambling for alternative suppliers, whose specifications may not be the same as old suppliers, experts say.The changes in specifications require new production lines to be established, which could take up to a year, even as India battles a shortage of medical equipment, Sen said.A way forward on PLI schemeFirms have also demanded hiking the 5% incentive of the PLI scheme in the medical devices sector to 10%, which is the incentive rate for the auto sector, for instance. “This will automatically give policy primacy to the medical industry,” said a spokesperson of Unisur Lifecare Private Limited, also affiliated to the Association of Indian Medical Device Industry.A top-level meeting was held early this month to review all current schemes available to the bio-medical goods and phama sectors, an official of the DV Sadananda Gowda-headed chemical and fertilizers ministry said, requesting not to be quoted.The government may restructure the PLI scheme to focus on manufacturers of medical equipment needed for the “fight and containment of Covid-19”, the official said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/whats-behind-india-s-acute-shortage-of-life-saving-medical-devices-101622115154512.html
27-05-2021||News||BJP works on new West Bengal strategy as CBI breathes down TMC’s neck||The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is working on a new strategy to regain ground in Bengal before the 2024 Lok Sabha elections. A significant part of this strategy, party leaders said, is to reach out to people with a new approach that will make the BJP more acceptable and help it counter the general perception that in Bengal it is represented mainly by Trinamool Congress (TMC) turncoats, who switched sides prior to the assembly polls this year.The BJP, which dealt a major blow to the TMC in 2019 by winning 18 of Bengal’s 42 Lok Sabha seats, ended up securing only 77 of the 294 assembly seats, falling far short of its target to oust the ruling party by wresting more than 200.The BJP’s tally in the assembly has now come down to 75 as two of its winning candidates resigned to retain their Lok Sabha seats. Polls were held for 292 of the 294 seats as two candidates died of Covid-19.TMC secured 47.94% of the votes polled against the BJP’s share of 38.13%, a difference of 9.81%. In 2011, when the TMC and Congress fought as allies and ousted the Left Front government, the difference in vote share between the winners and losers was 7.6%.“We have not yet done a detailed analysis of the poll results, but the preliminary study indicates that public perception even in large parts of Hindu-dominated areas was not in our favour. While the TMC branded the BJP as a party of Hindi-speaking people from north and central India, the presence of so many TMC turncoats led to a sort of identity crisis. Despite having a presence in Bengal since its inception, no matter how small, the Bengal BJP failed to project its own identity. We will focus on this now,” said a BJP leader who spoke on the condition of anonymity.Also Read | For rural India, it is the golden hourThe BJP is working on plans to secure the confidence of Bengal’s voters by working on the ground. On Monday, when the state government was preparing to face cyclone Yaas, BJP national president J P Nadda virtually addressed the party’s Bengal MLAs and MPs and asked them to go on overdrive during relief operations.Countering the outsider tagIn the assembly polls, the battle for securing votes of various castes, sub-castes, religions and linguistic groups, manifested itself in two narratives. The BJP primarily projected Banerjee as an “appeaser,” a code for what the party alleges is the TMC government’s pro-Muslim tilt. Banerjee labelled the BJP’s national leaders from the Hindi belt as “bahiragato” (outsiders) to Bengal’s culture and spirit.Since the results indicate that the “outsider” narrative influenced more voters, BJP wants to counter it effectively.“The outsider tag did not influence voters in many rural areas of north Bengal and south Bengal districts located along the Indo-Bangladesh border where non-Bengali voters are almost non-existent. We secured seats in these regions. Right now, our job is to stand by people facing post-poll violence,” said BJP state vice-president Ritesh Tiwari.Another BJP leader, who did not wish to be named, said they need to focus on the sensitivities of Bengalis. He referred to the raising of the Jai Sri Ram slogans at the celebration of freedom fighter Subhas Chandra Bose’s birthday in presence of Prime Minister Narendra Modi in Kolkata on January 21.“Modi’s bid to celebrate Bose’s birthday as Parakram Diwas (day of valour) ran into a political debate with Mamata Banerjee expressing anger at BJP supporters present at the event raising the slogan. Bengali voters, on whom Bose’s ideology has great influence even 76 years after his disappearance, did not take the sloganeering well. The Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) and some old leaders of the BJP’s Bengal unit, such as chief spokesperson Samik Bhattacharya, said the sloganeering was uncalled for but central leaders from other states accused Banerjee of politicising the issue and being insensitive towards Hindus,” the BJP leader said.“In the coming days, we have to rethink our ideological stand in reference to the Bengali psyche. The positive response we were getting till January started evaporating after that incident. Also, repeated references to Banerjee as pishi (aunt) and Abhishek Banerjee as bhaipo (nephew) in the campaign speeches of Modi and other BJP leaders had a counter effect on the Bengali mind,” he added.Crucial CBI and ED casesEighteen days after Banerjee returned to power, the CBI arrested her heavyweight ministers Subrata Mukherjee and Firhad Hakim, MLA Madan Mitra and former TMC leader Sovan Chatterjee in the 2016 Narada sting operation case in which they are accused of accepting bribes to the tune of ₹4 to 5 lakh each. The leaders are still in judicial custody. CBI officials say more arrests and charge sheets are in the pipeline in the Narada and other cases. Their counterparts in the Enforcement Directorate, who are conducting parallel probes in these cases, have dropped similar hints.Although the BJP has dismissed allegations that its central leaders and Union ministers are influencing the probe agencies to cripple the TMC, many in the Bengal saffron camp do not deny this during private conversations that prosecution of accused TMC leaders will help them regain strength.The same leaders, however, also accept that with BJP national vice-president and MLA Mukul Roy and leader of the opposition in the Bengal assembly Suvendu Adhikari, who defeated Banerjee, being accused in the Narada case, banking on the outcome of CBI probes may not be a good idea.The central agencies began to act against TMC leaders before the polls. The chief minister and TMC youth wing president Abhishek Banerjee became the prime targets in the campaign speeches of all BJP leaders, including Modi and Union home minister Amit Shah.The BJP has alleged that Abhishek Banerjee was involved in a coal smuggling case. The probe got a boost on December 31 when the CBI raided three residences of businessman and TMC’s youth front general secretary Vinay Mishra. He has been declared an absconder.It is alleged that illegally mined coal, worth several thousand crores of rupees, has been sold in the black market over several years by a racket operating in the western parts of Bengal where the Eastern Coalfields Limited runs several mines.The CBI has questioned Abhishek Banerjee’s wife, Rujira, and her sister Maneka Gambhir. The latter’s husband, Ankush Arora, and his father Pawan Arora have also been grilled.The central probe agencies started speeding up the investigations from August 2020 when the Kolkata office of the CBI, which is also probing the Saradha, Rose Valley and MPS Group Ponzi fund scams involving thousands of crores of rupees, revamped its team in the economic offence wing. New officers flew from Delhi. During the same month, the ED sent notices to five TMC leaders in connection with the Narada sting operation case. But this was only the beginning.On August 24, the ED asked Lok Sabha members Saugata Roy and Kakali Ghosh Dastidar, former Lok Sabha member Aparupa Poddar, then TMC minister Suvendu Adhikari and former leader Sovan Chatterjee’s estranged wife, Ratna Chatterjee, to furnish details of their properties in connection with the Narada case.“The ED served me notice after several years. There are clear indications of a political vendetta,” said Saugata Roy.Adhikari left the TMC and joined BJP in December. In the recent polls, he made news by defeating Mamata Banerjee in Nandigram by around 1,900 votes.In March 2017, the CBI also registered an FIR against then TMC Rajya Sabha MP Mukul Roy, who joined the BJP in October that year and became the opposition party’s election strategist in Bengal.Roy and Adhikari have now become prime targets of the TMC.“Unlike Adhikari, Roy did not mention in his declaration to the Election Commission (EC) that he is an FIR-named accused in the Narada case. Why weren’t they arrested along with the four others?” said TMC spokesperson Kunal Ghosh.The CBI also wants to wrap up the Saradha Ponzi fund case involving an estimated ₹2,460 crore that was raised from around 1.8 million depositors from West Bengal, Assam, Jharkhand, Odisha, and Chhattisgarh.Sudipta Sen, who owned the group, is in jail. Before the assembly polls, Sen wrote a letter to the state government saying he gave a huge amount of money to Adhikari in instalments. BJP has called this a conspiracy to put Adhikari in trouble.BJP leaders admit that the Saradha case is crucial for them because there are allegations that money from the group was used to fund Jago Bangla, the TMC mouthpiece.In August 2019, TMC Rajya Sabha MP and national spokesperson, Derek O’Brien, was questioned by the CBI as he is the publisher of the mouthpiece. Subrata Bakshi, its editor and TMC’s national general secretary, was summoned too.The Rose Valley scam, estimated at ₹17,000 core, is however the biggest Ponzi scam in Bengal in terms of money involved. In 2014, the Supreme Court asked the CBI to investigate the scams and the role of influential people in money laundering. The ED is running a parallel probe.“The Calcutta high court is overseeing the probes as well as the refund of money to investors, around 200 of whom have died by suicide in these years,” said lawyer Arindam Das who represents the cheated investors of Saradha, Rose Valley and MPS groups.“If the probe agencies arrest top TMC leaders and file charge sheet the ruling party will be in trouble. But there is a catch. Former TMC leaders, such as Adhikari, can land in trouble too. Also, the TMC will intensify its campaign saying we are influencing the agencies to make up for our organisational weakness,” said a senior BJP leader who did not want to be named.Columnist and political commentator Suvashis Maitra said, “BJP will always run the risk of being bracketed as a party that uses probe agencies because CBI and ED work under the Centre. For a long time, there has been a demand to make the CBI an autonomous body like the Election Commission.”Helping people during the pandemicDuring a recent virtual meeting, BJP central leaders from Delhi instructed that all MLAs must be in touch with workers on the field and help people affected by the Covid pandemic. The party feels that this may have a far-reaching effect.“We were told that our MLAs must help the administration set up camps for vaccination, distribute sanitisers and masks and spread awareness among people. This will help the BJP reach out to those who did not vote for us and send out a positive message,” said a BJP state committee member.The party acted on this immediately.Actor-turned-politician Hiranmay Chatterjee, who won the Kharagpur Sadar seat, former economic adviser to the Centre, Ashok Lahiri, who wrested the Balurghat seat, Krishna Kumar Kalyani, the MLA from Raigunj, Subrata Maitra from Berhampore and Shankar Ghosh from Siliguri are among many new legislators who are actively working on the field. More MLAs have followed them.Facing an uphill taskIn the recent polls, the BJP managed to regain the trust of many Hindu, tribal and Dalit voters, who backed the saffron camp in the 2019 Lok Sabha polls in the south Bengal region which comprises 240 assembly segments.In north Bengal, on the other hand, two prominent TMC ministers lost while BJP candidates won 30 of the region’s 54 assembly segments.In terms of the 2019 Lok Sabha results, the BJP was ahead of the ruling party in 121 assembly segments. But the picture changed in most of the south Bengal districts during an unprecedented eight-phase assembly election.Regaining that lost ground before 2024 is the party’s main priority and it is an uphill task, BJP leaders said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/bjp-works-on-new-west-bengal-strategy-as-cbi-breathes-down-tmc-s-neck-101622031854170.html
27-05-2021||Other||Delhi HC asks IRDA to consider insurance claims of Covid patients who couldn’t get hospital beds||New Delhi: The Delhi high court on Thursday said that several people were not able to avail the benefit of the insurance policies during the second wave of the pandemic as they did not get hospital beds, “not due to their fault, but for the dearth of infrastructure”.A bench of justices Vipin Sanghi and Jasmeet Singh, while noting that thousands of patients had to take treatment at home, asked the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority (IRDA) to consider such cases and see whether the insurance claim can be given to the insurers.“It’s a matter of common knowledge and we can take judicial notice at the same time that for about 3-4 weeks when the current wave of pandemic was at its height, there was acute shortage of hospital beds, not only in NCT of Delhi but all over the country. People suffering from Covid-19 requiring hospital were not getting beds much less ICU beds and those with ventilators. Thus thousands of patients had to take treatment at home and make arrangements at home.”“The insurance policies issued by several insurance companies which have been in existence do not cover claims unless the insurer is a hospital. It appears that it is only the Corona kavach policy which has been introduced as a standard policy. However, a large number of insured people would not be able to receive any benefit under the insurance policies held by them only because they did not get hospitalization for no fault of theirs, but for the dearth of infrastructure,” the court noted in its order.According to the insurance companies, the claims could be made on their policies, only if they are hospitalized for at least 24 hours.The bench also noted a submission by central government standing counsel Amit Mahajn who said that several people who have been paying premiums for years but did not get the insurance premium. Petitioner lawyer Rakesh Malhotra also told the court that he could not avail the insurance claims because he was discharged 23 hours later than the stipulated time to avail the benefit.“It seems unfair if somebody is paying insurance for 20 years but when he actually wants it... Now IRDA has come up with a new policy which is a good thing covering home care also,” the court noted even as the insurance companies were not doing charity but also making money.During the hearing, advocate Abhishek Nanda, appearing for the IRDA, told the court that they have introduced four new policies the first among them being the Corona Kawach policy which is a common policy which is mandatory for all the companies to issue it. He said that these were short term policies issued for specific months.He submitted that Corona Rakshak has been also issued by IRDA but it’s not mandatory for all the insurance companies to issue. He informed the court that more than 31 lakhs insurance policies have been sold.However, the bench did not seem impressed with the figures and said, “If you consider the population of this Country, this isn’t enough…. We feel it’s a very minuscule number”.It also questioned the provision of the Corona Kavach policy that covered only the age group of 18-65. “The data which we have shows that people who are above 65 are more prone to covid.

An FIR was registered following this and four persons were arrested.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/delhimatrix-cellular-s-plea-to-release-seized-concentrators-rejected-101622139660480.html

Around 24.32 lakh people in this age group have been vaccinated…,” said Atishi, the AAP’s Kalkaji MLA. So far, a total of 5.2 million people in the Capital have got at least one dose of the vaccine, of which 1.18 million have got both doses, showed government data. However, Atishi reiterated that the Capital needed more vaccine doses if it were to continue inoculating all eligible age groups “In Delhi, all vaccine sites for the 18-45 age group in public schools have been closed for four days now… On May 26, only about 34,000 people were vaccinated, of which 30,000 were given the first dose while the rest got the second. This is much lower than 130,000-140,000 people we were vaccinating a day till two weeks ago. We are facing a major vaccine shortage,” said Atishi. She also said, “Covaxin doses for the 45+ group are over, while we have 11 days’ stock of Covishield… We would like to appeal to the central government again to allow WHO-approved vaccines to be imported into India so that more and more people get vaccinated.” Sisodia inaugurates drive-in jabs centre in Saket Deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia on Thursday inaugurated a temporary drive-through Covid-19 vaccine centre at Select Citywalk shopping mall in south Delhi’s Saket. The centre will be open for two days (Thursday and Friday), and will administer Covaxin doses to those aged between 18 and 45, the mall said in a statement. The mall set the centre up in collaboration with the United by Blood NGO and Fortis Healthcare hospital. The centre is capable of providing a “safer, quicker and effective environment” for vaccination, Sisodia said while inaugurating the centre. On Wednesday, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal inaugurated Delhi’s first drive through vaccine centre set up by a private hospital at a shopping mall in southwest Delhi’s Dwarka Sector 14. In the next few days, the Delhi government is likely to open a drive through vaccine centre at the Chhatrasal stadium in north Delhi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/42-of-those-aged-45-and-above-in-delhi-have-got-at-least-one-vaccine-dose-says-govt-101622139600433.html
27-05-2021||Delhi||Crackdown on drug hoarding: 136 kilos of meds seized after raids in 2,517 shops and units||The Delhi government has intensified its crackdown against the hoarding and black-marketing of life-saving drugs and the special task force (STF) in every district, formed for the purpose, have so far conducted searches in at least 2,517 shops and manufacturing units across the city, senior revenue officials said on Thursday. The move comes at a time when cases of secondary mucormycosis or black fungus are on the rise among Covid-19 recovered patients, which doctors are attributing to the compromised immunity of these persons, most probably as a result of the indiscriminate use of steroids to treat Covid-19, besides underlying conditions such as diabetes. “Acute shortage of medicines to treat black fungus patients is a bigger problem than the increase in the number of cases of this fungal infection. Amphotericin-B is in short supply across the country and each state is getting only a limited number of vials, depending on the caseload of that state or Union Territory. In such a scenario, ensuring that there is no black-marketing or hoarding of such life-saving drugs is of prime importance,” said a member of the STF in Central district, asking not to be named. These STFs, one in each of the 11 districts of Delhi, have officials from the district administration, Delhi Police and the city’s drug control office. Data showed that till May 24, STFs conducted searches in 2,512 shops and five manufacturing units. A total of 25 cases of hoarding and black-marketing of life-saving drugs have been reported so far and 136 kilograms of medicines seized. A total of 67 oxygen cylinders have also been seized in the past few days -- there were eight separate cases of hoarding and black-marketing of oxygen cylinders. A total of 16 FIRs (first information reports) have been lodged so far and 31 persons arrested, the government data further showed.On May 25 alone, the government’s drugs control department suspended the licences of 25 drugstores and initiated action against 12 others for selling medicines used in the treatment of Covid-19 without prescription. Department officials said they sent decoy customers to various stores across the city to purchase ivermectin (to treat parasite infestation), antibiotics such as azithromycin, and steroids to check if these medicines were being sold without a doctor’s prescription. The licences of 25 drugstores were suspended after they sold ivermectin and antibiotics to the decoy customers without prescription on May 14 and 15.Show-cause notices have been sent to 12 other drugstores which were found selling steroids such as dexamethasone and budesonide without prescription on May 17 and 21. Their licences are also likely to be suspended.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/crackdown-on-drug-hoarding-136-kilos-of-meds-seized-after-raids-in-2-517-shops-and-units-101622139481622.html

27-05-2021||Mumbai||Covid-19 vax drive: Lagging districts Maharashtra’s priority||The Maharashtra government on Thursday decided to give priority to districts that are lagging behind in vaccination, by providing more doses to bring them up to the state’s average. State health minister Rajesh Tope said some districts have an average of around 40-50%, while some districts have an average of around 5%. The state, meanwhile, is seeking more information from the eight bidders that have responded to the state’s call for 50 million vaccine doses. Tope added that the Centre should intervene, reiterating that a national policy on vaccine import must be formulated. According to health department officials, districts such as Hingoli, Parbhani, Gadchiroli, Nandurbar, Solapur, Palghar, Beed and Solapur are behind on vaccination drive. These districts are expected to get more vaccines. Officials also added that besides vaccine shortage, vaccine-hesitancy and far-off vaccination centres in tribal districts etc are also reasons for low percentage of beneficiaries there. “In the above 45-years category, the state average is around 27% [vaccination]. Some districts have reached 50-60%, but there are also districts where it is around 5%. Therefore, we have taken a decision regarding vaccine distribution in such districts,” Tope said, after the state cabinet meeting. He also added that the government has decided on a “policy” to give priority to second dose. “Districts where second doses are due, the stock will be provided,” he added. The health minister further said the Centre needs to “intervene” in the matter of importing vaccines. Tope said the “marketing agencies” of vaccine manufacturers Pfizer, Johnson & Johnson, Sputnik and Astra Zeneca have given responses to the global bid. However, some companies have not given their rates, while some have not given their schedule, he said. “We are seeking more details from the companies, but the Centre too must intervene and we are requesting the Centre to give their opinion on this.” The intermediaries who have responded have quoted prices between US$10 to US$18, while it is US$25 for Pfizer and US$23 for AstraZeneca shots. Tope admitted that some companies’ decision to not provide vaccines to state governments has caused a hindrance. “Pfizer has clearly told Punjab [government] that it will not give vaccines to state, but only the Centre. So far, the Centre has given permission to Covishield, Covaxin and Sputnik. They may give it to Pfizer and Moderna also later. Therefore, we appeal to the Centre to formulate a national policy on vaccine import,” he said. Meanwhile, the state administered 278,687 doses till 8pm on Thursday. So far, the state has administered 21,642,190 doses, of which 4,460,587 beneficiaries are fully vaccinated. Mumbai saw 46,156 doses being administered till 8pm on Thursday, while the total doses administered rose to 3,156,422. So far, 754,032 beneficiaries in Mumbai are fully vaccinated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/covid19-vax-drive-lagging-districts-maharashtra-s-priority-101622139001422.html

He also recommended termination of her contractual service, after a probe committee indicted the ANM. The matter came to light on Monday when 29 Covid vaccine -loaded syringes were found in the dustbin at Jamalpur urban primary health centre in Aligarh. The ANM on duty Neha Khan was suspected of allegedly having thrown these syringes. Chief medical officer (CMO), Aligarh, Dr Bhanu Pratap Kalyani ordered probe by a committee of additional CMO Dr MK Mathur and deputy CMO Durgesh Kumar. The ANM denied the allegations, calling them a conspiracy against her. The probe committee reached the urban primary health centre on Tuesday, questioned the staff, including ANM Neha Khan, and submitted its report on Wednesday, following which a show cause notice was issued to the ANM and recommendation made for termination of her services. “No such incident would be tolerated and whosoever is found guilty would face the action,” said DM Chandra Bhushan Singh. To note, there has been much focus on minimizing wastage of Covid vaccine and so the incident at Jamalpur PHC has raised many eyebrows.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/anm-penalised-for-throwing-vaccine-loaded-syringes-in-dustbin-101622139000120.html
27-05-2021||Mumbai||Probe how politicians, film stars procured Covid drugs, Bombay HC directs Maharashtra govt||While appreciating the initiatives of some political leaders and film personalities to help Covid-19 patients, the Bombay high court (HC) on Thursday directed the state government to probe as to how they procured essential Covid drugs that were being allocated by the Central government to different states. The HC also noted that those personalities could not resort to extra-legal methods by bypassing the state, to procure drugs even if their intentions were noble. The division bench of justice AA Sayed and justice Girish Kulkarni, while hearing compliance of its directions by the Centre, state and BMC that were passed in a clutch of public interest litigation (PIL), was informed by the respective counsels that the issues pertaining to fire audit of hospitals, providing oxygen and essential drugs to treat Covid and black fungus infection, bed management, cremation and curbing black marketing of the drugs had been addressed to a large extent. The PILs had alleged that there was large scale mismanagement by the authorities during the second wave of Covid-19, hence sought various directions on shortage of Remdesivir and oxygen supply, curbing black-marketing and profiteering during procurement and distribution of Covid-19 drugs among others. Advocate general Ashutosh Kumbhakoni representing the state while submitting compliance of the earlier orders of the HC in the PILs informed the bench that notices were issued to actor Sonu Sood’s charity foundation and Congress MLA Zeeshan Siddique by the drugs inspector and an inquiry was underway in relation to their procurement of drugs. Kumbhakoni submitted the state affidavit wherein it is stated that the actor and the MLA in response to the inquiry had informed that they had not purchased or stocked the medicines and injections and had merely acted as facilitators. “The reply states that Sood’s foundation requested manufacturers such as Cipla, Jubilant and others to help them to provide required medicines to needy patients,” said Kumbhakoni adding that notices had been issued to the manufacturers. Additional solicitor general Anil Singh informed the bench that the central government had already questioned the manufacturers and they had denied having supplied them to any politician or celebrity. “They might be doing it bonafide, but not realizing the legal repercussions. They want to help somebody but it has to be within the parameters of the law and they cannot have extra-legal methods by which drugs are made available. Those who want to help, let them do that with procedures known to the government,” said the bench. The bench clarified that as neither Sood nor Siddique were party to the case it was not passing any orders against them but directed the state government to caution them and continue with the inquiry. Kumbhakoni then informed that following the recent fire incidents in Covid-19 hospitals, fire audits of 479 out of 520 government hospitals and health centres had been undertaken and directions were issued to them to comply with fire safety norms. Nine establishments had received fire NOC and mock fire drills were successfully conducted in 395 units. With regards to cremation Kumbhakoni submitted that while there was a delay in cremation due to large numbers, there were no cases of denial of decent cremation or burial for want of space like in other states where bodies were consigned to the river without proper cremation. The court then directed the state and civic authorities to install smoke controlling devices in crematoriums to reduce the pollution under the supervision of the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board. On being assured that there was no shortage of oxygen, the bench asked the state to consider passing an ordinance making it mandatory for private hospitals to have their own oxygen manufacturing units to meet the demands in light of the possibility of a third wave of the Covid-19 pandemic. Regarding Mucormycosis cases, Kumbhakoni submitted that to date there were 3,200 cases mainly found in Covid patients and the daily requirement for treating it was 14,000 vials of Amphotericin- B drug however it was receiving only 4,000 vials on an average from May 11 to 25, per day. The PILs will be heard for further compliance on June 2.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/probe-how-politicians-film-stars-procured-covid-drugs-bombay-hc-directs-maharashtra-govt-101622138880187.html

The petition also seeks registration of a first information report (FIR) and initiation of a probe into the threats. The vacation bench of justice SS Shinde and justice NR Borkar, while hearing the petition filed by advocate Datta Mane, was informed that as per a May 4 news report, Poonawalla had been living in fear due to constant pressure from politicians and notable persons demanding that he provide their state with more supply of the Covishield vaccine. Mane’s petition further stated that the Poonawalla family had left for London due to this pressure and threats. The petition further stated that if vaccine manufacturers were subjected to such situations, the manufacturing of the vaccine would be affected. After hearing the petition, the court questioned the locus of the petitioner and said that if Poonawalla was not satisfied by the security already provided to him, he could have approached the authorities. Advocate Pradeep Havnur, however, submitted that criminal law could be set in motion by any person. The court then observed that Poonawalla was doing a good job and a huge service to the nation. “As per our knowledge, he has been given Y-Plus security already. The petitioner is seeking Z-plus security. We are not aware of it. If it is necessary, then the state will give it,” said the bench. The court also noted that as per news reports Adar Poonawalla’s father had clarified that he had gone to London for a break. “The petitioner, being an advocate, will have to bear in mind and be careful next time while arguing this matter as our country has a very good reputation and such proceedings will have an international impact. This is not an ordinary matter,” said the bench and asked the state to respond to the petition.Thereafter, additional public prosecutor SR Shinde for the state government sought time to take instructions from the concerned department and respond to the petition. The bench has posted further hearing of the petition to June 1.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/respond-to-plea-seeking-z-plus-security-for-adar-poonawalla-hc-tells-maharashtra-govt-101622138820186.html
27-05-2021||Mumbai||542 prisoners released from jails in Maharashtra after HPC order; bail pleas of 12,751 pending||Following the May 11 order of the high power committee (HPC) to decongest overcrowding in prisons, in the wake of the second Covid-19 wave, in all 542 prisoners have been released from jails either on emergency bail or Covid parole. However, as bail applications of over 12,000 prisoners remain pending before various courts, jails across the state are still overcrowded despite releasing over 10,000 prisoners last year, on emergency bail/parole.The HPC which, believed the second wave Covid-19 is more virulent and lethal, recommended that the concerned magistrate courts in the state, consider the pending applications for interim bail of the 12,751 under-trial prisoners liberally and on a priority basis for the sake of the safety and welfare of the prisoners.These 12,751 applications for interim bail have pending since last year. For the effective de-congestion in jails, this issue needs to be addressed on a priority basis, said a prison official. According to the prison department as of May 26, 483 and 59 prisoners have been released on bail and emergency parole, respectively, following recommendations of HPC dated May 7 and May 1, 2021. As new prisoners continue to be admitted, the prison population has gone up substantially again. As per the latest statistics, there are 32,362 inmates lodged across 46 jail in the state against the capacity of around 24,000 prisoners. It is also pertinent to note that over 10,800 prisoners, who have been released during the “first wave” of Covid last year, have not been called back and continue to remain on interim bail/emergency parole.As per the official data, the prison population was reduced from 36,061 as of March 31, 2020, to 26,379 as of July 31, 2020, due to the temporary release of eligible prisoners, following the decisions of the HPC. Hence, the impact of the first wave of the pandemic was thereafter diluted and the situation in the prisons had improved in the context of the spread of coronavirus.However, considering the decline in numbers of new Covid-19 cases, the government relaxed the movement restrictions. As a result, regular crime reported to police increased again, thus the number of arrests and accused being sent to judicial custody also gradually increased.From 26,379 prisoners on July 31, 2020, the population in state jails has now reached 34,733 as of May 11, 2021.At present, there are 212 Covid infected active patients (prisoners) in state jails. To date total of 4,023 prisoners got infected by the virus and 13 have succumbed to the disease, since April 2020. Around 840 prison staffers, of the 902, who tested positive, have recovered and nine have succumbed.Another prison officer said that the prison department has a minimum role in the release of prisoners on bail for decongestion, however, it has been adopting other measures to curb the spread of the virus. The department has set up over 41 temporary prisons and Covid care centres (CCC). “Almost all prisons in the state has one temporary prison and a CCC,” said the officer. Most of these temporary prisons are set up in schools and colleges. After the lockdown restrictions were relaxed last year, these temporary prisons were returned to the respective educational institutes. “Unlike last year, this time we would be keeping these temporary prisons functioning as part of our preparation to tackle surge in cases, in case of the third wave,” said a senior prison officer. The process of acquiring buildings for the creation of additional temporary prisons is still on.Steps taken to prevent the spread of Covid in prisons:- Over 41 temporary prisons have been established in the state. Of these, 10 double as Covid Care Centres, where asymptomatic and mildly symptomatic inmates are isolated. - New inmates are accepted only after RT-PCR tests and kept in temporary prisons until their test results are obtained. - Those who test negative are then admitted to a regular prison - Prisoners/inmates above the age of 60 are kept in separate barracks or hospital ward where there are special facilities available e.g. special toilets, equipment etc- Prisons are sanitised every week. Special attention is being paid to toilets - Use of sanitisers, soap, face masks and social distancing, both by inmates as well as prison staffers- Nearly 73,000 Covid-19 tests on inmates and 4,707 on prison staffers have been undertaken so far- 3,456 vaccine jabs were administered to the prisoners- 3,252 staffers out of 3,818 have been vaccinated and the process of vaccination of the balance staffers is in progress- A total of 124 smartphones and 73 coins box sets have been provided for prisoners/inmates to communicate with their lawyers as well as family members.- The video conferencing facilities between the prisons and courts have been put to use for communication with lawyers.- A total of 10,811 prisoners/inmates have been released on emergency parole or interim bail following the outbreak of the pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/542-prisoners-released-from-jails-in-maharashtra-after-hpc-order-bail-pleas-of-12-751-pending-101622138760757.html

27-05-2021||Mumbai||3 jumbo Covid centres shut before Cyclone Tauktae to reopen for patients from June 1||The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has decided to reopen three jumbo Covid centres in Bandra Kurla Complex (BKC), Dahisar and Mulund that were shut as a precautionary measure ahead of Cyclone Tauktae. The centres will reopen for Covid patients from June 1 in a phased manner. The BMC had shut its three jumbo Covid centres before Cyclone Tauktae hit the city on May 17. The civic body, between May 15 and 16, had shifted over 500 Covid patients to nearby hospitals namely SevenHills and Nesco jumbo centres, considering a threat of damage, owing to the high wind speed. Civic officials also used the opportunity to undertake maintenance of these Covid centres and make some structural changes, per BMC’s plan to be prepared for a possible third wave.The tentative date of reopening the three centres is June 1, said, civic officials.However, it has been decided to reopen the centres in phases as they need not be functional at full capacity since the number of cases in the city is on the decline. The capacity of the three centres is around 4,600 beds.According to BMC officials, the repair and maintenance work ongoing at the jumbo centres include cleaning and sanitation of the entire area, changing water pipelines at several spots, fixing leakages, stormwater works, sewage-related work, flooring, installing additional ropes to the hangars to ensure the makeshift hospital sustains longer, followed by furniture-related works.Dr Rajesh Dere, dean of BKC Covid centre said, “The repair and maintenance work is currently ongoing and we will be in a position to take patients from June 1. However, currently, the caseload is less, and hence we may reopen in a phased manner. We are already conducting vaccination at BKC jumbo.”At Dahisar Covid jumbo centres, the BMC will restart the vaccination in the next two days, however, the jumbo centre will get reactivated in a phased manner, with the intensive care unit (ICU) beds getting activated first.Dr Deepa Shriyan, dean at Dahisar jumbo centre said, “We will first reactivate the jumbo centre with ICU beds, considering an emergency. Further, we are also adding a paediatric ward with 30 beds where children can be admitted.”Meanwhile, in the case of Mulund, the BMC plans to open up one hangar for admitting Covid patients. Dr Pradeep Angre, dean at Mulund jumbo centre said, “We have around 1,600 beds and starting June 1 we will activate one hangar for Covid patients. For the remaining beds, we will activate them in phases considering the ongoing maintenance work anticipating the third wave. Along with maintenance work, we are also carrying out pre-monsoon works, which we will require time.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/3-jumbo-covid-centres-shut-before-cyclone-tauktae-to-reopen-for-patients-from-june-1-101622138700709.html

During the 2020 lockdown, we had some savings to sustain ourselves. This time the shopkeepers are badly affected, hence need to resume their businesses,” said Mohan Gurnani, convenor, TUMF.The TUMF has demanded that the state should waive off the taxes like license fees, professional tax as well as give concessions in property tax.After the surge in Covid-19 cases, the state had imposed first the night curfew, then a partial lockdown and finally a full lockdown. The lockdown has shown positive results as the cases fell from the 60,000 range to currently within 25,000.Nirmal Nahar who runs his clothing business from Mangaldas Market at Kalbadevi said it is imperative to start their business. “We have lost considerable business to other states like Gujarat and if the lockdown extends, it will be difficult to retain it,” said Nahar.Retailers in cities across the state too have demanded that the restrictions on their businesses should be lifted.Aurangabad member of Parliament (MP) Imtiyaz Jaleel warned the government to allow them to open or shopkeepers will defy the rules. “Shopkeepers are dying of suicide in Aurangabad and other parts of Maharashtra. The financial institutions are harassing them and the government is silent,” said Jaleel. “If the government still wants to extend the lockdown then they need to compensate the shopkeepers,” he added.However, Shiv Sena leader and former Aurangabad MP Chandrakant Khaire said the government will decide after reviewing the situation. “There is lockdown across the world and we have decided to save the lives of the people. The decision will be based on the ground situation,” said Khaire. Shopkeepers in Solapur have warned of opening their shops irrespective of the government’s stance.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/allow-to-open-shops-from-june-1-waive-taxes-association-urges-maharashtra-govt-101622138700124.html
27-05-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai: Firm that proposed to supply Pfizer vaccine withdraws bid||A supplier from Czech Republic who had proposed to supply Pfizer and AstraZeneca vaccines to the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC), on Thursday, withdrew its proposal, said civic body officials. The supplier has not given any reason for the withdrawal, officials added. With this, now only seven interested suppliers offering Russian Sputnik V and Sputnik Light are in the race. The Czech supplier firm which withdrew its proposal on Thursday had responded to the BMC’s global expression of interest (EOI) floated on May 12 to procure 10 million Covid-19 vaccines. ​The supplier had also demanded advance payment in exchange for the same.However, following BMC’s announcement of it receiving total eight responses that included seven proposals for supplying Russia’s Sputnik and one for supplying Pfizer and AstraZeneca, Pfizer stated that it had not authorised anyone for distribution of its Covid vaccine.Pfizer in its statement had said, “Pfizer is supplying its COVID-19 vaccine only to central Governments and supranational organizations for deployment in national immunization programs. Neither Pfizer Inc nor any of its affiliates globally, including in India, have authorized anyone to import/market/distribute the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID 19 vaccine.”Responding to this, the BMC on Wednesday had said that it will term the proposal of any supplier as ‘invalid’, in case no genuine link is found between the supplier and the manufacturer in its verification process.On Thursday, however, the BMC received an email from the supplier from Czech Republic expressing its withdrawal from the process without giving any reason, confirmed P Velrasu, additional municipal commissioner of the BMC.On whether the BMC like the Maharashtra government will go ahead and write to the Central government or any of the vaccine manufacturers for confirming the authenticity of the vaccine supply proposals, Velrasu said, “We will process the papers first. We have time till June 01. We will decide the future course of action later.”The BMC had on May 12 floated the EOI, giving time till May 18, but it extended the last date till May 25 as it had received only three proposals. Post this, on May 25 it extended the proposal till June 1 on getting eight proposals.Meanwhile, municipal commissioner Iqbal Singh Chahal on Monday had said that though BMC has got eight proposals, it will welcome more proposals till June 1.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-firm-that-proposed-to-supply-pfizer-vaccine-withdraws-bid-101622138580134.html
27-05-2021||Delhi||Delhi: Covid positivity rate below 2% for two days now||The Capital’s Covid-19 graph continued on its downward trajectory on Thursday, with daily infections falling sharply, as Delhi added 1,072 new cases of Covid-19, over 400 fewer than the previous day. Thursday’s case count, the lowest in a single-day since March 30 (when it added 992 cases) came on the back of just over 70,000 tests and at a positivity rate of 1.53%, a number that has now dropped for 21 consecutive days. The positivity rate has now stayed below 5% for a week, and below 2% for two days. The World Health Organization recommends a number below 5% for two-weeks, for an outbreak to regarded as under control in a region. The average daily test positivity rate over the past week fell to 2.7% on Thursday, and has stayed below 5% for four days now. Delhi struggled with test positivity rates over 30% for 12 straight days between end April and early May, as cases and deaths spiralled out of control. The positivity rate in Delhi hit an all-time high of 36.24% on April 22, at the peak of the caseload of the fourth wave. The city also saw 117 people succumb to Covid-19 on Thursday. While fatalities have dropped over the past few days, they have remained in the triple digits for 44 days. The seven-day average deaths on Thursday, however, fell to 176, the lowest since April 20. On May 3 in Delhi, 448 people died of Covid-19, the most in one day so far. Active cases are also at their lowest in over 50 days, as infections fall and more people who contracted the disease recover. This has freed up hospital beds in wards as well as intensive care units (ICUs). The state government’s Covid-19 dashboard showed that 76% out Delhi’s 28,701 Covid-19 hospital beds were vacant as of 6pm on Thursday, while nearly half the 6,887 ICU beds, and over 18,000 oxygen-equipped beds were free.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-covid-positivity-rate-below-2-for-two-days-now-101622137920082.html
27-05-2021||Delhi||Drug peddling couple and associate held with half kilo heroin, 1.92 lakh cash||Police on Thursday said they had arrested a couple and their associate with more than half a kilogram of heroin and ₹1.92 lakh in cash that they had allegedly earned from selling the contraband. The couple ran a garment shop from their home in outer Delhi’s Bawana JJ Colony and used the business as a front for peddling drugs, the police said.The 49-year-old husband, Mohammad Tabrej, has nearly 17 cases of drug peddling, attempt to murder and possessing illegal weapons against him, police said. He was last arrested in a drug peddling case in 2015 and remained in jail for two years, said deputy commissioner of police (narcotics cell) Chinmoy Biswal.“During his stay in jail, other inmates advised Tabrej to start a legitimate business and use his wife to carry out the drug trade in order to avoid police attention. After coming out of jail, Tabrej opened a garment shop named “Hollywood Garments” from his house and kept a low profile. His wife Mohsima took up the drug peddling business with their associate Mohammad Bilal. All three have been arrested,” said DCP Biswal.The police said the couple and Bilal sold heroin in small pouches to customers in areas near their residential colony. They sold each pouch for ₹300 and their daily target was 80-100 packets, which meant that they earned between ₹24,000 and ₹30,000 daily. The people in their neighbourhood were hassled by the couple’s drug dealings as their children were also getting addicted to drugs, said a senior narcotics cell officer, associated with the operation, asking to be named.“Nearly 200 residents gathered outside the couple’s home when we conducted the search and recovered the contraband and arrested the duo. They said they were happy with the arrests as that would save their children’s lives,” said the officer.Biswal said the narcotics cell team had received information that drug peddlers were active in the JJ Colony in Bawana and that they were continuing the trade even during the ongoing lockdown. The information was developed and on May 23, it was learnt that a woman would be supplying heroin to her associate in Block E. Accordingly, a trap was laid and the team caught Mohsima,45, along with her husband Tabrej and associate Bilal,27.“We caught them with some quantity of heroin and ₹1.92 lakh in cash. The couple’s house was also searched and more recovery of heroin was made. In total, 520 grams of the contraband, valued at around ₹75 lakh in the international market, was seized,” DCP Biswal said.This is the second case in the past fortnight where a couple has been held with heroin. In the previous case, an Afghan refugee couple was held with 125 kilograms of heroin that they were going to deliver to another person in west Delhi when they were caught.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/drug-peddling-couple-and-associate-held-with-half-kilo-heroin-1-92-lakh-cash-101622137740069.html
27-05-2021||Chandigarh||Covid crisis: With private units backing out, govt hospitals become Shimla’s lifeline||With the lethal second wave of the pandemic raging across the ‘queen of hills’, private players have refused to admit and treat coronavirus patients, making the two primary government hospitals in Shimla, the state capital, the lifeline of the masses in this hour of crisis. The two hospitals — Indira Gandhi Medical College (IGMC) and Deen Dayal Upadhyay (DDU) hospital — have been shouldering the Covid burden of the state. While IGMC has been admitting patients from Sirmaur, Kullu, Kinnaur and Solan apart from Shimla, DDU only admits patients from Shimla. Despite limited resources and heavy caseload, the staff, comprising doctors, paramedical staff and Class-4 workers, has been working round the clock to tackle the pandemic.102-year-old woman beats CovidA 102-year-old patient, Dharamdasi of Kinnaur district, who had tested positive for Covid on May 14, was discharged from IGMC, where she was admitted after complaining of headache, fever and difficulty in breathing, on Thursday.An IGMC spokesperson said, “None of her family members were present with her at the hospital. She was looked after by the hospital staff. It is a matter of pride for us that she has made complete recovery as it a challenge to treat people her age.” Another almost centenarian, 99-year-old Suvdha Devi Bhimta who contracted the viral disease recovered after a month-long stint at DDU. “The two private hospitals in Shimla were not admitting Covid patients so we had no option but to admit her to DDU. However, we were pleasantly surprised as she was looked after properly and made a full recovery at her advanced age,” said her son-in-law Jaisi Ram Jodhta,“There was shortage of nurses, but oxygen supply was sufficient. We were also provided with an ambulance on our way home after my mother-in-law’s recovery. Medical superintendent Dr Ravinder Mokta and his team were very vigilant,” he said.‘DDU Covid ward was like a high-end hotel’Another family had a close brush with death after everyone, except two children, tested positive for the virus and had to be hospitalised. Suresh Chauhan, his wife, mother and elder brother had to be hospitalised at DDU as their oxygen levels dipped. Chauhan and his wife’s oxygen level had plummeted to 80 and their lungs were severely damaged. As their health deteriorated, they were put on ventilators. As they battled the virus, neighbours stepped in to look after their children. Unfortunately, his mother succumbed to the infection and had to be cremated by relatives. Chauhan attributes his family’s recovery to the efficiency and kindness of the hospital staff from the specialists to the sanitary staff. “Surprisingly, the food quality and hygiene standard in the Covid ward was like a high-end hotel,” Chauhan said. “The credit goes to the entire staff, they have been putting in relentless efforts,” says Mokta.2% mortality rate at IGMC IGMC, the state’s premier health institute, which treats the most critical patients, and has a mortality rate of around 2%. As many as 2,025 patients admitted at the hospital since the outbreak have recuperated, 241 are undergoing treatment and 568 patients have succumbed.“As per the World Journal of Death and Dying, the Covid death rate world over has been estimated to be 2-3%. In many countries it has been as high as 5%,” says medical superintendent Dr Janak Raj Pakhretia.The hospital has also provided dialysis to 235 Covid patients. It is the only hospital in the state, which has continued non-Covid OPD even during the peak of the virus.In 2020, the IGMC held 4,24,788 outpatient departments (OPDs) on non-Covid patients while this year 2,00,536 patients have been attended.Six lakh liters of oxygen has been used at IGMC since the outbreak. No shortage was reported despite heavy caseload.Jai Ram visits Virbhadra in IGMC SHIMLA: Chief minister Jai Ram Thakur visited Indira Gandhi Medical College, Shimla, on Thursday to enquire after the health of former chief minister Virbhadra Singh, who was hospitalised on April 30. Congress’s octogenarian leader and former chief minister Virbhadra Singh had been admitted to Indira Gandhi Medical College’s (IGMC’s) cardiac unit ICU on April 23 after he complained of difficulty in breathing. He had just been discharged from Max Hospital in Mohali where he was being treated for Covid. He had been brought to Shimla in the state chopper. The 86-year-old leader had tested positive for Covid on April 13. The CM was accompanied by urban development minister Suresh Bhardwaj, IGMC principal Dr Rajneesh Pathania, senior medical superintendent Dr Janak Raj and other senior officers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/covid-crisis-with-pvt-units-backing-out-govt-hospitals-become-shimla-s-lifeline-101622135700720.html

27-05-2021||Delhi||Lockdown woes: Final year students worried about job opportunities||For students graduating from some of the premier colleges, the Covid-19 induced pandemic has come with another set of challenges. From campus placements to the inability to network, the lockdown has affected their chances of getting good job opportunities. Ravi Sharma, a final year student at IIT Delhi, feels panicked and uncertain due to the current situation. “The college placements were relatively low as compared to previous years and the influx of companies for visiting the campus was also less. The online hiring process was not at all effective; it was rather time-consuming and tedious,” says Sharma. “ It is especially hard for freshers to find a job with no experience.”Agreeing to this Jyoti Yadav, another student from IIT Delhi who will be graduating this year says, “On campus, we form job groups for placements and help each other until the whole group is placed. Now, that couldn’t happen this time. This disturbed the whole idea of placement for students and there was no networking. Generally, students who get placed first, come forward to help and guide others who still have not been placed. But since everyone was stuck at home during placements this could not be done. How many calls can one person take?” Apart from placements, last few days on campus brings festive fervour among students. However things have been different in the past year. “ Online exams, finishing deadlines stuck at home wasn’t fun at all. It was depressing to say the least,” says Rishabh Agrawal, who is graduating from IIT Delhi amidst a pandemic.Pursuing final year from home, students miss perks of studying on campus. “Everything else was on but college wasn’t. We had to do all the assignments and tests locked inside our homes, our peers were not there to help or accompany us. Taking a break on campus is a good stress reliever. You can go out for walk in the lush green campus. It’s stressful to sit at home and graduate,” adds Agrawal. With graduation celebrations cancelled or shifted online, students missed out on a lot of fun. “There are a lot of farewells, hostel, batch, and society farewell parties. None happened because of the pandemic,” adds Yadav.Final year of college is the most cherished time in a student’s life, however it has been very different for the batch 2021 . “There isn’t much stress around academics in the last year; the course material is mostly finished before the last semester.

27-05-2021||Ranchi||Over 8 lakh students of Classes 9, 11 promoted without exams||Over eight lakh students studying in Classes 9 and 11 across the state have been promoted to higher classes without any examinations in wake of the second wave of Covid-19 and lockdown-like restrictions imposed in Jharkhand since April 22, an official said on Thursday.State secondary education directorate issued an order in this regard on Thursday and asked all school headmasters to promote the students and ensure their admissions in higher classes at the earliest.The academic session for 2020-21 ended on March 31 and the new session began on April 1. The students have already suffered an academic loss of two months this year, an education official said.State secondary education director Harsh Mangla said, “It’s doesn’t seem to be possible to reopen schools till next few months. In such a situation, students would not get enough time for completing the syllabus of Classes 10 and 12, in case they are not promoted. Hence, the state government has decided to promote the students of Classes 9 and 11 to higher grades.”Officials at Jharkhand Academic Council (JAC), which conducts the examinations for Class 9 and 11, said that around eight lakh students study in the abovementioned grades in Jharkhand.Jharkhand government has already promoted the students from Class 1 to 8 without any examination because of the Covid pandemic.The JAC officials had said that they would issue a fresh examination schedule after reviewing the Covid situation on June 1.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ranchi-news/over-8-lakh-students-of-classes-9-11-promoted-without-exams-101622128199204.html

Liposomal Amphotericine-B injection, a specific drug for the fungal infection, has flown off the shelves. The AIIMS, which has around 65 patients of black fungus, is struggling in the absence of drugs. “It will be butchery if we operate upon patients and don’t make drugs available. Surgery is 50% cure, the remaining 50% recovery is through drugs,” said a doctor. With 98 patients out of the total 109 admissions and eight deaths, the IGIMS has the highest number of patients with black fungus in any health facility in the state, said Dr Bheem Ram, assistant professor of medicine, IGIMS. Its stock of Amphotericin-B is enough to barely last a day. The IGIMS received 500 vials and AIIMS 400 vials of Liposomal Amphotericin-B on Wednesday evening after the two institutes sent SOS to the state health department. Their stock has now exhausted. The AIIMS had earlier received 2,000 vials and the IGIMS 1,300 vials of the injection. “We have around 65 patients of mucormycosis. Each patient requires between six and 12 vials of Amphotericin-B injection per day. The drugs replenished are woefully inadequate to last even a day. The drug is out of stock,” said Dr Kranti Bhawna, additional professor and head of ENT department at AIIMS-Patna. To make matters worse for the AIIMS, its empanelled vendors have refused to supply Amphotericin-B at the approved rate of ₹1,700 per vial after the Centre agreed to purchase it at ₹4,000 to ₹6,000 per vial from manufacturers. Purchasing the drugs is a costly proposition for patients, given that its average daily requirement is 6-12 vials per patient a day, considering the patient’s body weight — more the weight, higher the drug requirement. The state government, which declared mucormycosis a notifiable disease on May 22, has decided to supply it free to patients. Meanwhile, the IGIMS, a dedicated Covid-19 hospital, on Thursday initiated an integrated outdoor patient department (OPD), comprising experts from the ophthalmology, ENT and neurology departments for patients with mucormycosis. “The idea is to facilitate patients so that they don’t have to run about and wait in queues subsequently when referred for consultation from OPD of one department to another,” said Dr Manish Mandal, medical superintendent, IGIMS. “The experts in our integrated OPD unit for patients with mucormycosis will evaluate patients and decide on their admission for treatment. Those who are very serious and unstable will be examined and admitted in emergency,” added Dr Mandal. The government, on the other hand, defended itself. “We have made available 10,000 vials of the drug to hospitals, including private, across the state. Since the drugs supplied are not one-time allotment, they are being replenished continuously, as per availability. We are relocating drugs from facilities having no patient of black fungus to those where the patient burden is high. We are also purchasing drugs directly from manufacturers. There is some supply issue, which we hope to tide over soon,” said an official of the health department, handling the allotment of Amphotericin-B. Used in the treatment of kala-azar, Bihar had some stock of Liposomal Amphotericin-B, which it had received from the WHO. It diverted 10,000 vials of the drug for treatment of mucormycosis after obtaining the Centre’s nod. Bihar reported 14 deaths and 244 cases of mucormycosis till Wednesday after the first case of mucormycosis was reported in the state late last month.

Nobody can question his mastery of Yoga. But he is certainly not a Yogi. A Yogi is one who has control on all his senses and brain. What he has done for Yoga is comparable to what Coco Cola did for beverages. Indians have been, since ages, consuming Shikanji and thandai but after the advent of the soft drink giant, every home seems to be stocked with bottles of Pepsi and Coke”, Jaiswal said in his post.“There is no need to reply to all baseless talks. If you speak more, you start giving more weight to others,” he advised the IMA. Jaiswal, who is the first BJP leader to speak on the controversy, however, lauded yoga. “It is important as it keeps you disease free but this is not a system of medicine,” he said. “Every system of medicine has its own limitations, which held true for Yoga, a sophisticated form of physiotherapy which can help us ward off illnesses but can create problems if we take to it to cure existing ailments.”The IMA, however, seemed unmoved. “Over five lakh doctors associated with the IMA across the country, including 12,000 in Bihar, are hurt. He shouldn’t demoarlise doctors who have done yeomen service in treating patients during the ongoing pandemic. He should stick to yoga and his Patanjali products,” said Dr Shahjanand Kumar Singh, IMA national president (elect). “Every state organization is contemplating legal action and now only PM’s intervention can bring sanity,” he said.The Indian Medical Association has been up in arms against Ramdev over his recent diatribe and its Uttarakhand chapter has slapped the yoga guru with a hefty defamation suit.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/ignore-ramdev-bihar-bjp-chief-tells-doctors-101622127959200.html

The informal group, opened by two cyber police staff from Madhya Pradesh, now has 2,000 members on Telegram. The mission is to stop online frauds and prevent money reaching the fraudsters, all in real time. A recent example is the quick refund to an online fraud victim from Pune. A private school teacher has ₹2.5 lakh siphoned from his account after he made an online payment of ₹10, as a token amount towards for an RT-PCR report, prior to his air travel to Ladakh. The above fraud details were put on the group by the Pune cyber cell, after which nodal officers of the e-wallets involved checked their domains, and blocked the transaction. The money was immediately refunded to the victim. The cyber cell helped a Dhanori-based computer engineer get back ₹1.93 lakh, a businessman from Kothrud received a refund of ₹1.5 lakh and a senior citizen from Bibvewadi got back ₹97,000, all in various cases of cyber fraud. Pune police have, so far, helped victims recover a total of ₹8 lakh from fraudulent online transactions. An online financial transaction is made on one of, or all of, four platforms - banks, e-wallets, e-commerce and bill payments. Nodal officers from all four platforms are on the group, which makes it easy for cyber sleuths to block a payment to a fraudster. Police inspector Chandrakant Hake, incharge of the Pune cyber police station, said, “The group is indeed very helpful for us to stop payment before it reaches the destination of the fraudster. The group has proved to be a very useful platform for sharing critical fraud-related information and also get results in real time, so that victims are assured that their money is safe. It’s a country-wide group which is effectively run by all the participants for the public good.” The Maharashtra coordinator of the social media group, speaking on the condition of anonymity said, “This group has served to protect victims from losing money to scammers and results are encouraging. This process works faster based on the basic nature of the complaint, like an email, and later the necessary paperwork can be completed.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/social-media-group-of-cops-and-e-commerce-reps-prevents-online-frauds-worth-rs-15-crore-101622126639697.html

The waterhole census is a conservation exercise and environment experts believed it should not be missed. “We are working with 15 per cent staff, which makes it very difficult to organise and arrange this census. We need at least two persons, a forest officer and a volunteer, at each location across all sanctuaries, keeping a vigil at waterholes atop machaans (a platform erected on a tree or at a height off the ground),” said Rahul Patil, deputy conservator of forests, Pune. Though Patil added that counting of animals happens throughout the year using cameras placed inside the forests.The last census was conducted in 2019 at four wildlife sanctuaries - Nanaj, Bhimashankar, Rehekuri and Mayureshwar, where it was found that there has been an increase in the number Sambar deer, Chinkara, antelope and wolves. The Pune division of the Maharashtra forest department registered 2,497 different types of wildlife species during the 2019 census.According to the census, the number of Sambar increased from 29 in 2018, to 31 in 2019. Along with that the Chinkara number increased from 399 to 417. The census report also shows that antelope figures increased from 858 to 1,071. The number of Bengal foxes had come down from 39 to 38.Sunil Bhoite, honorary wild life warden in Satara, said, “Due to the pandemic, we could not get a group together, though we are constantly monitoring cameras, with motion sensors and infrared. We have recent tiger sightings on the Western ghats and have set corridors. If we can’t conduct an animal census, it affects the forest ecosystem.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/annual-waterhole-wildlife-census-missed-for-second-year-running-101622126639043.html

The accused, identified as Siddharth Bansode, was arrested along with three accomplices identified as Rohit Durgesh Pandhrari (25), Sawantkumar Ramesh Saladallu (48) and Satish Ramesh Landage (40), according to the police. A local court in Pimpri remanded them to police custody till May 30. “We checked his house, the hotels that he frequents and could not find him. We formed multiple teams to look for these men.

I am starving, these children are starving," Lakshmi Majhi, a resident of Kadupara said, as she stood on the flooded courtyard outside her house with her three children.Majhi further said, "We were asked by the administration to rush to nearby school camp. But how can we go? It will take me 30 minutes to reach the camp. How will I wade through the flooded roads with my children, leaving my home and belongings behind?"Bapan Laskar, a migrant worker of the same village, said he was finding it difficult to make ends meet in the midst of the lockdown, and the cyclone has added to his woes."I work as a mason in Kolkata, but the COVID-induced lockdown robbed me of my livelihood. This cyclone, on top of that, has partially damaged my home. I do not know what to do," Laskar, who lives with his ailing parents, said.In cyclone-ravaged Kultali, villagers were seen lining up on the elevated pavements, most of them without masks, even as water levels kept rising due to the incessant rainfall."Saline water from the sea gushed in, breaching the embankments, and destroyed crops that we had taken pains to grow. Almost every villager in the area depends on fishing and farming. With ponds and farmlands flooded with saline water, residents here are now staring at an uncertain future," one of the villagers lamented.Kultali MLA Ganesh Chandra Mondal, however, said that disaster management personnel have fanned out to the affected areas in South 24 Parganas to shift all marooned villagers to relief camps, set up in school buildings.Similar tales of misery were shared by people in Purba Medinipur district, which, too, bore the brunt of the storm.In the tourist town of Digha, one of the worst- affected areas in the state, shops selling knick-knacks close to the beach lay ravaged, with shells, junk jewelleries and other decorative items seen floating in the flood water.Several hotels in Mandarmoni, another resort town, also suffered extensive damage.In Shankarpur, roads in certain areas were reduced to patches of boulders with telltale signs of destruction around.A Digha Development Authority official said work to repair damaged structures would begin in a day or two.Mamoni Das of Ramnagar in Purba Medinipur broke down when reporters approached her.Das, a middle-aged widow with no children, said she was rescued by Army personnel after the squall on Wednesday morning flattened her home in a trice."I am thriving on puffed rice that I managed to get from a nearby relief camp. With everything lost, I do not know how to rebuild my life," she added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/yaashit-people-cry-for-food-shelter-amid-heavy-rain-in-pockets-of-bengal-101622124956410.html

27-05-2021||Other||Fake assessment notices served to several taxpayers, case filed||The income tax department has filed a case against an unknown person/group for allegedly issuing fake and illegal assessment notices to several taxpayers in Gurugam last year. The matter came to light when in April, the department received an undelivered notice served to taxpayers in the city. During an interval investigation, it was found that the notice under section 147 of the IT Act was signed with a fake name. The stamp and letterhead were allegedly found to be fake, said police. The department complained that someone or a group impersonating as IT officials were trying to dupe taxpayers, said police. The notice was dated June 2018 and addressed to a private company based in Sushant Lok-1. The notice was signed by someone named Naresh Yadav, who identified himself as an assistant commissioner of IT circle (4) of Gurugram, said police. K K Rao, commissioner of police, said on the date when the notice was issued, no assistant commissioner named Yadav was posted in the IT department. Moreover, the stamp affixed on the notice was not the one used by Income Tax authorities. “The seal used on the said notice was also forged. The notice pertains to the assessment year 2017-18. However, the said year was not under regular assessment so it was not possible to issue notice for that year,” he said. Besides, the notice had several other defects like wrong e-mail address and wrong letter serial numbers. Rao said during investigation, it was found that the notice was sent from the website of the department of post and it was posted from Delhi and not Gurugram. It was clear that the notice in question was not issued by the IT department. Seema Dhankhar, joint commissioner of Income-tax, Kurukshetra, said they had complained to police last year when she was holding charge as deputy commissioner. “We were suspecting the role of an insider who worked on a contract basis. The suspect tried to impersonate as an Income Tax authority and sent a forged notice to the taxpayer. The dispatch number used was correct, which led to the suspicion that it was a doing of an insider. It is a matter of serious concern,” she said. On the basis of the complaint, a case was registered under section 170 (personating a public servant) of the IPC at Udyog Vihar police station on Tuesday. “We have conducted a thorough investigation and it seemed someone tried to settle a personal score with the victims. Maybe an individual or a gang is involved,” said Rao.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/fake-assessment-notices-served-to-several-taxpayers-case-filed-101622116306126.html

The severe disease in the 49-year-old patient was because of her immunocompromised state – she had undergone surgery and chemotherapy for breast cancer and then contracted coronavirus disease (Covid-19). “Candida is a very common infection and people walk around with it not even knowing they have it. However, it turned pathogenic in the patient because she was severely immunocompromised owing to the cancer, chemotherapy and Covid-19. there were perforations (tears) in the lower end of the food pipe. A part of the small intestine had developed gangrene and she had multiple thinned out patches in the wall of the colon with one small leak,” said Dr Samiran Nundy, advisor, department of surgical gastroenterology and liver transplantation. He added, “Along with that, her bowel also had blood clots resulting from Covid-19.” Also Read | Politics behind US call for coronavirus origin probe, says ChinaThe patient was admitted to the hospital earlier this month with complaints of severe abdominal pain, vomiting, and constipation. She was in circulatory shock (a life-threatening complication) and had severe respiratory distress. A CT scan of her abdomen revealed air and moderate amount of free fluid in the abdominal cavity indicating a tear in the intestine. A tube was placed to drain the fluid, which turned out to be a litre of bile-stained pus. A part of the bowel removed during the surgery was tested and she was found to have candida hyphae. “Candida is a normal part of the gut flora but in immunosuppressed states caused by diabetes, injudicious use of steroids, overzealous broad spectrum antibiotics, and chemotherapy for an underlying malignancies, the candida migrates inwards disrupting the normal gut barriers. This is followed by intestinal complications like ulcers, bleeding, gangrene and perforation followed by the infection getting into the blood resulting in septicaemia (blood infection) and multi-organ failure,” said Dr Anil Arora, chairman of the institute of liver, gastroenterology and pancreaticobiliary sciences.

27-05-2021||Pune||Taste of life: Opium rumours bring this Pune tea story to a boil||Shrikrishna Govind Phadke was famished when he reached Pune one summer afternoon in 1921. He was 14-years old and had walked to Pune from Dapoli, near Ratnagiri, where he was employed in a small inn. He had five rupees with him.Phadke had come to the city in the hope of earning a better living. One of his distant uncles was working as a cook in a local restaurant and he wished to join him. Phadke had been told by this uncle in a letter, that wages were better in Pune and that he would never sleep hungry in the city. Phadke had been planning to get out of Dapoli for months and now that he was in Pune, he suddenly realised that he did not know where to find his uncle. All he knew was that he worked in a restaurant near the mandai, and despite making enquiries in all the nearby inns and restaurants, his search drew a blank.Hungry and exhausted, he decided to have something to eat. It was almost 3 pm and most of the eating houses were closed. The only shop that was open was the one selling tea and biscuits. Written on a pale blue slate in beautiful yellow font was the name of the shop - “Gandharva Golden Tea”. “Gandharva Golden Tea” was named after the legendary actor-singer Balgandharva. Established in 1911, it had shortly acquired a cult status and a greater notoriety. For soon after it opened its doors to patrons, whispers in the city suggested that the proprietor of the shop added opium poppy-seed pods to the concoction, which got its customers addicted to the tea. Now it was not uncommon amongst Europeans to enjoy opium tea, especially those with a connection too China and the Levant. But opium tea in the peths of Pune was unheard of till then.The owners of “Gandharva Golden Tea” strived hard to dispel the rumours. At least five advertisements in the newspapers “Kesari”, “Subodh Patrika” and “Kaal”, placed by the owners between 1912 and 1915, appealed to the public to not believe the grapevine and urged them to patronise the shop.We do not know if the advertisements had their desired effect. It was not unusual for rumours to be taken seriously in Pune. In January 1896, pandemonium broke out in the local vegetable market after a rumour circulated that a ship carrying vegetables from Calcutta to Pune had sunk in a storm. Half the city rushed to the market to buy vegetables in the fear that they would not be able to buy any for the next few days. Had they paused a bit to think, they would have realised that there was no waterway connecting Calcutta and Pune, and that the city did not source its vegetables from Calcutta in the first place. Exactly a year later, a ship ferrying goods, mostly cotton fabric, from Calcutta to Patna did sink in a river. After the news appeared in “Kesari”, people thronged the market to buy clothes. This too was published in the same newspaper with the editor urging its readers to think before they acted. Similarly, the “opium in tea” story was bought by many. How would they otherwise explain the addiction to tea? The shop prospered. There’s a possibility that several customers went there to relish what they thought was “opium tea”. “Gandharva Golden Tea” soon started selling tea powder in the shop as well. An article in “Jnanaprakash” in 1938 mentions how several conservative citizens would stand outside the shop and shout slogans in the initial years of the establishment. The owner would always offer them tea with a smile and after they refused, ignored them throughout the day. Phadke could not meet his uncle that day. He returned to the shop that evening and requested the owner to let him work in the shop. The owner agreed. Phadke got a roof over his head and he did not sleep hungry ever.Five years later, he established his own restaurant near Appa Balwant chowk. And a couple of years later, he left Pune for Aden in Yemen, where he started a tea shop and named it “Gandharva Tea”. It was located near the port and was popular among Indians living in Aden. This is all we know about Phadke and his tryst with the two tea shops, both named “Gandharva”, one in Pune and the other in Aden. He passed away childless in 1961 in Aden. A short obituary appeared in an issue of the periodical “Kirloskar”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/taste-of-life-opium-rumours-bring-this-pune-tea-story-to-a-boil-101622112564592.html

The court said that the duty free import can be carried out after the importers furnish a bond till the Centre takes a final decision on waiving the customs duty on it.The high court said the medicine is required to save lives of thousands of people suffering from mucormycosis and the central government shall seriously consider waiver of customs duty till the drug is in short supply in India."We direct if any import is made by any person, the same may be cleared by accepting the bond from the importer without actual payment of duty till a final decision on the said aspect is taken," the bench of justices Vipin Sanghi and Jasmeet Singh said in its order."The bond shall have the undertaking that in case the import duty is not waived, the duty shall be paid by the importer," the order further said.The judges also said they have been assured that the customs shall clear all consignment of medicines of black fungus without any delay.During the course of hearing, senior advocate Krishnan Venugopal - who appeared for one of the petitioners - said that there is an import duty of 27% on the drug and people who want to source it from their end will find difficulty in procuring the medicine.The Centre said that there were seven manufacturers and five more have been added. The Centre's standing counsel Kirtiman Singh added that the government has asked more manufacturers and if they are interested, they can apply and the matter will be expeditiously considered.Prime Minister Narendra Modi recently gave instructions to India missions across the world to get Amphotericin from anywhere in the world.

27-05-2021||Delhi||BJP asks Delhi government to clarify how many vaccines it procured||The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Thursday asked the Delhi government to come clean on the arrangements it has made to procure vaccines and set up oxygen plants while accusing it of politicising the Centre’s vaccine procurement to deflect attention from what it should have done to provide them.BJP spokesperson Sambit Patra said only 13% of people, who have been vaccinated in the national capital, have got their vaccines from the Delhi government. “Nearly 46 lakh [4.6 million] free vaccines were supplied by the Centre to Delhi. Private hospitals... procured about 9 lakh [90,00,00] doses of vaccines while the Delhi government managed to procure just a little over 8 lakh [80,00,00].” Patra said private hospitals have managed to get more vaccines on their own than the Delhi government. He said the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) government should also clarify how many doses of the Russian Sputnik V vaccine has it ordered and paid for so far.The BJP-led Centre and the AAP government have been at loggerheads over the vaccine policy as well as over the allotment of oxygen to Delhi. The state government has alleged the Centre did not supply oxygen to it as per the quantum of requirement. The Centre has sought an audit of the oxygen being supplied.Also Read | 848 kgs of used surgical hand gloves seized from 2 Delhi godowns, 3 heldPatra said it has been a month since chief minister Arvind Kejriwal announced 44 oxygen plants will be set up within a month. “It has been a month already… I want to ask how many plants have been started.”Patra said the number of companies manufacturing the drug needed to treat mucormycosis, which has emerged as a major Covid-19 complication, has gone up from four to nine following the Centre’s intervention. Kejriwal on Wednesday said there was an acute shortage of the drug.Patra said American firm Gilead Sciences is sending about 100,000 vials of the medicine to India and 85,000 of them are on their way. “…Delhi has so far received 4,550 vials of the medicines required to treat mucormycosis or black fungus,” Patra said. “As per our information, the vials are not reaching the hospitals properly because there is a problem at the Delhi government end in terms of management.”Patra referred to the Delhi government’s statement that companies such as Pfizer and Moderna have refused to sell vaccines to state governments and added Centre has amended the rules to allow vaccines certified by international agencies or listed for emergency use by the WHO to be allowed for use in India. “There are constraints in the supply of vaccines.”He said the Centre is talking to these companies and working to procure vaccines. “Political leaders such as Arvind Kejriwal, who are asking questions, should remember this is not something that can be bought off the shelf. There is a process to be followed.”Patra accused the opposition parties of propagating the myth that domestic manufacturing has not been encouraged. “This is again not true. Bharat Biotech has been ensured that the company can share the [vaccine] license with three other companies to increase enhance the production of Covaxin.”He called the Delhi government’s claim about the reluctance in vaccinating children untrue. “Children are not guinea pigs for our experiments.” He said there was a need for proper trials before children are vaccinated. “There should be no politicisation on the issue of vaccinating children.”There was no immediate response from the AAP or the Delhi government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/bjp-asks-delhi-government-to-clarify-how-many-vaccines-it-procured-101622105417514.html

Since the offence was bailable, Sharma was released on bail soon after his arrest on Wednesday.The trend of uploading videos of small dogs tied to helium balloons is prevalent in some other countries. While they usually draw a lot of clicks, they are also criticised for being cruel to the animals.In the apology video, Sharma acknowledged that he was influenced by the foreign videos.Last Friday, he and his mother took their brown Pomeranian, named Dollar, to a shop to buy hydrogen balloons. In the video, Sharma explained that he preferred hydrogen as helium balloons were more expensive.In any case, the video showed that Sharma got his dog tied to a bunch of balloons before taking it to a park. The dog appeared to be finding it difficult to stay on the ground while running in the park.When it was suspended in the air to make it fly, the dog was seen throwing its limbs around.Another scene showed Sharma climbing atop a car and then letting the dog fly.The dog appeared to float a few metres, reaching up to the second floor of a building, while ramming into the railing of a balcony in the process. The video was uploaded on Saturday, drawing lakhs of views and severe criticism.On Sunday, the video was taken down and Sharma posted another video to explain why he pulled down the original. He pointed out that he told his viewers that safety precautions were taken to keep the dog safe.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-youtuber-arrested-for-posting-video-of-his-flying-dog-101622104637436.html

27-05-2021||Delhi||848 kgs of used surgical hand gloves seized from 2 Delhi godowns, 3 held||Nearly 848 kilograms of used surgical gloves have been seized from two godowns in southwest Delhi’s Dabri, the police said after arresting three men, including a resident of Kerala, who were involved in the illegal business of its recycling and resale. They collected used surgical gloves from scrap dealers, washed them, and packed them in new boxes before reselling them as unused ones, the police said.The arrested persons have been identified as Arun Shriniwasan, 36-year-old Kerala resident, Manish Kumar,30, and Dinesh Kumar Rajput,28, both from Delhi. They were caught on Tuesday and booked for disobedience to order duly promulgated by a public servant and negligent act, likely to spread infection of [a] disease danger­ous to life. All three were later released on bail, the police said.This is the second such seizure this month in Delhi-NCR. On May 4-5, three men were arrested after a raid at a factory in Tronica City in Ghaziabad led to the recovery of used and recycled surgical gloves. Ninety-eight gunny bags containing used surgical gloves and 60 with washed gloves inside were seized. As many as 800 packing boxes, three washing machines, one dryer and some chemicals were also seized.In the latest operation, the Dabri police station on Tuesday received inputs about a godown in Chanakya Place in Dabri being used for illegal activity. A team raided the godown and caught one person with such used gloves. His questioning led the police to another godown in Badri where two more men were caught with similar items.Around 848 kgs of used surgical gloves were recovered from both the godowns. Keeping in view the health hazard, and the possibility of these gloves having been used in Covid hospital, the seized materials were sealed in the godown itself, said a police officer, who was part of the raiding team.“The arrested persons disclosed that the deliveries of the used surgical gloves were made to them by various scrap dealers, who collected the protective medical equipment from hospitals in Delhi-NCR. The usable gloves were further washed and packed in new packets while the torn ones were discarded in drains. The packets were further sold in markets,” the officer added.Police said the arrested men disclosed that they were making some quick money amid a high demand for such protective medical equipment due to the Covid-19 pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/848-kgs-of-used-surgical-hand-gloves-seized-from-2-delhi-godowns-3-held-101622102837449.html

27-05-2021||Jaipur||Hundreds of Covid-19 infected Hindus cremated by Muslim family in Kota||A Muslim family in charge of Kota’s biggest cremation ground since three generations claims to have performed the last rites of close to 800 Hindus in the last two months, including around 400 Covid-19 victims, many of whom couldn’t be attended to by their family members.Earlier this month, a Brahmin family in Kota’s Talwandi locality lost an elderly person to Covid-19 while the rest were themselves battling the infection, leaving no one to collect and cremate the body. It was at such an hour that 31-year old Moid Anwar responded to the distress call and arranged for an ambulance to transport the body to the Kishorepura crematorium after four members of his team had packed it as per the Covid-19 containment protocols.Social worker Om Prakash Sahni, who called Anwar for help said, “Moid and his brother themselves arranged the pyre for the last rites of the deceased in the presence of a Hindu priest as no one from the family of the victim could attend.”One priest of Sindhi community, Jeetu Sharma (30), said Moid and his brother Moin not only sell firewood for last rites but made all arrangements for cremation and their services were exceptional during the peak of Covid-19 crisis, when crematoriums overflowed yet many abandoning their dead ones due to fear of contracting the virus.“They even provide free firewood to those who cannot afford the expenses of last rites and have cremated so many Covid-19 deceased,” said Jeetu Sharma.“They performed the last rites as per the wishes of the family members of the deceased, for which people extended their gratitude to them,” he said.Rajaram Jain Karmayogi of Karmayogi Seva Sansthan, whose organization provide vehicles for dead body transportation and arranges for last rites in the city, said, “At a time when human race is facing one of its worst moments with family members not cremating even their own, Moid and his team have cremated countless people risking their own lives.”Moid says his family has been the caretaker at the Kishorepura Muktidham for the last 50 years”.“Our grandmother Haleema Bai started working here and later my father Anwar Hussain joined her and now we are working at Kishorepura,” he said.“During Covid-19 peak period in April and May this year, we worked round the clock as bodies were coming in one after another,” Moid added.There are half a dozen members in Moid’s team. “We have performed the last rites of 800 persons in these two months. More than 50% of these were Covid-19 deaths. Our team members, comprising both Muslim and Hindus, lit several pyres in absence of family members,” he said.Moid also arranges ambulances to bring Covid-19 patients through his contacts with service providers.“We only charge for the firewood for cremation, but provide free facilities, including arranging ambulances to pick up the dead and pyres and priests for the last rites,” he said, adding that families are requested to pay the priests directly.Moid said he and his team earned around ₹30,000 a month. Interestingly, all of them have remained uninfected despite cremating several Covid-19 patients.“We follow the protocol while God also helps us in our service to mankind and keeps us fit enough to help others,” he concludes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/jaipur-news/hundreds-of-covid-19-infected-hindus-cremated-by-muslim-family-in-kota-101622101757380.html
27-05-2021||Delhi||Pandemic hits conservation of key ASI monuments, Chandni Chowk revamp||The restrictions due to Covid-19 since March 2020 and subsequent shortage of labour and delay in procuring construction material have hit the heritage conservation of key monuments and structures in the national Capital over the past year. Officials from the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) said work on projects such as the conservation of Sher Shah Suri Gate, Sab Burz, and Tughlakabad Fort slowed down in the past year and the second wave of the Covid-19 in the country has again thrown a spanner in the works.In the wake of rising Covid-19 cases, the ASI had announced the closure of all centrally protected monuments and museums on April 15.Delhi has over 70 monuments under ASI, including the Red Fort, Humayun’s Tomb, Qutub Minar, and Purana Qila, among others. While the Red Fort had been closed to the public since January 26, when violence had broken out there during the farmers’ tractor rally, the other monuments had reopened in July last year following the nationwide lockdown announced in March 2020 and was again shut on April 15.Also Read | Emergency vehicles to be allowed in revamped Chandni Chowk stretch: JainSubsequently, the Delhi government imposed a lockdown on April 20 to arrest the alarming rise in Covid-19 cases and deaths.An ASI official, who did not wish to be named, said project completion deadlines of multiple heritage sites would have to be revised following the lockdown. Prior to the lockdown, conservation work was being carried out at Sher Shah Suri Gate and Sab Burz, among other places, he said.“A part of the National Museum was to be shifted to the Red Fort but that now stands delayed. At the Tughlakabad Fort, we were carrying out repairs on the fort walls but that has now stopped. Tenders that we were supposed to float did not happen due to the lockdown. In other cases, tenders were passed but the work did not start,” said the official.Anticipating a repetition of hardships that they had suffered last year, several migrant workers have left the city for their homes and villages in other states. Agencies fear that, unlike last time, it might take more time for work on pending projects to take off again since the virus has reached the rural areas.The official said the shortage of labour and difficulty in acquiring construction material were two major reasons for work to slow down over the past year -- issues that are likely to get exacerbated in the months to come.“Construction material is transported from different cities and the closure of shops in those cities poses problems in procuring the material that we require. Shortage of labour also continues to a major concern,” said the official.He added that, unlike the previous wave, several staff members of the ASI have succumbed to Covid-19 in the past two months and so several processes were likely to be expedited only when offices reopen.“When the office reopens, we will have to rework the project deadlines and take stock of the situation since we have lost several staff members to the virus,” said the official.Ajay Kumar, project director of the Delhi chapter of the Indian National Trust for Art and Cultural Heritage, said while work had resumed following the gradual unlocking last year, the second wave had put the brakes on the work once again. “We were supposed to finish work on the Dara Shikoh library building in April but before we could complete the work, lockdown restrictions kicked in,” said Kumar.He said the resumption of work might take time even if the lockdown restrictions were eased-- there is still the uncertainty over labour. “We are not sure if we will be able to find workers immediately. Around 90% of the labour force that we work with comes from other cities. They may or not return as the situation continues to be dire in rural areas,” said Kumar.The much-delayed Chandni Chowk redevelopment project is also likely to get further delayed. The initial deadline was fixed for March 2020, but it was revised to March 2021 due to several factors such as the pandemic-induced delays from last year and legal issues in removing encroachments. While the inauguration for Phase 1 was scheduled for April 17, it was eventually called off as Covid cases started peaking in Delhi.Officials from the Shahjahanabad Redevelopment Corporation (SRDC), the nodal agency for the redevelopment project, said work was bound to be affected in these circumstances. Garima Gupta, managing director, SRDC, said that while the first phase of the project was on the verge of completion, work had to be stopped on account of the pandemic.“The first phase of the project is about to be completed though the lockdown is bound to have an impact on the timeline. Factors such as shortage of labour and procurement of material have hampered work in the past as well due to which the project timeline was breached. Once the situation improves, a new timeline for the project will be decided,” said Gupta.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/pandemic-hits-conservation-of-key-asi-monuments-chandni-chowk-revamp-101622101697358.html

The Bagdogra airport in West Bengal operated 110 flights and handled 6,080 passengers during this period. In Bihar, Gaya stood at the bottom of the pile with 10 flights and 296 passengers during this period.Jai Prakash Narain (JPN) airport in state capital Patna, however, served 25,573 passengers and 297 flights. The Birsa Munda Airport at Ranchi, Jharkhand’s capital, operated 112 flights and served 8,287 passengers during this period.According to AAI’s daily updates, the passenger footfall at many regular and RCS (Regional Connectivity Scheme) airports, such as Jharsuguda in Odisha, Port Blair, Jagdalpur in Chhattisgarh and Pakyong in Sikkim, were nowhere close to the footfalls seen recently at Darbhanga airport.Likewise, between May 1 and May 7, Raipur airport handled 142 flights while catering to 6,158 passengers. In this period, Darbhanga airport handled 8,516 passengers and 68 flights.An AAI official pointed out that Gaya airport, with the worst footfall of air travellers in Bihar, has 63 staff members whereas Darbhanga airport has only seven to man the operations of the airport.

We will vaccinate everyone," Adityanath said in Deoria.The chief minister during his visit to Deoria went to Katrari village and interacted with the Gram Pradhan as well as the members of the Covid monitoring committee.He said that active surveillance committees played a major role in the door-to-door screening of people to curb Covid cases. Timely identification of symptoms and then distribution of medical kits and isolation helped in keeping the spread of the disease in control, Adityanath said.The chief minister emphasised on creating awareness in the village about encephalitis, the UP government said in a statement here.People should avoid open defecation and keep the village clean, he said.Adityanath later reached the Primary Health Centre in Majhgawan to inspect the vaccination campaign and asked the people, who have come for their jabs, to inspire others as well.He also informed that the government is preparing itself to deal with diseases like encephalitis and dengue that occur mainly during the rainy season due to contamination of water and mosquitoes.An action Plan is being prepared in this regard, Adityanath said."We have to go door-to-door in every district prone to encephalitis and provide medicine kits in advance to tackle encephalitis," he added.Adityanath on Wednesday also visited the Integrated Covid command and control room in Kushinagar district and met the family members of a home isolated Covid-19 patient at her home and asked about her well being.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/all-eligible-persons-in-state-will-be-vaccinated-yogi-adityanath-101622090875790.html
27-05-2021||Patna||Patna waterlogging reveals many mitigation plans have remained on paper||Patna municipality’s preparedness to deal with water logging during the monsoons got a rude awakening following just 52 mm of rain on May 19 and 20 this year, when important localities were left flooded for hours. A status check has now revealed that many measures cleared to rid the city of the problem have remained only on paper.While, the urban development department (UDD) and Patna municipal corporation (PMC) claim to have the machinery to clean the capital city of storm water within an hour or so after heavy showers, they were found out badly during the 36-hour intermittent rains which submerged Gandhi Maidan, Patna Junction, Kankarbagh residential colony and Nalanda Medical College and Hospital to name a few.Last year too, similar claims failed to live up to the promise with many localities, including the state secretariat, state legislative building, Shashri Nagar and Rajvanshi Nagar, Patliputra, Kankarbagh getting flooded for hours during the monsoon.Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar inspected waterlogged areas and drainage pumping stations (DPS) last June and asked UDD officials to concretise the old and kuchha Badshahi Nala—the main channel to take drain water out of the capital city. CM’s instruction was in line with the recommendation made by a high-level committee that probed the severe flooding in Patna in 2019. However, the project has not taken off yet.Bihar urban infrastructure development corporation (Buidco) was given Rs168 crore to buy additional submersible pumps, diesel generator sets and pumps etc to ensure smooth operation of 39 existing and 27 temporary drainage pumping stations by June last year. The temporary DPS were to be made permanent, but that did not happen so far.PMC commissioner Himanshu Sharma said the corporation was better prepared this time and had identified water prone areas and installed portable pumps to clear water. “About 97% of the capital city would be cleared of storm water within a few hours if it rained around 100-120 mm in a day,” said Sharma, adding that some areas, which have old drainage networks, might take some extra time to flush out drain water.The commissioner said that a few new drains, connecting the localities facing perennial waterlogging, have been created to deal with the issue. He, however, admitted that the capacity of the main drainage network, which takes water from smaller drains out of Patna, could not be enhanced.504 posts, including for engineers and pump operators, were sanctioned by the state cabinet in May last year to run and maintain pumping stations. However, no appointment for engineers or other technical staff could be made as yet. A special secretary of UDD said he was not sure if any fresh appointments were made in the past one year.Associate professor of Patna University and social activist Shankar Kumar said recurring waterlogging was the result of too much planning on paper and little execution on ground. “First of all, the sewerage and drainage network has to be completely delinked. There should be comprehensive planning for drainage networks in keeping with related hydraulics. But, generally drains are made in isolation. The comprehensive plan with depth and stretch of pipes and rains must be brought in public domain for social inspection of regular cleaning carried by authorities,” said Kumar.Deputy chief minister Tarkishore Prasad (also in-charge of urban development department), UDD principal secretary Anand Kishore and managing director of Buidco Raman Kumar could not be reached for their comments.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/patna-waterlogging-reveals-many-mitigation-plans-have-remained-on-paper-101622089997868.html
27-05-2021||Dehradun||Ramdev dares authorities to arrest him in viral video, IMA escalates offensive||A video, which surfaced on social media on Wednesday, has yoga guru Ramdev challenging the authorities to arrest him. Earlier in the day, the Indian Medical Association (IMA) wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi to book the Yoga guru under sedition laws for questioning the efficacy of allopathic medicines and vaccines against Covid-19 disease.In the 40 second video, Swami Ramdev is seen saying, “Khair arrest to unka koi baap bhi nahi har sakta Swami Ramdev ko…lekin ek shor macha rahey hain...ki arrest Swami Ramdev…kabhi kuch chala detey hai….ki arrest Ramdev…Thug Ramdev…Kabi maha thug Ramdev…Kabi giraftaar Ramdev…chalate rahe hai..chalane do (’No one ..in fact no one’s father can arrest Swami Ramdev…but they are making noise… arrest Ramdev, Thug (con) Ramdev…They are following trends …let them)”HT cannot independently verify the authenticity, origin or context of the video and Patanjali spokespersons have refrained from commenting on it till the filing of this report.Watch | 'Even their fathers can't arrest me': Ramdev video tweeted by CongressThe war of words between the IMA and the yoga guru has escalated over the past couple of days with Ramdev raising 25 questions on the efficacy of modern medicine and the IMA Uttarakhand chapter threatening him with a ₹1000 crore defamation case. It all started with a video, where Ramdev was seen calling allopathy a ‘stupid science’ and alleging that thousands of doctors had died despite taking the vaccine to prevent Covid-19 infection. He later retracted those comments following the IMA and Union health minister’s objections.Following Ramdev’s continued questioning of modern medicine, the Delhi Medical Association filed a complaint against the yoga guru and IMA’s Uttarakhand chapter has given him a fortnight to withdraw his remarks.“Baba Ramdev has no knowledge whatsoever regarding allopathy. Baseless opinion, allegations and statements, as seen in videos surfacing in social media itself, points to his derogatory views about allopathy and doctors who are front line warriors,” said IMA Uttarakhand secretary Dr Ajay Khanna.Swami Shivanand Saraswati of Matri Sadan ashram said it seems Ramdev has become an arrogant person.“If allopathy has no significance for him, then why Acharya Balakrishnan was taken to AIIMS Rishikesh two years back for food poisoning. He should prove first that Coronil is much better than allopathic medicine treatment then raise fingers on Covid-19 treatment and fatalities,” said Swami Shivanand Saraswati.Coronil is an ayurvedic immunity booster manufactured by Ramdev’s firm Patanjali. Acharya Balakrishna is Ramdev’s close aide and co-founder of the firm.Former president of IMA’s Haridwar chapter, Dr Sandhya Sharma said Ramdev should concentrate on jointly fighting the war against Covid-19.“Allopathic doctors are working day-night for past 14 months in the fight against Covid-19 and so are Ayurveda, Homeopathy, Unani or Siddha medical therapies,” said Dr Sandhya SharmaRamdev has courted controversy before with his remarks. Last year, his company launched Coronil after claiming it was a medicine for Covid, only to withdraw the claim months later. In 2012, he claimed that yoga could cure cancer and HIV-AIDS, drawing strict censure from medical councils.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/dehradun-news/ramdev-dares-authorities-to-arrest-him-in-viral-video-ima-escalates-offensive-101622085856596.html
27-05-2021||Bangalore||Bangalore Talkies: Have you exited a WhatsApp group lately?||My friend, Raju, is incensed. He calls me out of the blue and says, “I am thinking of exiting too.”I know exactly what he is talking about. Our high-school WhatsApp group has become a battlefield. On a day last week, six people abruptly exited the group.Some left after a few principled words (which were immediately construed as sanctimonious holier-than-thou natter by the people at whom the words were aimed at). “Those of you who have been defending this government ought to ask yourself if you will take such a strong position if one of your own died in the hospital without bed, oxygen or care.”Others left with a virtual throw of the arms in the air. “Folks, I am tired of this infighting. Will return when things get saner in our group. Thank you all and have a great life.”Raju’s phone call is really a plea. He doesn’t want to leave the group but he wants the fighting to stop.“Can you mute those two jokers?” he asks. “After all, you are the admin.”I know the two people he is talking about. They have hijacked the conversation so that everything is about forwarding articles that support their position.Also Read | Bangalore Talkies: Moonwalking at night on city streetsI attempt a mild plea. “The rest of us can change the discourse. Why can’t you change the topic? Talk about Danish Sait or the latest Kannada movie? Why are you keeping quiet and letting them have at it?”“What’s the use? The two of them just rant and rant. There is no air-time for anything else.”The trouble with what seems like a never-ending, ever-complicated pandemic is that people get testy and want to place blame somewhere. These days, there is enough blame to go around. We want to blame someone for the vulnerability that we all feel.The illusion of control that we all had about our lives has now been irrevocably shattered. Today, we live and breathe because a tiny virus decides not to invade our body.Bengaluru, like much of the country, is teetering under wave after wave of this mutating virus. Battle lines have been drawn and they are as obvious as the Lakshmana Rekha that our politicians like to talk about. There are the pro-BJP folks and the anti-BJP folks.With any large WhatsApp group -- which is where we all live these days -- there are participants who belong to both camps. And they cannot stand each other even if they once played gully cricket together. The result? A potent brew of sarcasm, vicious name-calling, and principled outrage. The stakes, meanwhile, are dug deeper and deeper into the ground. And unlike a battlefield, there are no clear winners. Each side thinks they are right. “Obviously,” they say with a roll of the eyes and a sneer.It didn’t used to be this way. Bengaluru was a different kind of city. It seemed to encourage certain gentility in its citizens. Maybe it is the weather, maybe it is the parks and trees all around. Whatever the reason, I haven’t felt the extreme kind of reaction that happens frequently in say, neighbouring Chennai, during the 15 years that I have lived in Bengaluru. Even road rage is muted and borders on civil.So what do you do? How do you deal with the cacophony of WhatsApp groups? How do you deal with people who once used to be your friends, but have now morphed into folks you can barely stand? How do you keep the vitriol out of the conversation? Do you make a principled and abrupt exit or not? Do you engage or mute the whole conversation?It isn’t only in Bengaluru though. WhatsApp is geography agnostic. Most of the school and college groups that we all belong to have participants from a number of metros all over India and abroad. On the one hand, it is exhilarating to be in this giant courtyard-adda. On the other, it is exhausting to just keep up with the barrage of messages. One of my friends exited all her WhatsApp groups two months ago. It is something I think about every day.A way forward was afforded by Deepa Krishnan, who lives in Mumbai. In a long post on -- what else-- Facebook, she talked about how she used to be one of those abrupt exiters, but eventually made her way back into the groups she exited to figure out how to tolerate the folks whose opinions she was against. “It’s not easy, the process of learning to tolerate someone who is the opposite of you, and whose very presence is constantly pushing your buttons,” she said. “I really struggled a lot. I still struggle, but it is getting easier. What made it possible was my realisation that the group was a community in which I lived (albeit virtually). Communities are made up of all kinds of people, just like the real world around me. I deal with a lot of diverse people in the real world, without getting into fights. Then surely I could do the same in the virtual world?”To clamp down on voices that are the opposite of your own is a slippery slope. If one of the pillars of democracy is free speech, it ought to be part of how we practice it. After 20 minutes of good-natured ribbing, I eventually talked Raju off the cliff he had climbed on. We both agreed that there were two ways to deal with WhatsApp triggers -- to speak louder and take over the conversation, or to stay silent and ignore the fighters.Sanity has to come back sometime.

27-05-2021||Kolkata||Narada sting: Calcutta HC to hear bail plea of 4 arrested leaders||A five-judge bench headed by acting Chief Justice Rajesh Bindal of Calcutta high court is scheduled to hear today the bail plea of the four politicians arrested in the 2016 Narada sting operation case. “The matter has been listed for 11am on Thursday morning. The hearing could not be held on Wednesday as the court had suspended all judicial proceedings because of Cyclone Yaas,” said an advocate who also happens to be a TMC leader. The arrested politicians are sitting ministers of Mamata Banerjee-led West Bengal government, Firhad Hakim and Subrata Mukherjee, Trinamool Congress legislator Madan Mitra, and former MLA Sovan Chatterjee. Also Read | Cyclone Yaas: Calcutta HC suspends all judicial proceedingsThe case pertains to a controversy that erupted ahead of the 2016 assembly elections after Narada News portal uploaded a series of videos purportedly showing a number of high-profile TMC leaders receiving money in exchange for favours to a fictitious company.Though a special CBI court granted them interim bail, the high court stayed it and sent them to judicial custody. Later, the first division bench of the Calcutta high court put the leaders under house arrest on May 21 and a five-judge bench was constituted to hear the bail plea.Meanwhile, this Monday, the CBI moved the Supreme Court against the high court order of putting the leaders under house arrest instead of lodging them in jail in judicial custody. On Tuesday, however, the agency withdrew its petition before the apex court.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/narada-sting-calcutta-hc-to-hear-bail-plea-of-4-arrested-leaders-101622084896644.html
27-05-2021||Delhi||Positivity rate in Delhi below 2% after 60 days||The Capital’s Covid-19 test positivity rate dropped below the 2% mark for the first time in 60 days, while the city added fewer than 1,500 new cases as it continues to recover from a deadly fourth wave of infections.State health minister Satyender Jain hailed the improvement in Covid-19 numbers as an effect of the ongoing lockdown.On Wednesday, the city recorded a test positivity rate — proportion of samples that return positive for Covid-19 — of 1.93%, the lowest since March 27. After the third wave of the infections receded last December, the positivity rate remained below 2% for 103 days.Experts regard the test positivity rate as a crucial metric to gauge the spread of an outbreak in a region. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends a rate below 5% for at least two weeks for an infection to be considered under control in an area.Between December-end and mid-March, this number stayed below 1% for 82 days in Delhi, before infections began to rise, and it became clear that Delhi was entering another surge.The Capital added 1,491 more cases to its tally on Wednesday, even as the active case count dropped below 20,000 for the first time in 50 days.Covid-19 deaths, too, fell to 130 on Wednesday, down from 156 the previous day, according to the state government’s daily health bulletin.“The positivity rate and number of cases have gone down, and this is a direct impact of the lockdown. The bed occupancy has also reduced and several beds are available for Covid-19 patients. Around one-thirds of the ICU beds are also vacant,” said Jain.The fall in active cases has freed up hospital beds, with nearly 75% Covid-19 beds vacant.Around 45% of ICU beds were vacant as on Wednesday evening, the Delhi government’s dashboard showed, compared to end-April, when all ICU beds were occupied.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/positivity-rate-in-delhi-below-2-after-60-days-101622076094989.html
27-05-2021||Delhi||India must be united in hunt for vaccine shots: CM Kejriwal||Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Wednesday asked the Centre to procure vaccine doses and distribute them across the country, saying that several states failed to get global vaccine makers to supply to them directly, a remark that appeared to intensify the tussle over shortage of jabs amid a widened inoculation drive.The chief minister drew a war analogy to make his point. “If Pakistan declares war tomorrow, we cannot tell UP (Uttar Pradesh) to get their own tanks and Delhi to get their own arms. If India loses the war, it won’t be a loss for the BJP but a loss for India as a nation. If Delhi loses the battle, the Aam Aadmi Party does not lose, India will lose. If Maharashtra loses the battle, it is not the Shiv Sena that will lose, but India will lose,” Kejriwal said in a digital briefing, adding that the country needed to stand in solidarity as “Team India”.The chief minister recently said Delhi received 1.6 million doses of Covid-19 vaccines in May, and its allocation for June was halved to around 800,000, adding that at this rate, it would take the city 30 months to inoculate its entire adult population of about 15 million adults.On Wednesday, Kejriwal said the Delhi government has received supply assurances from Dr Reddy’s Laboratories for Sputnik V doses but added that there was little clarity on the number of doses. “Senior government officials had their last meeting regarding Sputnik V supplies on Tuesday. They assured us they will supply but we are currently discussing how many doses they can supply to Delhi at the earliest,” he said.He later appealed to the Centre to approve vaccines being used in other countries for use in India and stressed on expanding the vaccination drive to include people under the age of 18.“At this point we should have opened more vaccine centres. But the shortage of vaccines is forcing governments to close vaccine centres. This is concerning… We could have protected India’s population to a large extent from the devastation caused by the second wave of the pandemic with more vaccination. We should have started vaccinating and scaled up the drive at least six month ago. We were (one of) the first countries to start manufacturing Covid-19 vaccines. But when several countries were expanding their vaccine coverage, we chose to export our vaccines to other countries. We should have started the vaccination drive on a war footing in December 2020,” said Kejriwal.“In March, the second wave started. India should have procured vaccines from across the world. But then, states were asked to procure vaccines on their own. I am in touch with several chief ministers. They have left no stone unturned in their attempts to procure more vaccines, except the ones which were supplied by the central government. But, as far as I know, no state has been able to procure even one vaccine dose directly from the manufacturers on their own. Vaccine companies have clearly said that they will only talk to the central government. Global tenders were floated but they failed,” Kejriwal said.The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) shot back, accusing the Delhi CM of indulging in “politics of self-promotion”. Party spokesperson Sambit Patra said Kejriwal earlier advocated the decentralisation of the vaccination programme, but after the Centre did so, he took a U-turn and was indulging in “lies, misinformation and credit-taking”.The government’s vaccine bulletin on Wednesday said that 43,824 doses were administered in the city on Tuesday. AAP MLA Atishi, in a video press briefing, said around a week ago, about 125,000 to 140,000 people were being vaccinated in Delhi daily, but there has been a drop in the numbers now as hundreds of centres for ages 18-45 have been shut due to the shortage of jabs.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/india-must-be-united-in-hunt-for-vaccine-shots-cm-kejriwal-101622075695130.html
27-05-2021||Delhi||EDMC allows food carts in residential areas||The East Delhi Municipal Corporation (EDMC) has decided to allow food e-carts to sell packaged foods and beverages in residential and mixed land roads.EDMC officials said the mayor has approved this policy on health trade licence last week to encourage entrepreneurship among people. The move will also generate more revenue sources for the cash-strapped civic body.Nirmal Jain, mayor of EDMC, said under the new policy, licences will be issued for e-cart (battery operated) for the sale of packaged food.Similar policies were approved by the north and south municipalities earlier this year.“At the starting of the initiative, maximum of two e-carts will be allotted in each municipal ward, subject to obtaining a no objection certificate (NOC) from the Delhi traffic police. If the plan succeeds, the number of e-carts will be increased. These carts will be mobile and restricted for movement only in residential and mixed land roads, not in commercial areas and notified commercial roads,” said Jain.The mayor further said that e-cart owners can use the prototypes of bus/train coaches for the operation of eating establishments.“EDMC is committed to the welfare of citizens in East Delhi. This initiative will create employment for many people and also help the corporation to become self-reliant,” Jain said.A senior EDMC official, who asked not to be named, said there are a number of eateries already functioning at different locations on mix land-use streets and residential areas falling under the EDMC jurisdiction but the civic body does not get any revenue from such establishments. “This scheme will streamline the problem of haphazard mushrooming of such food carts in every corner of the east Delhi. It will pave a way to regulate and legalise such food carts after paying a licence fee, which will be decided later,” the official said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/edmc-allows-food-carts-in-residential-areas-101622074995752.html
27-05-2021||Delhi||New excise policy set to be cleared, with minor tweaks||Lieutenant Governor Anil Baijal has cleared the Delhi Excise Policy, 2021, and the draft Delhi Excise (Amendment) Rules, 2021, with some suggested tweaks, paving the way for a range of sweeping reforms envisaged by the Delhi government to boost the city’s revenue, crack down on the liquor mafia, and improve user experience.Major changes include slashing the legal drinking age from 25 to 21, getting the state out of the retail alcohol business, overhauling a labyrinthine tax system, reducing the number of dry days in a year from 21 to 3, and improving spread and service. It gets rid of the iron grilles at the front of most liquor vends in the Capital, and allows buyers to browse and purchase the brands of their choice.Documents seen by HT show that the Delhi government’s council of ministers, led by chief minister Arvind Kejriwal, cleared the suggestions given by the L-G in a Cabinet meeting last Friday.Senior government officials privy to the developments said that Baijal recently discussed the draft excise policy and rules with Kejriwal and deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia. While approving the policy, he gave seven suggestions.However, the decision to reduce the legal drinking age to 21 is going to take longer because it requires the Delhi assembly to convene and pass the amendment to the Delhi Excise Act, officials said.One of the amendments, now approved by the Cabinet, included strengthening clauses aimed at preventing brand pushing and cartelisation by tightening checks not just on wholesalers, but also on retailers.“The retail licensee holder should not have any manufacturing facilities/distilleries/breweries/wineries anywhere in the country or abroad either directly or through any sister concerns/related entities. For this purpose, sister concerns/related entities shall mean that the entities should not have common proprietor or partners or directors. Majority ownership (51% or more) of the proprietorship or partnership or company should not lie with the same person in all the entities. The entities should not have a holding subsidiary relationship or are not subsidiaries of the same holding company,” said the Cabinet decision dated May 21. HT has seen a copy of the note on this.On April 6, an HT investigation revealed that several liquor stores in Delhi were controlled by a small group of people through proxy ownership that, experts said, led to cartelisation and suppression of State revenue. The government’s new policy aims to end that.Some of the other amendments include lowering the minimum carpet area of “super premium vends” to 2,500 sq ft from 5,000 sq ft; lowering the minimum stock of these super premium vends from 100 imported liqour brands (including wines) to 50; renewing retail licenses subject to timely payment of license fee and compliance to the rules;The policy, with the amendments approved by the Cabinet, has been again sent to the L-G for his final approval. Once that is granted, the process of notifying the draft excise rules and the policy will be initiated, the official cited above said.A liquor industry executive in Delhi said the changes proposed by the L-G were “nominal”, and that the essence of the new policy remains unchanged. “The latest amendments were done with some stakeholders requesting for changes. Overall, the policy is fundamentally the same,” the trader said, asking not to be named.The policy was first approved by the Delhi government on March 22, after which amendments were approved on April 15 and May 21. It aims at providing a more equitable distribution of stores, scraps several antiquated laws regulating service in restaurants.The policy divides the Capital in 32 zones for retail sale of liquor, and ends the system of collecting licence fees separately from each store. Instead, the licence fee is charged upfront, and retailers are free to decide the selling prices in a competitive environment, rather than an MRP being mandated by the government. Each zone will have at least 27 liquor vends — all of which will go to one successful bidder.Anurag Katriar, president of the National Restaurant Association of India (NRAI) said, “We are extremely happy that pursuant to the earlier decision made by the Delhi government, the L-G has also given his ascent to the new excise policy for Delhi now. This is historic and will significantly change the F&B landscape of Delhi..”Neither the Delhi government nor the L-G office commented on the matter on Wednesday.The Confederation of Indian Alcoholic Beverage Companies (CIABC) also welcomed the move.“..We urged the government to take steps to ensure monopolies are not created in retail space. We are glad to note the government has inserted measures to prevent this.Delhi BJP spokesperson Praveen Shankar Kapoor, however, questioned the government’s priorities. “It is really sad that when the entire country is trying to fight Covid and governments are busy arranging vaccines, Delhi’s Arvind Kejriwal government’s priority is approving liquor policy.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/new-excise-policy-set-to-be-cleared-with-minor-tweaks-101622070621747.html
27-05-2021||Delhi||Tough but crucial lockdown decision enabled Delhi to tame deadliest wave||At 12.15pm on April 19, when Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal announced a lockdown, the Capital was in dire straits.The city had posted an average of 24,000 cases daily for the previous four days, every third person tested was turning out positive, hospitals were overrun, intensive care unit beds were scarce, and pharmacies were short of critical drugs and essentials. There was panic on the streets as infections mounted across India.In the weeks leading up to the announcement, the government had imposed night curfews and restrictions to avoid the crushing economic impact and human suffering seen last year. Imposing a lockdown was a tough choice; at the time, there were “curfews” in some other states, but none had officially gone into complete “lockdown”.Faced with a spiralling virus spread, the government decided to shut down the city and try to break the chain of transmission. “If we don’t impose a lockdown now, it will lead to a major tragedy,” Kejriwal said at the time.The decision has paid dividends. In the six weeks that Delhi has remained locked, the city’s average daily case count plummeted from 23,686 to 2,108 on Wednesday, and the positivity rate dropped from 26.1% to 1.9%. The count of daily deaths, which usually shows a two-week lag from average infections, is also starting to fall with the city recording 130 deaths on Wednesday, the lowest in 41 days.“It was time for decisive action and CM Kejriwal was clear that hard decisions had to be taken to control this wave. It’s because of his timely decision that Delhi was able to bring down its positivity rate from 35% to 2% within a month,” the chief minister’s office said in a statement.Officials said that the lockdown was carefully planned. Prior to the announcement, Kejriwal announced a weekend curfew on April 17 and 18. Special arrangements were made for migrant workers to avoid a repeat of last year’s humanitarian crisis and the government announced expanded ration distribution, and financial assistance to workers registered under the Delhi construction workers board and auto-taxi drivers, reopened hunger relief centres to help the poor and marginalised apart, from facilitating transportation of at least 800,000 workers to their villages.Through the lockdown, the average daily tests didn’t drop below 60,000, even at the peak of the fourth wave.“All of Delhi supported this decision wholeheartedly. A lot of lives have been saved because of this timely decision,” the CM’s office added.The impact of the lockdown, which has been extended five times, gradually made itself apparent.The seven-day average of new infections, which denotes a region’s Covid-19 case curve, peaked at 25,294 on April 23 – the highest ever recorded in the city till date – but then hovered at what appeared to be a week-long plateau before finally beginning to decline starting May 1.By the time the third extension came into effect on May 10, the rate of new infections had dropped 30% from the April 23 peak – for the week ending May 10, there were 17,604 new cases in Delhi every day.In another week, when the fourth extension was enforced, cases dropped 65% from peak levels – there were 8,882 new cases a day in the week ending May 17. For the week ending on May 24, this number has fallen to 2,861 – a drop of 89% from peak levels.Public health experts attributed this easing of the city’s fourth wave largely to the lockdown.“At such a time, the only other possible intervention is vaccination. But even if you do it in the last one month, it will take some time for the people to develop immunity. So, clearly, the numbers came down because the chain of transmission was broken by the lockdown. The decline in Delhi has been fast, which many modellers had predicted would be slower,” said Dr Amit Singh, associate professor, Centre for Infectious Disease Research, Indian Institute of Science, Bengaluru.Due to a supply crunch, vaccination in the city has stagnated in recent weeks though the state has built a capacity of 214,150 doses a day. Due to a shortage of vaccines, Delhi had no option but to shut all the 368 government vaccination centres for the 18-45 age group, while only around 450 instead of about 650 centres are operational for those above 45 years due to non-availability of Covaxin.Strict enforcement of the lockdown played an important part in taming the virus curve, said Sanjeev Khirwar, Delhi’s divisional commissioner, to whom all the 11 district magistrates report.“Without strict enforcement of Covid-appropriate behaviour and lockdown rules, it is impossible to bring contact between individuals to a bare minimum, which is essential to break the chain in this pandemic. From the day of the lockdown (April 19) till Monday (May 24), Delhi issued nearly 100,00 challans and registered about 1,800 FIRs. So, there has been no laxity from our district administrations during this period and the lockdown orders have been followed in letter and spirit,” said Khirwar. The figures of prosecutions and FIRs cited by him are combined data of actions taken by the DMs, police and local bodies.A senior health official said for that Delhi created a record number of microcontainment zones during this wave. Data analysed by HT showed that between April and May, Delhi saw a 1,648.7% jump in the number of its containment zones. The Capital had 3,291 containment zones on April 6. The number shot up to a staggering 57,550 by May 13.Last week, Kejriwal announced that if the downward trend continued in cases and deaths, the lockdown may be eased in phases from May 31. Senior government officials said that lifting of the curbs may start once daily Covid-19 cases fall below 1,000-mark, and remain so for at least two days or more.Delhi’s success on this front was in line with global trends where lockdowns have proved the most effective non-pharmaceutical intervention to curb infections. In a number of global studies last year, researchers attributed strict lockdown to effective disease control in China and south-east Asian countries.Some experts suggested that Delhi should have imposed the lockdown even earlier, but admitted that the case spike was sharp, leaving the government with little time to think and act. “There has to be aggressive testing and the government has to be vigilant about which localities are seeing a surge,” Singh said.Dr. Suneela Garg, Member Covid India Task Force of Lancet Commission, and National President of Indian Association of Preventive and Social Medicine, New Delhi, said while lockdowns cannot eliminate Covid-19, they can flatten the curve. “Basically, a lockdown increases the duration of the pandemic which is always better than getting everyone infected in a single surge and attaining herd immunity. Lockdowns reduce the load on hospitals and help strengthen contact tracing and isolation.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/tough-but-crucial-lockdown-decision-enabled-delhi-to-tame-deadliest-wave-101622070234243.html
27-05-2021||Delhi||From constable to ACP, Delhi cop realises his dreams with true grit||As a student at a government school, Firoj Alam had two dreams -- first, to join the police force; and second to become an “officer”.Alam, the son of a scrap dealer in Pilkhuwa town of western Uttar Pradesh’s Hapur district, realised his first dream in 2010, when he joined the Delhi Police as a constable; and the second on April 1 this year when he joined the force again, but this time as an assistant commissioner of police (ACP).Alam’s success story made headlines last year when he cracked the UPSC 2019 civil services exam, results of which were announced on August 4, 2020. Alam achieved the 645th rank from among 800,000 aspirants.Alam, 30, said he was determined to not waste a single minute that he could find off-duty. “All these years, I shared a room with my friends in Mukherjee Nagar. My colleagues and seniors in the force were very helpful and cooperative. Whenever I managed to find time from my job, I studied. Even for a minute, I did not forget I wanted to clear the civil services. Education was the only way to fulfil my dreams and I was focused on my aim to clear UPSC (exam),” he said from the Police Training College in Delhi’s Jharoda Kalan over the phone.Talking about his journey to the post of ACP, Alam said, “Once I became a constable after passing Class 12, I knew I wasn’t done. I chose to work, make a living, pursued my education but my goal was cracking the civil services. I am fortunate to have succeeded. I am an ACP now,” he said.Having achieved the rank, Alam said the road ahead of him is full of challenges. “I remind myself that I have to be a good leader. There is so much to learn. When I wore the officer’s uniform for the first time, I realised the responsibility and the expectations that come with the stars (insignia).”Now, Alam is helping other constables crack the civil services exam. He started a WhatsApp group called – Delhi Police Family For UPSC. Fifty-eight constables who aspire to pass the UPSC exams are part of the group. “Some have cleared their main examinations, others are preparing. I help them in whatever way I can. Be it sharing notes or time management, I tell my brothers that I am just a call away,” he said.But how has life changed for the man who until last year was among the 46,000 most junior cops in the Delhi police?“Sometimes it is awkward. My constable friends, who called me Bhai(brother) for so many years, now call me sir. We smile. I do not know how to respond to that,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/from-constable-to-acp-delhi-cop-realises-his-dreams-with-true-grit-101622069240350.html
27-05-2021||Delhi||Two held for fraud over O2 cylinders||A 21-year-old man, who claimed to be a social worker and the national president of “India Youth Icon Team” with 1.8 million members and followers, was arrested along with his associate for allegedly duping Covid-19 patients and their families in the name of delivering oxygen cylinders, the police said on Wednesday.Investigators said Ritik Kumar Singh and Sandeep Pandey have duped nearly 50 people in different states of ₹8-10 lakh since the second wave of Covid-19 hit the country in April. They circulated their cellphone number on various social media platforms as suppliers of oxygen cylinders and promised home delivery, the police said.They tricked Covid-19 patients and their families into transferring token amounts into their digital wallets for securing cylinders. But after receiving the money, they blocked the person or deactivated their contact number, said deputy commissioner of police (Shahdara) R Sathiyasundaram.The two suspects were arrested from Greater Noida on Tuesday following investigations into a cheating case filed at the Vivek Vihar police station on the complaint of Sanchet Aggarwal, whose mother was ill and needed an oxygen cylinder. Aggarwal told the police that on May 6, he found a supplier’s number on Instagram and contacted the person, who promised the home delivery of two cylinders after receiving ₹14,000 as token money. The family paid the money through an e-commerce payment gateway. However, neither the cylinders were delivered nor the money was returned. The family filed a complaint after the phone number was switched off, the DCP said.Though the website of “India Youth Icon Team” and his social media profile show that Singh is allegedly connected with a national political party and its senior leaders, the Delhi Police said they have not come across any evidence that links Singh with a political party.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/two-held-for-fraud-over-o2-cylinders-101622068366749.html
27-05-2021||Kolkata||Mini tornado hits villages of West Bengal before cyclone||Before cyclone Yaas could hit the Odisha – West Bengal coast on Wednesday morning, videos of a tornado swirling over villages and the river Ganga in south Bengal were widely shared on social media.The incident took the residents of Bandel and Chinsurah in the Hooghly district and Halisaha in the North 24 Parganas district by surprise, however, the meteorological experts said tornadoes can develop before an approaching cyclone or a major thunderstorm.“When a cyclone approaches, such vortex develops because of the difference in wind speed in the upper air and the ground level, known as vertical wind-shear. This is, however, not a full tornado, It is a mini tornado,” said Sanjib Banerjee, deputy director general of India Meteorological Department’s regional office in Kolkata.“A tornado is basically a column of air rotating violently that extends from a thunderstorm to the ground. It tears and lifts everything in its path,” said a meteorological department official.The cyclone Yaas landfall began near Dhamra port in Odisha on Wednesday morning, even as strong winds and heavy tides saw seawater enter in many coastal towns and villages in Odisha and West Bengal ahead of the landfall.The “very severe cyclonic storm” packed sustained winds of 130-140 kilometers (up to 87 miles) per hour and gusts of up to 155 kph (97 mph) when it made landfall, the IMD said.Chief minister Mamata Banerjee said at least two persons were electrocuted when the mini tornado hit parts of the two districts, and around 40 houses were damaged.Such mini tornadoes have been seen earlier in the district of Murshidabad in west Bengal and also in Odisha experts said. Even though it is rare, but thunderstorm activity occurs when a cyclone approaches, they added.“They [tornadoes] can happen when a cyclone or a thunderstorm approaches. Just like a pilot car moves ahead of a VIP convoy, these mini tornadoes act like a pilot of the cyclone, occurring before a cyclone comes,” said KJ Ramesh, former head of the IMD. In the early 70’s, Delhi witnessed a mini tornado ahead of a thunderstorm in which an entire bus was lifted in the air by the vortex, Ramesh said.If the tornado passes over a water body or a river, it starts lifting the water. There were examples from Odisha where a mini tornado had emptied an entire pond by lifting the water.“Just like a cyclone and a thunderstorm, a tornado too needs heat and moisture to develop,” said RK Jenamani, senior scientist of IMD.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/mini-tornado-hits-villages-of-west-bengal-before-cyclone-101622068150190.html
27-05-2021||Other||Vaccine shortage: No jabbing for 18-45 age group in P’kula today||The Panchkula health department has run out of vaccines for the 18-45 age group, prompting it to suspend jabbing for this group on Thursday. No inoculations have been conducted for this group for the past two days.On Thursday, first and second doses of the vaccine will be administered only to beneficiaries above the age of 45. On May 24 and 25, only 200 slots were opened for the 18 to 45 age group in the district. Immunisation officer Dr Meenu Sasan said, “Over 5,000 doses were administered during the drive-through vaccination that took place last week. So we ran out of our stock. Only a few doses are left for the 18 to 45 age group, which have been reserved for those living in slum and rural areas.”On Wednesday, 1, 347 persons were vaccinated in all.Earlier, Rajeev Arora, additional chief secretary, health and family welfare, Haryana, had said: “Currently, vaccination sourcing is a controlled commodity. We are getting vaccines for the 45-plus group from the government of India, and for the 18 to 45 group, the state government is directly coordinating with the company. But this is also regulated and we get limited supply, and there is nothing much that we can do.”Though the vaccination drive has not been stopped for even a day in Panchkula, getting a jab has not been easy task for residents. Days after starting the drive for the 18-plus group, the administration stopped giving the first dose to the 45-plus group. And now, it has halted jabbing for the 18-plus group while resuming the drive for the 45-plus category.As per Meenu Sasan, “We are managing with whatever limited resources we have. We have been vaccinating people without a break. Even people from adjoining states are coming to Panchkula to get a shot. But we cannot do much, unless we get a fresh stock.”Till date, 2, 08, 807 persons have been vaccinated by the Panchkula health department, out of which 37, 674 are in the age group of 18-45 years.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/vaccine-shortage-no-jabbing-for-18-45-age-group-in-p-kula-today-101622063235214.html

27-05-2021||Chandigarh||Patiala jailbreak: 2 assistant jail superintendents, a warder suspended for lapse||The Punjab prisons department has suspended two assistant jail superintendents and a warder for negligence in the Patiala jailbreak case. Additional director general of police (prisons) PK Sinha ordered suspension of assistant jail superintendents Tarlochan Singh and Kuldip Singh and warder Sant Singh on the basis of an inquiry report submitted by IG (prisons) who found them prima facie guilty in the jailbreak incident. Three prisoners — Inderjit Singh, Sher Singh and Jaspreet Singh — fled from the quarantine ward of the Patiala Central Jail on the intervening night of April 27 and 28 by scaling the prison wall. An FIR under sections 223, 224, 225, 225-A, 427, 120-B of the Indian Penal Code, section 4 of the Damage Public Property Act, and section 42 of the Prison Act was registered against the escapees at the Tripuri police station. The police had constituted a special investigation team (SIT) besides six other teams to track and nab the accused. Eight days later, the SIT managed to nab Inderjit, a former army trainer. The police also arrested a person who allegedly gave shelter to Inderjit when he was on the run. Sher Singh and Jaspreet are still absconding.“The IG in his report found that the officials did not ensure surveillance. They were also found negligent as per the jail manual. A stern action should be taken against officials as the incident has dented the image of the prisons department,” an official said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/patiala-jailbreak-2-assistant-jail-superintendents-a-warder-suspended-for-lapse-101622061015139.html

The statue will come up in the vicinity of the village. The locals said the Indian Air Force pilot died in an attempt to save the lives of hundreds of residents of Langeana Nawan and adjoining Langeana Purana village as the fighter jet could have crashed into residential areas. The two villages have a population of nearly 5,000. They have already approached sculptors to make the statue of Choudhary. Also, an akhand path (non-stop recitation of Guru Granth Sahib) started at Langeana Purana on Wednesday in the squadron leader’s memory and a bhog ceremony will be held on Friday. Choudhary, whose body was found from fields nearly 2km from the crash site, was on a routine training sortie and was returning to the IAF base in Suratgarh, Rajasthan. He hailed from Baghpat district in Uttar Pradesh.Langeana Nawan sarpanch Jagsir Singh said, “He averted the crashing of the fighter jet in the residential area. He could have survived by crashing the jet in the residential area but chose to save others’ lives. The statue will be installed with the contribution of villagers. Once the IAF completes formalities pertaining to the death, we will start the work on the installation of statue.”Langeana Purana sarpanch Sukhdev Singh said, “We lost a brave young warrior in the unfortunate incident. Senior IAF officials were also informed and they may also join us in the bhog ceremony on Friday.”Moga deputy commissioner Sandeep Hans, said, “It is a good initiative. They just have to inform us where they want to install the statue.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/moga-villagers-to-install-statue-of-iaf-pilot-who-died-in-mig-crash-101622060954982.html

Mohali deputy commissioner Girish Dayalan said it had come to fore that the hospital has been charging around ₹20,000 a day from Covid patients.As per the rates set by the government, a private hospital can charge ₹16,500 a day from a patient requiring ventilator support while for a bed without ventilator, the charges are capped at ₹14,500 a day. This includes all expenses including room rent, visiting charges and PPE requirements. “Mayo Hospital was found to be offering a package of ₹40,000 for the entire span of hospitalisation but was adding ₹6,000 a day as visiting charges, which is completely illegal,” said the DC. Referral money The administration also found that the management of the hospital was paying 10% to the doctors of other hospitals for referring patients here and in the last two months, the management has paid ₹17 lakh as referral money. Dayalan said, “Strict action will be taken against the hospital.”One of the directors of the hospital admitted that the patients were charged more than the limit set by the government but added that the management has decided to refund the money.Hospital’s managing director KD Singla said, “I am not aware of overcharging but have I have already submitted my resignation to the board of directors due to ongoing controversy in the hospital.” On Monday, a four-member inquiry committee headed by sub divisional magistrate (SDM) Jagdeep Sehgal had recommended penal and legal action hospital after discrepancies were found in the bills issued for purchase of remdesivir, a drug used in Covid treatment. In the report submitted to Mohali deputy commissioner Girish Dayalan, the committee stated that the bills for the injection were issued in the name of a prominent cement manufacturing firm, besides the chief finance officer (CFO) Mukesh Sharma and a few doctors of the hospital. One bill was also issued in the name of a woman on March 17 even as she was admitted on March 18. While doctors reportedly denied getting any injections, the reply to the show-cause notice issued to the hospital was also unsatisfactory, the committee stated in its report.Internal controversyWhen the controversy erupted, three directors of the hospital — Deepak Tyagi, Virender Dhankhad, and Dr Manoj Sharma — had accused the CFO and his son of illegally procuring remdesivir injections and selling them at a premium to patients outside the hospital. The CFO, on the other hand, has alleged that the directors had fabricated documents pertaining to the drug sale to frame him. Both allegations are being probed by the police.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/covid-treatment-more-trouble-for-mayo-hospital-as-100-cases-of-fleecing-surface-101622060174993.html
27-05-2021||Chandigarh||Row over ‘missing content’ from SGPC’s new website||A controversy has erupted over the new website of the Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC) with voices being raised over removal of important content related to the Sikhism from the portal. The SGPC unveiled its new website www.sgpcamritsar.org in January this year, which earlier was was www.SGPC.net. Urging the Akal Takht to take action against the SGPC, Sikh Federation activist Prof Sarchand Singh said the gurdwara body has deliberately removed old and new kirtan (devotional singing), hukamnama sahib (hymn from the Guru Granth Sahib which is an order to Sikhs) pages from the new website. He said, “The panth (community) has yet not got the plundered treasure of the Sikh Reference Library and the SGPC president Jagir Kaur has removed important content related to Sikh customs and history from the website under a deep-rooted conspiracy. Instead of using Punjabi, the new website is decorated with the English language. Instead of uploading the pictures of Sikh martyrs, the SGPC has uploaded pictures of celebrities and political leaders.” He said, “It has been around four months since the new website was launched, but there is no information about the Sikh history, the life of Sikh gurus and Sikh ideology. If there had been any issue with the old website, the SGPC chief could have taken suggestions from Sikh scholars and technicians. No permission was taken for changing the website from the executive committee.” Terming the allegations as “baseless”, SGPC’s additional secretary Sukhminder Singh said the work to transfer data from the old portal to the new is still underway. He said the domain name of the old website gave an impression of a network whereas the SGPC is a large organisation. Therefore, the domain name was changed to ‘sgpcamritsar.org’. “The new portal will contain the entire data which was available on the old website. As per the need of the hour, modern technology has been adopted in the new website,” he said. Sukhminder said Jagir Kaur had constituted a committee of Sikh experts, including Dr Balwant Singh Dhillon, Dr Paramvir Singh, Principal Prabhjot Kaur, Dr Inderjit Singh Gogoani, Dr Amarjit Singh, and Dr Jogeshwar Singh for reviewing the content on the website. Not only this, many historic, as well as new books related to the Sikh faith, will also be a part of this new website. “Sarchand Singh can approach the SGPC with his suggestions, which will be welcomed. It is not good to create baseless controversies,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/row-over-missing-content-from-sgpc-s-new-website-101622059997396.html

Multinational conglomerate Larsen and Toubro (L&T) is responsible for its maintenance.The residents’ complaints range from blocked stormwater pipes and ill-maintained parks to wild outgrowth. They say internal footpaths and periphery berms are either missing or in dilapidated condition, while there are no benches, canopies, or swings for children. Stray cattle and herders also have a free run in the residential area. Moreover, GMADA has failed to construct a dedicated bus stop, dispensary, milk booth, police post and community centre.Ranjit Malhotra, who is building a house in Block H, decried the poor-quality infrastructure. “The procedure for getting water and sewerage connections is so cumbersome that allottees are always at receiving end,” he said.He added that GMADA has failed to check illegal encroachments by street vendors that too on the main road. “Vendors are using electricity panels and street poles for free advertising and defacing homes and parks,” he complained.Vasudev Gupta, president of Block A, said, “Dangling electricity wires are a potential hazard. Fogging against mosquitoes and pests is not done on a regular basis, leaving the resident to fend for themselves and remain indoors in the evening and early morning hours.”“The sewerage system is mess and even stormwater pipes are blocked in most parts of Aerocity. Parks are in shambles in absence of maintenance,” said Kuldeep Singh Issapuri, president of Block J.Bhupinder Singh, president of Block H, alleged that only 60% of the streetlights work, while electricity panels for meters in most of the blocks are either missing, damaged or need to be replaced immediately. Also, high and low-tension power lines have been damaged at numerous places and residents have to bear the brunt of the power cuts for long hours. “What makes the situation worse is the absence of three-phase power lines and a dedicated grid for Aerocity,” he rued.GMADA chief engineer Davinder Singh said L&T is responsible for the maintenance work and we will seek a report from the latter. “As far as dispensary, police post and community centre are concerned, the department concerned should contact the GMADA officer for getting sites earmarked,” he said.When contacted, Ravi Kumar, L&T project manager for Aerocity, said, “Allottees are responsible for the blocked sewerage as they dump construction material over manholes. Our power cables are damaged due to this frequently. Parks are being maintained time to time.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/mohali-five-years-on-basic-amenities-continue-to-elude-aerocity-residents-101622059636983.html

It will also be a regional driver training hub.With little human intervention, the sensor-based machines at the state-of-the-art facility will inspect, test and certify whether a vehicle is fit for plying on roads.All commercial goods vehicles, taxis and public and school buses will have to visit the new facility for annual fitness certification.The facility will test each vehicle on more than 24 parameters as laid down in the Motor Vehicles Act before certifying its road worthiness. These parameters include components, parts and fixtures such as brakes, steering, suspension, emissions transmission, electrical systems and assessment of general condition of the vehicle including tyres etc. Failing to pass the stipulated tests, vehicles would be denied permission to plying on the road.The road-worthiness test ensures safety of passengers or other road users such as pedestrians. “These tests also help in keeping worst polluting, unworthy vehicles off the roads, and help protect the environment,” a UT official said.The entire inspection process will involve negligible human intervention. The current system involves state transport authority (STA) officials’ subjectivity, which encourages corruption. The manual inspection is not exhaustive. The new facility will eliminate the need for STA inspectors’ discretion.It will also make the process time-bound and transparent. During the tests, owners will be able to see the process through CCTV feeds and nobody will be allowed near the vehicle, including officials.“The centre will be spread over three acres of land. The construction will start within a month and is expected to be completed in a year’s time,” the official added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/work-on-automated-vehicle-inspection-hub-set-to-kick-off-in-chandigarh-101622059574938.html

After renewal of the 2003 ceasefire agreement in February this year, the Indian Army has renovated an old cafeteria at the Kaman post and also installed a 60 feet National Flag Pole. The post was named in 1956 in the memory of Lt. Col. Kaman Singh, the hero of ‘Thikal war’ in 1948 and a Mahavir Chakra awardee.“The post is especially popular for its view across the Line of Control,” said defense spokesman Emron Musavi. He adds that Kaman Post was once popular for motivational tours organised by schools and colleges.The Srinagar-Muzaffarabad route was first thrown open in the year 2005 and was seen as one of the biggest Confidence Building Measures (CBM’s) between India and Pakistan. The route was made inoperative in April 2019 purportedly for some repair work but could not be reopened after relations between the two countries nosedived after abrogation of Article 370 and bifurcation of Jammu and Kashmir into two Union Territories in August that year.The Indian Army officials have spoken of plans to turn Kaman post into a major tourist attraction offering stunning views across the LoCs with accompanying tales of snipers shooting from pigeon hole bunkers at one of the most hostile boundaries between India and Pakistan. The renovated cafeteria near Kaman bridge also known as ‘Aman Setu’ (bridge of peace) was thrown open a few days ago and is now being run by a local former army soldier. Hilal Turkey, chairman of Salamabad Cross LoC Trade termed the reopening of the cafeteria a good omen.“After the ceasefire, this is a welcome step and the people are hopeful that once Covid-19 situation improves, the road will be thrown open for both trade and the bus service. This was the most hostile place; now it’s being revived again which gives all the traders a hope of trade and bus resumption.”Turkey said that around 4,229 families have suffered due to the suspension of trade through two trading points of Uri-Muzaffarabad and Poonch-Rawalakot.“We have suffered an annual loss of about ₹40 crores due to trade suspension. Now we feel the ice is again melting between the two neighbouring countries,” Turkey added.The developments have also made locals hopeful. “Many families could meet their family members after decades when Srinagar - Muzaffarabad road was opened 18 years ago. After its closure, hopes were crushed. Now, there is again a hope that this road will open again,” said Farooq Ahmad Shiekh whose relatives live at Muzaffarabad. He travelled many times to Pakistan Occupied Kashmir (PoK) via Kaman.“Though it’s premature to say anything when it comes to India-Pakistan relations, we have not lost hope,” Shiekh adds.Some experts say that the renewal of the ceasefire agreement through back channel negotiations pointed to an effort towards improving relations, however, it would be too early to hope for a significant breakthrough given the fact that the two sides are currently sticking to their respective stands on Kashmir.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/kashmiris-hope-for-reopening-of-srinagar-muzaffarabad-trade-route-101622058799457.html

Proper Covid protocols are being adhered to in the holding centre and in all the prisons across Jammu and Kashmir,” the official added.A Rohingya, who lives in Kiryani Talab in Narwal in Jammu, said, “We are also hearing that testing and vaccination drive will be started soon in all our clusters, but so far no one has come to us.”On March 6, on the instructions of the Union ministry of home affairs, the Jammu and Kashmir administration had started a verification drive of the Rohingya, and moved 197 of them to the Hiranagar holding centre.There are close to 7,000 Rohingya refugees in Jammu & Kashmir, numbers that have increased since the late 2000s when they first arrived in the region after escaping from Myanmar, where they were facing persecution.Rohingyas plead administration to provide rationNajmul Haq, plot in-charge at Rohingyas’ cluster at Kiryani Talab in Narwal, said, “Is there any possibility of releasing the inmates from the holding centre because we have younger ones here in the cluster, whose parents have been lodged in the holding centre.”“We request the administration to provide us help during the pandemic because there is a lockdown and we are not able to get any work to eke out a living. We appeal to the government to provide us ration for survival,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/53-rohingyas-test-covid-at-jammu-sub-jail-quarantined-101622058797025.html

Besides, 47% ventilators are still non-functional at the facility, which caters the south Malwa region of the state.Against a daily caseload of 8,668 May 11, the state reported 4,539 new cases on May 25. The positivity rate has also dropped from 15% to 6.51%.Of the total 119 ventilators, only 63 are operational at the Faridkot facility.With 450 isolation beds facility, the GGSMCH is providing care to critical Covid patients from Bathinda, Mansa, Muktsar, Moga, Ferozepur, Fazilka and Faridkot districts. As per official records, all 128 level-3 Intensive care unit (ICU) beds with ventilators and 175 of the 320 level-2 beds are occupied. Following non-availability of beds, critically ill patients have to wait or go to another level-3 facility in other district. On May 11, 73 of the total 119 ventilators at the GGSMCH were found non-functional following multiple defects. Of the 73 non-functional ventilators, 71 were received under Prime Minister (PM) Cares Fund. Though engineers of a private company visited the facility to repair the ventilators, all of them are yet to be operational. Doctors have also refused to certify some ventilators due to snags.GGSMCH medical superintendent Dr Shilekh Mittal said they are facing a shortage of level-3 beds as patients from nine districts are visiting the facility. “Right now, all ventilators are occupied but engineers are working to repair the faulty life-saving machines. We are stuck in a cycle as 3-4 ventilators are being repaired everyday but the same number of these machines stop working due to some defect. We are not using some ventilators as their performance is not up to mark,” he added.Dr Ruhee Dugg, registrar, Baba Farid University of Health Sciences (BFUHS), said initially the GGSMCH got 82 ventilators under the PM Cares Fund and nine from AvGa. Later, more ventilators under PM Cares Fund were shifted to the Faridkot medical college from other districts. But these were non-functional. The engineers are continuously repairing the faulty ventilators but some are yet to be certified doctors. We put the machines on a 24-hour trial run as we cannot test them on patients directly. We are witnessing problems in some ventilators even after repairs,” she added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/all-icu-beds-occupied-47-ventilators-still-non-functional-at-faridkot-medical-college-101622058134882.html

He also questioned the move to transfer about 489 subsidiary health centres in rural Punjab under the rural development and panchayat department to the health department. “These decisions will deprive the people of about 3,000 villages of medical services,” the LOP claimed in a statement, accusing the state government of betraying the people. He also alleged that the black marketing of Amphotericin B drug for black and white fungus was rampant.Cheema demanded the Punjab government stop the mistreatment of the people living in the villages and immediately appoint MBBS doctors in villages so that the people are not forced to go to cities for treatment of Covid and other diseases.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/aap-slams-punjab-govt-for-removal-of-doctors-from-villages-101622057955547.html
27-05-2021||Mumbai||Pawar urges PM Modi to withdraw controversial policy decisions in Lakshadweep||Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar urged Prime Minister (PM) Narendra Modi to look into the concerns raised over policy decisions taken by the Lakshadweep administration recently. He also requested for re-examination and withdrawal of the decisions that would allegedly lead to destruction of traditional means of livelihood and the unique culture of the Union Territory. Lakshadweep is represented in the Lok Sabha by NCP MP Mohammad Faizal.Pawar made the demand through a letter to the PM on Wednesday.Lakshadweep administrator Praful Khoda Patel’s recent reforms have attracted widespread resentment among the local populace, with many believing the changes are aimed at “destroying the unique culture and tradition” of the islands. Around a dozen MPs, including Faizal, sent letters to President Ram Nath Kovind seeking immediate recall of the decisions.Pointing out the decisions and their likely impact, Pawar said, “I fear that unwarranted and irrational decisions taken by the Lakshadweep administrator would lead to the destruction of traditional means of livelihood and the unique culture of Lakshadweep. It has already resulted in huge unrest and protest.”“I would be happy if orders and decisions taken by the incumbent authority of Lakshadweep administration are re-examined and necessary directions are passed to the Lakshadweep administration to withdraw the unreasonable and unwarranted orders,” he added.Lakshadweep, which has an overwhelming Muslim majority, is facing a draft regulation against cow slaughter, ignoring the fact that beef forms part of the daily diet. Locals have opposed draft regulation for the creation of Lakshadweep Development Authority, fearing this would enable outsiders to purchase land. The administration has also decided to implement Goonda Act in Lakshadweep, which has a very low crime rate.Meanwhile, while the islands had been free from Covid-19 for almost a year, the decision to lift the stipulation for mandatory quarantine for travellers from Kochi is attributed as a key reason for a surge in cases.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/sharad-pawar-urges-pm-modi-to-withdraw-controversial-policy-decisions-in-lakshadweep-101622057954297.html
27-05-2021||Mumbai||Amid reservation issues, Sharad Pawar meets Maharashtra CM Uddhav Thackeray||Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar met chief minister (CM) Uddhav Thackeray at his official residence on Wednesday evening. The meeting, which lasted for around 45 minutes, took place in the backdrop of the issues related to Maratha reservation.Pawar is considered the guiding force of the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government. He was the one who brought the Shiv Sena and Congress to join hands with his party to form the Uddhav Thackeray-led government in the state.It has been more than two months since Pawar met Thackeray as the former was not well. He had to get admitted in the hospital multiple times for endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) procedure, gallbladder surgery, post-operative gallbladder surgery and a surgery for removing mouth ulcer. For the past one month, the NCP chief was recuperating at home.The Maratha community is upset as 12% and 13% reservation granted to them in education and government jobs, respectively, under the Socially and Educationally Backward Classes (SEBC) Act was quashed by the Supreme Court. Many Maratha organisations have threatened to start large-scale public agitations in the state.Besides, the Congress, an ally in MVA, has been demanding withdrawal of the state’s May 7 decision scrapping reservation in promotion. After state energy minister Nitin Raut, state Congress chief Nana Patole too raised the demand.“Both the leaders would have discussed the reservation issue as many leaders from the Maratha community are threatening to start agitation. Apart from this, the issue of reservation in promotion, which may have come for discussion, also cannot be overlooked,” said a senior NCP leader. He added that the two leaders may have discussed about relief to those affected by Cyclone Tauktae which hit the state last week.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/amid-reservation-issues-sharad-pawar-meets-maharashtra-cm-uddhav-thackeray-101622057894247.html
27-05-2021||Mumbai||Covid management: Shiv Sena’s shot at retaining stronghold Mumbai||With Covid-19 expected to be a major issue even for the rest of 2021, the Shiv Sena has turned its entire attention to managing the disease in the city, considering the party rules the state as well as the Mumbai civic body. While the second wave seems to be waning, the Sena is now focusing on vaccination in Mumbai and preparing infrastructure for the projected third wave that could hit between July and September. Mumbai matters Mumbai is important in the Sena’s political plans. The party has been ruling the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC), which handles local governance in India’s financial capital, for almost three decades. The BMC has an annual budget of over ₹30,000 crore, which is more than a few small states in India, giving the Sena its strength and influence. Consequently, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has been making plans to wrest control of the civic body. In the 2017 civic polls, the BJP emerged the second biggest party after the Sena, and the party’s leader in the state, Devendra Fadnavis, is working on winning power in the BMC in the next civic polls scheduled to be held in February 2022. The Sena, meanwhile, is working on its counter-strategy. The party’s efforts in Mumbai are largely handled by environment and tourism minister and Sena leader Aaditya Thackeray, insiders said. Thackeray, the guardian minister of Mumbai (suburban district), has been holding regular review meetings with top civic officials during the second wave. The Sena cadre and Yuva Sena (party’s youth wing headed by Aaditya Thackeray) functionaries have been on the ground since the pandemic hit in March 2020. During the second wave, they were helping people with admissions to hospitals, securing anti-viral injections Remdesivir and Tocilizumab, getting oxygen cylinders, etc. Now, the Sena-controlled BMC has decided to set up vaccination centres in each of the 227 wards across the city, asking corporators to take initiative and set up helpdesks to guide people. Thackeray’s meeting with senior civic officials has yielded decisions such as two-time reporting from laboratories, instead of the 24-hour cycle; helping patients secure a bed at jumbo facilities even at night; increasing bed capacity on war-footing; drive-in vaccination centres and calling global tenders for 10 million vaccine doses. As a part of the preparation for the third wave, earlier this month, Thackeray directed BMC officials to set up a dedicated paediatric Covid-19 ward at Nesco exhibition ground — one of the BMC’s jumbo Covid Care Centres. Shiv Sena MP and party’s chief spokesperson Arvind Sawant said the idea is that if Mumbai gets safe, so does Maharashtra. “The European nations and United States of America have vaccinated their citizens on a large scale and are now protected against Covid. Our focus has not shifted. Aaditya ji has said that each ward should at least have one vaccination centre. Then we took a decision to add more centres in wards; in my constituency we have two to three vaccination centres. The idea was simple – to bring the vaccination centres closer home. He (Aaditya) also came up with the idea of drive-in vaccination,” said Sawant. The vaccination centres are mostly run by the BMC and in some cases by private hospitals in association with elected representatives. BJP’s plans The BJP is likely to use all its might to wrest the civic body from the Sena, while the latter is looking for a Covid success story to get an upper hand. However, Sawant denied there are any political calculations behind the management. “In Mumbai, the Shiv Sena is known for its social work. Our shakhas (local offices) are a centre for people to voice their grievances or seek help. It has created enormous goodwill for us over the years. In times of a pandemic, it is logical that people would expect us to help them and we are anyway doing it,” said a former Sena mayor. “The only addition is making our on-ground work known. The BJP has a massive machinery for marketing, which shows what their governments do irrespective of their actual performance. We also need to keep people informed,” she added. The equation In 2017, the BJP and Sena, despite being in power in alliance in the state, fought the civic polls against each other. It was a close contest, with the Sena securing 84 seats and the BJP bagging 81 seats, in the 227-member body. The BJP would want to capitalise on its numbers in the upcoming elections and has been targeting the Sena-led corporation over the handling of Covid-19 in Mumbai. Earlier this month, Fadnavis alleged the death figures in Mumbai are being fudged and the number of RT-PCR tests has reduced to show a lower case count. Earlier, the BJP has also alleged corruption in the construction of Covid Care Centres. Political analyst Surendra Jondhale said this time, traditional agendas and planks such as Hindutva ideology and Marathi manoos will not be at the fore in the campaigning for BMC polls. “The conversation has changed due to Covid now. People will look at Covid handling and vaccinations. For Shiv Sena, the prime political concern will be handling the third wave and vaccination. The BJP government at the Centre is creating a bottleneck in vaccination, not just for Mumbai, but also for the state. The BJP, which gave a neck-and-neck fight last time, wants to win the BMC elections after losing the state,” Jondhale, a former professor of political science at Mumbai University, said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/covid-management-shiv-sena-s-shot-at-retaining-stronghold-mumbai-101622057835617.html
27-05-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Final-year PG medical, dental students await exam schedule||Days after the state government and the Maharashtra University of Health Sciences (MUHS) released exam commencement dates for undergraduate and postgraduate medical, dental and diploma exams, final-year postgraduate medical students are still waiting to hear about their exam schedule. Originally scheduled to take place in May, the exam was postponed by a month by the National Medical Commission (NMC) to ensure that all students are working across hospitals as the country was facing the peak of the second wave of Covid-19. As of May 25, these students still do not know when their exams will take place.“We have sent repeated requests and reminders to MUHS as well as authorities at the Directorate of Medical Education and Research (DMER), but to no avail. The Central government extended our residency by one month till May 31; so post that, we should be appearing for exams but the authorities have no clarity,” said Dr Pranav Jadhav, vice-president (central), Maharashtra Association of Resident Doctors (MARD). In April, the Central government’s decision to extend final-year postgraduate medical and dental exam by a month and the National Eligibility-cum-Entrance Test for postgraduate courses by four months did not go down well with stakeholders, especially the students. To make matters worse, the state released a circular postponing the exams, but so far has not given any clarity on the future date of exams, something several other states including Rajashthan and Delhi have already released.“Most of us (students) are working every day at hospitals across the state and have had no time to prepare for exams. MARD has also requested that the government give us at least 45 days before starting exams, to give us ample time to prepare, but with no date in sight, we are unsure when the exam will finally be held,” said Dr Prajakta Mhatre, another final-year postgraduate medical student.While exams for undergraduate medical and dental students as well as non-final year postgraduate students are scheduled to take place between June 10 and 30, final-year students still await answers from the authorities. “We cannot announce exam dates until we get a go ahead from the state government. Once that comes through, we will confirm the schedule and also ensure that students get ample time for exam preparation,” said a senior exam authority from MUHS, on condition of anonymity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-final-year-pg-medical-dental-students-await-exam-schedule-101622057774301.html
27-05-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai: SC candidate moves high court over LLM admissions||A candidate belonging to the Scheduled Caste (SC) category, who had applied to the University of Mumbai’s (MU) Master of Law (LLM) course, has filed a writ petition in the Bombay high court (HC) alleging an unfair admission process.Maruti Mhavarkar, a lawyer enrolled with the bar council of Maharashtra, had applied to MU for LLM in criminal law and had secured 68 marks in the common entrance test (CET). His name did not appear in any of the first four merit lists. Having realised that few seats were available for criminal law, he wrote an application to the university’s department of law for admission to any seat in any stream as per merit. The varsity then issued a notice stating that seats for reserved category students were vacant in two subjects — human rights and law, and environment and legal order. Applications were invited for the same. Mhavarkar claimed that he applied for both the subjects, but did not make it in the fifth and sixth merit lists too. The sixth merit list was issued last Wednesday. “Candidates who have scored less than me have been admitted. The admission process was unfair and unjust. I am seeking judicial intervention for the same,” he said. Rajeshri Varhadi, professor and head of MU’s department of law, said, “The entire admission process is computerised. There is no scope of any human intervention. All applications received for reserved category seats were measured on merit alone.”Refusing to comment on the writ petition, Varhadi said, “There is a process for responding to such legal cases. A lawyer is appointed by the university and we will respond through the lawyer.”Mhavarkar, in his plea, has urged the court to undo the “injustice meted out to him in the admission process”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-sc-candidate-moves-high-court-over-llm-admissions-101622057714309.html
27-05-2021||Mumbai||Cyclone Tauktae felled 812 trees in city: Time to dig deeper for cause||Tree damage after Cyclone Tauktae, which uprooted at least 812 trees in Mumbai as per official data, has once again brought to attention allegedly poor horticultural practices by the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC). Over the past week, several environmentalists and activists pointed out that a significant number of uprooted trees had not been planted in adequately-sized basins. At least 15 such instances have been brought to the notice of Hindustan Times since March 16.“This would have certainly contributed to the tree’s fate because it needs a fully-developed root system to keep it anchored. Too small tree basins, especially for larger trees, hamper this. More worryingly, several trees which fell did not even have any discernible basins around them, and were concretised or paved all the way to the trunk. When this happens, the underlying critical root zone could get disturbed, weakening the tree’s structural integrity,” said Stalin D, director, NGO Vanashakti.Stalin on Tuesday wrote to BMC and environment department, requesting the authorities to take corrective measures before the onset of monsoon. “This email is to voice our concerns about the precarious condition of the trees of Mumbai and Thane city. All the trees are standing in shallow concrete tree basins and have no soil for the roots to grip and stand firm,” Stalin’s letter stated. According to regular logs maintained by Vanashakti, there are at least 500 large, old-growth trees in Mumbai and Thane which require urgent de-paving. One particular locality where this problem is conspicuous, according to environmentalists, is south Mumbai’s Ballard Estate, where wide roads are lined with large banyans and gulmohars among others. A visit to the area on Wednesday by a HT team found BMC workers clearing up trees that fell during last week’s cyclone. HT identified at least six large trees that had been completely uprooted, while at least a dozen others were vaulting or bursting out of their tree basins, causing cracks in the pavement. “Giant trees on the road towards RBI signal and the road alongside Port Trust Bhavan have died after concreting of the roads and basins was done. The remaining trees in Ballard Estate will collapse and fall in this monsoon or within the next year if urgent steps are not taken... Despite the National Green Tribunal (NGT) ordering that tree bases must be freed of concrete, and soil be provided for the tree bases, no action has been taken so far. Neither depth nor lateral space is available for the trees to anchor itself,” Stalin informed the authorities. In 2015, Vanashakti had approached NGT seeking remedial measures against rampant concretisation over root zones of large trees in Mumbai. In a subsequent order dated September 10, 2015, the tribunal instructed BMC to implement a “de-concretisation programme... in phased manner, ward by ward and not selectively but in contiguous manner”. BMC, for its part, had conveyed to NGT in September itself that around 11,790 trees in the city had already been de-concretised, but given there were an estimated 1.9 million trees in the city at the time, covering them all would take considerably longer. It is unclear whether the programme has continued to be implemented in the years since. Officials in BMC’s tree authority and garden department did not respond to requests for comment on Wednesday.“The programme has either tapered off or is being implemented too slowly. The situation after Cyclone Tauktae shows clearly that the order has not been complied with fully. Had it been so, we may have lost fewer trees,” said Zaman Ali, advocate for Vanashakti in the matter, referring to guidelines prescribed by the ministry of urban development in its Urban Green Guidelines, 2014.“A minimum area of 1.25x1.25 metre around the trees be left un-cemented and widening of roads up to the trunk of trees be avoided, as roots come under the asphalted roads, which will gradually die. In case of storm, these trees may topple. Activities which adversely affect the roots are to be minimised,” the guidelines stated. However, as Ali pointed out, these are only directive principles and not legally binding.“But such guidelines are still required to be followed in absence of a statutory directive,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/cyclone-tauktae-felled-812-trees-in-city-time-to-dig-deeper-for-cause-101622057654331.html
27-05-2021||Chandigarh||Six months of stir: Punjab farmers hold protest, hoist black flags atop houses||Farmers in Punjab put up black flags on their houses and burnt effigies of the Narendra Modi government on Wednesday, joining a “black day” call given by protesting farmer unions to mark six months of their agitation at Delhi borders against the Centre’s three farm laws.Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) chief Sukhbir Singh Badal raised a black flag at his house at Badal village in Muktsar district and urged the central government to accept the demand of protesting farmers. Opposition political parties, including the Congress, SAD and Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) have extended their support to the farmers’ call of observing the day as “black day”.The Samkyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM), an umbrella body of protesting unions, had announced that farmers will observe May 26 as “black day” to mark the completion of six months of their protest.Farmers carrying black flags while women wearing black ‘chunnis” held protests in villages and raised slogans against the Union government.Protesting farmers burnt effigies of the BJP-led government at many places, including Amritsar, Muktsar, Moga, Tarn Taran, Sangrur and Bathinda.Farmers, especially youth, put up black flags on their vehicles including tractors, cars and two-wheelers at several places in Punjab to register their protest.SAD leaders led by Bikram Singh Majithia and Daljit Singh Cheema hoisted a black flag at their party office in Chandigarh.Hundreds of farmers, including women and youths, holding black flags held tractor marches in Sangrur and Barnala districts.Sangrur block chief of BKU (Ekta-Ugrahan) Gobinder Singh asked farmers to join a three day long protest against the state government in Patiala from May 28. Leader of opposition and Dirba MLA Harpal Singh Cheema, Sunam Aam Aadmi Party MLA Aman Arora and Lehra SAD legislator Parminder Singh Dhindsa hoisted back flags atop their residences to oppose the farm laws.Covid norms violated Amid the second wave of the pandemic, a large number of farmers and their supporters gathered at various places of southern Punjab on Wednesday to observe the “resistance day”.Carrying black flags, scores of activists gathered outside the Bathinda district administrative complex. They later marched to Hanuman Chowk and burnt an effigy of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Scores of the protesters did not adhere to Covid norms and social distancing was not followed.Reports of similar gatherings were reported from Muktsar, Mansa and other districts of southern Punjab. Women-led protests in various villages of the region.Bajwa demands scrapping of lawsCongress’ Rajya Sabha member Partap Singh Bajwa on Wednesday demanded that the BJP government at the Centre should immediately scrap the three farm laws to pave the way for the return of protesting farmers to their homes. Bajwa, who paid obeisance at Gurdwara Singh Shaheedan, Sohana, for safety of farmers protesting at Delhi’s borders for six months, said that he hoped the central government would listen to views other than Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Mann ki Baat. “Scrap these #BlackLaws so that our farmers can return to their homes,” he tweeted with photos of black flags at his residence here in support of the Black Day protest observed by the farmer organizations.AAP protests outside guv’s residenceThe AAP observed the “black day” by staging a protest in front of Punjab governor VP Singh Badnore’s residence in Chandigarh. AAP workers led by Kotkapura MLA and state kisan wing president Kultar Singh Sandhwan and Barnala MLA and state youth wing president Gurmeet Singh Meet Hayer carried black flags and raised slogans in support of farmers protesting against the three farm laws.“At a time when the entire country was grappling with the Covid-19 pandemic; what was the need for the Union government to bring three black farm laws?” Sandhwan asked, accusing it of neither consulting the farmer organisations nor the opposition parties before enacting the legislation. Sandhwan and Hayer demanded immediate repeal of the three laws.(With PTI inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/six-months-of-stir-punjab-farmers-hold-protest-hoist-black-flags-atop-houses-101622057595633.html

He was cremated with full state honours at Chamarajapet crematorium on Wednesday evening. A school teacher, Doreswamy joined the freedom struggle in June 1942, at the age of 23, on Mahatma Gandhi’s call. He was also jailed for organising protests against the British government. CN Manjunath, the cardiologist at Jayadeva Hospital said that Doreswamy had heart failure and a cardiac arrest and passed away around 1.40 on Wednesday. Adding that Doreswamy had pre-existing valvular heart disease for the last 10 years, he was admitted to Jayadeva Hospital multiple times in this period. “He tested positive for the novel coronavirus earlier this month. This could be a precipitating factor since he tested positive and was hospitalised till May 12. He was readmitted to the hospital on May 14,” Dr CN Manjunath added. “It is very sad to hear the news that senior freedom fighters, Gandhian, journalist, social worker, and the voice of the people, HS Doreswamy, has passed away. Praying for goodness to their soul, I ask that God grant their families the power to bear the pain,” Karnataka chief minister BS Yediyurappa tweeted. Doreswamy actively participated in the protests against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act and National Register of Citizens in Bengaluru in 2019-20. “HS Doreswamy, who parted from all of us, was our self-conscience. He condemned us when he saw wrong, supported us when he saw right and guided us. He was an inspiration from a young age, came to the streets when he saw injustice and was an inspiration to all of us,” tweeted former Karnataka chief minister Siddaramaiah.

27-05-2021||Other||Delhi: 50 cops, footage from 1,350 cameras and nine days of probe nail three in cow slaughter cases||New Delhi: Five teams of 50 police personnel from three police stations worked for nine days, scanned footage from 1,350 CCTVs installed across 62 kms of road length to arrest three suspects in three cow slaughter cases reported from outer Delhi’s Baprola village and Nihal Vihar between May 16 and 20, investigators associated with the case said.On May 16 morning, the carcass of a cow was found on a vacant plot in outer Delhi’s Baprola village, said Parminder Singh, deputy commissioner of police (outer district). A crowd gathered at the spot and they informed the police. A case was registered at Ranhola police station under sections of the Indian Penal Code, the Delhi Agricultural Cattle Preservation Act and the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act, Singh said. Around the same time, another carcass was found at a different spot in the same village. The DCP said, “An inspection of the scene and the animal carcass suggested that same people could be involved in the two cases.” He said a separate FIR was registered in this case. While the police were investigating the two cases, a similar crime was reported from Nihar Vihar on May 20. An FIR was registered there too.Since the recoveries of animal carcass led to tension in the two areas, the police constituted five teams of a total 50 personnel from police stations in Ranhola, Mundka and Nihal Vihar. The team was led by two additional deputy commissioners. The personnel were drawn from different wings such as the special staff, the anti-auto theft squad (AATS) and the narcotics department, an officer associated with the case said.The officer said CCTV footage revealed that a Vitara Brezza car was used in the crime. Thereafter, the police scanned footage from 1,350 CCTVs spread over 62 kilometers to finally trace the suspects to Jamia Nagar in south-east Delhi, said Singh.Between Monday night and Tuesday afternoon, the police arrested the three men from Jamia Nagar. These included two brothers, Asif and Monis, and their cousin Naeem.The DCP said while Asif had two dozen cases against him, including two in which he was convicted, Monis had four cases registered against him. Both carried a reward of R50,000 each that was announced by the Uttar Pradesh Police, on their arrests.The officer said they were using a curfew pass purportedly issued by APMC in Azadpur Mandi to travel around the city to allegedly slaughter cows during the lockdown.The police are checking the authenticity of the pass as well as looking for other people that could possibly be involved in the alleged crimes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/delhi-50-cops-footage-from-1-350-cameras-and-nine-days-of-probe-nail-three-in-cow-slaughter-cases-101622057475662.html
27-05-2021||Delhi||Four associates of wrestler Sushil Kumar held for Dhankad’s murder||Four associates of wrestler Sushil Kumar were arrested from outer Delhi late Tuesday in connection with the murder of 23-year-old wrestler Sagar Dhankad at Chhatrasal Stadium on May 4, police said.Police said the four are members of the Kala Asauda-Neeraj Bawana gang, which also points to Kumar’s possible links with jailed gangster Neeraj Bawana and the apprehension that Dhankar’s murder may lead to a gang war.All four men are from Haryana and have been previously involved in serious crimes such as abduction, murder, rioting and robbery. They have been identified as Bhupender alias Bhupi,38, Mohit alias Bholi,22, Gulab aka Pehalwan,24, and Manjeet alias Chunni Lal,29.Mohit and Gulab belong to Asauda village in Haryana’s Jhajjar, which is also the village of Rajeev alias Kala Asauda, their gang leader, who was killed by members of a rival gang on the court premises in Haryana’s Rohtak in 2017. As Bawana is also in jail, the gang was being led by Bhupender and Mohit, the police said.Deputy commissioner of police (Rohini) Pranav Tayal said the special staff team of Rohini district on Tuesday received information that four men, wanted for the murder of wrestler Dhankad, would be coming to Ghewra village to meet an associate named Kala Sethi. The team laid a trap near Ghewra railway crossing and the four were caught after they were identified by an informer, he said.The four were present at Chhatrasal Stadium in north-west Delhi where Dhankad was allegedly beaten to death in a brawl involving two groups, one of which, according to the police, was led by two-time Olympic medallist and world champion wrestler Kumar.“Their preliminary interrogation revealed that they were called to Chhatrasal Stadium on the night of May 4 by one Kala alias Sethi, who is still on the run. The four disclosed that they knew the purpose for which they were called there and so they came prepared with weapons,” Tayal said.On Wednesday, their custody was handed over to the crime branch team which is investigating Dhankad’s murder. The team also has custody of wrestler Kumar and his associate Ajay Sherawat.During interrogation, DCP Tayal said, the four men disclosed that on the intervening night of May 4 and 5, they had gone to Chhatrasal stadium around midnight in two vehicles.“They were actively involved in the crime. On hearing police sirens, they fled the stadium, leaving behind their vehicles and weapons. The four have narrated the sequence of events leading to Dhankad’s death and details of the other persons involved in his murder,” the DCP added.After fleeing the stadium, the four split up and were hiding in remote villages in Haryana. They had switched off their cellphones to avoid detection. One of them had recently procured a new cellphone, which he was operating only for virtual calling through a secure app and using a Wi-Fi connection. They were using their confidants to pass messages to each other, said an investigator, asking not to be named.Police said that while Bhupender is involved in nine cases of kidnapping, murder, robbery, cheating, rioting and other serious crimes, Mohit and Manjeet have five and four cases against them, respectively. Gulab has previously been involved in two cases, they said.Bhupender’s interrogation, the DCP said, revealed that he became Rajeev Kala’s associate in 2000 and committed several crimes with him. In 2011, Bhupender went to jail in a double murder case and remained there till February 2021. After his release, he was reviving his gang to take revenge of Kala’s murder. He was being helped by the key associates of jailed gangster Bawana, the police said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/four-associates-of-wrestler-sushil-kumar-held-for-dhankad-s-murder-101622057475092.html

They had circulated their cellphone number on various social media platforms as suppliers of oxygen cylinders and promised home delivery. They tricked Covid patients or their families into transferring the token money into their online payment wallet for securing a cylinder. But after receiving the money, they used to block the person or deactivated their contact number, said deputy commissioner of police (Shahdara) R Sathiyasundaram.The two suspects were arrested from Greater Noida on Tuesday following investigation into a cheating case filed at the Vivek Vihar police station on the complaint of Sanchet Aggarwal, whose mother was ill and needed an oxygen cylinder. Aggarwal told the police that on May 6, he found a supplier’s number on social media (Instagram ) and contacted the person, who promised the home delivery of two cylinders after receiving ₹14,000 as token money. The family paid the money through an e-commerce payment gateway. However, neither the cylinders were delivered nor the money was returned. The family found the phone number switched off and filed a police complaint, the DCP said.Although the website of the youth organisation named “India Youth Icon Team” and his social media profile show that Singh is allegedly connected with a national political party and its senior leaders, the Delhi Police said they have not come across any evidence that linked him to any party.“Also, India Youth Icon Team that Singh claims to be heading and has branches in at least seven states is not a registered organisation. He claims that his organisation had over 18 lakh members and followers. But it’s a matter of investigation. Singh was running this unregistered organisation to project himself as an influential social worker and to cheat people,” said DCP Sathiyasundaram.Singh’s social media accounts have images in which he is seen with luxury cars, surrounded with bodyguards carrying weapons, distributing essential items to needy people and standing with politicians. He also claims to be running a consultancy firm for admissions in educational institutions, said the DCP.“We interrogated Singh and he told us that he used to hire bouncers and luxury cars regularly to influence people, including those associated with his organization, and to give an impression that he is a powerful person having political links. In reality, he doesn’t own a car,” added the DCP.During the investigation, DCP Sathiyasundaram said, the investigating team collected details of the online wallet in which the money was deposited and also of the bank accounts in which the money was routed. The phone number linked with the online wallet and the bank account was the same and belonged to one Sandeep Pandey. It was also learnt that the phone number and the accounts were used for similar frauds. The money was further transferred into two more bank accounts belonging to Ritik Kumar Singh. On the basis of mobile phone location and local intelligence, Pandey and Singh were arrested from Greater Noida, the police said.The DCP said that Singh, who originally belongs to Bihar, is the mastermind of the racket that he was running in connivance with Pandey to cheat people for money they needed to live lavishly. Singh’s bank account had ₹4.23 lakh while Pandey’s had ₹2.43 lakh, which they had accumulated through cheating people in the name of delivering oxygen cylinders. Two cellphones and two SIM cards used in the crimes were also seized, he said.Police said Pandey is from Uttar Pradesh’s Ghazipur and he completed his diploma in civil engineering from a college in Allahabad, UP. He has been working as a property dealer and also runs a wheat flour mill in Greater Noida with his friends, the police said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/man-claiming-to-be-head-of-a-youth-organisation-arrested-for-cheating-covid-patients-101622057474327.html
27-05-2021||Delhi||Farmers observe ‘Black day’ to mark six months of protest at Delhi borders||Farmers protesting at Delhi’s borders marked six months of their agitation on Wednesday by observing a “Black Day” and burning effigies of the government, and once again demanding that the Centre repeal the three farm laws promulgated in September 2020. The farmers also celebrated Buddha Poornima at the protest sites at Singhu, Ghazipur and Tikri on Wednesday.While black flags were hoisted across tents and trolleys at the protest sites, farmers’ collective Samyukta Kisan Morcha said people from several villages and cities also shared pictures of black flags hoisted atop houses as well as pictures of them attired in black, in a symbolic show of support to the agitation at the Delhi borders.Thousands of farmers have been camping at Singhu, Ghazipur, and Tikri, since November to press the government into repealing the new laws, which they say will erode their bargaining power, weaken a system of assured prices, and leave them vulnerable to exploitation by big agri businesses.“From across India, visuals have arrived of farmers and their supporters expressing solidarity with the protesting farmers, and anger against the BJP government. Lakhs of Indians responded to the call put out by SKM and wore black clothes, hoisted black flags atop their homes and vehicles, and assembled in small groups to burn effigies of the BJP government,” SKM said in a statement.“We had arranged for black flags and they got delivered on Tuesday. We carried the effigies around, raising slogans, before burning them,” said Tejvir Singh, a farmer from Ambala district in Punjab. “More people are expected to join us on Thursday and in the coming days as the harvesting season is now over.”The continuous rain in the Capital last week, and the deadly second wave of the pandemic since March, have led to a thinning of the numbers at the protest sites. But, the farmers said they will continue the agitation till their demands are met.“Even though the farmer agitation has had to continue for six long months, with farmers suffering many hardships including the martyrdom of more than 470 farmers so far, we are prepared to continue (with the protest) for however long it takes; the determination and resolve of farmers remain strong and firm,” the farmer leaders said in a joint press statement on Wednesday.Experts had warned that such a gathering could turn into a super spreader event, particularly at a time when cases have been receding in the Capital after a devastating few weeks and a hard lockdown.But SKM said they were taking several steps to arrest the spread of the virus at protest sites. “We put up the sound system [loudspeakers] closer to trolleys so that farmers would not have to come towards the stage to listen to speeches. We invited doctors to speak on stage and educate the farmers on precautions, symptoms and Covid-appropriate behaviour,” ’SKM media coordinator Harinder Singh had said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/farmers-observe-black-day-to-mark-six-months-of-protest-at-delhi-borders-101622057415397.html

I’m not afraid if one or hundred or thousand PILs are filed against me.”He added, “Whatever the court decides, we will accept it. But whenever I’ll get an opportunity in the future to help people, I will do it because saving people’s lives is the meaning of politics.”The court on Monday directed the Delhi government’s drug controller to launch an inquiry into three politicians — Gambhir and Aam Aadmi Party MLAs Praveen Kumar and Preeti Tomar — for allegedly buying and storing Covid-19 drugs and medical oxygen in bulk amid a severe shortage in the Capital.To be sure, all three did not sell the medicines or oxygen, but distributed them for free to people in their constituencies. Also none of the politicians were named as party in the case.On April 21, Gambhir announced on twitter that people who needed Fabiflu tablets, an anti-viral, could get them for free at his east Delhi office.The court, however, said it was not responsible behaviour. “Gambhir must have done it with best of intentions. He has been a national player for our country. But when you know the medicine is in short supply and you buy over 2,000... Is that responsible behaviour? Should he not have realised that medicines are in shortage for others?,” the high court bench said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/file-1k-pils-will-still-save-people-s-lives-gambhir-101622057414810.html

It has been found that administering steroids in the first week of treatment of Covid-19 is one of the main causes of black fungus infection. We need to avoid this and steroids should be administered only from the second week,” Sudhakar said in a statement on Wednesday.He added that there are around 95 known cases of black fungus being treated in Bengaluru, of which 75 have either uncontrolled diabetes or have been administered steroids during Covid treatment.Karnataka has formed a task force dedicated to black fungus, under the chairmanship of Dr HS Satish, and ENT specialist at government-run Victoria Hospital. There are nearly 481 persons known to have contracted black fungus and are being treated in Karnataka, according to information shared by the Centre. There are at least two suspected cases of white fungus in Belagavi, about 500 kms from Bengaluru.Several states including Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat, Rajasthan among others have reported a sharp increase black fungus cases, which can be fatal in the third stage when it enters the brain if not detected and treated early.He said that the discharge policy will include a provision in which recovered Covid patients will be subjected to further tests for black fungus and even an MRI scan, if necessary. “After one week of discharge, Covid recovered persons should get themselves tested here or they can also get a tele-consultation. Every Covid recovered person will be contacted to check for any symptoms of fungus infection. If symptoms are found they will be called to hospitals for further diagnosis,” the minister said.He added that post-recovery, the patients will be contacted for nearly two weeks based on their condition.“It has been found in a preliminary report that the infection is reported in small hospitals, taluk hospitals and those under home isolation in some cases. We will get more clarity in the final report,” he added.Meanwhile, union minister for chemicals and fertilizers, DV Sadananda Gowda said that the Centre had made more allocations of 29,250 vials of Amphotericin B, a drug used to treat black fungus.“Additional 29,250 vials of #Amphotericin- B drug, used in treatment of #Mucormycosis, have been allocated to all the states/UTs today. The allocation has been made based on the number of patients under treatment which is 11,717 across the country,” Gowda said in a post on Twitter.

The SIT said two derogatory posters were pasted near the Bargari gurdwara on the intervening night of September 24 and 25, 2015, by the accused dera followers on their directions. The SIT had on May 21 nominated the trio in another case of sacrilege wherein torn pages of ‘bir ‘were found scattered in Bargari . Remand of 2 dera men extended Meanwhile, the police remand of two dera followers, Shakti Singh and Ranjit Singh, alias Bhola, arrested on May 16 in the Bargari sacrilege case, was extended by two days by the court of additional chief judicial magistrate Sanjeev Kundi.The probe has found that derogatory posters were put up by the dera followers and they also have a witness to prove this, the SIT told the court. “Gopal Das, who runs a stationery shop, identified the papers and markers that were purchased from his shop to make posters before the incident took place in 2015,” the SIT claimed, adding that two cars used in the crime were also recovered from the possession of accused dera followers.Dera committee members missing link in case The three absconding members of the dera’s national committee are the missing link in three sacrilege incidents that sparked off state-wide protests in 2015. The teams probing the cases claim that the instructions to execute sacrilege at Bargari (Faridkot), Malke (Moga) and Gurusar (Bathinda) were given by Bareta, Kler and Dhuri to the district dera committee members.In July 2020, The SIT had named Breta, Kler and Dhuri as accused in a case relating to the theft of a “bir” (copy) of Guru Granth Sahib from a gurdwara on June 1, 2015. On October 12, 2015, torn pages of the “bir” were found scattered in front of a gurdwara at Bargari village.Torn pages of Guru Granth Sahib were also found at Malke village in Moga district in November 2015 and Gurusar (Bhagta) village in Bathinda district in October 2015. The SIT led by former IGP Ranbir Singh Khatra had nominated them accused in both cases in 2018. They have already been declared proclaimed offenders in these three cases. “The trio had met Mohinder Pal Bittu, who was killed in Nabha jail in 2019, and instructed him to steal the bir. Similarly, in Moga sacrilege case, they gave instructions to dera state committee members Pirthi Singh and Jatindervir, alias Jimmy, after which sacrilege was done by a dera follower at Malke and Gurusar villages. Once arrested, the trio can reveal names of more people involved in the case,” said an SIT official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/three-national-committee-members-of-dera-nominated-in-sacrilege-case-101622057055151.html

In a major relief to the business community, which had been clamouring for relaxation in timings, all shops can now operate from 5am to 3pm, an extension of two hours. The permitted hours for home delivery of cooked food have also been increased till 9pm. The weekend curfew will remain in place. In his weekly Facebook live session, deputy commissioner Varinder Kumar Sharma said Ludhiana has been witnessing a slight respite in cases for the last two weeks after hitting an extraordinary scale amid the second wave of the pandemic in mid-April and May. He said the Ludhiana administration will be honouring health workers and officers of all departments that have been performing their Covid duties tirelessly. Traders had met DC earlier in the dayEarlier in the day, a delegation of the Punjab Pradesh Beopar Mandal had met Sharma and demanded that shops be allowed to remain open till 5pm. The meeting had been facilitated by MLA Rakesh Pandey, to whom the traders’ association had submitted a memorandum after staging an agitation on May 24. Citing losses due to the imposition of a 16-hour daily curfew and weekend lockdown, traders said they will be forced to raise an agitation and hand over their shops to the government unless the curfew relaxation period was extended till 5pm next month. Though the extension of timings have been welcomed, traders want further relaxation citing the low footfall during the relaxation hours in the morning and afternoon. Beopar Mandal general secretary Sunil Mehra said, “Shopkeepers are struggling to pay rent, power bills and salaries as marginal sales are made between 5am and 1pm. Shops should be allowed to stay open till 5pm from next month as is being done in other districts of the state.” A garment store owner in Model Town market, Ashu Grover, said, “The decision to allow the shops to remain open till 3pm will certainly increase the footfall in the market. It is not possible to keep running businesses without profits. The move will also reduce chaos and traffic jams witnessed around 1pm as the curfew hour approaches.” On May 7, the administration had first imposed a 17-hour curfew from 12pm to 5am, which was relaxed by an hour on May 24.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/now-curfew-relaxation-in-ludhiana-till-3pm-101622056274947.html

27-05-2021||Mumbai||Maha to write to Centre as it seeks clarity on global bids for vax supply||After the Maharashtra government received eight responses to its global tenders for supplying Covid-19 vaccines, it now plans to throw the ball in the Centre’s court over engaging with intermediaries. Senior government officials said the state is going to write to the Centre, seeking clarity on whether the companies that showed interest in supplying vaccine doses to Maharashtra are authorised by the company.On Tuesday, the state received bids for the supply of vaccines manufactured by Pfizer, Sputnik and AstraZeneca. However, the bids have been submitted by suppliers or middlemen and not the vaccine manufacturers. Senior health department officials said the government’s concern is the authenticity of the proposals as manufacturers including Pfizer and Moderna has clearly stated that they have not appointed any suppliers.Senior officials said that there are number of queries the state intends to ask the Centre in its letter, including can the state engage with the intermediaries, can it procure AstraZeneca vaccine, which is in a pact with Serum Institute of India (SII), that manufacturers same vaccine under Covishield brand.N Ramaswami, commissioner of health services, said, “We will refer this issue to Government of India. We will write to them, asking if the manufacturers have appointed these companies to supply the vaccine doses, and whether the state government can engage with them. These are complex matters and therefore we need to tread cautiously.” If the state finds the companies that showed interest to be unqualified, it’ll have to depend on the supply of Sputnik, which, too, will be limited as its domestic manufacturers will have to give 50% to the Centre and remaining 50% stock will be given to states/UTs and private hospitals. Ramaswami added that the state is trying to get in touch with Russian Direct Investment Fund—the developer of Sputnik V—but so far, they have not responded. The state has got five responses from suppliers of Sputnik, which have quoted a price between Rs800 and Rs2,500, state officials said.The uncertainty over the vaccination and the slow pace of inoculation is expected to continue until SII and Bharat Biotech can supply enough stock by July. Ramaswami said that they expect to hear from the two companies on the stock it will sell to the state. “We are constantly in touch with Serum and Bharat Biotech for the doses we will procure. We expect to hear from them on the schedule of supply by tomorrow,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maha-to-write-to-centre-as-it-seeks-clarity-on-global-bids-for-vax-supply-101622056216314.html
27-05-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Healthcare of malnourished children takes a back seat in Covid pandemic||While the state is still struggling with the second wave of the pandemic, severely malnourished children with compromised immunity have been at the receiving end. Though the Women and Child Development (WCD) has taken up several initiatives to improve their outreach programme, to improve the health of malnourished children, social activists said the burden of such children in the state will further increase due to the closure of anganwadis and discontinuation of mid-day meal programmes. Doctors said severely malnourished children are most vulnerable to contracting Covid-19 infection. Malnutrition is a non-communicable disease that is referred to when a person’s diet does not provide enough nutrients or the right balance of nutrients for optimal health.According to the last measurement in March 2020, before the pandemic hit the state, Maharashtra had 45,217 severely malnourished children below six years, and around 1.5 lakh children were identified as moderately malnourished. This counted as 3.5% of the total children weighed. Most children are from rural parts of the state like Nandurbar, Palghar, Raigad, Marathwada among other districts. However, activists in rural areas said the number will increase drastically like a ‘ripple effect’ in the pandemic. Dr Ravikant Singh, founder, Doctors for You, said that since the lockdown last year, anganwadi centres have been closed down to reduce transmission of infections. “Also, the mid-day meal programme that provides the primary source of nutrition supplementary to school-going children has halted. Due to the lockdown, many parents have lost their jobs and are facing financial constraints to take care of their children. This will cumulatively contribute to the rise of the acute under-nutrition among children.”With the rise in cases of malnutrition, doctors said these children are likely to become more vulnerable to contracting Covid-19 due to low immunity and several other underlying health issues. MA Patil, president of the Mumbai wing of the Maharashtra Asha Workers and Gatpravartak Sangh said post-Covid, nutrition-related deaths among children would surge.“Malnutrition is classified into various categories. Only if a child is severely malnourished, he can not only contract Covid but other infections like tuberculosis. Since they also have underlying health issues like cardiac or kidney problems among others, they become easy targets for any virus,” said Dr Subhas Prabhu, who heads the paediatric task force. However, so far, the task force hasn’t provided any suggestion on it to the state government.Compared to the first wave, in the second wave, more children below the age of 10 have been infected with Covid-19. Considering this, social activists said the battle against the pandemic is a long term struggle that requires strengthening the implementation of the community-based management strategy for addressing malnutrition among children.To address the issue, Integrated Child Development Services under WCD has been distributing take-home ration to the children registered with anganwadis. “Since the lockdown, we are making all possible efforts to provide an uninterrupted supply chain of nutritious foods to the children. For moderately and severely malnourished children, we are sending doctors and trained Asha workers to their home to check their health parameters. If we find anyone unwell, we immediately shift them to the hospitals and nutritional rehabilitation centres,” said IA Kundan, principal secretary WCD. “We are also sending ready-to-eat energy-dense nutritious food which is a mixture of peanuts, oil sugar, nuts and nutrition-rich ingredients to severely malnourished children,” she added. However, activists claimed only 10% of the total severely malnourished children are getting it. Patil said the take-home ration isn’t providing much help. The state government should focus on providing daily ration to the malnourished children. “At present, the ration is provided every month which is also being consumed by the parents of the children. Along with just dal, wheat and rice, the department should provide more nutrient-rich foods like dry foods and fruits,” he said.Many rural nutritional rehabilitation centres have recorded a sizable drop in the number of referred children. “Earlier, we used to get around 15 referral children every month. Now, we barely get 3-5 cases. In most cases, patients reach us only when they have an infection or develop any health complication,” said an officer from government medical college in Nandurbar. The department is also providing training to the caregivers on how to use the Mid Upper Arm Circumference to measure the degree of malnutrition among children. Also, the state health department has instructed the WCD to make planning for vaccination of lactating and new mothers.Take flu shots as a precautionary measureThe paediatric task force has, as a precautionary measure, suggested that children be inoculated with the influenza vaccine. The suggestion has also been submitted to chief minister Uddhav Thackeray. Dr Prabhu said since symptoms of Covid-19 and seasonal flu are similar, taking the shot might help control the mental anguish of parents if their children develop flu.“There is no scientific evidence that children will be more affected in the third wave. But if taking the shot helps control the development of seasonal infection, it will save parents from getting paranoid and decrease the unnecessary burden on the hospitals. This is just for a precautionary measure,” he said. When HT enquired with private and civic-run hospitals, they said that so far, they haven’t recorded any sudden surge in the demand for the influenza vaccine from parents.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-healthcare-of-malnourished-children-takes-a-back-seat-in-covid-pandemic-101622056154880.html
27-05-2021||Lucknow||Now, free post Covid treatment at govt medical colleges in UP||: Patients requiring post Covid treatment will now get free treatment at all government medical colleges/institutions running post Covid wards, said principal secretary medical education Alok Kumar. In an order issued on Tuesday, principal secretary said, “In the present scenario it has been observed that despite testing negative for Covid-19, many patients have to stay further for post Covid treatment in hospitals. Such patients who test negative for Covid but need further treatment in post Covid wards will be treated free of cost.” Several medical institutions had raised the issue with the medical education department as many patients who come for post Covid treatment are unable to afford the same and despite recovering from infection need prolonged hospital stay. Till now medical colleges were charging from post Covid patients who were shifted out of Covid ward after they tested negative. “The decision will be a big relief particularly for those who cannot afford treatment cost. Covid treatment is free of cost, but the sudden burden of post Covid treatment might be a trouble as many patients come from poor economic background,” said Dr Abhishek Shukla, secretary general association of international doctors. The order has been sent to all government medical institutes, including King George’s Medical University, Sanjay Gandhi Post Graduate Institute, Dr Ram Manohar Lohia Institute of Medical Sciences in Lucknow and all government medical colleges across the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/now-free-post-covid-treatment-at-govt-medical-colleges-in-up-101622056154269.html
27-05-2021||Mumbai||Anil Deshmukh case: Maharashtra govt v/s CBI hearing to be held on June 8||A vacation bench of the Bombay high court (HC) on Wednesday adjourned to June 8 hearing on the petition filed by the state government seeking to drop two topics from the purview of investigation by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) into the corruption charges against former Maharashtra home minister Anil Deshmukh. The adjournment came after the state agreed to CBI’s contention that the petition be placed for hearing before the bench headed by chief justice Dipankar Datta, which had on April 5 directed the central agency to conduct a preliminary probe into the allegations of corruption made by former Mumbai Police commissioner Param Bir Singh against Deshmukh, as the petition essentially involved interpretation of the April 5 order.The state government agreement was based on the condition that CBI would not seek certain documents from the state related to offences that were included in two unnumbered paragraphs in the first information report (FIR) registered against Deshmukh after the HC directed preliminary probe was concluded. The documents sought by the central agency included the communication by former commissioner of state intelligence Rashmi Shukla in August 2020 to her superiors alleging political interference in posting and transfers of police officers in the state, and the minutes of the June 2020 police establishment board meeting which reinstated arrested assistant police inspector Sachin Vaze after 15 years of suspension. After the counsel for CBI assured the bench that it would not seek the said documents till June 9, the court directed its registry to place the matter before the bench headed by the chief justice on June 8. On Wednesday, when the state government’s petition against CBI came up for hearing before the vacation bench of justice SJ Kathawalla and justice SP Tavade, the bench sought to know from special senior counsel Rafique Dada, for the state, whether he was agreeable to the CBI’s contention that the petition should be heard by the same bench which passed the April 5 order. After taking instructions, Dada submitted that the state was agreeable, provided CBI did not press for the documents pertaining to the two issues that it had included in the unnumbered paragraphs in its FIR against Deshmukh. Additional solicitor generals SV Raju and Anil Singh, for CBI, after taking instructions informed the court that it would not press for the documents till June 9 if the petition was heard by the same bench which had passed the April 5 order. After hearing both the sides, the bench adjourned the hearing and directed the registry to place the matter before the division bench of the CJ on June 8 at 10.30am. In the previous hearing on May 21, during preliminary arguments, the state had objected to the scope of the investigation by CBI as it had included issues pertaining to the report by Shukla and the reinstatement of Vaze in its FIR. Dada had submitted that as these issues had nothing to do with the allegations made by Singh against Deshmukh, it was an example of over-reach by CBI as the April 5 order had directed the agency to conduct only a preliminary probe into the allegations. Dada had also added that CBI had not followed procedure and had gone beyond the norms laid down in its manual of taking prior approval of the state. CBI had, however, contended that the issues involved had far-reaching consequences and the April 5 order had not put any restrictions on CBI with regards to the extent of its preliminary probe. Raju had further referred to Supreme Court judgements which had set aside objections by other states regarding the over-reach by CBI in its investigations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/anil-deshmukh-case-maharashtra-govt-v-s-cbi-hearing-to-be-held-on-june-8-101622056094139.html
27-05-2021||Chandigarh||State suspends 18+ jab drive as stocks dry up||With no dose left to administer to people under the 18-45 year category, Punjab has suspended the vaccination drive for the next few days. Punjab has received 4,29,000 doses of Covishield vaccine out of 30 lakh booked with the Serum Institute of India (SII) this month, which have already been administered. “All these doses have been administered and rather, Punjab vaccinated 4,35,000 persons in the 18-45 category against the 4,29,000 doses as one vial of Covishield actually has 11 doses and whereas the company mandates it to have 10 doses,” said state nodal officer for vaccination Vikas Garg. He said the state has booked 1,16,000 doses of Covaxine for the 18-45 category but the schedule for the arrival of these does is not known yet. Senior officials said 3.8 lakh doses of Covishield are expected to arrive in the first week of June. A few days ago, US-based manufacturers Moderna Pfizer refused to deliver vaccines directly to Punjab citing policy decisions. The Punjab government had approached all manufacturers for direct purchase of Covid vaccines, including Sputnik-V, Pfizer, Moderna and Johnson & Johnson, to explore possibilities of floating a global tender for the procurement of jabs for early inoculation in the state.The manufactures said they can deal with the Government of India and not the state governments or private companies for delivering vaccines. The Punjab government on May 13 decided to join the COVAX facility alliance for global sourcing and procurement of Covid vaccines at the best price, but it also informed the government that it doesn’t deal directly with the state. But a spokesperson for GAVI, one of the three organisations that have set up COVAX initiative, said that since India is already a participating member of the facility, Punjab could not separately apply to access Covid-19 vaccines.These efforts to procure vaccines from manufacturers abroad were driven by an acute shortage of vaccine for beneficiaries in the age group of 18-45 years due to which the state government has had to first delay its start and then suspend the drive at several vaccination centres across the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/state-suspends-18-jab-drive-as-stocks-dry-up-101622055975402.html
27-05-2021||Mumbai||Barge P-305 tragedy probe: Police summon 5 companies||The Yellow Gate police have issued summons to five companies in connection with the investigation into the Barge Pappa-305 (P305) tragedy. The police, however, have not revealed the names of the companies, as the investigation is underway. P305 is owned by Durmast Enterprises Limited, and chartered by a consortium led by Afcons Industries to carry out a project contract for the Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC). As Cyclone Tauktae hit the coast, accommodation barge P-305 sank in Heera Oil Fields in the Arabian Sea on May 17. Of the 261 people on board, the Indian Navy rescued 186 crew members, recovered 71 bodies and four are still missing. Of the 71 bodies, 13 are still to be identified. Six of them were identified on Wednesday. The executives of the companies have been asked to visit the police station with relevant documents pertaining to ownership of the barge, agreement of subcontracting of work, compliance of safety norms, compliance of other marine laws, etc. Their statement would be recorded, said a police officer from Yellow Gate Police station. “Details about the ongoing investigation can’t be shared,” said Mumbai police spokesperson and deputy commissioner of police Chaitanya Siriprolu. The police had earlier registered a case of culpable homicide not amounting to murder against the master of P305, who is still missing. “It was the call of the master of the barge Pappa-305 to not to move to Mumbai Harbour or other safe region, despite prior warning of a storm. The master chose to just move 200m away from the platform where the barge was working, and to remain at that location, deciding this as a safe location. Unfortunately the weather conditions deteriorated and reached a level worse than predicted. The master didn’t get enough time for any further action to be taken,” Afcons Infrastructure Limited had stated earlier. All 12 anchors of the barge gave away and it drifted. It collided with the unmanned ONGC platform. Most of the crew members jumped into the sea with life jackets on. Police have already recorded statements of over 50 survivors. “Some of them have given a detailed account of the fateful night,” said a police officer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/barge-p-305-tragedy-probe-police-summon-5-companies-101622055974148.html
27-05-2021||Chandigarh||Delhi man held with 1kg heroin in Ludhiana||A New Delhi resident was arrested with 1kg heroin near the Food Corporation of India (FCI) godown on GT Road, national highway 44, in Doraha on Wednesday. Acting on a tipoff, a team led by sub-inspector Kuljeet Singh laid a trap in the front of the godown. A taxi coming from Khanna was stopped for checking and the passenger Gaurav, a resident of Mansa park in New Delhi, was held with the contraband, said Khanna senior superintendent of police (SSP) Gursharandeep Singh Grewal. Gaurav had hired the taxi from Delhi Bypass for ₹5,000 to deliver the consignment, which he had collected from a Nigerian, to a Zira resident. He had recently moved to New Delhi from Ludhiana. “Questioning is still on to find out who is the operator of the drug racket and to whom the accused was going to deliver the contraband,” said SSP Grewal. The SSP said, “ Traditionally, Punjab was used as a transit point for drug peddlers across the border for transporting contraband to other parts of the country. However, tight security measures have snapped the supply lines. Now, drugs are being smuggled through other parts of the country and are being supplied to peddlers in the state.” He said that it was the third such attempt to sneak huge quantities of drugs into the state in the last two months. A case was registered under sections of the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances ( NDPS) Act.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/delhi-man-held-with-1kg-heroin-in-ludhiana-101622055915462.html

In the second petition filed by the same organisation seeking waiver of hotel license fees and other statutory charges, the court has asked the state authorities to decide on the representation of the organisation, as the purpose of the fees and charges has not been availed of by the members due to the Covid-19 restrictions. On May 6, the division bench of justice KK Tated and justice NR Borkar, while hearing the petition filed by United Hospitality Association, which represents owners of hotels and restaurants and is based in Pune, through video conferencing, was informed by advocate Abhay Anturkar and Yatin Malvankar that the hotel industry had abided by the lockdown announced on March 24, 2020, which was extended from time-to-time and had curtailed their businesses. The advocates submitted that as the business had come to a standstill they were not in a position to pay back the loans availed by them and sought directions to the Union finance ministry to grant relief, in respect of repayment of loans given the Covid-19 pandemic under the Disaster Management Act. Anturkar further submitted that the association had made representations to the Central government to consider grant of relief in respect of repayment of the loan to the hospitality industry in Pune and Maharashtra and also sought extension in moratorium on loans and a restriction on banks for non-performing assets (NPA) tagging of loans of the hospitality industry in the state.The association said that it was finding it difficult to repay the loans and taxes and hence in the interest of justice, the respondents be directed to decide on their representation.The court issued notices to the respondent Union finance ministry and Disaster Management Authority to respond to the petition and also directed the Union Finance Minister to take a decision on petitioner’s representation on its own merits and communicate the same to the organisation and posted the further hearing of the petition to June 18.

27-05-2021||Mumbai||Assistant dean of Mumbai hospital booked in third case of cheating PG aspirants||The Sion police have registered a third case against Rakesh Verma, assistant dean at the Lokmanya Tilak General Hospital at Sion, and arrested his associate Luv Gupta for allegedly duping an MBBS doctor to the tune of ₹45 lakh, for securing a postgraduate (PG) medical seat for her.Verma was arrested in December last year in two similar cases, where he along with his associates duped two doctors – from Pune and Hyderabad – of ₹50 lakh and ₹18.50 lakh respectively. The Sion police have given an application to the court to seek his police custody for further investigation. Gupta is in police custody till Thursday. He had secured anticipatory bail in one of the previous cases, said a police officer. Dr Mohan Joshi, dean of Sion hospital said, “Dr Verma has already been suspended. I am not aware about police action.”According to the police, the complainant lives in Kurla (East) and wanted to pursue Master of surgery. However, she failed to crack the test. She then approached Verma through a Goregaon-based man. Gupta, who was the middleman, allegedly accepted the money on behalf of Verma, said the officer.The Goregaon-based man arranged the meeting with Verma at Sion hospital, where the victim was promised to get admission through a government quota. The suspects demanded ₹1.10 crore, but after bargaining, the amount was reduced to ₹75 lakh. The victim alleged in her complaint that she paid ₹45 lakh directly to Gupta and ₹26 lakh through bank transaction. The rest of the amount was given later in cash, the officer said.When the victim did not secure admission till April 2020, she contacted Gupta, however, he avoided her calls. The victim along with her family approached the Sion hospital last year in December and learnt about the fraud. The victim approached the Sion police station and gave a written complaint a few months ago. Sion police registered a case and arrested Gupta, said inspector Dilip Ghuge.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/assistant-dean-of-mumbai-hospital-booked-in-third-case-of-cheating-pg-aspirants-101622055854135.html
27-05-2021||Mumbai||Multiple applications by same students, LLM students blame Mumbai university||A day after the University of Mumbai (MU) said that admissions to the Masters of Law (LLM) course were conducted without any errors, applicants have highlighted more issues.In a statement shared with the university vice-chancellor and the governor, LLM applicants have highlighted how a single candidate’s more than one application was accepted by the varsity despite a strict admission rule which states that a student cannot apply to more than one division of the course.“As per the university circular dated May 15, only these seats which are vacant as per their list could be applied, and every student can apply to one division only. However, once they released the list of applications received, it showed the same applicant’s form being accepted for all six divisions,” said a student, who is one of those who have approached the university.On May 15, the university’s department of law issued a notice allowing candidates, who couldn’t make it to the first five merit lists, to apply afresh to vacant seats for spot admissions. In the same notice, the department announced that the sixth merit list would be the last one.There are around 600 seats for LLM in six divisions—Constitutional and administrative law, business law, intellectual property and information technology law, human rights law, criminal law and criminal administration and environmental and legal order.As per a statement highlighted in bold in the same circular, MU stated “candidate should apply for only one group of LLM depending on availability of vacant seats as per the shared list”.Some students highlighted how as per this list, only four seats in the general category were vacant across two of the six divisions.“I had originally applied for group 2, but in the final round I could’ve applied to another group had the varsity announced the total vacant seats. Without sharing this basic information, the varsity later released a sixth merit list showing new admissions in the general category across all six divisions. How is this fair?” asked another applicant who scored 82 in her entrance exam and has lost a seat in one of the divisions to a student with 76 marks in the same exam.A spokesperson for the university told HT that since the last admission round for LLM was a special spot-admission round, students were given a free hand to apply across any division as long as there are vacant seats available. Students, however, highlighted that the MU circular speaks otherwise.“Originally there were only four seats in the general category across six divisions, which we displayed. In case, if the seats in the persons with disability (PWD) category have no applicants, only such seats can be converted to the general category, hence some students who knew the rules applied and got admission. This was a computerised process and no foul play has been highlighted,” said the spokesperson, who added that complaints against the admissions procedure should be addressed to the grievance redressal cell for proper verification.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/multiple-applications-by-same-students-llm-students-blame-mumbai-university-101622055794263.html
27-05-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra records 24,752 cases, 453 deaths||Maharashtra is witnessing a decline in not just Covid-19 cases but deaths, which was on the higher side over the past several days. On Wednesday, the state recorded 24,752 new cases and 453 deaths.The death toll has now reached 91,341 since the outbreak of the virus.In the past 10 days (May 17-26), 5,773 people succumbed to the virus, while from May 7-16, the toll was 7,971. From April 27 to May 6, the state had recorded 8,181 deaths.There are currently 315,042 active patients across the state of which Pune tops with 45,655 patients followed by Mumbai with 28,074 active patients. The death toll has now reached 91,341 with Mumbai leading with 14,684 deaths followed by Pune with 11,966. The total number of cases now stands at 5,650,907.Meanwhile, Mumbai recorded 1,352 cases, followed by 34 deaths. There are total 700,340 cases with 14,684 deaths. The city’s recovery rate is 93% with 655,484 recoveries, while the fatality rate of the city is 2.09%.Dr Subhash Salunke, advisor to the Maharashtra government on Covid-19 management attributes the decrease in the number of deaths to various corrective measures taken over a period of time. “We are testing much earlier than before. In addition, the patients with comorbidities are being sent to the hospitals and are not advised of home quarantine, which has improved the situation. Today we have far better knowledge of the mode of treatment, the medication required as well as post-Covid-19 protocols than before. All these factors combined have resulted in a decrease in the death rate,” he added.Dr Jeevan Jain, physician from Lalbaug who has treated over 15,000 Covid-19 patients credits the lockdown for a decline in cases. “The lockdown played an important role in curbing the transmission of the virus and consequently bringing down the number of deaths,” said Jain. However, Jain cautions both the government and the citizens against adopting a casual approach. “The government needs to open up in a staggered manner and with strict protocols. People should follow Covid-19 guidelines and refrain from mass gatherings or social function till the end of this year or else all these gains will be lost,” said Jain.Meanwhile, despite Ratnagiri being included in the red zone, the Savarde market in Chiplun saw huge crowds. In Jalgaon, thousands of people participated in the funeral procession of local politician Gaffar Malik. Akola saw thousands of people on roads despite it being on the list of 18 districts that have a high number of cases. The police and municipal staff raided various cloth stores for violating Covid-19 guidelines. Traders in Solapur have warned of opening shops from June 1 irrespective of the government’s orders.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-records-24-752-cases-453-deaths-101622055735681.html

These centres have been set up in Nagepur, Harsos and Aswari Bhimchandi villages where doctors have been treating people for fever, cold and other seasonal diseases. Villagers turning up with high fever are being referred to the nearest primary health centre (PHC). Nagepur is among those villages adopted by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who is the Varanasi MP. Social activist Nand Lal Master said that medicines from these centres were also being sent to the Covid patients in home isolation in these villages. Counseling of Covid-19 patients is also being done by the experts. Dr Jai Prakash attended around 35 patients at Nagepur centre and gave them medicines. Master said that the centres that would function for a month will also create awareness about measures to prevent getting infected by Covid-19. Thermal scanning is being done of each and every person reaching the centre and persons with high fever were being advised to visit the nearest primary health centre (PHC) and get tested for Covid-19 infection, Master said. Father Anand, a social activist, who inaugurated the centres, said that serving the poor during the pandemic was true service to humanity. NGOs running these Covid care centres include Asha Trust, Lok Samiti, Vishwa Jyoti Jansanchar Samiti along with Cairitas India.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/ngos-set-up-covid-counseling-centres-in-3-kashi-villages-101622055735032.html

These are being set up within zilla parishad schools and ashramshalas that are located within the proximity of the public health centres in the rural areas. The district’s rural areas have witnessed around 36,000 cases last year, whereas the district’s rural areas have already recorded 61,114 cases in five months of this year. Keeping this in mind, the preparations for the possible third wave has begun in the Thane district. There are 2,181 active patients, of which, around 1,546 patients in home isolation and 219 in CCC. The collector has shortlisted three spots in Bhiwandi rural, Shelar grampanchayat and Shenale village in Murbad to build a 30-60 bedded CCC. “We are having one CCC in each taluka and in case of a bigger taluka, we are looking for a suitable space in a cluster of gram panchayat to build CCC. By preferring institutional quarantine, we can curb the further spread of the virus. Moreover, immediate medical help can also be provided in case any individual has more symptoms or health issues,” said Rajesh Narvekar, collector, Thane district. Similarly, Thane Municipal Corporation has made basic preparations for the same, “We already have a centre in Bhayanderpada which is being used as a CCC; it has ample space. With the available infrastructure, if need be we can easily increase the number of beds and provisions in CCC,” said Sandeep Malvi, deputy municipal commissioner, TMC.As of now, TMC has 86% beds available, from among the 895 CCC beds available. Thane city currently has 2,105 active cases and 678 from among them are under home quarantine. During the peak of cases in mid-April, the city witnessed 16,700 active cases and around 12,650 were under home quarantine during that period.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/setting-up-covid-centres-in-thane-gram-panchayats-collector-101622055674148.html

The last date of submission for EOI is June 8, while the bids will be opened on June 9. The civic body has a budget of ₹50 crore for the buying of these five lakh vaccine doses. With the unavailability of adequate vaccine doses from the Central government, the TMC has planned to buy the vaccines from the global markets. The civic body got approval for the EOI from the general body last week. As per the EOI, manufacturers, Indian partners, wholesalers, authorised dealers and distributors who have vaccines duly approved by the drug regulator, the Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI) can submit the EOI. An officer from TMC said, “We have asked the bidders to give us a clear timeline of vaccine stock, which will be available in the first 15 days after the EOI is signed in the next 15 to 30 days. Those who will provide maximum stock in a lesser time frame at a feasible cost will be given preference. The vaccine suppliers should also be responsible for providing their own transporting agents and cold storage facilities till the vaccines are supplied to the TMC centres. Moreover, if the vaccines need any specific cold storage conditions, other than the normal available with the corporation, provision for the same should also be done by the concern provider.” The bidders who apply should also attach an earlier success story of supplying vaccines to any other government agency across the world. He added, “The rate quoted in the bid should clarify the rate of per vaccine dose, which needs to be inclusive of all taxes, licensing fees, transportation cost and other charges. The bidder can be from anywhere across the world, except for those countries which share a border with India. The bids will be scrutinised by our Bid Evaluation Committee and will be approved for the further process.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/thane-civic-body-floats-global-tender-for-5-lakh-vaccine-doses-101622055614139.html
27-05-2021||Mumbai||Bid will be termed invalid if unauthorised: Mumbai civic body||As civic officials began screening the proposals the Mumbai civic body received in response to its global tender for supply of 10 million Covid-19 vaccines, they said the bids of suppliers who have not been authorised by vaccine manufacturers will become invalid. A day after Pfizer made it clear that it has not authorised anyone globally or in India to import, market or distribute its Covid-19 vaccine, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) on Wednesday said it will term the bid to supply Pfizer’s vaccine as invalid if no genuine link is found between Pfizer and the Czech supplier behind the bid. The civic body said the same rule will apply to all bidders who have proposed to supply other vaccines. On Tuesday, the BMC said it received eight proposals for supplying 10 million vaccine doses. Out of the eight bidders, seven have proposed to supply Russia’s Sputnik vaccine. One bidder had submitted a proposal is for supplying the Pfizer and AstraZeneca vaccines. The BMC said further scrutiny is going on, and the last date for submitting proposals has been extended up to June 1, 2021. The BMC had floated a global expression of interest (EoI) on May 12, giving one week’s time to interested parties for supply of vaccine. Post which ,two extensions were given on May 16 and May 25. Pfizer had on its statement on Tuesday said: “As stated earlier, during this pandemic phase, across the world, Pfizer is supplying its COVID-19 vaccine only to central Governments and supra-national organizations for deployment in national immunization programs. Neither Pfizer Inc nor any of its affiliates globally, including in India, have authorized anyone to import/market/distribute the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID 19 vaccine. We continue to have ongoing discussions with the Government of India towards making our vaccine available for use nationally.” Civic officials on Wednesday said they are aware of the statement made by Pfizer and that it will scrutinise each and every bid for the same (if suppliers are authorised by the manufacturers). The last date for bids is June 1, 2021. A senior BMC official, not wishing to be named, said, “We have received bids from a Czech supplier to supply Pfizer vaccine and AstraZeneca. We have also gone through the statement of Pfizer and are aware of their claims. We will see if the suppliers who submitted their bids are backed by the vaccine manufacturer. If no genuine link is found in verification of documents, that particular proposal will be counted as invalid, be it of Pfizer or any other company.”Municipal commissioner Iqbal Singh Chahal on Tuesday told HT, “It is a fact that someone has sent the bid for Pfizer. If someone has bid, we will evaluate it as per merits of the case.”The bidder offering supply of Pfizer vaccine has also sought advance payment, said civic officials. However, the BMC in its bid document has stated that it will not make any advance payment, they pointed out. “On the issue of advance payment, our tender conditions are clear that no advance payment will be made. The pricing part will come at a later stage. First, we are wanting to ensure whether those who have sent proposals are authorised to supply us the vaccines or not,” said an official who did not want to be named, as he is not authorised to talk to the media. According to BMC’s condition, a supplier or manufacturer is supposed to supply 10 million vaccine doses within three weeks from the date of appointment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/bid-will-be-termed-invalid-if-unauthorised-mumbai-civic-body-101622055554148.html

The civic body claimed that 70% of its patients are institutionally quarantined and that it has enough beds for 100% institutional isolation of patients. NMMC commissioner Abhijit Bangar, said, “The city has enough beds to isolate all the patients if required. The government’s latest guidelines are for those areas where the positivity rate is not coming down. We are doing very well in that regard as our positivity rate is a very good 3%. Anything below 5% is good.” According to civic body data, there are 1,771 active patients in the city at present. Of these, 533 are under home quarantine, while 1,238 are in institutional quarantine. 859 patients are admitted to NMMC-run Covid care centres and hospitals, while 379 are admitted to private hospitals. The city has a total of 6,803 beds capacity including ICU, oxygen, general and beds with ventilators. With the daily Covid positive cases dropping to less than 100 in the past couple of days, just 2,183 of these are occupied, while 4,620 beds are available. For the third wave, NMMC is further planning to increase the isolation facility to 12,000 beds. These will include 1,500 ICU beds and 5,000 oxygen beds. Bangar, however, explained, “The more people we have in institutional quarantine, the more opportunity we will have to reduce the death ratio. Late reporting and delayed treatment are main reasons for an increase in the number of deaths.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/navi-mumbai-enough-beds-to-isolate-all-patients-if-required-says-nmmc-chief-101622055434108.html
27-05-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Primary Health Centres left out of Covid care net||At a primary health centre (PHC) in Amravati district’s Morshi taluka, patients who come in with Covid-19 like symptoms such as high fever, breathlessness or depleting oxygen saturation are immediately referred to the district hospital, 30 km away. The PHC located in Vichori village is among the 59 such centres in the district. Yet, despite being the nearest medical centres for the community, they have merely acted as referral centres in the pandemic. Dr Satish Pawar, additional mission director, Directorate of Health Services, Maharashtra said that PHCs so far have been kept away from treating Covid-19. “The primary centres implement crucial programmes like maternal and childcare,” said Pawar. “We did not want Covid-19 to affect any of the other health programmes. It is a conscious decision to refer all Covid-19 patients to designated Covid Care Centres, rural hospitals or district hospitals,” he said. “Rare exceptions may be made in cases where access to designated Covid care centres is difficult. But such need has not occurred so far,” he added. However, data over the past month indicates that most of the cases in Maharashtra have emerged from rural parts of the state. Take the case of Amravati, which recorded 8,204 active Covid-19 cases on May 24. Nearly 80% were from rural areas. The district in Vidarbha region was the first to record the spike of the second wave. From less than 100 cases daily till January-end, it reported its highest single-day spike of 1,067 cases in the third week of February. At the time, the numbers rose rapidly in urbanised pockets of Achalpur and Warud, prompting authorities to impose a lockdown on February 23, and which ended on March 8. Simultaneously, they focused on testing and tracing. This so-called “Amravati pattern”, officials said, helped bring down the numbers. On May 12, Amravati district recorded 1,089 cases, with 1,097 active cases. The rural share of daily cases on that day was 76.12%, while in active cases, it was 57%. The gap between the rural and urban areas has only been increasing since then, even though the overall cases have been falling. On May 25, Amravati district recorded 605 cases, but 560 of those were in the rural areas, with only 45 in the city. That’s a rural share of 92.56%. On May 25, Amravati district had 1,376 active cases, with the rural part contributing 820 or nearly 60% of those. Other badly affected districts are showing a similar pattern. Until the second week of May, Ahmednagar, Jalgaon, Solapur, Sangli and Kolhapur recorded disproportionately high rates of rural cases. On May 13, rural parts of Ahmednagar reported 2,370 new cases as opposed to just 255 in the urban parts. In Jalgaon, 575 new cases were recorded in rural areas whereas 71 new cases came from urban Jalgaon. Solapur rural saw 1,569 new cases while the urban pockets in the district clocked 125 cases (that’s a difference of 1,155%). Kolhapur and Sangli recorded 1,144 and 1,229 cases in rural areas and 125 and 234 new cases in the urban areas, respectively, on the same day. As the cases spike across rural Maharashtra, officials now realize that PHCs can play a crucial role in curbing the spread of the coronavirus disease by ensuring that villagers wouldn’t have to travel far for treatment. But, to achieve this, the state must first overcome some roadblocks. VACANT POSTS In a video conference with doctors from his constituency of Varanasi last week, Prime Minister Narendra Modi emphasised the need to bring medical services closer to the Covid-19 patients, and said “jahan bimaar, wahin upchaar” [treat the sick where they are located] should be the goal. Even the Union health ministry’s recently released guidelines on Covid-19 Containment and Management in Peri-Urban, Rural and Tribal areas, recognizes the need for stronger primary level health care infrastructure to intensify the state’s response to the pandemic. Maharashtra’s network of 1,829 PHCs in the rural areas are ill-equipped and under-staffed. According to the Rural Health Statistics (2019-2020), a report brought out by the Government of India’s National Health Mission, there were 1,962 vacant posts of female health care workers in PHCs across the state in 2020. Of the 3,587 sanctioned posts of doctors, 739 are vacant; 669 of the 3,834 sanctioned posts of nurses are vacant. Maharashtra requires 1,112 specialists like obstetricians, gynecologists, physicians and pediatricians in its PHCs and Community Health Centres (CHCs) but only has 558 sanctioned posts of which 159 are vacant, leading to an overall shortfall of 713 specialists in rural pockets. The state has 32 vacant posts of radiographers, 247 vacant posts of pharmacists and 544 vacant posts of lab technicians in the PHCs and CHCs. LACK OF INFRASTRUCTURE A PHC typically has two doctors and support staff like supervisors, a pharmacist, and a lab technician. One PHC is commonly connected to five sub-centres which have a female and male healthcare worker each. “We mainly offer primary first aid, antenatal and prenatal care, run OPDs every day and implement immunization drives,” said Yogesh Gawai, a healthcare worker attached to the PHC in Vichori village in Amravati. This PHC, for example, has a four-bed ward, a delivery room and a minor operation theatre for family planning procedures. But the PHC does not have an ICU set up or a specialist doctor. The medical officers in most PHCs are Bachelor of Ayurvedic Medicine and Surgery (BAMS) doctors. “The only medical equipment used at PHC is a stethoscope. Anything beyond that is referred ahead,” said a health worker who did not wish to be named. In the tough rural terrain with bad road connectivity, reaching advanced medical centres in district hospitals becomes challenging for patients, leading to delays in seeking medical treatment. Last August, the Vichori PHC was equipped with an oxygen cylinder and last week they received two oxygen concentrators gifted by guardian minister Yashomati Thakur. The PHC staff is yet to be trained in using the concentrators. “PHCs were never envisaged to tackle diseases like Covid-19,” said Dr Dilip Ranmale, district health officer of Amravati. “But we are now trying to expand their use without affecting the non-Covid work,” he said, adding that the PHC staff has played a crucial role in contact tracing and rolling out vaccination in the pandemic. “Nearly 85% of the Covid-19 cases are mild or asymptomatic, and such patients could easily be managed at well equipped, well-staffed primary centres,” said health activist Dr Abhijit More. “If patients are diagnosed and treated at the earliest, the further complications of requiring oxygen or ventilators can be controlled largely. But PHC’s in Maharashtra have not been upgraded to keep up with such challenges.” UPSCALING INFRA NEEDS Washim district’s Ashegaon village appointed two MBBS doctors last week. Till now, the centre was led by BAMS doctors who were appointed on a contractual basis. The centre has a pharmacist, a staff nurse, two supervisors and three multipurpose workers. “But we have a shortfall of at least five staff members including two Auxiliary Nursing Midwifery (ANM) staff,” said a health worker. The PHC caters to a population of 28,000 across 21 villages. The staff has been trained in recording pulse oximeter readings after Covid-19 but the members have been asked to refer confirmed and suspected Covid-19 patients to the Covid Care Centre, 22 km away from the PHC. While most patients are transferred through ambulances, some travel on their own, risking the spread of the virus. “Many who are allowed home quarantine don’t follow rules and roam outside,” the health worker said, adding that they had to call the police to warn two such patients. “In rural areas, the farther a patient is asked to go, the more reluctant they get. Equipping PHCs for Covid-19 care is a good idea but manpower will be crucial to run them,” he added. Meanwhile, Amravati officials have identified 20 PHCs that will simultaneously function as isolation centres for mild patients. The isolation wards, however, will be set up in halls and schools near the PHCs to ensure that other patients are not at risk. “We have finalised the premises for the isolation wards and are in the process of setting up the beds,” said district health officer Ranmale. “The isolation wards will start functioning in another week’s time.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-primary-health-centres-left-out-of-covid-care-net-101622055374182.html

Every week interviews are being held on walk-in bases. The process will be completed in a fortnight. We currently have around 36 doctors, while 5-6 junior residents have come from Meerut and other districts in the paediatric department. Some consultants may be appointed from other hospitals as well,” said Dr. (Major) B P Singh, senior emergency medical officer (EMO) of Child PGI.Dr Akash Raj, medical director of Child PGI, said that the 50-bedded paediatric Covid ward will be increased to 100. “Out of these, 50 will be paediatric ICU [PICU] beds for Covid patients,” said Dr Raj. Currently there are 150 general PICU beds in Child PGI, the officials said.On a visit to the district on May 16, Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath had announced that all districts in the state will be equipped with adequate PICU beds.“The district health department is working to ensure at least 425 PICU beds and 20-30 additional neonatal ICU (NICU) so that we have over 450 PICU/NICU combined beds in the district,” said Dr Ohri.Dr (major) Rakesh Gupta, director of Government Institute of Medical Sciences, said, “Currently we have some 20 beds combined for neonatal and paediatric care which we will now increase to 100. Around 30 will be equipped with ventilators and other 20 will be with other oxygen support systems.” The hospitals are also planning on helping each other.“We will map all the paediatric beds in the district and mark them as level 1, 2 and 3 in increasing order of severity. In case patients have to be shifted from one hospital to another, we can ensure the transfer with this data. We can coordinate among ourselves and arrange medicines from one another,” said Gupta.He added that currently GIMS does not have any paediatric Covid patients. “Third wave is inevitable we expect it will come in October-November. We had relaxed after the first wave and were not as much prepared for the second wave as much we should have been. Now for any such wave in the future, we are preparing more than needed so that we are prepared for the worst,” he said.Meanwhile at Sharda Hospital too, a task force has been formed to increase medical facilities.“In our hospital, from oxygen to beds, NICU wards, ICUs, general wards etc. are being kept ready. We currently have six NICU and 14 PICU beds which will be increased to 20 each soon,” said Dr Ajit Kumar, Director, Sharda Hospital.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/noida-child-pgi-ramps-up-infra-for-patients-101622054234864.html
27-05-2021||Noida||Covid-19: Hospitals to train staff in handling children||Gautam Budh Nagar hospitals will be training their staff to ready themselves in the event of a third wave of Covid-19 infections that could possibly affect more children.The focus on children comes on the instructions of the government. While some reports indicated that children may be more affected in a third wave, experts have been saying that there was no evidence to support this theory.But since paediatrics is a specialised branch and in case the infection in children does prove to be severe, hospitals say they want to be ready.“We have 60 resident doctors and over 200 nurses who are being trained by two paediatric experts,” said Dr (major) Rakesh Gupta, director, Government Institute of Medical Sciences who is also the former head of the department of paediatrics in the Armed Force Medical College (AFMC), Pune. They will be instructed on how to handle children, triage and administering medicine.Dr Gupta added that on Wednesday, paediatric experts from government and private hospitals in the district came together to chalk out a plan to prepare for an expected third wave.In the first step, paediatricians will train staff in their own hospitals.Dr Ashutosh Sinha, additional director of Paediatrics, Fortis Hospital, said, “The trainings will help reduce an anticipated staff crunch in the paediatric wards. Uniform guidelines and standard operating procedure (SOPs) will also be created,” he said.Sharda Hospital in Greater Noida will also hold a virtual weeklong session for all health care workers in the district from 11am to 4pm on May 31. “Three paediatric experts from our hospital will train the participants,” said PK Gupta, chairman of the hospital.“Handling children is a bit sensitive. We will train nurses on how to administer medicines, and their doses along with how to handle the medicines. We will also advice on symptoms and the line of treatment,” said Dr Ashutosh Niranjan, medical superintendent at the hospital.The district health department too will hold similar sessions. “The dates have not been decided yet,” said Dr Deepak Ohri, Chief Medical Officer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/hospitals-to-train-staff-in-handling-children-101622054114130.html
27-05-2021||Noida||Bed occupancy falls to 33%, ICU at 63% in Ghaziabad||There are considerably more vacant Covid beds available in Ghaziabad than what was the case at the starting of the month.On May 25 night, the overall bed occupancy stood at just 33% (1133 of 3409 beds occupied), and 499 of the 785 ICU beds occupied, according to official data. On May 1, there was not a single ICU bed available and the overall occupancy was 83.5% (where there were 3262 beds).From April 29 to May 5, the weekly average test positivity rate was nearly 41%, which dropped to 18% the next week and 5.37% the week after that. From May 20 to 26, the average weekly positivity rate was 3.78%.An expert said that the curfew from April 30 had helped in reducing the stress on hospital beds with reduction in cases.“During the period (April-May), the cases had spiked considerably, and we were also short on options. However, the situation has almost normalised now with all types of beds easily available in hospitals,” said Dr NK Gupta, chief medical officer. “We still have 229 patients on ventilators and another 89 on oxygen concentrators. The recovery case in such Covid patients is slow. We expect the ICU situation will further improve after 10-15 days.”Doctors said that the second wave saw patients taking longer to recover and hence, occupied beds for longer too.“Last year, the patients generally recovered within 7-8 days even in the ICU. But this year we witnessed recovery time of 10-15 days,” said Dr Sangeeta Garg, chief medical superintendent of Yashoda Hospital at Nehru Nagar.Others said that patients still on ventilator-support pose a major concern.“After the partial corona curfew was announced, the shortage of beds continued till May 10, but thereafter the cases started to decline,” said Dr Ashish Agarwal, president of Indian Medical Association.On Wednesday, district officials said that they have marked a 10-bedded paediatric ICU (PICU) and another 10-bedded neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) at Santosh Medical College, which is a government-acquired tertiary care Covid facility.“The arrangements are being made to tackle any shortage of beds in case a third wave happens. It is believed that children may be more affected at the time. Private hospitals have been asked to create PICU wards with 10 beds each. We will also start with 60-bedded dedicated healthcare facility for children,” said Ajay Shankar Pandey, district magistrate.Experts have earlier said that there is no evidence to support the claim that children will be impacted in the event of a third wave. They said that infected children may have a greater share in the overall infections in than previously but that would be because many adults would have got their vaccinations by then.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/bed-occupancy-falls-to-33-icu-at-63-in-ghaziabad-101622054054081.html

We also had 250 society staff register themselves, while some residents also got their domestic helps to sign up,” said Gyaan Singh, a society resident. The camp was organised by Fortis Hospital, Noida. The camp started at 9.30am and went on till 6pm, in which nearly 400 people under the 18-45 years age group were inoculated with their first dose of Covishield. The rest will be vaccinated on Thursday, said the residents. Each beneficiary had to pay ₹1,050 for the shot and service. No adverse reaction was reported on Wednesday, they said.The health care staff, equipment and an ambulance were provided by the hospital.Such a camp has come as a relief for residents who found scheduling appointments over Co-Win difficult. “We had been trying to associate with private hospitals for a while to organise such camps. Other societies will host them soon as well,” said Abhishek Kumar, president, Noida Extension Flat Owners Welfare Association.Office bearers of residential bodies said that the idea has been popular with the public.“In less than a day, 250 residents registered and paid for the vaccination camp to be held tomorrow in our sector. Other sectors are also starting these drives in collaboration with private hospitals, making it easy for people to get themselves inoculated.

According to the officials, the district needs to reduce its dependency on oxygen cylinders and focus more on LMO as it is “logistically and medically a better option”. They also said that some new storage tankers for LMO are being planned in the district and new PSA (pressure swing adsorption) plants or oxygen generating plants are being installed.“Currently, the demand for medical oxygen in the district is roughly between 80 to 85 metric tonnes (MT), while the total storage capacity, including LMO plants and all the cylinders, is around 125 MT. We need to enhance the LMO facilities. We are working on it,” said Dr Sweta Khurana, nodal officer for medical oxygen, GB Nagar. At present, the district has 113 MT of LMO holding facilities across 13 private and public hospitals, the officials said. “We are working to increase the LMO tanker storage capacity keeping the future emergencies and likely third Covid wave in mind. Also, we aim to reduce our dependency on oxygen cylinders as LMO tankers are better option logistically and medically as they have better pressure and can be available on time, while cylinders are better for home-isolated patients,” Khurana added.According to the GB Nagar chief medical officer (CMO), Dr Deepak Ohri, oxygen from LMO plant is cleaner as compared to the oxygen cylinders. “An LMO plant stores oxygen in fluid form and there is assurance of its purity while the purity of oxygen depends on the condition of cylinders which often are not cleaned properly. There are high chances of black fungus and other bacterial infections in cylinders especially when they are stored in high humid areas. Besides, an LMO plant stores more oxygen in lesser space,” said Ohri.He further said that work will soon begin on installing new oxygen generating plants and LMO storage tankers in community health centres at Jewar, Bhangel, Badalpur and Dadha.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/need-more-liquid-oxygen-storage-facility-in-noida-say-health-officials-101622053934108.html
27-05-2021||Noida||At UP Gate, ‘Black Day’ observed to mark six months of farmer protest||Ghaziabad: Hundreds of farmers protesting against the Centre’s three new farm laws at the UP Gate marked six months of their agitation on Wednesday by observing a “Black Day” and burning effigies of the government. Later, farmer leaders, who have been demanding the rollback of the farm laws, said that the government is using Covid-19 just as an “alibi so that the laws stay”. During the protest, the farmers also waved black flags to press for their demands. Farmer leader Jagtar Singh Bajwa, who is a member of UP Gate farmers’ committee, said that about 1,000 farmers gathered to observe “Kala Diwas (Black Day)”, but they followed all Covid protocols. According to the directions of the UP government, the state faces partial Covid-19 curfew, and processions or gatherings are banned. The partial curfew came into effect on the night of April 30 and would continue till May 31.“We did not call farmers, but they arrived on their own. We observed social distancing, and everyone was wearing a mask. We waved black flags and burnt effigies. Flags were also waived by people in villages as mark of protest. For past six months, there has been no solution and we will continue our movement,” Bajwa added. The farmers are staying put at the UP Gate site since November 28 last year and also occupying the Ghaziabad-Delhi carriageway of the Delhi-Meerut Expressway since December 3. The several talks with the Centre have failed to break the deadlock. The Ghaziabad police had made elaborate arrangements on Wednesday and said that the protest by farmers went on peacefully. “They brought black flags and also tried to burn effigies. When we tried to stop them, they entered jurisdiction of Delhi. About 700-800 protesters had gathered today, which was higher than what normally is nowadays. Majority of them arrived from Uttarakhand. The police deployment was there, and the protest passed of peacefully,” said Gyanendra Kumar Singh, superintendent of police (city 2).Meanwhile, farmer leader Rakesh Tikait said it seems that the agitation will get prolonged. “The government does not ready to talk to peaceful protesters. We ask if Covid is a bigger issue or farm laws are a bigger issue. If Covid is a bigger issue, they should take back the laws and farmers will return home. But Covid is just taken as alibi so that laws continue to stay. But we will carry our our protest peacefully,” Tikait said at the UP Gate on Wednesday. The last talks between the farm union leaders and the government were held on January 22. “During the peak of the pandemic, an injection which costs ₹400-800 was sold for thousands of rupees and oxygen cylinders were refilled for as high as ₹20,000. Common man suffered. They faced similar situation like farmers will face with the new laws. We have sent letters and if the government talks to us, we will talk. But we have to be prepared for any eventuality. If they snap our electricity supply, we will disconnect supply of electricity to police stations and administrative offices,” Tikait added. Tikait, during the earlier days of the agitation, had alleged that with the new laws, the crops of farmers would go to corporates and farmers would suffer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/at-up-gate-black-day-observed-to-mark-six-months-of-farmer-protest-101622053874122.html
27-05-2021||Chandigarh||Self-collected mouth samples a good option for Covid testing: PGI study||Self-collected buccal (cheek) samples are promising alternatives to nasal and throat swab culture for Covid testing, a study by researchers at the Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research and Panjab University has noted.The researchers stated that nasopharyngeal (nose) and oropharyngeal (throat) swab sampling remains the gold standard for reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) tests as these methods have established track records for detection of respiratory viruses and have been widely used in pandemic situations. However, these pose unique challenges, such as requiring the healthcare worker to be in close proximity to the infected patient, which can be risky in the backdrop of a public health emergency. In addition, these induce discomfort and can stimulate the gag reflex (contraction of the throat that happens when something touches the roof of the mouth) in patients undergoing sampling. This can affect compliance and carries the risk of aerosol generation.Nasal and throat sampling also require the use of personal protective equipment (PPE). Researchers noted that although nasopharyngeal sampling remains the gold standard, it must be recognised that there are specific patient groups that are not amenable to this procedure. For instance, it can be difficult to obtain nasal and throat samples from children and adults with various health conditions.Compared with nasal and throat sampling, the sensitivity of tests from buccal swabs and saliva was 58.90% and 62.90%, respectively suggesting that the oral cavity and its fluids are of high relevance to the pathophysiology of SARS-CoV-2.“Results from nose and throat samples were used as the gold standard to gauge the diagnostic capability from buccal and saliva samples. Both asymptomatic (59) and symptomatic (14) patients, whose nose and throat samples were positive for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-qPCR, were included in our study. Of 73 buccal swabs, 43 (58.90%) were found positive for SARS-CoV-2 and of 62 saliva samples, 39 (62.90%) were positive for SARS-CoV-2.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/samples-collected-from-cheeks-alternative-for-covid-testing-pgi-study-101622050334027.html
27-05-2021||Pune||Work on ‘escape passages’ linking Shivajinagar and Civil court Metro tunnels begins||PUNE The Maharashtra Metro Railway Corporation (Maha-metro) has begun excavation work on the passage that will link the Shivajinagar and Civil court tunnels. Officials said a short underground passage, connecting the parallel tunnels will be used in case of an emergency. According to Atul Gadgil, director, Maha-Metro, “Maha-Metro has planned seven such passages on the underground stretch between Shivajinagar and Swargate. Generally, there is one passage for each 500 metre underground stretch. It is in case a train derailment tales place, there will be an escape route for passengers. We have started excavation work on the first passage between Shivajinagar and the civic court tunnel.”On the overall completion of the underground route, Gadgil said, “We have crossed the river and reached the Budhwar peth area. From the Swargate side, we will reach Mandai in the coming 15 days.” The underground stretch between Agriculture college and Swargate is part of the 16-kilometre Pimpri-Chinchwad to Swargate corridor. Meanwhile, a ramp to link the elevated track with the underground route at Agriculture college depot will be completed by August.Gadgil said, “At Swargate, we are using cut and cover sections for the station work. Behind the station, there are two tunnel works going on under the New Austrian Tunnelling Method (NATM) method. It is a conventional method as there are no tunnel boring machines. It takes at least three months to complete this tunnel work.” There are five underground stations. Of these five metro stations, Maha-Metro is erecting multi-modal hubs at three stations.The cross passages are generally constructed using traditional techniques. These typically include the use of ground treatment, excavators, rock breakers, rock bolting and concrete lining from within the tunnels.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/work-on-escape-passages-linking-shivajinagar-and-civil-court-metro-tunnels-begins-101622040193470.html
27-05-2021||Delhi||Delhi’s Master Plan 2041 to be out in first week of June||Tackling pollution, provisioning rental housing, enhancing walkability and redevelopment of old areas are some of the key features of the Master Plan of Delhi-2041 (MPD-2041), the blueprint for city’s development in the next two decades. The draft MPD-2041 was approved by the Delhi Development Authority on Tuesday and will be placed in public domain for comments next month.DDA vice chairman Anurag Jain said, “The vision is to foster a sustainable, liveable and vibrant Delhi by 204I. There are several policies and norms that have been introduced to achieve this. In fact, we have included some of them such as green development areas (policy for development in green belt areas), walkability, Transit Oriented Development (ToD), norms for unauthorised colonies etc in the current master plan.”While focus is on sustainable development, the draft plan talks about urban design provisions to ensure safety of people on the streets by allowing round-the-clock activities.Jain said, “It is important to have eyes on the streets for the safety of people. It is based on this idea that we have included provisions to mainstream urban design ideas such as active frontage, walkable block lengths, round the clock activity, etc. In new areas which will come up under land pooling, this can easily be done.”The DDA aims to notify the MPD-2041 or the vision document by December this year.While there are proposals to modify some existing norms related to development control, there are many new policies which will change the city. These include introduction of Special Green Economic Uses having low Floor Area Ratio and larger green areas, allowing development in green belt, rental housing, etc.EnvironmentIncreasing air pollution has been one of the key concerns of the city in the past few years. The draft MPD-2041 stresses on the need to enhance the city’s preparedness to deal with climate change issues and tackle pollution, mainly air.For this, the draft plan has proposed a blue-green policy which is to integrate the drains (blues) with the green areas around it. A senior DDA official said, “The policy for new industrial areas has been changed and no manufacturing units will be allowed. There is provision for adopting strict norms for tackling air, water and noise pollution and Special Green Economic Uses that will have low Floor Area Ratio and large green areas.”Environmentalist Diwan Singh said just pushing for construction of green buildings or green industries is not enough and concrete measures have to be taken.Singh said, “There is a conscious effort to increase the green buffer. The DDA should include creation of a biodiversity park or dense green area every 4-5 square km. Green cover is essential to mitigate local air pollution. There should be a plan to revive the water bodies and not flood them with treated water.”HousingCurrently, the DDA is one of the main agencies responsible for providing housing in the city. While the land-owning agency has modified its policies allowing private developers to provide housing, the DDA has made provision for rental accommodations in its next master plan (a major departure from the existing norms).A DDA official said, “The focus will be on non-ownership/ rental and small format housing (particularly close to mass transit) with incentivising new formats like serviced apartments, condominiums, hostels, student housing, worker housing, etc. DDA could earmark some plots in the zonal plan for this which can be allotted on leasehold basis to private developers.”While transit-oriented development (ToD) is being pushed as a major policy in future developments, the draft plan proposes policy for redevelopment and re-densification of old areas specially urbanised villages and unauthorised colonies. DDA officials said that this could be done either through retrofitting or redevelopment. The draft plan also has provisions to provide flexibility in land use and FAR. It stresses on the need to provide social infrastructure in existing residential areas such as urbanised villages, unauthorised colonies, etc.GIS-based planningFor the first time, the DDA has used GIS-based planning in the MPD-2041. DDA officials said that zonal plans have been prepared after digitally mapping every service, land use and infrastructure . “GIS-based plan is to enable stakeholders to know the exact policies/provisions of the draft Master Plan,” said an official.There are 168 layers such as residential, trade and commerce, utilities, roads, transport networks, unauthorised colonies, government offices etc which are being earmarked. “So far we have completed 50 layers and plan to finish the remaining soon,” said a senior DDA official.AK Jain, former planning commission, DDA, said, “GIS is an outdated system and DDA should use new technologies for better planning of the city.”DDA officials said that efforts have been made to make the document people-friendly and easy to read and understand.Other provisionsThe draft MPD-2041, which is divided in two volumes, focuses on enhancing infrastructure for walkability, special provisions for preservation and redevelopment within identified heritage and cultural precincts. There is also focus on enhancing the environment with focus on preservation and enhancement of ecological heritage (Yamuna riverfront development, biodiversity parks).Jain, who has been part of the preparation of 2001 and 2021 master plans, said, “The focus of the new master plan should be on developing a 15-minute city by allowing development along transport nodes. It should take people 15 minutes to reach their workplace from home. Also, the land use provisions should be relaxed and made flexible.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/delhis-master-plan-2041-focuses-on-sustainable-development-and-checking-pollution-101618340142801.html
27-05-2021||World||TikTok took on President Trump and won big||In the summer of 2020, President Donald Trump developed a bizarre obsession with TikTok. Amid a pandemic, historic unemployment and racial unrest subsuming the country, the daily flood of headlines turned to the Chinese-owned social media app.Episode six of Foundering: The TikTok Story begins during a moment of fraught relations between the U.S. and China. Trump had waged a years-long trade war and blamed China for the coronavirus outbreak. In August 2020, in an attempt to deal another blow to Beijing, Trump issued a pair of executive orders banning TikTok unless the app’s U.S. business was sold to an American technology company.Zhang Yiming, the founder of TikTok’s parent company ByteDance Ltd., openly negotiated for months to sell TikTok. However, an alternative strategy prevailed: ByteDance waited out President Trump until he was voted out of office. After Joe Biden moved into the White House, his administration put an official hold on the TikTok ban and sale process. Meanwhile, TikTok became the most downloaded app in the world, according to market research firm App Annie. And its growth continues—TikTok has been expanding its e-commerce and live-streaming operations and cozying up to more music artists and social media influencers, while further entrenching itself into American culture. This is all by design, says Bret Bruen, a former Obama diplomat, in episode six of Foundering: The TikTok Story.For TikTok, “there is no better strategy that I can think of than to get the most influential voices and align them with my product, align them with my policy preferences,” Bruen says.On Thursday, Zhang said he would step down from his role as chief executive officer of ByteDance, capping nearly a decade at the helm of one of the world’s fastest-growing technology companies. The human resources chief, Rubo Liang, will become the new CEO. Zhang will stay at the company to focus on long-term strategy. “The truth is, I lack some of the skills that make an ideal manager,” he wrote in a letter to employees posted by ByteDance. “I worry that I’m still relying too much on the ideas I had before starting the company and haven’t challenged myself by updating those concepts.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/tiktok-took-on-former-us-president-trump-and-won-big-101622136901348.html
27-05-2021||World||Covid either emerged naturally or it was laboratory accident: US Intel community||The Covid-19 virus either emerged naturally from human contact with infected animals or it was a laboratory accident, the US intelligence community said on Thursday."The US Intelligence Community does not know exactly where, when, or how the Covid-19 virus was transmitted initially but has coalesced around two likely scenarios: either it emerged naturally from human contact with infected animals, or it was a laboratory accident," Assistant Director of National Intelligence for Strategic Communications Amanda Schoch said.While two elements of the intelligence community lean toward the former scenario and one leans more toward the latter - each with low or moderate confidence - the majority of elements within the intelligence community do not believe there is sufficient information to assess one to be more likely than the other, she said."The IC continues to examine all available evidence, consider different perspectives, and aggressively collect and analyze new information to identify the virus's origins," Schoch said, a day after President Joe Biden ordered the intelligence agencies to "redouble" their efforts in investigating the emergence of the deadly Covid-19 pandemic and report back to him in 90 days.Covid-19 was first detected in the central Chinese city of Wuhan in late 2019. More than 168 million confirmed cases have since been confirmed worldwide and at least 3.5 million deaths reported.The origins of the Covid-19 remain a widely debated topic, with some scientists and politicians maintaining that the possibility of a lab leak of the deadly virus exists. The Wuhan Institute of Virology is near the outbreak's known epicentre of Huanan Seafood Market in central China’s Wuhan city, where the virus first emerged in late 2019 and became a pandemic.Former US president Donald Trump was among those who supported the theory that the virus might have escaped from a bio lab in China.China has been vehemently denying that the coronavirus broke out in Wuhan and took exception to Trump’s reference to it as “China virus” or “Wuhan virus”. China asserts that the Covid-19 broke out in different places in the world and China only reported the virus first.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-either-emerged-naturally-or-it-was-laboratory-accident-us-intel-community-101622135909878.html
27-05-2021||World||China continues to undermine Hong Kong's democratic institutions, says Blinken||The Chinese government continues to undermine the democratic institutions of Hong Kong and denies the residents the rights that China itself has guaranteed, said US Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Thursday after the city's Legislative Council approved the controversial bill to reform the electoral system.Blinken said that new measures that alter the composition of the electoral system, severely constrain people in Hong Kong from meaningfully participating in their own governance."Decreasing Hong Kong residents' electoral representation will not foster long-term political and social stability for Hong Kong. This legislation defies the Basic Law's clear acknowledgment that the ultimate objective is the election of all members of the LegCo by universal suffrage," the US Secretary of State said in a statement.The State Secretary also asked China and the Hong Kong authorities to allow the voices of all Hong Kongers to be heard. "We also call on these authorities to release and drop charges against all individuals charged under the National Security Law and other laws merely for standing for election or for expressing dissenting views," he said."The United States stands united with our allies and partners in speaking out for the human rights and fundamental freedoms guaranteed to the people in Hong Kong by the Sino-British Joint Declaration and the Basic Law," he added.The reforms passed on Thursday, allow the city's national security department to carry out background checks to ensure candidates for public office are "patriotic". Besides this, the Legislative Council will also be expanded to 90 seats from 70 through this law.This comes after China's National People's Congress (NPC) in March had passed the resolution, paving the way for the biggest shake-up to the city's electoral system since its return to China in 1997.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-continues-to-undermine-hong-kong-s-democratic-institutions-says-blinken-101622135658523.html
27-05-2021||World||US Senate 'unanimously' confirms Christine Wormuth as first female Army secretary||Christine Wormuth was confirmed unanimously by the Senate on Thursday to be the first female secretary of the Army.Wormuth, who led President Joe Biden’s transition team at the Pentagon, got an overwhelmingly warm reception from members of the Senate Armed Services Committee during a hearing this month.Her confirmation sets her up as one of the more powerful officials in a defense establishment long dominated by men. She is the second woman named to a top Pentagon role by Biden. The deputy secretary of defense is Kathleen Hicks.During her hearing, many of the senators pressed Wormuth on a range of personnel issues that have plagued the Army, ranging from sexual assault and racial tensions, to strains on a force that has been in combat in multiple war zones for the last two decades.The Army’s handling of sexual assaults and other violence has come under significant scrutiny in the aftermath of a series of crimes, including murders and suicides last year at Fort Hood, Texas. A review panel found that military leaders at the post were not adequately dealing with high rates of sexual assault and harassment and were utterly neglecting the sexual assault prevention program.Wormuth told the Senate Armed Services Committee that she was “angry and frustrated” by the failures at Fort Hood. And she said the Army needs to “put quite a bit of focus” on improving the command climate all the way down to the lower levels so that younger soldiers feel safe and are able to make complaints if needed.She will take over her post just as military service leaders are facing pressure to change how they prosecute sexual assaults and other crimes. An independent panel has recommended that decisions to prosecute service members for sexual assault be made by independent authorities, not commanders, a major change that has been resisted by the military. And members of Congress strongly back such a change.Wormuth has a long history of service in the Pentagon on a variety of national security issues. She served as the undersecretary of defense for policy and the senior director for defense policy at the NSC during the Obama administration, and held other Defense Department positions. She also previously served as principal deputy assistant secretary for homeland defense.Her most recent job was as director of the International Security and Defense Policy Center at the RAND Corp., a federally funded think tank.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-senate-unanimously-confirms-christine-wormuth-as-first-female-army-secretary-101622134034219.html
27-05-2021||World||Biden orders more intel investigation of Covid-19 origin||President Joe Biden ordered U.S. intelligence officials to “redouble” their efforts to investigate the origins of the Covid-19 pandemic, including any possibility the trail might lead to a Chinese laboratory.After months of minimizing that possibility as a fringe theory, the Biden administration is joining worldwide pressure for China to be more open about the outbreak, aiming to head off GOP complaints the president has not been tough enough as well as to use the opportunity to press China on alleged obstruction.Biden asked US intelligence agencies to report back within 90 days, and he told reporters on Thursday that he aimed to release their results publicly. The Democrat directed U.S. national laboratories to assist with the investigation and the intelligence community to prepare a list of specific queries for the Chinese government. He called on China to cooperate with international probes into the origins of the pandemic.Republicans, including former President Donald Trump, have promoted the theory that the virus emerged from a laboratory accident rather than naturally through human contact with an infected animal in Wuhan, China.Biden ordered an initial intelligence review in March and upon being presented with its conclusions determined more digging was required. He also ordered that excerpts of the assessment be declassified to demonstrate the U.S. government's commitment to investigating the origins of the pandemic and to increase pressure on China to cooperate, said a person familiar with the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal thinking.Biden in a statement said the majority of the intelligence community had “coalesced” around those two scenarios but “do not believe there is sufficient information to assess one to be more likely than the other.” He revealed that two agencies lean toward the animal link and “one leans more toward” the lab theory, "each with low or moderate confidence."“The United States will also keep working with like-minded partners around the world to press China to participate in a full, transparent, evidence-based international investigation and to provide access to all relevant data and evidence," said Biden.His statement came after weeks of the administration endeavoring to avoid public discussion of the lab leak theory and privately suggesting it was farfetched.China on Thursday accused Biden's administration of now playing politics and shirking its responsibility in calling for a renewed investigation into the origins of the coronavirus pandemic, which was first detected in China in late 2019. Foreign Ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian said Biden’s order showed the U.S. “does not care about facts and truth, nor is it interested in serious scientific origin tracing.”In another sign of shifting attitudes on the origins of the virus, the Senate approved two Wuhan lab-related amendments without opposition, attaching them to a largely unrelated bill to increase U.S. investments in innovation.One of the amendments, from Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., would block U.S. funding of Chinese “gain of function” research on enhancing the severity or transmissibility of a virus. Paul has been critical of Dr. Anthony Fauci, the government's top infectious-disease expert, and aggressively questioned him at a recent Senate hearing over the work in China. The other amendment was from GOP Sen. Joni Ernst of Iowa and it would prevent any funding to the Wuhan Institute of Virology.Both were approved without roll call votes as part of the broader bill that is still under debate in the Senate.As for the origin of pandemic, Fauci, a White House coronavirus adviser, said Wednesday that he and most others in the scientific community “believe that the most likely scenario is that this was a natural occurrence, but no one knows that 100% for sure.”“And since there’s a lot of concern, a lot of speculation and since no one absolutely knows that, I believe we do need the kind of investigation where there’s open transparency and all the information that’s available, to be made available, to scrutinize,” Fauci said at a Senate hearing.White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Tuesday that the White House supports a new World Health Organization investigation in China, but she added that an effective probe “would require China finally stepping up and allowing access needed to determine the origins.”Biden still held out the possibility that a firm conclusion may never be reached, given the Chinese government's refusal to fully cooperate with international investigations.“The failure to get our inspectors on the ground in those early months will always hamper any investigation into the origin of Covid-19,” he said.The Chinese Embassy in Washington, without mentioning the Biden order, accused unnamed political forces of being fixated on a blame game while ignoring the urgent need to combat the pandemic.“Smear campaign and blame shifting are making a comeback, and the conspiracy theory of ‘lab leak’ is resurfacing,” the embassy said in a statement posted Wednesday on its website.Administration officials continue to harbor strong doubts about the lab leak theory. Rather, they view China’s refusal to cooperate in the investigation — particularly on something of such magnitude — as emblematic of other irresponsible actions on the world stage.Privately, administration officials say the end result, if ever known, won’t change anything, but note China’s stonewalling is now on display for the world to see.The State Department, which ended one Trump-era probe into the Chinese lab theory this spring, said it was continuing to cooperate with other government agencies and pressed China to cooperate with the world.“China’s position that their part in this investigation is complete is disappointing and at odds with the rest of the international community that is working collaboratively across the board to bring an end to this pandemic and improve global health security," said spokesman Ned Price.The White House also hopes Biden's commitment to the investigation will stand in contrast to the last administration, which in the earliest days of the pandemic refused to press China to reveal more about the origins and course of the deadly disease because it was fearful of disrupting trade talks in an election year.Research into the origins of the virus is critically important, said Arinjay Banerjee, a virologist at the Vaccine and Infectious Disease Organization in Saskatchewan, Canada, because, “If you don’t know where it came from, how are you going to stop it from spreading it again?”“The great probability is still that this virus came from a wildlife reservoir,” he said, pointing to the fact that spillover events – when viruses jump from animals to humans – are common in nature, and that scientists already know of two similar beta coronaviruses that evolved in bats and caused epidemics when humans were infected, SARS1 and MERS. “The evidence we so far have suggests that this virus came from wildlife,” he saidHowever, the case is not completely closed. “There are probabilities, and there are possibilities,” said Banerjee. “Because nobody has identified a virus that’s 100% identical to SARS-CoV-2 in any animal, there is still room for researchers to ask about other possibilities.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-orders-more-intel-investigation-of-covid-19-origin-101622133511441.html
27-05-2021||World||Facebook says won't remove posts claiming Covid-19 is 'man-made'||Facebook says it will no longer remove claims that Covid-19 is man-made or manufactured from its apps “in light of ongoing investigations into the origin of Covid-19 and in consultation with public health experts."The move comes amid increasing pressure worldwide to investigate the origins of the pandemic, including the possibility that it came from a lab. Since the pandemic began, Facebook has been changing what it allows on the topic and what it bans. In February, it announced a host of new claims it would be prohibiting -- including that COVID-19 was created in a Chinese lab. Other claims it added at the time included the false notion that vaccines are not effective or that they are toxic.Lisa Fazio, a professor of psychology at Vanderbilt University, said the reversal shows the difficulty of fact-checking in general, particularly with something unprecedented like the coronavirus, when experts can disagree and change their minds with new evidence.“It’s one reason that content moderation shouldn’t be static, scientific consensus changes over time," Fazio said. “It’s also a reminder to be humble and that for some questions the best current answer is “we don’t know yet” or “it’s possible, but experts think it’s unlikely."Facebook's reversal comes as President Joe Biden ordered U.S. intelligence officials to “redouble” their efforts to investigate the origins of the COVID-19 pandemic, including any possibility the trail might lead to a Chinese laboratory. After months of minimizing these claims as a fringe theory, the Biden administration is joining worldwide pressure for China to be more open about the outbreak.

The council has limited powers of investigation.Belarus scrambled a fighter jet and used a false bomb alert to divert the flight to Minsk and detain a dissident Belarusian journalist. The plane had been traveling from Athens to the Lithuanian capital Vilnius.The incident sparked international outrage and calls for sanctions against Belarus. Minsk accused the West of using the episode to wage "hybrid war."Irish Transport Minister Eamon Ryan said Dublin wanted ICAO to use Article 55e of its Convention, which allows an investigation into avoidable obstacles to the development of international navigation."We need a full probe," he told reporters.Montreal-based ICAO cannot impose binding rules on governments but wields clout through its safety and security standards, which are approved by its 192 member states."We wish to remind those who demanded we take punitive action against that country that our agency was never assigned that type of role or capability," ICAO tweeted on Wednesday.ICAO said officials from Belarus, Ireland, Lithuania, and Poland would also be present at the governing council meeting to underscore their priorities and concerns.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/un-aviation-body-discusses-call-for-independent-probe-into-force-landing-of-ryanair-flight-by-belarus-101622129221640.html
27-05-2021||World||Sinopharm Covid-19 vaccines appear safe, effective: Study||Two vaccines made by China's Sinopharm appear safe and effective against Covid-19, according to a study published in a medical journal.Scientists had been waiting for more details about the two vaccines, even though they already are being used in many countries, and one recently won the backing of the World Health Organisation for emergency use.The report, published online in the Journal of the American Medical Association, concluded the two vaccines are about 73 per cent and 78 per cent effective, as Sinopharm has previously claimed.Researchers from Sinopharm and its local partners in the Middle East say the trial involved around 40,380 participants with the company's two vaccines -- one developed by the Wuhan Institute of Biological Products and the other by the Beijing Institute of Biological Products — and a placebo.The trial was carried out in four countries — Bahrain, the United Arab Emirates, Egypt and Jordan. However, the study provided data for just Bahrain and the UAE.“There's nothing very surprising. It's consistent with what they have claimed previously, but it does not completely eliminate the doubts about Sinopharm,” said Jin Dong-yan, a medical professor at the University of Hong Kong who was not involved with the study.He raised doubts about how protective the vaccine was based on a recent surge of cases in the island nation of Seychelles, which had vaccinated a large majority of its population with the Sinopharm vaccine.The study, performed mostly in younger men, had little information about the vaccine's effectiveness against severe disease. Some experts also expressed concern at the shortage of female participants, with nearly 85 per cent being male."It's important to make sure you have tested it in enough women to be able to start seeing any possible safety concerns," said Ashley St. John, an associate professor at Duke-NUS Medical School in Singapore.A spokesperson for the company did not immediately respond to a request for comment.The vaccines, both of which are made with inactivated viruses, have already been given to millions of people across the world.The World Health Organisation cleared the Beijing Institute of Biological Products' shot for emergency use in early May, making it the first Chinese vaccine to receive the certification.Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said in April that China has provided vaccines to more than 100 countries, although it has not identified them. While China has six vaccines in use, the majority of its exports come from two companies: Sinopharm and Sinovac.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/sinopharm-covid-19-vaccines-appear-safe-effective-study-101622124781433.html
27-05-2021||World||AstraZeneca follows up with German lab on blood clotting Links||AstraZeneca Plc is following up with a German laboratory that may have discovered the cause of rare blood clots linked to its Covid-19 vaccine.The UK pharma company said the theory put forward by the Goethe University lab in Frankfurt on Wednesday is one of many that AstraZeneca scientists are investigating.“We are continuing to work with regulators, recommending bodies and the scientific community around the world to understand more about the epidemiology and the possible mechanisms behind these extremely rare events,” said Fiona Cookson, a spokesperson for AstraZeneca.The theory set out in a preprint by the lab, headed by Professor Rolf Marschalek, suggests that the adenovirus vectors can deliver the DNA gene sequencing into the nucleus, not the fluid found inside the cell where proteins are usually produced. Parts of the resulting spike protein split inside the nucleus, according to the theory, producing mutant versions that are secreted into the body and trigger blood clots in very rare events.“The data certainly highlights that production of this truncated spike may well occur, but it stops short of providing a concrete link with promotion of blood clotting,” said Jonathan Ball, a molecular virologist at the University of Nottingham, about the Goethe research. “Nevertheless, it is certainly something worth investigating further.”The Astra vaccine, which uses a design formulated by Vaccitech Plc scientists at the University of Oxford, has come under scrutiny around the world after reports of cerebral venous sinus thrombosis in some people who received it. Similar blood clot reports have been identified in recipients of Johnson & Johnson’s vaccine, which uses a similar design.The Financial Times reported on Wednesday that J&J had also spoken to the lab about the research.“We are supporting continued research and analysis of this rare event as we work with medical experts and global health authorities,” J&J’s Janssen Pharmaceuticals said in an emailed statement. “We look forward to reviewing and sharing data as it becomes available, and, currently, we believe it is too soon to draw conclusions.”The Goethe data conflict with University of Bristol research from October that said Astra’s vaccine performed as expected.Marschalek’s team noted that the type of vaccine developed by Pfizer Inc.-BioNTech SE and Moderna Inc., which uses mRNA technology, only delivers the genetic information to the cell fluid.“All mRNA-based vaccines should represent safe products,” the Goethe University preprint said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/astrazeneca-follows-up-with-german-lab-on-blood-clotting-links-101622123871478.html
27-05-2021||World||China, US clash again on Covid origin, Indo-Pacific||China on Thursday said the US is playing politics with the Covid-19 pandemic by calling for a new investigation into the origin of the virus first detected in the central Chinese city of Wuhan in late 2019.The Chinese foreign ministry said scientists from the World Health Organization (WHO) had already said that the “lab leak” theory was unlikely.The ministry dismissed the theory that the virus may have leaked from a lab in Wuhan as a “conspiracy”.“Some people in the United States completely ignore facts and science,” ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian said on Thursday.Zhao said that the US ranks first globally in the number of confirmed Covid-19 cases and fatalities, which have reached around 33 million and 600,000 respectively.He said the US should accept a WHO-led international investigation into its Fort Detrick biolab and over 200 similar facilities it operates around the world.The Chinese foreign ministry was responding to US President Joe Biden telling US intelligence officials to redouble their efforts to investigate the origin of the pandemic, including any possibility the trail might lead to high security Chinese laboratory in WuhanThe Biden administration is seemingly adding to the global pressure on China to be more open about the outbreak, aiming to counter the opposing Republican complaints that the new president hasn’t been tough enough to press China on its alleged lack of transparency about the first days of the pandemic.CHINA ANGRY OVER INDO-PACIFIC STRATEGY, QUADSeparately, the Chinese defence ministry singled out the Biden administration on its Indo-Pacific strategy, saying that no strategy should instigate countries to establish selective and exclusive military alliances, to gang up or to create the “New Cold War” featuring bloc confrontation.The zero-sum game will only lead to more division, antagonism and chaos, senior colonel Tan Kefei, defence ministry spokesperson said in Beijing on Thursday.“No strategy should harm the welfare of people in regional countries, or put them in a dangerous situation,” Tan was quoted as saying by official military media.The strategy of intensifying military presence and highlighting military competition will only aggravate regional tensions and endanger world peace and stability, Tan added.Earlier this month, China had lashed out at the four-member Quad, saying it is an exclusive clique rallying countries to work against China.The ministry’s spokesperson Hua Chunying said that China has always made its view clear about the Quad, which comprises the US, India, Japan and Australia.“We believe it is an exclusive clique against China and trying to rally countries around China to work against China,” Hua added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-us-clash-again-on-covid-origin-indopacific-101622123099474.html

27-05-2021||World||UK health secretary Matt Hancock denies lying over Covid-19 response||Britain's health secretary Thursday denied lying to colleagues and the country over his handling of the coronavirus pandemic, after a scathing broadside from Prime Minister Boris Johnson's former top adviser.The attack from Dominic Cummings -- who also called Johnson "unfit for the job" -- raised new questions about whether tens of thousands of people died needlessly because of government incompetence and dishonesty.Health Secretary Matt Hancock "should have been fired for at least 15, 20 things" after "lying to everybody on multiple occasions, in meeting after meeting in the cabinet room and publicly", Cummings said in testimony to MPs.Hancock claimed in May 2020 to have thrown a "protective ring" around care homes -- but the main opposition Labour party noted that 30,000 elderly residents have died of Covid-19 and 20,000 older patients were discharged from hospitals without testing.It also highlighted Cummings' claim that the health secretary had dishonestly blamed the National Health Service for the government's failure to procure adequate personal protective equipment for frontline medics.The "unsubstantiated allegations around honesty are not true", Hancock said in parliament."I've been straight with people in public and in private throughout, every day since I began working on the response to this pandemic last January (2020)," he said.Hancock received backing from colleagues including senior minister Michael Gove, who told parliament that the health minister has "been doing a great job" and is a "dedicated public servant".Downing Street has also stood by Hancock, insisting Johnson retains confidence in him.But the prime minister himself faces questions over whether, as claimed by Cummings, he refused to take the pandemic seriously, ignored scientific advice at a key point, and was obsessed by personal issues and media coverage."Tens of thousands of people died who didn't need to die," Cummings, an abrasive political strategist who masterminded Brexit, said during his excoriating account on Wednesday.Coronavirus has claimed nearly 128,000 lives in the UK -- the fifth-highest official death toll in the world, and the highest in Europe.But Johnson's government has also overseen a successful vaccination drive, having offered more than two-thirds of adults at least one dose.However, scientists say the progress is threatened by the rapid growth of a Covid variant that first emerged in India, which could imperil the government's plans to fully reopen the economy after June 21.Hancock said ministers were "desperate" to stick to the timetable, "but only if it is safe" once more data on the variant comes through.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-health-secretary-matt-hancock-denies-lying-over-covid-19-response-101622115851692.html
27-05-2021||World||China bars envoy from entering court to watch Australian’s trial||China firmly rejects Canberra’s attempts to intervene in the trial of detained Australian writer Yang Hengjun, the foreign ministry said on Thursday, hours after the Australian envoy was denied entry inside a Beijing court where the author’s case was being heard.Graham Fletcher, the Australian ambassador to China, was stopped from entering the heavily-guarded Beijing No 2 Intermediate People’s Court as the court began hearing Yang’s case.The high profile trial of Yang, 56, an Australian-Chinese writer charged with espionage by China, started on Thursday, two years after he was picked up from an airport by Chinese authorities.A popular blogger, Yang had written spy novels until he was picked up from Guangzhou airport in 2019.Yang faces a possible death sentence if found guilty of having “endangered national security” while the minimum sentence is three years.“Unfortunately, we have just been denied entry to the court. The reason given was because of the pandemic situation but the foreign ministry has also told us it is because it is a national security case therefore, we are not permitted to attend it,” agency reports quoted Ambassador Fletcher as saying outside the court.“This is deeply regrettable and concerning and unsatisfactory. We have had long standing concerns about this case, including lack of transparency, and therefore have concluded it is an instance of arbitrary detention,” he said.Responding to questions on the case, Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson, Zhao Lijian said China firmly opposes Australia’s unreasonable interference with China’s handling of cases according to law and gross interference in China’s judicial sovereignty.Zhao added that China has lodged solemn representations with Australia about the case.Rights groups have spoken out against Yang’s detention and trial.“Yang Hengjun has been detained on totally baseless allegations that he is a spy, and the Chinese authorities must ensure that his trial meets international fair trial standards. The charges against Yang appear to be a politically motivated prosecution for articles he wrote that were critical of the Chinese government. This is an outrageous attack on his right to freedom of expression,” the head of the rights group Amnesty International’s China Team, Joshua Rosenzweig, said.Australian-Chinese, Cheng Lei, a high-profile business anchor for CGTN, a state television channel, disappeared in August last year, and a month later, was accused of espionage.Yang’s arrest and the reluctance on China’s part to release details about it is one among several reasons for the souring of ties between Beijing and Canberra.Earlier this May, China had “indefinitely” suspended all activity under a China-Australia economic dialogue mechanism, seen as part of increasingly strained diplomatic ties between Beijing and Canberra.Like with the US, Beijing-Canberra ties have been soured by more than one reason; the strains first appeared in 2018 when Australia became the first country to publicly ban Chinese tech giant Huawei from its 5G network.Beijing was furious in 2020 when Australia became one of the first countries to call for an independent investigation into the origins of the novel coronavirus, which started from the central Chinese city of Wuhan in late 2019.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-bars-envoy-from-entering-court-to-watch-australian-s-trial-101622113834570.html

Most were killed in Hamas-controlled Gaza, where Israel fought militants for 11 days, ending in a ceasefire.Hamas rockets had killed 10 Israelis and residents.She was addressing a special session of the UN Human Rights Council, held at the request of Muslim states who have asked the forum to set up a commission of inquiry to investigate possible crimes and establish command responsibility.The conflict erupted after Hamas demanded Israeli forces leave the Al Aqsa compound in East Jerusalem and later launched rockets towards Israel. The "indiscriminate" rocket strikes constitute "a clear violation of international humanitarian law", Bachelet said.Israel responded with intense air strikes in Gaza, including shelling, missiles and attacks from the sea, causing widespread destruction of civilian infrastructure and death, she said."Despite Israel’s claims that many of these buildings were hosting armed groups or being used for military purposes, we have not seen evidence in this regard," she added."If found to be indiscriminate and disproportionate, such attacks might constitute war crimes," Bachelet told the 47-member forum. She also urged Hamas to refrain from firing indiscriminate rockets on Israel.Meirav Eilon Shahar, Israel's ambassador to the UN in Geneva, denounced Hamas as a "jihadist, genocidal, terrorist organization" and accused it of using Palestinian civilians as human shields to conceal its rockets.Referring to the 4,400 rockets fired into Israel - most of which were intercepted by Israel's "Iron Dome" defence shield - she added: "Each one of these rockets constitutes a war crime."Riyad al-Maliki, foreign minister of Palestine, said: "Israel, the occupation and apartheid authority continues its crimes, its policies and laws to consolidate a colonial and apartheid system."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/un-rights-chief-michelle-bachelet-says-israeli-strikes-on-gaza-may-be-war-crimes-101622111803836.html
27-05-2021||World||Police, FBI seek motive in California shooting rampage||Police and federal investigators sought on Thursday to determine why a Northern California transit employee opened fire on his co-workers, killing nine people in the latest mass shooting to haunt the United States.The accused gunman shot himself as police closed in on him, minutes after gunfire erupted at about 6:30 a.m. Pacific time at a light rail yard in the heart of Silicon Valley, according to Santa Clara County Sheriff Laurie Smith.Police did not publicly name the gunman. The San Jose Mercury News and other news media identified him as Samuel Cassidy, 57, a maintenance worker at the yard.Firefighters responded to a fire at a home where the suspect lived at about the same time that the shooting was first reported. A police bomb squad searched the rail yard and adjacent buildings after an explosive device was found.Police declined to speculate on a motive for the shooting rampage, saying that their work at the scene could take several days, assisted by the Federal Bureau of Investigation and Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms.California Governor Gavin Newsom said at a Wednesday afternoon news conference that the massacre was a symptom of a larger American problem."It begs the damn question, What the hell is going on in the United States of America? What the hell is wrong with us and when are we going to come to grips with this?" Newsom said.A White House spokeswoman told reporters that the shooting was further evidence that the United States was in the grip of an "epidemic of gun violence."Latest mass shootingThe gunman and the nine victims shot dead were all employees of the transit agency situated near the city's airport. The victims were found in two buildings on the site.The County of Santa Clara medical examiner-coroner's office identified the victims late on Wednesday. They appeared to all be men and ranged in age between 29 and 63. Their names are: Paul Delacruz Megia, Taptejdeep Singh, Adrian Balleza, Jose Dejesus Hernandez III, Timothy Michael Romo, Michael Joseph Rudometkin, Abdolvahab Alaghmandan and Lars Kepler Lane.The ninth victim, Alex Ward Fritch, 49, died late Wednesday after he was taken to the hospital in critical condition, the medical examiner's office said, according to NBC Bay Area.Cassidy had worked for the transit authority since at least 2012, when he was listed as an "electro-mechanic," and was promoted to "substation maintainer" in 2015, according to records posted by the nonprofit website Transportation California.Last year, he earned a salary of $102,000 plus benefits and $20,000 in overtime, the records showed.The suspect and another individual filed domestic violence restraining orders against one another in 2009, three years after Cassidy and his wife divorced, according court records showed.San Jose is a city of about 1 million people in Silicon Valley, a global technology hub and home to some of America's biggest tech companies.Wednesday's incident was the latest of at least nine deadly U.S. mass shootings in the past three months, including a string of attacks at Atlanta-area day spas in mid-March and a rampage days later that killed 10 at a Colorado supermarket.Last month, a former employee of an Indianapolis FedEx center shot eight workers to death before taking his own life. Earlier this month a man fatally shot his girlfriend and five other people before taking his own life at a birthday party in Colorado.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/police-fbi-seek-motive-in-california-shooting-rampage-101622111161843.html

"We would like to ask the US side to do the same as China and immediately cooperate with the World Health Organization on origin tracing research in a scientific manner."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/politics-behind-us-call-for-coronavirus-origin-probe-says-china-101622109356308.html

Oli and Nepali Congress President Deuba had staked separate claims to the premiership, saying the “claims were insufficient.”Nepal's Opposition alliance on Monday filed a writ petition in the Supreme Court demanding restoration of the House of Representatives and appointment of Deuba as the Prime Minister. Others had also filed petitions against the dissolution of the House of Representatives.The Constitution envisions a five-member Constitutional Bench which is led by Chief Justice Rana. The members of the bench are selected by Rana.Earlier on December 20, the President had dissolved the Parliament and called snap polls on April 30 and May 10. However, two months later, the Rana-led Constitutional Bench on February 23 overturned the decision and reinstated the House.Constitutional experts have criticised Oli and Bhandari for their complicity in trampling upon the Constitution. Nepal plunged into a political crisis on December 20 last year after President Bhandari dissolved the House and announced fresh elections on April 30 and May 10 at the recommendation of Prime Minister Oli, amidst a tussle for power within the ruling Nepal Communist Party (NCP).Oli's move to dissolve the House sparked protests from a large section of the NCP led by his rival Pushpa Kamal Dahal 'Prachanda'.In February, the apex court reinstated the dissolved House, in a setback to Oli who was preparing for snap polls.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nepal-sc-sends-petitions-against-house-dissolution-to-constitutional-bench-101622108223018.html

27-05-2021||World||US resident sought by China for comments on last year's India-China clash freed in Dubai||A permanent resident of the United States wanted by China was freed by Dubai on Thursday, taking off on a flight to Turkey after spending weeks in detention.Beijing had sought Wang Jingyu over his online comments about a deadly confrontation between Chinese and Indian forces last year.Activists and his supporters say plainclothes police officers arrested the 19-year-old student as he came off an Emirates flight in April at Dubai International Airport, trying to connect onto New York. The State Department acknowledged his arrest, described the case as a “human rights" concern and warned that he could have faced extradition to China.He was freed just hours after The Associated Press began asking questions about his case.Wang's case comes as the United Arab Emirates, long a US defence partner in the Mideast, has drawn closer to China in recent years in trade and in efforts to combat the coronavirus pandemic. That already has sparked concerns among American officials amid what experts refer to as a looming “great powers conflict” the US faces with China and Russia.“We remain alarmed by human rights violations and abuses in China and call on (Chinese) authorities to respect the fundamental freedoms to which their citizens are entitled consistent with China’s international obligations and commitments,” the State Department told the AP.Chinese diplomats in the Emirates did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The Chinese Foreign Ministry also has not responded to requests about Wang.Wang posted a video from an Emirates flight, showing his ticket back to Istanbul.“The police here are very bad,” Wang said. “Today, they suddenly brought me on the plane. They didn’t even give me back my clothes or shoes, and they gave me these flip flops to wear. They didn’t give me anything just a passport and a phone. They’re really too awful. Too awful.”Wang came to authorities' attention last year after brutal hand-to-hand combat between Chinese and Indian forces in a valley in the Karakoram mountains, a region disputed following a 1962 war between the two countries. In June, soldiers armed with clubs, stones and fists battled each other for hours in violence that killed 20 Indian soldiers.Months later, in February, China acknowledged the fighting killed four of its own soldiers. Wang then publicly questioned on social media why the Chinese government waited six months to release the information, sparking a harassment campaign that saw him flee to Istanbul, activists say.Police in Wang's hometown of Chongqing reportedly have cited him for violating a 2018 law against demeaning heroes and martyrs and called his parents in for questioning. While en route from Istanbul to New York, activists say authorities arrested him April 6 at Dubai International Airport, holding him first at an immigration jail and later at another at a police station.“While in custody, Wang has been questioned by Dubai police for endangering national security, and has, according to his statements, been visited by both Chinese Embassy (Abu Dhabi) and Consulate (Dubai) staff repeatedly,” the rights group Safeguard Defenders said in a letter Wednesday to the UAE's ambassador to the USThey “pressured him to sign a document allowing him to be deported back to China, where he is wanted for what can only be described as freedom of speech crimes,” the letter added.A Dubai Public Prosecution charge sheet obtained by the AP describes Wang as facing an investigation over allegedly “insulting one of the monotheistic religions,” a charge typically referring to insulting Islam. However, the government's Dubai Media Office initially told the AP that Wang instead had been arrested for “non-payment of hotel bills" and denied he faced any charge for insulting IslamShown the charge sheet, the Dubai Media Office then said Wang had faced the insult charge later, but “hotel payments were settled and charges were dropped and he was let free.”“Chinese authorities have not inquired about Mr. Wang, nor did they request his deportation to China, nor has there been any contract between UAE and Chinese authorities with regards to Mr. Wang,” the Dubai Media Office said.The State Department said it had been “actively seeking information” on Wang's case as he could have been deported to China.“We actively discourage foreign governments from embracing the tactic of menacing journalists and dissidents overseas and will continue to make clear to partners and adversaries alike that this increasingly prevalent practice must end,” the State Department said. “Freedom of expression should never be criminalized.”The UAE, a federation of seven sheikhdoms on the Arabian Peninsula, maintains close economic ties with China. Over 4,000 Chinese companies operate in the UAE across its economic free zones, with roadwork projects noticeably involving Chinese state construction firms. The UAE imported $40 billion in goods from China and exported $9.3 billion to it in 2019 alone, according to United Nations trade data. Dubai's Jebel Ali port remains an important transshipment point for Chinese goods to the world.The US also maintains close defense ties to the UAE. Some 3,500 American troops operate in the country, including at Abu Dhabi’s Al-Dhafra Air Base. Jebel Ali is the US Navy’s busiest port of call outside of America. The US also plans a $23 billion arms sale to the UAE, including advanced F-35 stealth jet fighters, after Abu Dhabi recognised Israel.China’s influence in the UAE, however, has increasing come under American scrutiny.Since the coronavirus pandemic, the UAE relied heavily on Chinese vaccines for its initial inoculations amid questions about its efficacy. US diplomats and security officials privately warned the state of Nevada not to use Chinese-made coronavirus test kits donated by the United Arab Emirates over concerns about patient privacy, test accuracy and Chinese government involvement.The Wall Street Journal this week, citing anonymous US officials, reported that American spy agencies recently saw two planes belonging to China’s People’s Liberation Army land at an Emirati airport and unload crates of undetermined materiel. Those officials warned a growing Chinese military presence in the Emirates could affect the UAE's efforts to obtain the F-35.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-resident-sought-by-china-for-comments-on-last-year-s-india-china-clash-freed-in-dubai-101622106286388.html
27-05-2021||World||French energy giant Total stops payments on Myanmar pipeline||Shareholders of the French energy company Total SE have voted to suspend payments of dividends to stakeholders in the joint venture company running a gas pipeline in Myanmar, the company said Wednesday.Pressure has been growing on companies with investments or operations linked to the Myanmar military to suspend any financial support following a Feb. 1 coup. The Yadana pipeline is partly owned by Myanmar Oil & Gas Enterprises, a government-controlled entity.Shareholders of the Moattama Gas Transportation Co., or MGTC, which operates the Yadana pipeline, made the decision at a meeting held on May 12, Total said in a statement.It said the decision was in response to a proposal from Total and the US energy company Chevron and was taken “in light of the unstable context in Myanmar.”The decision was retroactively effective from April 1, it said. “All cash distributions by MGTC to its shareholders (Total (31.24%), Chevron (28.26%), PTTEP (25.5%) and MOGE (15%)) are suspended," it said. PTTEP is a Thai company.Also Read| Myanmar's Suu Kyi appears in court in person for first time since coupTotal is still operating the pipeline, however, keeping the supply of gas steady “so as to not disrupt the electricity supply that is vital to the local populations of Myanmar and Thailand,” it said. The company has said it needs to protect its workers from repercussions of any moves to suspend its operations in the country.The human rights group Justice for Myanmar noted that the suspension of dividends represents a fraction of the funds paid to the government from the pipeline, which includes millions in taxes, royalties and the government's share of the gas revenues.Yadana is only one of Myanmar's three major offshore gas projects. The 400-kilometer (250-mile) Yadana pipeline, operated by Total Exploration & Production Myanmar, transports gas from the oil field offshore south of Myanmar to Thailand.The company reiterated that it “condemns the violence and human rights abuses occurring in Myanmar." It said it would comply with decisions of international and national authorities, including sanctions.Myanmar's military has imposed an increasingly violent crackdown on mass protests against the coup and a broad civil disobedience movement. More than 825 people have been killed — well over two times the government tally — according to the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners, a watchdog organization that monitors arrests and deaths.Also Read| Pro-democracy protesters seize police post, kill security forces in MyanmarThe United States, Canada, the United Kingdom and other European governments have imposed sanctions in an effort to push the junta to release the hundreds of people it has arrested and restore the elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi. But such actions have had a limited effect as they targeted domestic military-controlled companies and the overseas travel and assets of members of the junta's leadership, the military and their family members.Among other things, critics of the junta have urged many companies to withdraw or stop payments that might support Myanmar’s military, which has vast holdings that dominate its economy.That includes banks that provide financing for companies working with or paying rent to military-affiliated companies and pension funds that are invested in dozens of companies.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/french-energy-giant-total-stops-payments-on-myanmar-pipeline-101622105571114.html

Gen. Constat Ndima Kongba, ordered the evacuation of 10 of 18 neighbourhoods, saying an eruption could occur at any time.While the main city of Goma was previously spared, it is now under threat, with activity being reported under the urban area and Lake Kivu, Kongba said.“Based on these scientific observations, we cannot currently rule out an eruption on land or under the lake. And this could happen with very little (or no) warning,” he said. An eruption under Lake Kivu could also have harmful consequences by leading to the explosion of gas in the lake, which could destroy parts of Goma and Gisenyi in neighboring Rwanda.Residents were advised to carry very little, that they could not return to their homes until advised by authorities and that vehicles will be provided to help with the evacuation.With little warning Mount Nyiragongo turned the dark sky fiery red Saturday night and then spewed torrents of lava into villages destroying more than 500 homes and resulting in the deaths of more than 32 people over days, officials said.Mount Nyiragongo's last eruption was in 2002, leaving hundreds dead. The lava coated the airport runways and also left more than 100,000 homeless in the aftermath. It also erupted in 1977, killing more than 600 people.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/thousands-evacuate-congo-s-goma-city-fearing-more-volcanic-activity-in-mount-nyiragongo-101622104923928.html
27-05-2021||World||Hong Kong changes electoral law, reduces direct public vote||Hong Kong’s legislature on Thursday passed a bill amending electoral laws that drastically reduces the public’s ability to vote and increases the number of pro-Beijing lawmakers making decisions for the city.The new law empowers the city’s national security department to check the backgrounds of potential candidates for public office and a sets up a new committee to ensure candidates are “patriotic.”The number of seats in Hong Kong’s legislature will be expanded to 90, with 40 of them elected by a largely pro-Beijing election committee. The number of legislators elected directly by Hong Kong voters will be cut to 20, from the previous 35.The bill, passed by a 40-2 vote, was met with little opposition, as most of the legislators are largely pro-Beijing. Their pro-democracy colleagues resigned en masse last year in protest over the ousting of four lawmakers deemed to be insufficiently loyal to Beijing.Also Read| Hong Kong activist Joshua Wong jailed over 'unlawful' Tiananmen Square vigilPro-Beijing lawmakers lauded the bill during the debate on Wednesday and Thursday, saying that reforms would prevent those not loyal to Hong Kong from running for office.Some pointed out that multiple bills that impact people's livelihoods have been passed with more ease this year compared to in 2020, when pro-democracy lawmakers would at times filibuster or behave disruptively during meetings to stall the passage of bills that they disagreed with.The changes to Hong Kong’s elections come as Beijing further tightens control over the semi-autonomous city that saw months of anti-government protest and political strife in 2019.Authorities have arrested and charged most of the city’s outspoken pro-democracy advocates, such as Joshua Wong, who was a student leader of 2014 protests, as well as media tycoon Jimmy Lai, who founded the Apple Daily newspaper.China’s rubber-stamp parliament in March endorsed changes to the city’s electoral system, which then led to Hong Kong’s proposals.Also Read| Hong Kong media tycoon Jimmy Lai among five democracy activists jailedThey are the latest in a string of moves to ensure people elected to office or serving the city are loyal to Beijing. An amendment the legislature approved earlier this month requires the city’s over 400 district councilors — who mainly deal with municipal matters — to take an oath pledging loyalty to Hong Kong and to upholding its mini-constitution.The oath was previously required only of legislators and government officials such as the chief executive.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hong-kong-changes-electoral-law-reduces-direct-public-vote-101622105026662.html

His spokesman has said they "absolutely reject" Cummings' claims.With almost 128,000 deaths, the United Kingdom has the world's fifth highest official Covid-19 toll, far higher than the government's initial worst-case estimates of 20,000.One of the most damning allegations from Cummings was that Hancock's statement that the government had thrown a "protective ring around" care homes at the start of the pandemic was nonsense, and that instead people had been sent back from hospital who had contracted the coronavirus."No minister who lies to the public, especially not with the consequences that we have, should be in their post," Angela Rayner, Labour's deputy leader, told BBC TV.Johnson told parliament on Wednesday nobody could credibly accuse him or his government of complacency, and that the government had always sought to minimise loss of life."I think it is (wrong)," housing minister Robert Jenrick told BBC radio when asked about the allegation from Cummings that tens of thousands of people had died unnecessarily."You have to remember that we didn't have all of the facts at the time that the decisions were being taken. Nobody could doubt for one moment that the prime minister was doing anything other than acting with the best of motives with the information and the advice that was available to him."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-health-minister-to-face-parliament-after-claims-of-ineptitude-causing-unnecessary-covid-19-deaths-emerge-101622103860905.html
27-05-2021||World||UAE and Israel press ahead with ties after Gaza cease-fire||Israel's top diplomat to the United Arab Emirates attended a ceremony in Dubai on the grounds of the Arabian Peninsula's first permanent exhibition to commemorate the Holocaust. Hours earlier, he'd attended an event establishing a joint venture between an Israeli and Emirati company.The receptions on Monday were the clearest indication since a cease-fire in the Gaza Strip came into effect last week that the devastating 11-day war between Hamas and Israel and the violence that gripped Jerusalem and Al-Aqsa Mosque in the days preceding it have had no visible impact on the UAE's commitment to establishing deep ties with the state of Israel.“What we see here is the exact opposite of what we see in Gaza... What we see here in the whole normalization process is a departure from the past,” Israeli Ambassador Eitan Na’eh said.At least 254 Palestinians were killed, including 66 children, in the Gaza Strip during the war. Another 1,948 people were wounded, according to Gaza’s health ministry, which does not differentiate between fighters and civilians. Twelve people were killed in Israel, including an Israeli soldier and two children. The bombardment of the blockaded Gaza Strip destroyed about 1,000 homes and badly damaged hundreds more. Hospitals, clinics and main sewage and water lines were also damaged or destroyed.The violence, which erupted in the final days of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, angered citizens across Gulf Arab states, some of whom expressed support for Palestinians and opposition to Israel on social media or in limited street protests.The UAE government and its top officials publicly expressed concern over the violence in east Jerusalem and condemned the storming of Al-Aqsa Mosque compound by Israeli security forces, as well as Jewish settler efforts to evict Palestinian families from their homes in the city's Sheikh Jarrah neighborhood.It signaled a rare rebuke of Israel by the UAE since the two countries agreed to normalize relations last year. Some questioned whether the UAE would pause or halt the momentum of its strategic relationship with Israel, which included launching direct flights, cooperating on intelligence sharing, welcoming tens of thousands of Israeli tourists, investing in the Israeli gas sector and announcing a $10 billion investment fund for a range of Israeli sectors.After the violence in Jerusalem escalated into a war between Israel and Hamas on May 10 with Gaza’s ruling militant Hamas group firing rockets on Israel, the UAE muted its direct criticism of Israel and instead issued a statement calling on “all parties” to cease fighting. Hamas is an offshoot of the Muslim Brotherhood movement, which the UAE views as a threat.When asked about the nature of conversations with Emirati officials during the entirety of the recent conflict, Ambassador Na’eh — who is posted in Abu Dhabi — said the people he'd spoken with “showed a lot of understanding and curiosity."There “was no tension” in the conversations, he said. “To our ears, the UAE has called for the cessation of killing on both sides. They were mourning the death on both sides.”Na'eh spoke to The Associated Press from an open-air courtyard of the “Crossroads of Civilization," a privately-funded museum in Dubai that was hosting an event showcasing its Holocaust exhibition. The museum's founder is Ahmed Almansoori, a prominent Emirati figure who said the museum grounds were bestowed by Dubai ruler and UAE Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum.The event, attended by Jews, Israelis, the German ambassador to the UAE and others, included a solemn hymn of a Jewish prayer in Arabic for those departed. Young Jewish children took part in a candle lighting.The event focused on remembrance of the horrors of the Holocaust, the lessons to be learned from it and the importance of recognizing attempts at ethnic cleansing can happen and have happened since.As guests exited, joint Israeli-Emirati flag lapel pins were being sold for 20 dirhams (around $5). A large piece of artwork in the courtyard depicted an Emirati man in traditional garb with his arm on the shoulder of an Israeli as they laughed and shared coffee under the word “cousins" written in Arabic and Hebrew.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uae-and-israel-press-ahead-with-ties-after-gaza-ceasefire-101622101777306.html

"In the investigation of the origins of the pandemic it is really important to have transparency in order to build trust in the investigation results.""A comprehensive study"The Chinese embassy said it supports "a comprehensive study of all early cases of Covid-19 found worldwide and a thorough investigation into some secretive bases and biological laboratories all over the world."The Global Times tabloid, part of the ruling Communist Party's People's Daily newspaper group, said late on Wednesday that if the "lab leak theory" is to be further investigated, the United States should also allow investigators into its own facilities, including the lab at Fort Detrick.Also Read | Biden orders Covid origin hunt, says will press China for transparent probe: Full statement"Very clearly they are trying to internationalise their way out of the jam they are in," said Jamie Metzl, senior fellow at the Atlantic Council think tank, who has been campaigning for a new independent investigation.A joint China-WHO study published in March said that it was highly improbable that SARS-CoV-2 leaked from the lab, adding that it most likely spread from bats to humans via an as yet unidentified intermediary species.China has also continued to point to the possibility that Covid-19 originated in another country and entered via infected frozen food or through southeast Asian wildlife trade networks."The pandemic started in China," Metzl said. "Let's start with a full investigation there and expand as necessary. In short, this (statement from the embassy) is an outrageous insult to every person who has died from this terrible tragedy and their families."Huang of CFR said further investigations into the origins of Covid-19 were at an "impasse"."Ideally you want China to be more cooperative and more transparent," Huang said.

He has called for the industrial development of protected nature reserves and criticizing environmental enforcement.Bolsonaro had previously deployed the military in response to rising Amazon deforestation and fires, but pulled them out at the end of April. The expensive deployments over the course of 20 months failed to lower destruction https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/brazil-environment-military to levels seen prior to Bolsonaro's presidency.Brazil's official annual measurement of deforestation runs from August to July each year.Preliminary monthly data from the government's Inpe research institute shows Brazil has been on pace to potentially meet Mourao's 15% reduction during that period with deforestation falling in late 2020 and early 2021.But the data shows double-digit increases in March and April, while the most critical months for annual deforestation lie ahead.Deforestation peaks during the dry season from May to October, when it is easier for illegal loggers to access the forest to harvest valuable wood.Mourao also said he "deeply regretted" that Environment Minister Ricardo Salles was not present at a meeting of the country's Amazon Council on Wednesday at a time when "we need cooperation."Brazil is under international pressure, led by the United States, to show that it is serious about protecting the Amazon, with U.S. officials saying they expect a reduction in deforestation this year.

The resulting proteins could potentially trigger blood clot disorders in a small number of recipients, they suggest.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageScientists and U.S. and European drug regulators have been searching for an explanation for what is causing the rare but potentially deadly clots accompanied by low blood platelet counts, which have led some countries to halt or limit use of the AstraZeneca and J&J vaccines. Other scientists have suggested competing theories for the clotting condition.Johnson & Johnson, in an emailed statement said: "We are supporting continued research and analysis of this rare event as we work with medical experts and global health authorities. We look forward to reviewing and sharing data as it becomes available." AstraZeneca declined to comment.Researchers at the Goethe-University of Frankfurt and other sites explained in their paper that vaccines using a different technology known as messenger RNA (mRNA), such as those developed by BioNTech SE with partner Pfizer Inc and Moderna Inc, deliver the genetic material of the coronavirus spike protein only to fluid found inside cells, not to the nucleus of the cells. “All mRNA-based vaccines should represent safe products,” the paper said.The paper suggests that vaccine makers using adenovirus vectors could modify the sequence of the spike protein “to avoid unintended splice reactions and to increase the safety of these pharmaceutical products.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/research-ties-cold-viruses-used-to-deliver-covid-vaccine-to-rare-blood-clot-risk-101622075621131.html

27-05-2021||World||Climate crisis: Dutch court tells Shell to cut emissions||A Dutch court on Wednesday ordered Royal Dutch Shell to significantly deepen planned greenhouse gas emission cuts, in a landmark ruling that could pave the way for legal action against energy companies around the world.Shell immediately said it would appeal the court ruling, which comes amid rising pressure from investors, activists and governments on energy companies to shift away from fossil fuels and rapidly ramp up investments in renewable energy.At a court room in The Hague, judge Larisa Alwin read out a ruling which ordered Shell to reduce its planet warming carbon emissions by 45% by 2030 from 2019 levels.“The court orders Royal Dutch Shell, by means of its corporate policy, to reduce its CO2 emissions by 45% by 2030 with respect to the level of 2019 for the Shell group and the suppliers and customers of the group,” Alwin said.Earlier this year, Shell set out one of the sector’s most ambitious climate strategies. It has a target to cut the carbon intensity of its products by at least 6% by 2023, by 20% by 2030, by 45% by 2035 and by 100% by 2050 from 2016 levels.But the court said that Shell’s climate policy was “not concrete and is full of conditions...that’s not enough”.“The conclusion of the court is therefore that Shell is in danger of violating its obligation to reduce. And the court will therefore issue an order upon RDS,” the judge said.The court ordered Shell to reduce its absolute levels of carbon emissions, while Shell’s intensity-based targets could allow the company to grow its output in theory.“This is arguably the most significant climate change related judgment yet, which emphasises that companies and not just governments may be the target of strategic litigation which seeks to drive changes in behaviour,” said Tom Cummins, dispute resolution partner at law firm Ashurst.Shell said that it would appeal the verdict and that it has set out its plan to become a net-zero emissions energy company by 2050.Climate litigationThe lawsuit, which was filed by seven groups including Greenpeace and Friends of the Earth Netherlands, marks a first in which environmentalists have turned to the courts to try to force a major energy firm to change strategy.It was filed in April 2019 on behalf of more than 17,000 Dutch citizens who say Shell is threatening human rights as it continues to invest billions in the production of fossil fuels.“This is a huge win, for us and for anyone affected by climate change”, Friends of the Earth Netherlands director Donald Pols said.Shell, which is the world’s top oil and gas trader, has said its carbon emissions peaked in 2018, while its oil output peaked in 2019 and was set to drop by 1% to 2% per year.While its climate targets surpass those of its US rivals such as Exxon and Chevron, which ignore emissions from the combustion of its fuels, the Anglo-Dutch company’s spending will remain tilted towards oil and gas in the near future.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/climate-crisis-dutch-court-tells-shell-to-cut-emissions-101622074821987.html

The gunman was a Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority (VTA) employee, he said.Davis said he could not say how the gunman died or whether police officers fired their weapons at the scene.The shooting took place just before 7 am Pacific Time (1400 GMT) at a light rail yard run by the VTA near the city's main airport. A bomb squad was searching the yard after "at least one" explosive device was found, Davis said."A horrible tragedy has happened today and our thoughts and love go out to the VTA family," Glenn Hendricks, the chairman of the VTA board, said at the news conference.He said the shooting took place in a part of the yard where workers do maintenance on vehicles, and was not in the yard's operations and control center.San Jose, a city with about 1 million residents, lies at the heart of Silicon Valley, a global center of technological innovation and home of some of America's biggest tech companies."We are in a very dark moment," San Jose Mayor Sam Liccardo said at the news conference. "We will do everything possible to ensure this never happens again in our city."The Federal Bureau of Investigation said it had agents assisting at the crime scene.Mass shootings are common in the United States, which has one of the highest rates of gun ownership in the world.In March, eight people, including six women of Asian descent, were shot dead in a string of attacks at day spas in and around Atlanta, and less than a week later, 10 people were killed at a supermarket in Boulder, Colorado.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/very-dark-moment-8-killed-in-california-shooting-gunman-dead-101622052695296.html

27-05-2021||India||3 more Rafale jets land in India from France||Another batch of three Rafale fighter jets landed at the Ambala airbase on Thursday, taking the total number of Rafales in the Indian Air Force (IAF) inventory to 23.According to people aware of the development in Dassault, four aircraft were supposed to take off from Merignac-Bordeaux airbase in France on May 20, but only three could because of the unavailability of more mid-air refuellers in the UAE.Although four Rafale Omni role fighters were supposed to leave on May 20, the flights were rescheduled due to maintenance issues with the mid air refuellers. The fighters could only take off today due to long weekend holidays in France, the people cited above said.The IAF is all set to resurrect the 101 “Falcons of Chamb” squadron at Hashimara in West Bengal. It is expected that the full deliveries of 36 Rafale aircraft will be completed well before April 2022 as announced by Union defence minister Rajnath Singh in Parliament.With India likely to buy more front-line fighters to complete the stalled requirement of 126 medium multi-role combat aircraft (MMRCA), the French have not only offered hot engine technology to India but are also willing to jointly develop extended range and capability Hammer air-to-ground missile under the Atmanirbhar Bharat route. French engine manufacturer Safran has already conveyed the offer for jointly developing aircraft engines upto 100 Kilo Newton thrust as well as share the hot engine technology which Indian allies in the west are reluctant to share.France has also offered to share and jointly develop technology for longer range and heavier Highly Agile and Manoeuvrable Munition Extended Range (Hammer) missile which is currently part of the weapons package on the Indian Rafale. With a range of over 70 kilometres, the Hammer weapon can be guided on to the target using GPS, Inertial Navigation and Infra-red seeker with the capability to adjust to target location mid-air using maps for course correction. The latest version of this weapon has a 1,000 kilogram bomb and with laser guidance technology.India ordered 36 warplanes from France (equivalent of two squadrons) in 2016 for ₹59,000 crore under a government-to-government deal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/3-more-rafale-jets-land-in-india-from-france-101622136641072.html

Mariani MLA says he was target||Guwahati: Unidentified miscreants, suspected to be from Nagaland, fired at Assam legislator Rupjyoti Kurmi on Thursday when he went to look into allegations that some people from Nagaland had encroached on land along the Assam-Nagaland border.Assam chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma expressed shock at the incident and directed special DGP, Assam Police, GP Singh, to visit the spot and conduct a comprehensive inquiry. Rupjyoti Kurmi, the Congress MLA from Mariani in Jorhat district that also borders Nagaland, said the incident took place when he was touring the Disoi Valley reserve forest area, located around 5 km from Mariani town.“I had received information a few days back that people from the Nagaland side had encroached on an area which falls in my constituency. When I visited the spot on Thursday with local residents and some police personnel, there was unprovoked firing on us from the other side,” Kurmi said. “More than 20 rounds were fired at us and my personnel security officers and the policemen accompanying me retaliated in self-defence. Thankfully no one was injured. I urge the state government to take up the issue seriously and remove the encroachment from Assam soil,” he added.Police said the situation was under control and additional security personnel deployed in the area.Jorhat superintendent of police Ankur Jain said he visited the area on Wednesday to take stock of the situation. “A day earlier, forest personnel went there and uprooted some betel nut trees planted in the area. The area is a disputed territory between both states,” Jain said.Jain said local police personnel had requested lawmaker Rupjyoti Kurmi to avoid visiting the area but the Mariani MLA went ahead. He was accompanied by local residents including minors in violation of the Covid-19 restrictions in place in the state.The presence of a large number of people and security contingent in the disputed territory appears to have triggered a reaction.“As the area is disputed, people from the Nagaland side might have got worried seeing the crowd and policemen at the spot. Shots were fired in the air from the Nagaland side with muzzle-loaded rifles to scare away the Assam residents. Our security personnel also retaliated by firing blank shots. No one was injured in the incident,” said Jain.The Jorhat district authorities are in touch with their counterparts in Mokokchung district of Nagaland to ensure that the situation doesn’t go out of control.“It is unfortunate that an elected representative from Assam was fired upon by Naga miscreants when he went to inspect the spot where encroachment took place. The Assam government should conduct a thorough inquiry and ensure that all encroachments from Assam are removed,” said Congress legislature party leader Debabrata Saikia.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/shots-fired-in-air-on-assam-nagaland-border-mariani-mla-says-he-was-target-101622133422213.html

27-05-2021||India||Covid-19 vaccine: What states claim about crunch in supply||Many state governments in India have complained about a shortage in the Covid-19 vaccine supply and have urged the Centre to boost the supply. However, the Union government has denied any crunch in vaccine availability and has accused the states of not properly managing the vaccine stock.“Centre is allotting enough vaccines to the states in a transparent manner as per agreed guidelines. In fact, states are also being informed in advance of the vaccine availability. Vaccine availability is going to increase in near future and much more supply would be possible,” Dr VK Paul, member of the Niti Aayog, said earlier on Thursday in a press release, intended to address the myths regarding the vaccination program. “The behaviour of some of our leaders, who in spite of full knowledge of the facts on vaccine supply, appear on TV daily and create panic among the people is very unfortunate. This is not the time to play politics,” he further said, without mentioning any names.On May 25, the Union health ministry said that vaccine wastage in some states like Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh, Tamil Nadu, Madhya Pradesh and Jammu and Kashmir, is higher than what was prescribed. The Centre asked states to keep the wastage below 1 per cent.Also read | Home ministry extends national Covid-19 containment measures till June 30Here is a look at what some state governments have said about a shortage in the Covid-19 vaccine stocks:Rajasthan: State health minister Dr Raghu Sharma on Thursday said that vaccination has been stopped due to non-availability of vaccines and would be resumed upon receiving new supplies, news agency ANI reported.“For June, GoI has allotted 12.66 lakh vaccines (both Serum Institute & Bharat Biotech); with this combined quota, it won't be possible to vaccinate 3.25 crore beneficiaries as double dose and wastage makes vaccine requirement nearly 7 crore,” ANI quoted Dr Sharma as saying.Punjab: The state joined Haryana, Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand in denying the vaccine wastage data released by the Centre. Health minister Balbir Singh Sidhu on Thursday said that there is a shortage of vaccines in the state.“We don't have vaccines in the first place. The supply that is being made to us is not at par with our demand. It is a matter of concern. It is a 'hand to mouth' situation for us almost every day,” ANI quoted the minister as saying.Delhi: On Wednesday, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal in a tweet in Hindi said that there is a severe shortage of Covid-19 vaccines in the country and further said that had people been vaccinated at the right time, then the second wave could have been prevented.His government had also shut the vaccination centres for people in the 18 to 44 years age group for four days citing non availability of vaccines.Tamil Nadu: Chief minister MK Stalin, earlier in the day, wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi asking for complete operational freedom to the state government in running the Integrated Vaccine Complex (IVC), established by the HLL Bio-Tech Limited (HBL) in Chengalpet, Tamil Nadu.He said that the facility would enhance the country’s vaccine production capabilities and also stressed on the need to ramp up domestic production of vaccines.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid19-vaccine-what-states-claim-about-crunch-in-supply-101622131229470.html

Arvind Kumar works as a manager at one of the branches of Punjab National Bank's (PNB) in Bokaro.The PNB, however, denied Kumar's allegations and said he staged a drama to defame the bank, Livehindustan reported. It voted the bank to say that Kumar is facing probe over his NPA loan accounts.In a video of the incident, which has gone viral on social media, Kumar was seen reaching his branch office leaning on his wife and his son dragging the oxygen cylinder into the building with him, according to Livehindustan.The incident took place on Tuesday at Sector 4 branch of PNB. The bank said that Kumar's family members shot a video of the incident and posted it on social media. He is seen going to the cabin of his senior, and indulging in an argument with him, Livehindustan reported.According to Livehindustan, Kumar is heard saying in the video, "The doctors have said that it will take three months for me to be fully recovered because the infection has spread to my lungs. Why am I being harassed?"Kumar's family members said he resigned after his leave was not approved but it was not accepted, Livehindustan reported. They further claimed that the bank is threatening to deduct his salary, due to which he was forced to come to office in this condition, according to Livehindustan.Kumar was sent home after the verbal spat on Tuesday.The bank, meanwhile, said that this was a pressure tactic adopted by Kumar to drop charges against him and stop recovery proceedings of his NPA loan accounts.PNB said in a statement that Kumar remained absent from work for two years without authorisation, adding that no employee who contracts Covid-19 is denied leave in his own interest as well as others.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-positive-pnb-employee-reaches-office-with-oxygen-tank-says-denied-leave-101622127328723.html
27-05-2021||India||Home ministry extends national Covid-19 containment measures till June 30||The Union home ministry on Thursday extended the nationwide Covid-19 restrictions, put in place after its April 29 order, till June 30. The ministry said the restrictions are necessary to keep a check on the spread of the infection."The strict implementation of containment and other measures has led to a declining trend in the number of new and active cases, across States & UTs, barring some areas in the Southern and North-Eastern regions," the order by Union home secretary Ajay Bhalla said."I would like to highlight that in spite of the declining trend, the number of active cases presently is still very high. It is, therefore, important that containment measures may continue to be implemented strictly. Any relaxation by States/UTs, may be considered at an appropriate time, in a graded manner, after assessing the local situation, requirements and resources," the order further said.The home secretary asked states to work on strategy to bring down the number of Covid-19 cases.In the April 29 order, the MHA directed the states and Union territories to go for intensive and local containment measures in districts with a high number of Covid-19 cases to check the spread of the viral disease.It asked the states and Union territories to identify the districts Covid positivity rate was more than 10 per cent in the last one week.The MHA also asked the states to consider the containment measures, as conveyed in an advisory issued by the Union health ministry for immediate implementation based on an assessment of the situation.The health ministry said on Thursday that the second wave of Covid-19 is on the "downswing" in the country. It, however, highlighted that the current number of active cases is "still very high".NITI Aayog member (Health) V K Paul told a news conference here that the country continues to witness the stabilisation of the second wave in most parts, both by the number of cases and positivity rate, and despite a sustained and high overall testing coverage which is “reassuring”.India recorded 2,11,298 new cases of the infection, which took the nationwide tally to to 2,73,69,093.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/home-ministry-extends-national-covid-19-containment-measures-till-june-30-101622124997938.html
27-05-2021||India||'Completely baseless': Centre dismisses New York Times' report on India's Covid-19 toll||The government on Thursday dismissed as "completely baseless" a recent New York Times report on COVID-19 toll in India, saying it is not backed by any evidence.At a press conference, the Union health ministry said the report is absolutely false and based on "distorted estimates".The report titled "Just how big could India's true Covid toll be" estimated 600,000 deaths due to the infection in the country in a conservative scenario, 1.6 million estimated deaths in a more likely scenario and 4.2 million estimated deaths in a worse scenario.Dismissing the report, Health ministry Joint Secretary Lav Agarwal said, "It is completely baseless and absolutely false and not backed on any evidence." "The question does not arise that Covid-related deaths are getting concealed because since the beginning, our efforts have been that all cases and deaths are reported in a transparent manner. It is also necessary so that we can understand the overall trajectory of infection and what efforts have to be made so that required actions can be taken for it," he said.NITI Aayog Member (Health) V K Paul said the report is based on distorted estimates."The estimates have been done ad-hoc without any basis... reported cases are a part of a larger universe of total infections in any country," he said.He said the problem in the analysis arises "when certain number is thrown as mortality rate out of that infection". "If we go with our sero survey, then infection related mortality is 0.05 per cent and actual mortality is 1.1 per cent... They are taking 0.3 per cent - 6 times - on what basis has it been decided that it is 0.3 per cent of that large infection number - no basis at all," Paul said. He further said that if the same method is used, then by that estimate New York reported 50,000 deaths in May."I make it six times, it is 90,000 deaths and if I do it 12 times, it is 1.75 lakh deaths but they don't say that, they say it is 16,000. What I mean to say here is this is a distorted estimate for mortality. For infection estimate, they used our data only from January which can still be acceptable," Paul said. "On what basis this group pulls out infection mortality rate of 0.3 per cent in one scenario and 0.15 another scenario and 0.6 in another scenario? On what basis, this is just an assumption and a feeling of some people and this is something that should have been not published particularly in so called prestigious publication. I submit that we have a strong mortality tracking system which has stood the test of time," he said.Paul said there might be deaths where testing was not done but "outrageous factor suddenly without any basis and just on assumption is not fair and we don't accept it".||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/completely-baseless-centre-on-new-york-times-report-on-india-s-covid-19-toll-101622124318671.html
27-05-2021||India||In BJP leader’s unusual advice to IMA, a biting critique of yoga guru Ramdev||Dr Sanjay Jaiswal, the top Bharatiya Janata Party leader in Bihar, on Thursday, waded into the continuing row between the Indian Medical Association and yoga guru Ramdev, advising the association of doctors to mostly ignore the guru’s offensive against allopathic medicines.“Don’t waste your years of education and energy in useless discussion and instead concentrate on our noble profession,” said the doctor-turned-politician, a lawmaker from Paschim Champaran and Bihar BJP president in a Facebook post.“Concentrating on our profession would be the most befitting service to our innumerable colleagues who have lost their lives attending to their duties in the midst of the Covid-19 pandemic,” said the Bihar BJP president.Baba Ramdev has been in the eye of a fresh controversy when he questioned the efficacy of allopathic medicines in treating the dreaded coronavirus.“Ramdev is a yoga guru. Nobody can question his mastery of yoga. But he is certainly not a Yogi. A Yogi is one who has control over all his senses and brain. What he has done for yoga is comparable to what Coca Cola did for beverages. Indians have been, for ages, consuming Shikanji and thandai but after the advent of the soft drink giant, every home seems to be stocked with bottles of Pepsi and Coke”, Jaiswal said in his post.“There is no need to reply to all baseless talks. If you speak more, you start giving importance to others,” he advised the IMA.Jaiswal, who is among the first prominent BJP leaders to have criticised Ramdev for sparking off the controversy, however, batted for yoga.“It (yoga) is important as it keeps you disease-free but this is not a system of medicine,” he opined.He, however, asserted that every system of medicine “has its own limitations” which held true for yoga as well, a sophisticated form of physiotherapy which can help us ward off illnesses but can create problems if we take to it to cure existing ailments”.Dr Shahjanand Kumar Singh, IMA national president (elect), said Ramdev shouldn’t demoralise doctors who have done yeoman’s service to treat patients during the ongoing pandemic.“He (Ramdev) should stick to yoga and his Patanjali products,” said Dr Singh, adding that every state unit of IMA was contemplating legal action against the yoga guru.The IMA has already written to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, asking that Ramdev be booked under sedition charges for allegedly spreading misinformation on vaccination and challenging government protocols for treatment of Covid-19 and its Uttarakhand chapter has sent a ₹1,000-crore defamation notice to the yoga guru.According to the IMA’s complaint to the PM, Ramdev was seen claiming in a viral video that 10,000 doctors have died in the country despite taking both doses of the vaccines. The IMA said such statements were persuading people not to get the Covid-19 vaccines against the national interest of overcoming the pandemic, IMA said. “This in our opinion is a clear-cut case of sedition in addition to causing irreversible damage to the national interest and the poor masses of this country,” read the letter by IMA.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ramdev-is-yoga-guru-not-a-yogi-bihar-bjp-chief-s-biting-advice-to-ima-101622123699946.html

Prima facie, these statements are not only mendacious, but designed to impede a lawful inquiry by a private enterprise,” news agency ANI quoted Delhi Police officials as saying. “Twitter, being a public platform, must lead in demonstrating transparency in its functioning and should bring clarity into subject matters of public domain. Since the matter has been put in public domain, it’s important to set the record straight on tendentious statement made,” the officials were further quoted as saying.Accusing the social media giant of purporting to be an investigating, as well as adjudicating judicial authority, they also said that the police is the only legal entity to investigate, as duly laid down in the law, while courts are the only legal entity that can adjudicate.The officials further clarified that the Delhi Police registered a preliminary inquiry on the complaints filed by a representative of the Congress and, therefore, efforts by Twitter to portray it as a First Information Report (FIR) filed at the behest of the Government of India are “wholly and completely incorrect.”Also Read | After Delhi Police’s visit to Twitter office, Rahul Gandhi tweets about truthOn the alleged toolkit, the officials said that the declaration by Twitter that the toolkit is “manipulated media,” clearly shows that it was aware of facts of the case, and was hence asked to join the probe to provide the information it possesses.“Twitter’s latest statement is devised to seek dubious sympathy when they themselves not only refuse to comply with the law of the land but also claim possession of material evidence but also refuse to share it with duly recognised legal authority,” the police officials said further.The statement put out by the San Francisco-headquartered company on Thursday morning was over the visits by officials from the Delhi Police special cell to its offices in Delhi and Gurugram in connection with the alleged toolkit on May 24, as well as over the ongoing controversy on the IT Rules, 2021.

The people of Lakshadweep deserve a developmental vision that respects their way of life and reflects their aspirations,” Gandhi said. He cited Lakshadweep’s pristine natural beauty and said its unique confluence of cultures has drawn people for generations. He added the custodians of its heritage seek to safeguard the archipelago for posterity.“However, their future is threatened by the anti-people policies announced by the administrator of Lakshadweep, Shri Praful Khoda Patel. The administrator has unilaterally proposed sweeping changes without duly consulting elected representatives or the public. The people of Lakshadweep are protesting against these arbitrary actions.”Also Read | Lakshadweep MP Mohammed Faizal seeks recall of administrator Praful PatelGandhi referred to various orders Patel has passed since December 2020. He added the Lakshadweep Development Authority Regulation undermines safeguards pertaining to land ownership, dilutes environmental regulations for certain activities, and limits legal resources available to affected persons.He said the Prevention of Anti-Social Activities Regulation, Lakshadweep Animal Preservation Regulation, and end on restrictions on the sale of alcohol was a deliberate assault on the cultural fabric of the local community. Gandhi accused Patel of destroying the heritage of the archipelago, harassing its people, and imposing arbitrary rules.Patel has faced allegations of trying to “saffronise” the archipelago, where almost 95% of the population is Muslim.The Bharatiya Janata Party’s Lakshadweep unit president Mohammad Kasim on Tuesday joined the chorus of protests against the regulations.

Before China’s intervention, the paper insisted, Tibet was a “wretched and backward feudal serfdom” that was “doomed to die out”.But China does not recognise the CTA and hasn’t held talks with the Dalai Lama’s representatives since 2010.On day one in the CTA’s lead role, Penpa Tsering, who has spoken about his fears of cultural genocide in Tibet, sounded a conciliatory note, vowing to resolutely tread the path of Middle Way advocated by the Dalai Lama to reach out to the Chinese government to find a “mutually beneficial, negotiated, non-violent solution to the Sino-Tibet conflict”.Tsering, 54, was administered the oath of office and secrecy by the Tibetan Supreme Justice Commissioner Sonam Norbu Dagpo in presence of his predecessor Lobsang Sangay and spiritual leader the Dalai Lama, who attended the event virtually.In his inaugural address, Tsering promised that he will use all his energies to find a lasting solution for the Sino-Tibet conflict and the welfare of the Tibetan people.Till it is done, he said the Kashag (cabinet) shall represent the voices of Tibetans inside Tibet and optimise the global advocacy efforts. “We shall not dither from pointing out the gross mistakes of the Chinese government’s policies and programs and seek to redress, withdraw or amend the wrong policies,” Tsering promised.In future, the CTA President said, if and when the need arises to bring novelty in our approach in tune with the changing situation, it would be done in accordance with the democratic norms and consulting all important institutions.“We will be responsible to the Tibetan Parliament-in-exile and provide all necessary assistance to the three autonomous bodies, work out with NGOs irrespective of region, religion and political position and maintain transparency,” he said in a speech that focused on the immediate concerns of running the administration.In the days ahead of his oath ceremony, Tsering has been outspoken to counter China and the continuing effort in Beijing to choose the next Dalai Lama. How will they, he asked at an event earlier this month, because communist leaders don’t even believe in religion whereas the succession of the Tibetan spiritual leader is a deeply religious matter.Tsering told news agency Reuters earlier this month that he would continue to use all ways and means to reach out to the Chinese government. “We’ll use all ways and means to reach out to the Chinese government,” said Tsering. “If the Chinese don’t respond to us the only way we can keep the issue alive is to reach out to the international community,” he said, underlining that there was an urgent threat of “cultural genocide” in Tibet, and the international community must stand up to China ahead of the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/new-tibetan-president-offers-to-send-team-to-china-to-verify-white-paper-claim-101622119500566.html
27-05-2021||India||'Twitter's statement on IT rules an attempt to defame India to hide own follies': Govt||The Centre on Thursday lashed out at micro-blogging website Twitter, saying its statement on the country's new IT rules is an attempt to dictate its terms to the world’s largest democracy. The statement has been posted on Koo, the India-made social media platform, which gained traction earlier this year after the long-standing spat between the Centre on Twitter started around January-February.Also Read: Twitter says dialogue with Govt will continueThe government said that the unfortunate statement issued by Twitter is totally baseless, false and an attempt to defame India to hide their own follies. It asked Twitter to "stop beating around the bush and comply with the laws of the land".In the statement, the Centre strongly controverted the claims made by Twitter. "Twitter refuses to comply with those very regulations in the Intermediary Guidelines on the basis of which it is claiming a safe harbour protection from any criminal liability in India," the government statement said."India has a glorious tradition of free speech and democratic practices dating back centuries. Protecting free speech in India is not the prerogative of only a private, for-profit, foreign entity like Twitter," it added.The strongly-worded statement said that the only instance of scuttling free speech on Twitter is Twitter itself and its opaque policies. "As a result of this, people’s accounts are suspended and tweets deleted arbitrarily without recourse."Also Read: Amid controversy with WhatsApp, RS Prasad defends digital media guidelinesThe government also said that law making and policy formulation is the "sole prerogative of the sovereign" and a social media platform like Twitter has no locus in dictating what should India’s legal policy framework should be."The government also wishes to emphatically assure that representatives of social media companies including Twitter are and will always remain safe in India and there is no threat to their personal safety and security," the Centre said.In the latest round of the ongoing spat, Twitter said in a statement that it is concerned by recent events "regarding our employees in India and the potential threat to freedom of expression for the people we serve".The social network reiterated its commitment to India as a vital market, but criticised new IT rules and regulations that it said "inhibit free, open public conversation."In the new digital rules, social media companies like Facebook, WhatsApp and Twitter have been asked to identify within 36 hours the origin of a flagged message as well as conduct additional due diligence, including the appointment of a chief compliance officer, nodal contact person and resident grievance officer.Also Read: WhatsApp moves court against government of India. Here’s what it saidAccording to Twitter, the company is particularly concerned about the requirement to make an individual (the compliance officer) criminally liable for content on the platform, the requirements for proactive monitoring, and the blanket authority to seek information about its users.This, it said, represents dangerous overreach that is inconsistent with open, democratic principles.Twitter said it will continue to have dialogue with the government on the new rules.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/twitters-statement-on-it-rules-totally-baseless-false-govt-101622119119620.html
27-05-2021||India||Chhattisgarh activists reject police theory on Silger firing||Ten days after police firing killed three tribals protesting against a Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) camp at Silger village in Chhattisgarh’s Sukma, a two-member fact- finding team of activists said they didn’t find any evidence to support police claim that an armed group of 3,000 agitators, including Maoist cadres, took over the peaceful protests on May 17 and intended to burn down the CRPF camp, leaving the forces with no choice but to open fire.Human Rights activist Bela Bhatia and social activist Jean Dreze, who formed the fact-finding team, issued a press release on Thursday and said the locals were opposed to the CRPF camp fearing harassment.Three people were killed and many others were injured on Monday afternoon when security forces fired on protestors, agitating against the CRPF camp, opened on May 12 near Silger village - a Maoist stronghold along the border of Sukma-Bijapur districts.Chhattisgarh Police maintains that the CRPF camp was established in Silger village on 12th of May to mainly facilitate the Basaguda -Jagargunda road construction among other developmental works since the axis is an important corridor for Maoists in south Bastar region and a stronghold of People’s Liberation Guerrilla Army (PLGA) Battalion number 1, led by dreaded Maoist commander Hidma. PLGA is the armed wing of the Communist Party of India (Maoist), a banned organisation in India.The activists claim that the Silger camp was set up in the dead of night at around 3 am on May 12, without informing the villagers and about 40-50 of them were dispersed by force when they protested against the camp the next day. “On 14 May, about a thousand adivasis [tribals] of five nearby gram panchayats started a mass protest which went from strength to strength in the following days. Mass protests continue to this day,” the fact-finding report claimed.The report added that the protests swelled between May 14 and 16.“People shouted slogans demanding the removal of the camp. Every day the police tried to disperse them, sometimes with lathis, sometimes with “mirchi pataka” or tear gas. Dozens of protestors sustained minor injuries... and returned to their villages for local treatment,” the activists alleged.They cite witnesses to claim that the number of protestors might have reached 10,000 on May 17 and some of them started pelting stones after lathicharge, tear gassing and firing in the air by the security forces sent most running for cover.“Some protestors are said to have shouted that they would burn the police vehicles, but this did not happen,” the activists press release claims.“By that time the forces were on both sides of the road with protesters in the middle. Soon police firing started. Three protestors were killed on the spot (one of them, Uika Pandu – also called Murali – of Timmapuram village, who was hit in the head, was only 16 or 17 years old), at least another three had bullet injuries and as many as 40 were injured in one way or another,” the activists alleged.One survivor from Pusbaka village, who is now in the ICU in Bijapur, was shot in the back, the activists’ report claimed.The activists further said that the police theory that the protests were joined by armed cadres of Maoists who were looking to burn the camp down was “bizarre”.“This bizarre story does not fit with any of the testimonies we have heard. By that time [the protestors gathered] the camp had a huge presence of heavily armed personnel and there was no point in trying to attack it,” the report claimed.Explaining the reasons behind the protest against the camp, the report stated, “The main reason for people’s opposition to the camp is that they are afraid of harassment (eg, searches, beatings, sexual assault, fabricated cases, fake encounters and such).”To back their contention the activists claimed that an unarmed civilian named Midiam Masa was killed at Tolevarti village on May 22 near another new CRPF camp in the area while gathering mangoes with two other villagers.”Bastar region’s police chief (IGP), Sunderaj P refuted the claims made in the so called fact-finding report and said Silger villagers were properly briefed about the nature of the camp on May 13 by police officials and executive magistrate and they returned convinced with the response.“Meanwhile the Maoists were planning to destabilize this camp to protect their corridor. So the Naxals mobilized their frontal organization members and Militia cadres from the surrounding area and sent [them] to Silger on 17th of May with a conspiracy to instigate violence and launch an attack on the security forces deployed in the Silger camp,” the IGP said.He further claimed that some armed cadres hidden in the jungles attacked the camp triggering retaliation from the security forces.“On 17th of May, when the crowd started pelting stones and attacked the troops, utmost restraint was maintained by the security forces. The executive magistrate repeatedly issued warnings to maintain peace and order, which was ignored by the miscreants, who were basically the militia cadres acting on the behest of Maoist leadership,” the IGP said.He added that the security forces retaliated only after they were attacked by the armed cadres. He added that the three bodies recovered from the spot could not be identified by the villagers for two days since they were outsiders. He also refuted claims that one of the deceased was a minor.He further alleged that the Maoists compelled the villagers to bring all the three bodies to Silger village and were planning to cremate them as per the Maoist way of cremation but gave up when relatives insisted on cremating them in their own villages.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/chhattisgarh-activists-reject-police-theory-on-silger-firing-101622119259355.html

He is also expected to visit and hold meetings with officials in two affected states besides undertaking an aerial survey of the cyclone-hit areas on Friday.“About 106 teams of NDRF [National Disaster Response Force] were deployed … in West Bengal and Odisha that rescued more than 1,000 persons and removed more than 2,500 trees/poles that had fallen & obstructed the roads … Army and Coast Guard also rescued marooned persons, while Navy & Air Force were on the alert,” Modi was informed at the Thursday’s meeting, according to a statement.Modi highlighted the importance of preliminary weather reports as officials told him that accurate forecasting helped in evacuations in a timely manner and ensured the minimal loss of human life. He was told the damage assessment was being carried out and much of it was inflicted due to flooding. Modi was told power and telecom services have been restored in most of the affected areas.Also Read | Cyclone Yaas: 8 lakh people affected in JharkhandModi noted the active role played by central and states agencies and advised them to ensure an early return to normal life in these affected areas.

27-05-2021||India||In a crematorium, a silent Hindu-Muslim bond||Suneel, 56, and Aqeel, 20, both Kanpur-born, led ordinary, mundane lives. Suneel is deeply wedded to the idea of Sanathan Dharam, eternal duty, and religious practices come naturally to him. He lost his father as a five-year-old and studied through his early years to join a transport network.Aqeel, only 20, passed out of Class 12 and joined one of Kanpur’s many tanneries. The ₹8,000 he brought home every month, greatly supplemented the family’s income.The two met for the first time at the unlikeliest of places: Kanpur’s Bhairoghat crematorium. Both had volunteered to work with Madad Guru, a wing of Divya Prakash Sewa Samiti, an NGO that has lent its shoulder during the Covid-19 pandemic. Its 70 volunteers are cremating bodies, cooking food for the poor and distributing medical kits in rural areas.Suneel and Aqeel have no time to chat but have a deep bond that only grief can bring. They have carried hundreds of dead bodies and quietly laid them on the pyre.“There is some respite now. We are cremating 30 to 40 bodies everyday but in April, when the second wave hit like a tsunami, we have had rows and rows of bodies lying at the gates of Bhairoghat,” says Suneel.According to Ayush Gaur, founder of Madad Guru, “At the peak, we had 100 to 120 bodies per day. They just kept arriving in ambulances and we had to distribute tokens.”Some days, the token was kept on the sheets the bodies came wrapped in. They came straight from hospitals and often without family members. Rarely did two people from a family accompany a dead relative. The fear of contracting the virus forced many to bid farewell at the hospital itself. They would come the following day to collect the ashes.Also Read | Covid-19 and the disease of inequalitySuneel and Aqeel worked tirelessly. They had no time to talk; unburden themselves. Each body needed at least 250 kilograms of wood, some ghee and as Suneel said, “two yards of coffin cloth.” The families would not come but sometimes gave directions on a video call. “Make sure the last rites are done in accordance with Hindu traditions,’’ was a common request.A daughter came with her mother’s body. There was no one to help shift it from the tempo in which it arrived. The driver flatly refused but the volunteers stepped in.Disposing the dead has become a drill. Take the body out of the ambulance. Lay it in the queue. Build a pyre. Carry the body into Bhairoghat. Place it on the platform around pyres that were already aflame. Add some ghee and some straw, so the fires crackle and burn quicker. Pyres are usually not lit after sunset. They had to be laid to rest the day they came.There are no priests in Bhairoghat. Suneel knows the rituals. He is now a part of the Sanathan Dharam Ayog Mandal. What he was not prepared for and still finds difficult to accept is the fact that bodies were just abandoned. “I am anguished that family members were not willing to walk the last few steps for the last rites.”The anguish is deep but it has to wait. There is work to be done. The days go by in a haze. It’s the lengthening shadows of the night that Aqeel has problems with. Initially, he had trouble falling asleep. The long line of bodies was an image imprinted in his mind. “That’s all I could think of. Bodies of all ages, fastened in plastic sheets. But that was in the beginning. Now I’m so tired when I reach home, I just fall asleep.”Aqeel reaches every morning, wears a PPE suit, secures his mask firmly over his nose and mouth and gets down to work. He carries body after body, with help from another volunteer. “At least two people are needed to carry one body,” he said. A quick break when possible was taken, to quickly eat some food, has a sip of water. A restaurateur has loaned Madad Guru his kitchen where other volunteers are busy cooking and packing food.Also Read | India runs the risk of losing its pharma edgeFood is distributed to many. To its volunteers, the ambulance drivers, family members, junior doctors and the hungry. “Anyone who needs it,” says Gaur, whose daily schedule now entails driving into rural areas to distribute medical kits comprising masks, sanitisers and paracetamol tablets.Aqeel and Suneel usually eat after sunset. By then, their PPE suits are covered with soot and ash. They have no appetite but tell each other that eat they must. Last year, during the first Corona wave, both were involved with distributing food at the highway, for passing migrants.Both of them got calls from Madad Guru in end-March this year, asking if they were willing to volunteer again, this time at the crematorium.“If not now, then when? I consider myself lucky to have got this opportunity,” asks Suneel.Aqeel has no problem answering the question either. “Humanity demands that I lend my shoulder,” he says. He will return to the tannery when it reopens. The NGO has become an extension of his family. “The tannery is not paying me but when I need money, I get ₹1,000 to ₹2,000 from the NGO,’’ he says. His family knows he’s doing social service but doesn’t know he’s helping at the crematorium.Do they remember how many pyres they lit?“Hundreds,” says Suneel.“I didn’t light any pyre. Only helped carry the bodies,” says Aqeel.Why?“Because I’m a Muslim,” he says.“You are human,’ says Suneel.(Both wanted to be mentioned only by their first names)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-a-crematorium-a-silent-hindu-muslim-bond-101622119139657.html

She further said that the World health Organization (WHO) has no recommendation on vaccinating children, and no country is conducting these tests."As of now, no country in the world is giving vaccines to children. WHO has no recommendation on vaccinating children. Trials on children in India are going to begin soon. The decision is to be taken by scientists after data is available based on trials," Sitharaman tweeted.The finance minister also shared a release where the government busted seven myths around its handling of the coronavirus disease situation. Sitharaman added a clarification given by Niti Aayog member Dr VK Paul where he said that trials on children are at lower priority because of the risk involved."When any drug/vaccine is discovered, typically it is first sorted out in the adult population because you do not want to risk children," Dr Paul said in the tweet thread shared by Sitharaman in which he is speaking to news agency ANI."If we go with the paradigm of deaths as a public health objective, it's a lower priority," he further said.Amid a debate around inoculating children for the deadly infection, Dr Paul said that the vaccine developed by American pharmaceutical giant Pfizer can be administered to the younger population.He also said that the government has been pursuing Pfizer, Johnson & Johnson and Moderna since mid-2020 for the earliest possible imports, and has even waived local trials for well-established foreign vaccine makers.Pfizer has told Indian authorities that its vaccine is suitable for everyone aged 12 years or above and can be stored for a month at 2-8 degrees Celsius.The company, which has offered 5 crore doses to India between July and October, recently held a series of interactions with Indian government authorities.It shared with authorities the most recent data points regarding efficacy trials and approvals for its vaccine in various countries and by the WHO.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/trials-of-covid-19-vaccine-on-children-to-begin-soon-in-india-sitharaman-101622114873436.html

According to officials, the aircraft was flying towards Aligarh when a “technical glitch” forced the pilots to make an emergency landing.The instructor and trainee pilot were both not injured in the incident.“It was a two-seater trainer aircraft which made an emergency landing on the Yamuna Expressway. The trainer and the trainee are safe. They landed because of a technical glitch,” said Mathura’s Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) Dr Gaurav Grover.Elaborating further, Lokesh Bhati, the in-charge of Naujheel police station in Mathura, said, “Teams have arrived from Delhi and Aligarh to look out for the technical glitch that forced the aircraft to make an emergency landing. The trainer, Jagrath Yadav, landed the aircraft at around 12:30pm. Upon landing, the two pilots contacted the authorities, informing them of the accident.”Bhati further said that the aircraft was parked on a side of the expressway and, as such, it did not present any hurdle in traffic movement. The aircraft, whose landing spot falls within limits of the Naujheel police station, took off from Narnaul in Haryana and is owned by a private company, the Station House Officer (SHO) informed.The 165-km long Yamuna Expressway was inaugurated in August 2012 by then-Uttar Pradesh chief minister Akhilesh Yadav, and passes through Mathura and Aligarh.

He underlined vaccines are in limited supply globally, and companies have their own priorities, game plans and compulsions in allocating stocks. “They also give preference to countries of their origin just as our own vaccine makers have done unhesitatingly for us.”Paul said the Centre proactively eased the entry of vaccines approved by the US Food and Drug Administration, European Medicines Agency, UK’s Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency, Japan’s Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency, and World Health Organisation’s Emergency Use Listing into India in April. “These vaccines will not need to undergo prior bridging trials. The provision has now been further amended to waive off the trial requirement altogether for the well-established vaccines manufactured in other countries,” he said.Also Read | Politics behind US call for coronavirus origin probe, says ChinaBridging trials refer to supplementary trials performed in a new region or country to get more clinical data on efficacy, safety and dose regimen.States like Delhi have asked the Centre to procure vaccines and distribute them across the country as many of them have failed to get global vaccine makers to supply shots to them directly amid a shortage of jabs after a widened inoculation drive.The government in April said it will allow certain foreign-made vaccines to be rolled out and conduct parallel bridging clinical trials after they get the authorisation instead of requiring them to conduct bridging trials prior to seeking approval. It had said coronavirus vaccines cleared for use in the US, the UK, the European Union, and Japan will get fast-track approval in India to boost the pandemic response when India was recording the world’s biggest surge in infections.Paul said as soon as Pfizer indicated vaccine availability, the Central government and the company began working together. “Multiple rounds of discussions have happened with Pfizer, J&J & Moderna,” he said. “The government offered all assistance to have them supply and/or manufacture their vaccines in India,” said Paul in response to questions about India’s Covid-19 vaccine strategy.Paul said that no application of any foreign manufacturer for approval was currently pending with the drugs controller. “However, it is not that their vaccines are available in free supply. We need to understand that buying vaccines internationally is not similar to buying off the shelf items.”Paul said the Centre has remained engaged with all the major international vaccine manufacturers from mid-2020 and as a result of its efforts, Russian made Sputnik V vaccine trials got accelerated. He added with timely approval, Russia has sent two tranches of vaccines and accomplished tech transfer to Indian companies that would start manufacturing very soon. “We reiterate our request to all international vaccine makers to come and make in India – for India and for the world.”He referred to allegations that the Centre did not approve vaccines available globally, Paul said regulatory modifications were specially made to facilitate entry of foreign Covid-19 vaccine manufacturers. He added that included the condition of submitting local bridging studies while applying for emergency use authorisation in India.Pfizer is believed to have offered 50 million doses to India between July and October this year and sought indemnification among other regulatory waivers to export vaccines. In a statement to HT, the company said it remains committed to continuing its engagement with India towards making the Pfizer BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine available for use in the country. “Since the ongoing discussions are confidential, we cannot provide any further comments.”Paul denied allegations that the Centre was not doing enough to ramp up domestic Covid-19 vaccine production. “The central government is playing the role of an effective facilitator to enable more companies to produce vaccines from early 2020. There is only one Indian company [Bharat Biotech] which has the IP [intellectual property]. The government...has ensured that 3 other companies/plants will start production of Covaxin apart from enhancing Bharat Biotech’s own plants, which have increased from 1 to 4.”Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin production is also being ramped from about 10 million doses per month to nearly 100 million doses by October.Covishield and Covaxin were the first two shots to be approved in the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/local-trials-for-covid-shots-scrapped-to-fast-track-imports-101622114314117.html
27-05-2021||India||Covid-19 vaccine supply hasn't closed, says Dr VK Paul||Niti Aayog (health) member Dr VK Paul on Thursday said that Covid-19 vaccine supply hasn't closed. "To say Covid-19 vaccine supply has closed isn't true. Truth is that out of the available production, a distinct part is available to non-government channels, including state governments, to be used for vaccinating people of their state according to flexible approach by state governments," Dr Paul told news agency ANI.He further said that it has been found out that now Pfizer can be administered to the younger population. "When any drug/vaccine is discovered, typically it is first sorted out in the adult population because you do not want to risk children....It has been found out now that Pfizer can be administered to the younger population," said the NITI Aayog member.On vaccination for children, Dr Paul said that Covaxin has received permission and it will start pediatric trial. "I think they are going all the way to 2 years of age in systematic way. I have been told Serum Institute of India (SII) wants to begin pediatric trial of Novavax," he added.Paul further said that the World Health Organization (WHO) hasn't given any recommendation yet to cover pediatric population in general as any illness in that population group is extremely mild. "If we go with paradigm of deaths as a public health objective, it's at lower priority," he said.The Niti Aayog member added that they will have to prepare to give 1 crore doses in a day. "It will be possible in few weeks, we will have to prepare. We made possible 43 lakh doses in a day. We should bring it up to 73 lakh in next 3 weeks. We should make a system to achieve it," he said.This comes after Pfizer told the Centre that their Covid-19 vaccine can be administered to everyone aged 12 and above and can also be stored at 2-8 degree temperature for a month, sources told news agency ANI.The Pfizer vaccine which was created in collaboration with German biotechnology firm BioNTech is the only vaccine currently being administered to children in few countries.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid19-vaccine-supply-hasn-t-closed-says-dr-vk-paul-101622111211222.html
27-05-2021||India||Those who went to Delhi sent back with an answer, says K’taka CM Yediyurappa||Karnataka chief minister BS Yediyurappa on Thursday said that his only priority was to deal with the Covid-19 pandemic and had no reason to indulge in other matters.“I only have Covid in front of me. Controlling Covid and people’s welfare are my only priorities.If someone went to someplace, they have been sent back with an answer,” Yediyurappa told reporters in Bengaluru on Thursday.The statement comes a day after at least two Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leaders, including one minister, went to Delhi, purportedly to meet the top brass in connection with a possible change in leadership in the state.The clamour for a leadership change in Karnataka has grown louder with increasing instances of conflict within the BJP and the Yediyurappa-led government. The defeat in the Maski bypolls and wafer thin margin of victory in Belagavi Lok Sabha by-elections has also gone against the 78-year-old chief minister.At least two BJP legislators aware of the developments indicated a possible change post the calming of the pandemic. Among the leaders who had rushed to Delhi was CP Yogeshwara, member of the Karnataka legislative council, and minister for tourism, ecology and environment. Yogeshwara claimed on Thursday that he went to Delhi “for personal reasons”.“I keep going to Delhi and can’t tell everything to the media. I will share more in the coming days,” he said in Bengaluru.Also Read | Centenarian freedom fighter who spoke truth to powerHowever, he did reiterate that the BJP in Karnataka works like a coalition government with the other two political parties -- an apparent reference to Congress and Janata Dal (Secular)-- appearing to be in power. “The day I became an MLC also I said that it does not appear as a pure BJP government. It appears to be a three-party government,” he said.In 2018 assembly elections, Yogeshwara lost his seat against HD Kumaraswamy of the JD(S) in Channapatna. However, he was able to secure a seat in the legislature, apparently for his role in securing the support of the 17 turncoat legislators who defected to the BJP, leading to the collapse of the Kumaraswamy-led JD(S)-Congress coalition government in the state.Meanwhile, other ministers in the BJP tried to rally behind Yediyurappa, dismissing any speculation of a leadership change. MP Renukacharya, the BJP legislator from Honnali and political secretary to the chief minister, came down heavily on Yogeshwara for his apparent attempt to seek a leadership change.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/those-who-went-to-delhi-sent-back-with-an-answer-says-k-taka-cm-yediyurappa-101622113594297.html
27-05-2021||India||India scraps local trials for Covid vaccines to fast-track imports||The Centre on Thursday scrapped local trials for "well-established" foreign coronavirus disease (Covid-19) vaccines to fast-track imports, news agency Reuters reported.The government said it was in talks with American pharmaceutical giant Pfizer for "earliest possible" imports of its vaccine and that it had also had discussions with Johnson & Johnson and Moderna.Last month, India pledged to fast-track approvals for foreign vaccines but its insistence on local trials was a key reason for stalled discussions with Pfizer."The provision has now been further amended to waive the trial requirement altogether for the well-established vaccines manufactured in other countries," Reuters quoted the government saying in a statement. This was earlier announced by Niti Aayog (health) member Dr VK Paul in a statement, which said that the vaccine approved by the US Food and Drug Administration, European Medicines Agency and other reputed bodies, will not be required to undergo prior bridging trial and trials for “well-established” vaccines have been waived altogether.India started its nationwide vaccination programme on January 16 this year after the country's drugs regulator DCGI approved two vaccines - AstraZeneca's Covishield and Covaxin made by local firm Bharat Biotech. Russia-made Sptunik V is also available in the market now.But supplies are far short of the millions of doses the world's second-most populous country needs. Many state governments have flagged the issue to the Centre, with chief ministers claiming the Centre is not doing enough to procure vaccines from abroad.The government countered the allegation, calling it a myth. Dr Paul said on Thursday said that the government is engaged in discussions and deliberations with many pharmaceutical giants. The government even offered assistance for the domestic production of their vaccines. However, vaccines being in “limited supply globally” has hampered their efforts, Dr Paul said in the statement.Though India has tremendously increased the daily testing and vaccination of its population, just about 3% of the country's 1.3 billion people have been fully vaccinated.The country reported 211,298 new infections on Thursday, nearly half the daily infections it recorded earlier this month, which pushed the overall caseload to 27.37 million.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-scraps-local-trials-for-covid-vaccines-to-fast-track-imports-101622113378481.html

NZP curator VVL Subhadra Devi confirmed to HT that all the eight lions tested negative and were back in their enclosures. On April 24, these eight big cats were found to be suffering from mild respiratory distress. Based on the guidelines of the Central Zoo Authority, their nasal and oral discharge samples were collected and sent to the Laboratory for Conservation of Endangered Species at CSIR-Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology (LaCONES-CCMB). Also Read | Lion tests positive for Covid-19 at Etawah Safari Park“The samples were tested using RT-PCR, and found positive for coronavirus. The CCMB analysed the genomes of coronavirus samples from these lions, and did not find those to be a variant of concern. The source of infection has not been found yet,” a CCMB spokesperson said. The lions were isolated from other animals. “They responded well to the treatment and showed signs of recovery,” a zoo official said. After two weeks of treatment, there were no symptoms of the virus in the zoo. But the authorities continued to keep the lions in isolation for a couple of weeks more, before testing them for the virus again. The zoo has been closed for public since May 2, following an advisory from the Union ministry of environment, forests and climate change.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/all-8-covid-ve-asiatic-lions-in-hyderabad-recover-101622112990178.html

27-05-2021||India||Experts talk about myths, misconceptions around black fungus||Mucormycosis, previously known as zygomycosis and sometimes termed as black fungus, is a serious fungal infection, found generally in people with less ability to fight infection. As the cases of black fungus infection continue to rise in India, doctors and scientists are worried if there is more to it than just the use of steroids.Symptoms of this infection depend on the part of the body which is infected. It most commonly infects the sinuses and brain resulting in a runny nose, one-sided facial swelling and pain, headache, fever, and tissue death.Other forms of the disease may infect the lungs, stomach and intestines, and skin. It is generally spread by breathing in, eating food contaminated by, or getting spores of molds of the Mucorales type in an open wound.These fungi are frequently present in decomposing organic matter such as rotting fruit and vegetables, leaves, and animal manure, but do not usually have an effect as it is not transmitted between people.Risk factors for the infection include diabetes, lymphoma, organ transplant, iron overload, HIV/AIDS, and long-term steroids or immunosuppressants use. Diagnosis for black fungus is done by biopsy and culture, with medical imaging to help determine the extent of the disease.Treatment for it is generally done with amphotericin B and surgical debridement and preventive measures include wearing a face mask in dusty areas, avoiding contact with water-damaged buildings, and protecting the skin from exposure to the soil such as when gardening or certain outdoor work.Black Fungus tends to progress rapidly and is fatal in about half of sinus cases and almost all cases of the widespread type. To talk about the disease and to spread awareness for it, experts from Ujala Cygnus Hospital, Columbia Asia Hospital, and Paras Hospital shared their inputs.Dr Amitabh Malik, Chief- ENT, Paras Hospital, Gurugram spoke about the misconceptions among people regarding the disease and said, "The rising incidences and mortality related to black fungus have actually paved the way for lots of misconception and misunderstanding about the fungal infection. People have started alienating the families, whose members are diagnosed with black fungus, thinking it's a highly contagious infection."Speaking further on the subject, he continued, "Black fungus disease is not contagious, which means that it cannot spread from contact between humans or animals. But it does spread from fungal spores that are present in the air or in the environment, which are almost impossible to avoid. Some people also feel that it can happen due to eating fruit. Uncontrolled diabetes along with a Covid infection are the leading causes for a patient to develop black fungus."Ever since the first few cases of black fungus had been reported, there has been extensive media coverage about it. This has led to fear and confusion among the public about its causes and effects. Mucormycosis, colloquially known as the black fungus, has aggravated the devastating effects of the second wave of the Covid pandemic.What needs to be understood is that our bodies are constantly attacked by different bacteria and fungi but they are kept under control by our immune system. It is when this immune system is compromised due to unreasonable use of steroids, diabetes, or cancer treatment; it gives a breeding ground to these fungi and bacteria to grow rapidly.Most diabetic patients suffering from COVID-19, who are being given steroids, have a high chance of being affected by the black fungus. To prevent it, people should stop the misuse of steroids.Mucormycosis can affect the face, infecting the nose, the orbit of the eye, or the brain, which can cause even vision loss.Dr Shuchin Bajaj, Founder and Director, Ujala Cygnus Group of Hospitals said that "it can also spread to the lungs. Doctors treating COVID-19 patients, diabetics and those with compromised immune systems should watch for early symptoms including sinus pain or nasal blockage on one side of the face, one-sided headache, swelling or numbness, toothache and loosening of teeth to guard against black fungus infections."There is also the idea among people that excessive use of steroids is causing the infection. The expression 'excessive use of steroids' can be misleading.Dr Shashank Vashist, Consultant- ENT, Columbia Asia Hospital, Palam Vihar, Gurgaon said, "Steroids are effective in Covid patients who have moderate to severe disease, there is no other way to treat them. However, if steroids are used too early in the disease, it can be counterproductive. Identifying the right time to administer steroids is important and blaming steroids for black fungus can affect treatment of this category of patients."Another myth that has been doing rounds is that a person can get infected by black fungus by eating raw food. But there is no data available so far to support this claim.Earlier this infection was spotted in patients with uncontrolled diabetes and in immune-compromised patients only. But during this pandemic, patients in the third week of illness, when they are recovering, are found to be affected with black fungus.Hence, it becomes extremely important to circulate the right information about the infection so that all the necessary precautions can be taken with the right kind of treatment at the right time.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/experts-talk-about-myths-misconceptions-around-black-fungus-101622108490311.html

The Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Union Home Minister Amit Shah should listen to the outcry of the local people and send in a new Administrator. The Central government should recall this administrator. This is the demand of the people.""We do not want to give the issue any communal colour. We are fighting for our people. Patel is trying to implement only anti-people laws and regulations," he added.The MP further said that all the drafts are under the consideration of the Union Home Ministry now. "Our request to the Ministry is that all these draft notifications should be scrapped and this administrator should immediately be recalled and a permanent people-friendly administrator may be deputed to Lakshadweep. And for that, we will continue this protest and we hope that the Centre will cooperate with us."Explaining about the laws implemented by Patel, he said "When the administrator on his first visit to Lakshadweep unilaterally decided to cahge and relax the SOP which was envisaged for containing COVID spread. When the entire world was shook in the first wave of the infection, Lakshadweep was the only one place which was green zone for one long year. It was a combined effort of then administrator, elected representatives and the people of Lakshadweep. On his first visit, he unilaterally deciding to relax the SOP.""We requested him to restore the quarantine system. He didn't listened to that. I have protested in front of the people. But the voice of the people went unheard," he added.Faizal said that Panchayat rules and regulations are being changed according to his whims and fancies. "I am a member to the district panchayat, after this draft formulation, my membership is seized.

27-05-2021||India||'Health is a state subject': Centre defends vaccine strategy in 7 points||Defending the Centre's vaccination policy, which has entered the third phase now, Niti Aayog (health) member VK Paul on Thursday issued a statement busting seven myths regarding India's vaccination. In his statement, he also addressed issues like why many more companies are not given licences to produce vaccines, why states are not getting responses from global tenders etc.Myth 1: Central government is not doing enough to procure vaccines from abroadThe Union government sought to counter this myth by stating the Indian government has been engaging in discussions and deliberations with International vaccine manufacturers like Pfizer, Moderna, and Johnson & Johnson. The government even offered assistance for the domestic production of their vaccines. However, vaccines being in “limited supply globally” has hampered their efforts.“Vaccines are in limited supply globally, and companies have their own priorities, game-plans and compulsions in allocating finite stocks. They also give preference to countries of their origin just as our own vaccine makers have done unhesitatingly for us,” the press release stated.Myth 2: Centre has not approved vaccines being administered globallyThe press release stated that all Covid-19 vaccines which have been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration, European Medicines Agency, UK’s Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency, Japan’s Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency, and included by World Health Organization in its Emergency Use Listing will not be required to undergo prior bridging trial and trials for “well-established” vaccines have been waived altogether.“No application of any foreign manufacturer for approval is pending with the drugs controller,” the release stated.Myth 3: Center is not doing enough to ramp up domestic production of vaccinesDescribing its role as that of an “effective facilitator”, the government stated that the only Indian vaccine with the Intellectual Property Right, Covaxin, will be manufactured by three other producers, and Covaxin is also ramping up its production facility, and is working on an intranasal vaccine. Covishield production is being ramped up to 11 crore doses per month and foreign vaccine Sputnik is slated to be manufactured by six companies under the coordination of Dr Reddy’s.Myth 4: Centre should invoke compulsory licensingCompulsory licensing allows manufacturers to produce patented goods with the permission of the patent holder. Countering that, Dr Paul said, "Think about this: Moderna had said in October 2020 that it will not sue any company which makes its vaccines, but still not one company has done it, which shows licensing is the least of the issues. If vaccine-making was so easy, why would even the developed world be so short of vaccine doses?"Myth 5: Centre has abdicated its responsibility to the statesStates are aware of how the centre is doing all the "heavy-lifting" as far as vaccination is concerned. From January to April, the government ran the entire vaccination programme and it was well-administered, "compared to the situation in May", the statement said. "Health is a state subject and the liberalised vaccine policy was a result of the incessant requests being made by the states to give states more power. The fact that global tenders have not given any results only reaffirms what we have been telling the states from day one: that vaccines are in short supply in the world and it is not easy to procure them at short notice," it said.Myth 6: Centre is not giving enough vaccines to the statesTo counter calls by states across the country on lack of supply of vaccines, the Central government said it is “allotting enough vaccines to the states in a transparent manner as per agreed guidelines”. Cautioning certain leaders, who appear on TV to “create panic” among people, “in spite of full knowledge of the facts on vaccine supply”, Dr Paul said this is not the time to play politics.Myth 7: Centre is not taking any step towards vaccinating childrenA decision on vaccinating children should not be taken on the basis of "WhatsApp group" panic, the statement said. Such decisions will be taken by scientists on the basis of trials, it said. “As of now, no country in the world is giving vaccines to children. Also, WHO has no recommendation on vaccinating children,” the statement said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/health-is-a-state-subject-centre-defends-vaccine-strategy-in-7-points-101622105429701.html

He served as finance secretary in Odisha in the late Seventies and early Eighties before moving to Delhi where he served in various ministries before serving as the civil aviation secretary between 1992 and 1994. During his tenure in the aviation ministry, he was working on the merger of Indian Airlines and Air India, but it could not be carried out due to lack of political backing.After retirement, he served as the chairman of Odisha Public Service Commission. In 2001, he was asked to comprehensively review the reforms carried out in Odisha, the first state to privatise power distribution, and brought out a 100-page report which revealed the rot in the power sector. The six-member committee headed by Kanungo found that nothing was achieved despite spending billions of rupees over 5 years. The report, which created a huge stir, revealed how transmission and distribution losses continued to be the same as during the pre-reforms period in the power sector, collection efficiency went down and loan burden increased fourfold from ₹820 crore to ₹3300 crore.In 2014, he authored a book “A Bureaucrat Speaks” in which he wrote about how political opportunism, nepotism and corruption eroded the whole governance, making people despondent and cynical. The book detailed his experiences about dealing with the political elites including former Prime Minister Dr Manmohan Singh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/former-civil-aviation-secretary-falls-to-covid-19-in-bubhaneswar-hospital-101622105717455.html

He also claimed that the "administration demolished structures used by the fisherfolk, fired contractual workers in various government departments".Calling the latest reforms "draconian", Gandhi said the latest "regulations penalise dissent and undermine grassroots democracy"."The people of Lakshadweep deserve a developmental vision that respects their way of life and reflects their aspirations," he also said.Since taking over as Lakshadweep’s administrator last year, Praful Patel has been making tweaks in the local administration in Lakshadweep, sparking a countrywide outcry. The new reforms include implementing the anti-social Activities Regulation bill, 2021, or the goonda act in the island territory where the crime rate is already very low.The government also took over the control of the local administrative powers of the elected Zilla panchayat regarding-- education, health care, agriculture, animal husbandry and fisheries.The new proposal will also bring changes in panchayat regulations and will make any person with more than two children ineligible to contest panchayat elections. He also gave a nod to open liquor bars in the island, a non-alcoholic zone due to its Muslim population, to promote tourism; a beef ban and eliminating non-vegetarian food from the menu of Anganwadi children.Locals are protesting against the laws saying they are anti-people and are going against the culture of the land.However, the Centre has dubbed the criticism as a result of Patel's efforts to end "corrupt practices" involving local politicians prevalent and usher in development there.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/draconian-regulations-undermine-grassroot-democracy-rahul-gandhi-seeks-centre-s-intervention-in-lakshadweep-101622104720051.html

Police and fire service personnel rescued eight families from the area and took them to a cyclone shelter, they said.National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) and Odisha Disaster Rapid Action Force (ODRAF) personnel have been kept ready for rescue operations.The port town of Paradip, state capital Bhubaneswar and the seaside pilgrim town of Puri have largely remained unaffected by cyclone Yaas.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/naveen-patnaik-undertakes-aerial-survey-of-cyclone-hit-areas-in-odisha-101622103926677.html
27-05-2021||India||Black fungus, white fungus, yellow fungus: What we know about post-Covid infections||Delhi's Ganga Ram Hospital has reported a rare kind of white fungus on Thursday in which the infection has spread throughout the intestine. The development comes as black fungus cases in India are on the rise and reports of yellow fungus white fungus are spreading panic among people. Though not much is known about white and yellow fungus, experts have said the colour depends on the growth of the fungus and it is better to not identify them with colour. Labelling the same fungus with the names of different colours can create confusion, AIIMS director Randeep Guleria has recently said. "There are various types of fungal infections such as candida, aspergillosis, cryptococcus, histoplasmosis and coccidioidomycosis. Mucormycosis, candida and aspergillosis are the ones observed more in those with low immunity," he said.Black fungusIndia at present has over 10,000 black fungus cases approximately, as the threat of mucormycosis emerged as a greater one amid the ongoing second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic. Unchecked level of blood sugar, abuse of steroids during Covid treatment are being considered as the reasons for this outbreak. The government has ramped up the production and import of its drug and most states have notified this disease as an epidemic.White fungusOn Thursday, Delhi's Ganga Ram Hospital reported the first-of-its-kind white fungus where multiple perforations were found throughout the intestine. White fungus infection causing such damage has not been seen earlier, doctors said.So far, the white fungus was considered to be a common infection, curable by commonly available medicines. Dr Kavita Sachdeva, head of the ENT department of Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose Medical College hospital in Jabalpur, which recently reported cases of white fungus, said the hospital gets five white fungus cases every month. It is common in rural areas as it is carried by dust, hay or other such particles. Known as Aspergillus Flavus infection in medical parlance, it is not a new disease, nor is it as fatal as mucormycosis, she said, as quoted by PTI.Yellow fungusDr BP Tyagi, an ENT (Ear-Nose-Throat) specialist of Ghaziabad, told ANI yellow fungus is fatal as it starts internally and it is not easy to note its symptoms.According to an ANI report, Ghaziabad has reported a case of black, white and yellow fungus infections all at the same time in a 45-year-old patient.On yellow fungus, Dr Samiran Panda, the head of Epidemiology and Communicable Diseases at the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), said the specimen needs to be studied as the yellow fungus is seen in reptiles.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/black-fungus-white-fungus-yellow-fungus-what-we-know-about-post-covid-infections-101622102847311.html
27-05-2021||India||'Something fishy': Lawyer says Mehul Choksi may not have reached Dominica voluntarily||Mehul Choksi's lawyer Vijay Aggarwal on Thursday questioned the legality of Choksi's possible repatriation straight to India after Antigun Prime Minister Gaston Browne said that his country won't accept the fugitive businessman and he will be sent to India straight. The lawyer also doubted what is being seen as Choksi's bid to flee Antigua and said there should be no speculations about how he landed in Dominica. "My understanding is that his reaching Dominica is not voluntary. So, I find something fishy that nobody seems to be at the moment looking into the fact that how exactly he reached Dominica," he said.After being missing for days, Choksi was apprehended in Dominica. Arrangements were initially being made to hand him over to Antigua police, but PM Browne said he should be extradited to India as he enjoys rights and protection as a citizen of Antigua.Citing Section 9 of the Indian Citizenship Act, advocate Aggarwal said, Choksi can only be deported to Antigua where he has legal citizenship. "The moment Mehul Choksi acquired the citizenship of Antigua he ceased to be a citizen of India. Hence legally as per the Immigration and Passport Act, Section 17 and 23, he can be deported only to Antigua," Aggarwal said in a statement on Thursday.Also Read | 'No reliable info that Mehul Choksi has fled': Antigua PMAggarwal further asserted that Choksi can't be repatriated to India as there is an Antiguan High Court order restraining processing any request from India. "It has to be done legally and it is not a game of chess. We are dealing with a human being and nor a pawn that shall be placed here or there and it cannot be on somebody’s desires and whims," Aggarwal also said.He also said that as per the universal declaration of human rights, there are "international covenants on voluntary repatriation and a person can be deported to only the country to his citizenship".Choksi is wanted in India in connection with ₹14,000 crore Punjab National Bank (PNB) loan fraud and money-laundering case. He fled to the Caribbean island nation of Antigua and Barbuda in 2018 after the Indian police launched an investigation against the diamantaire.He is accused of siphoning off close to ₹7,080 crore in the ₹13,578 crore PNB fraud. Choksi was also allegedly involved in the stock market manipulation in 2013.He went missing on Sunday evening after he left his home for dinner.After Choksi was captured in Dominica, Browne said "he may have entered the island illegally, possibly by boats"."The Dominican government is cooperating with the Antiguan and Indian governments. We have requested Dominican law enforcement agencies to not return him to Antigua where he has legal and constitutional rights as a citizen. We specifically requested them to have Indian law enforcement agencies make necessary arrangements to have him returned directly to India," ANI quoted Browne as saying.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/something-fishy-lawyer-says-mehul-choksi-may-not-have-reached-dominica-voluntarily-101622100801084.html

27-05-2021||India||Challenges ahead for new CBI director Subodh Kumar Jaiswal||Subodh Kumar Jaiswal, who took over as the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI)’s 33rd director on Wednesday, has his work cut out. He is expected to take forward his predecessor Rishi Kumar Shukla’s attempt to restore the federal agency’s credibility. The agency faced its worst credibility crisis in 2018-19 following a rift between then CBI director Alok Kumar Verma and his deputy, special director Rakesh Asthana, when almost all of its decisions and even a routine transfer came under the scrutiny of media and the courts.The agency has also lately faced criticism in cases such as the Narada string operation that are perceived to be political in nature. The CBI arrested West Bengal ministers Firhad Hakim, Subrata Mukherjee, ruling Trinamool Congress (TMC) lawmaker Madan Mitra, and former mayor Sovan Chatterjee last week over bribery charges in the Narda case five years after videos of the sting purportedly showed them taking money in exchange for favours to a fictitious company.West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee has accused the agency of making the arrests on the Centre’s directions. She staged a sit-in at the CBI’s office in Kolkata in protest against the arrests while hundreds of TMC supporters protested outside.Watch | How CBI chief Subodh Jaiswal is linked with Scam 1992 sequel on Abdul Telgi﻿﻿The agency has been at loggerheads with the West Bengal government also over its action in cases including Saradha, Rose Valley chit fund scheme, and the probe into an illegal coal mining case in the state. Family members of Mamata Banerjee’s nephew, Abhishek Banerjee, have been questioned in the coal case.The Shiv Sena-led Maharashtra government has criticised the CBI for registering a case against former state home minister Anil Deshmukh over alleged extortion and for influencing transfers in the state. The ruling Maha Vikas Aghadi coalition in the state has called the CBI probe against Deshmukh “illegal” and “an attempt to defame” him.Jaiswal reported to Deshmukh when he was the Maharashtra police chief until December last year. He will now be overall in charge of the probe against Deshmukh.There has not also been much progress in the CBI’s probe into actor Sushant Singh Rajput’s death in June last year after the case was transferred to the agency when Jaiswal was the Maharashtra police chief. The Mumbai police had concluded that Rajput died by suicide. The Maharashtra government has repeatedly questioned the lack of progress in the case. It has maintained the Centre transferred the case to the CBI in view of elections in Rajput’s native Bihar last year.Jaiswal, who is seen as an upright officer who does not interfere much in investigations, takes over when eight non-Bharatiya Janata Party-ruled Punjab, Kerala, Maharashtra, Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh, West Bengal, Rajasthan and Mizoram have blocked the CBI from conducting probes in these states without prior permission.There has also been an environment of mistrust between Indian Police Service (IPS) officers and the cadre officers within the agency. People aware of the matter said the cadre officers feel that the IPS officers “do not work for them and treat CBI as a platform for influence in Delhi”. The cadre officers complain that their career progression has been slow in the agency as they do not get to head the agency’s key branches or units. IPS officers, who lead most investigation units and branches, feel that cadre officers do not want to leave their comfort zones. Jaiswal is said to be strict when it comes to transfers and promotion rules.Jaiswal was named as the CBI chief on Tuesday after a Prime Minister Narendra Modi-led panel cleared his name on Monday evening. Names of the other two contenders for the top CBI post--Rakesh Asthana and YC Modi--were dropped after Chief Justice of India N V Ramana, a member of the panel, cited a March 2019 ruling of the top court that officers with at least six months left in retirement should only be considered.Former CBI joint director NR Wassan said the agency has its own procedures and intricacies, which take time for somebody coming from outside to understand. “But being an outsider has its advantages as well as disadvantages. While a person with zero experience in CBI would not have any preconceived notions about any case, he will take time to understand the procedures, intricacies, and human resources of the agency.”Wassan said Jaiswal comes with a good reputation, but a lot will depend on whether he is a good learner and works with an open mind. “Also, if he is supported by a good team of deputies, he should be able to manage.” Wassan added one of the key challenges for Jaiswal will be how to stop corruption within the CBI. “Most of the officers down below have become corrupt. Identify them and set processes to make sure that this does not happen in future.”Shukla tried to bridge some gaps in the agency by ordering mass transfers of officers, who had spent more than prescribed time in a particular unit or branch. He allowed personnel to approach him in case of any grievance.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/challenges-ahead-for-new-cbi-director-subodh-kumar-jaiswal-101622100677308.html
27-05-2021||India||Lakshadweep: All-party meeting today to discuss plan of action||An all-party meeting is scheduled today in Lakshadweep against the administrator’s decisions even as the collector of the islands has called a press conference in Kochi later in the day to explain the position of the administration in the stand-off. An archipelago in the Arabian Sea, Lakshadweep has been in the news since local people protested against some changes brought in by the acting administrator, Praful Khoda Patel, which they allege will destroy the unique culture of the Union Territory. They allege that these sweeping changes, which were introduced in the name of tourism development, will destroy the character of the island where 97% of the land is covered by forests and 95% of the population is included in the scheduled tribe category. “We will discuss all issues at the online meet. It seems the administrator is taking more retaliatory measures. All options are open. We are happy the whole country is aware of our burning issues now,” said Abdul Khadar, panchayat president of Kavaratti which is the capital of the UT. Also Read | Lakshadweep: Tackle the brewing discontentRecently, many Congress and CPI(M) MPs wrote to the President, expressing their anger over what they called unilateral decisions of the administrator, and sought his recall. They alleged that the administrator decided to introduce norms for private property development, anti-goonda rules that gave police powers to detain anyone, removed beef from the mid-day meal, allowed cutting of trees for road expansion projects and introduced a two-child norm for contesting in local body elections without any consultation with people. They said Patel was trying to “saffronise the island” where almost 95% population is Muslim. The erstwhile ruler of the island, the Arakkal royal family in Kannur, has also expressed concern over the developments and said the local people should be taken into confidence before taking any decision. The royals had given up their right to island in 1905 to the British for an annual pension of ₹23,000. “Island people are most peace-loving ones. Let people live peacefully and let their wishes prevail,” said Ashraf Adhiraja of the royal family.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/lakshadweepallparty-meeting-today-to-discuss-plan-of-action-101622099777169.html
27-05-2021||India||New rules to prevent abuse and misuse of social media: Ravi Shankar Prasad||Union electronics and information technology minister Ravi Shankar Prasad on Thursday maintained the government “fully recognises and respects the right of privacy” and said the new rules for intermediaries were designed to empower citizens and prevent the “abuse and misuse” of social media.“The new Rules require the social media companies to set up an India-based grievance redressal officer, compliance officer and nodal officer so that millions of users of social media who have a grievance get a forum for its redressal,” Prasad posted on Koo, the Indian alternative to Twitter.The comments came two days after WhatsApp cited “dangerous invasion of privacy” and threats to free speech of its 400 million users in India and moved the Delhi high court against the rule that mandates social media intermediaries to identify the first originator of a message on the orders of a court or executive authority.Prasad said ordinary users of WhatsApp have nothing to fear about the new rules. “Its entire objective is to find out who started the message that led to commissioning of specific crimes mentioned in the Rules,” he said.Also Read | Google respects legislative processes but pushes back when needed: Sundar PichaiHe clarified the “obligation to reveal” the first originator of an offensive message already in circulation “relates only to offences relating to sovereignty, integrity & security of India, public order, rape, child sexual abuse”. “That too when other less intrusive measures are not effective,” he said.The government on Wednesday wrote to social media companies such as Facebook and Twitter to send details of their compliance officers, nodal contact persons, resident grievance officers and physical contact addresses in India. It asked them to confirm if they have complied with the new Information Technology Act guidelines after the deadline to do so ended on Tuesday.The controversial guidelines seek the companies to put in place a new mechanism to regulate content, appoint officers, who will be liable for compliance, and adopt features such as traceability of messages and voluntary user verification.Most of the prominent companies, including Facebook, Twitter, WhatsApp, and Google, are yet to comply with the new rules.WhatsApp has a resident grievance officer. It is yet to appoint a compliance officer. Twitter and Facebook have not appointed anyone yet.Facebook on Tuesday said it aims to comply with the new guidelines but indicated there were unresolved issues.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/new-rules-to-prevent-abuse-and-misuse-of-social-media-rs-prasad-101622099418946.html

"That too when other less intrusive measures are not effective," he added.WhatsApp, which has nearly 400 million users in India, asked the Delhi High Court on Tuesday to declare that one of the new social media rules is a violation of privacy rights in India's constitution.The new rules require social media companies to set up an India-based grievance redressal officer, compliance officer and a nodal officer. This is made mandatory so that the users who have grievances can get a forum for its redressal, the minister said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/amid-controversy-with-whatapp-rs-prasad-defends-digital-media-guidelines-on-koo-101622096538883.html
27-05-2021||India||Twitter 'concerned' for India employees, says dialogue with Govt will continue||Twitter on Thursday said it is concerned about the safety of its India staff as it indirectly described the recent visit of a team of Delhi Police's Special Cell at its New Delhi office as "use of intimidation tactics by the police".Reiterating its commitment to serve the people of India, the microblogging platform said it will continue its constructive dialogue with the Indian government. "It is the collective responsibility of elected officials, industry, and civil society to safeguard the interests of the public."The statement comes amid Twitter's long-drawn battle with the government which started around January-February this year. The tussle has been going on as the Centre has accused Twitter of dragging its feet in blocking content flagged by the Centre, while Twitter defended its action citing freedom of speech. This is also Twitter's first official response regarding the new IT rules which were announced on February 25 and the social media intermediaries operating in India were given three months' time to comply.Delhi police visit Twitter offices in city, Gurugram over ‘toolkit case’Adding to the ongoing disagreement between the government and the social media platform, Delhi Police on Monday visited the Twitter office to serve a notice to Twitter's India head for tagging a tweet of BJP spokesperson as "manipulated media".Combining both the issues, Twitter issued a statement in which it cleared that the new IT rules have elements that inhibit free conversation and, at present, Twitter has pressing issues like the “safety of its employees in India”.“To keep our service available, we will strive to comply with applicable law in India. But, just as we do around the world, we will continue to be strictly guided by principles of transparency, a commitment to empowering every voice on the service, and protecting freedom of expression and privacy under the rule of law,” it said.“Right now, we are concerned by recent events regarding our employees in India and the potential threat to freedom of expression for the people we serve. We, alongside many in civil society in India and around the world, have concerns with regards to the use of intimidation tactics by the police in response to enforcement of our global Terms of Service, as well as with core elements of the new IT Rules,” it added.It, however, plans to “advocate for changes to elements of these regulations that inhibit free, open public conversation” and for that, the ongoing constructive dialogue with the Centre will continue, it said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/twitter-concerned-for-india-employees-will-continue-dialogue-with-government-101622097433580.html

27-05-2021||India||Government’s helplines for us found wanting, say migrant workers||A 35-year-old migrant worker from Uttar Pradesh, who identified herself as Khatoon, worked at an automobile factory in Gurugram and earned ₹10,000 monthly until she lost her job when the lockdown to check the second Covid-19 wave was imposed in April. Khatoon said she was paid just half of her salary for the last month of her work and even found it difficult to feed her children. An NGO helped her with some immediate ration and asked her to call Haryana’s assistant labour commissioner Jaideep Yadav to seek help to get her salary. Yadav’s number is listed among those of 100 central labour commissioners tasked to address migrant distress in 20 states.Khatoon said when she called up Yadav for help, instead of listening to her, he started questioning her how she managed to get his number. She added after repeated requests for help, Yadav asked her to WhatsApp him the details. Khatoon, a single mother, does not have a smartphone, and gave up and never called back Yadav, who was unavailable for comments. Many migrant workers across India said they were not even aware of such helplines.Anindita Adhikari of the Stranded Workers Action Network (Swan), a volunteer group working for migrant workers, said they contacted 80 labour commissioners in 20 states and found none of these helplines was able to offer any basic support. “These are just an eyewash,’ Adhikari said.Swan, which said it has been supporting around 45,000 workers by providing them ration and financial assistance, said that when they called on these helplines, the responses varied. Most of the officials answered the calls but many were not even aware that their numbers were listed as helplines for workers. A commissioner wondered how Swan got him number while another refused to take calls again.Also Read | India’s daily Covid-19 infection count goes up to 211,298, death toll at 315,235Prakash Kumar Mishra, a migrant worker from Bihar, said the tile manufacturing firm in Bengaluru he worked for was closed when the lockdown was imposed, and the owner left the city without paying them their salaries. “It was after we threatened that we will lodge a complaint with the labour commission that we got our salaries,” said Mishra. He said he called on a helpline number for ration help but was told there was no such provision. When Mishra told the officer in charge his family was starving, he was told to look for free food being distributed.The government has said it helped tens of thousands of workers via these helplines last year and that this year the workers can call on them for support related to ration, non-payment of wages, basic financial assistance, protection from eviction by landlords and travel support.Most officials in charge of these helplines told Swan they cannot do much for private-sector workers even as Union labour secretary Apurva Chandra has said the designated officials would be available for any kind of help.Many officials have been asking for complaints to be submitted in writing even as most workers are unlettered. According to Swan, some have even asked for complaints via emails.A labour ministry spokesman said help was being provided but did not have the details about the number of requests resolved so far. He added the data will be provided later.Adhikari filed an application under the Right to Information Act on May 8 seeking details of state-wise requests received and resolved by these helplines. There has been no response from the labour ministry yet. Swan on May 7 wrote a letter to the central labour commissioner DPS Negi and seven state labour commissioners highlighting specific cases for help. “Neither did the Centre nor did any other state give any response,” Adhikari said.Negi said they have been holding weekly meetings to monitor the redressal of the complaints even as the number of people calling on helplines is very few as compared to last year. The government last year said over 20,00,00 workers were helped last year via these helplines. Negi said that not more than 4,500 complaints have been resolved this year.Also Read | Here’s why you shouldn’t post your Covid vaccination certificate on social media“The complaints mostly have been about unpaid wages and the reason for such a smaller number of redressals is that there has been no mass migration like last year. Employers generally withhold wages when workers leave their places of work. This was not the case this year,” Negi said. He added that the labour ministry has directed all the industries to convince their workers to stay in states where they work and pay them wages as well. “Since there is no national lockdown and the state lockdowns as well have exempted the construction activities, where most these migrant workers are employed, this has caused a decrease in migration.”Negi said if anyone wants to travel back home, there are special trains. “In our review meetings, we have senior officials from the railway ministry as well who have been ensuring all the help to those workers who want to get back home.” Negi said the state governments were responsible for providing ration to workers. He added the control rooms were not empowered to direct ration support nor income support. “India is a federal country and most of these powers lie with the states. Whatever complaints we get out of our domain, we forward them to states.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/governments-helplines-for-us-found-wanting-say-migrant-workers-101622096837497.html

DCP south Atul Thakur said Gaurav has been arrested on charges of cruelty to the animal as he risked his pet's life by making the video. The video has already been deleted from YouTube and the YouTuber issued another video apologising for the earlier video.A case was registered against Gaurav in Malviya Nagar police station after People for Animal raised an issue with the cruelty showed in the video.The video in question was shot on May 21 and was released on YouTube under the title 'Flying Dollar with helium gas balloon'. In the video, which starts with a shot taken on a car, Dollar can be seen flying, while Gaurav says, "Let's make Dollar fly". A woman was also there in the video."Please don't take it wrong. When we will fly Dollar, we will take all safety precautions," Gaurav said in the now-deleted video. The video shows how the YouTuber got ready with drones and a few other equipment and then drove to a shop first to buy ballons.

Seawater also entered Shankarpur village in the district forcing people to leave their homes and seek shelter elsewhere.A resident of Shankarpur, Putul who had to move to a relative's house after the cyclone washed away his home, said he was surprised to see the level of the water as it rose to the "severe" level. "I am shocked to see this kind of effect. Earlier also there had been cyclones but not severe like this. We were stuck in the houses due to the flood and managed to escape but our documents got washed away. We are going to take shelter in our relative's house. We lost belongings too," news agency ANI quoted him as saying.Another resident of a village, Taps Bera said, it will take more than a year to return to normal life, as per ANI report. "I am taking my family and shifting to other villages. It will take more than a year for normal life to return," he said.Apart from Midnapore and Shankarpur, the cyclone also impacted Bankura, South 24 Pargana and Jhargram districts in West Bengal. Around 1,100 villages had been flooded by storm surges, leaving at least 50,000 homeless, news agency Reuters reported citing authorities.Packing gusts of up to 140 kph (87 mph), cyclone Yaas made landfall on Wednesday.

Choksi, who has sought refuge in Antigua after allegedly cheating Punjab National Bank of ₹13,578 crore along with his nephew Nirav Modi, and fleeing India in 2018, left his home on Sunday to go for dinner at a well-known restaurant in the southern part of the island and was never seen again. He was located in Dominica, another Caribbean island country 101 nautical miles from Antigua. He is currently in the custody of Criminal Investigation Department of Dominica, with whom Indian officials are coordinating, people familiar with the development said. Gaston Browne has said that he has requested Dominica PM Roosevelt Skerrit and the law enforcement agencies there not to return Choksi to Antigua, where he has legal and constitution protection as a citizen. “We have requested that he be detained and to make arrangements with Dominican government to have him returned to India,” Browne told ANI, while adding that “Choksi may not enjoy the same protection in Dominica”. He added that Choksi made a monumental error by skipping Antigua. A senior official in India said, “We are in touch with authorities in Dominica to get him repatriated to India. He is not a citizen there so he can be deported quickly.” The police in Dominica apprehended him in the northern territory of the island on the basis of a yellow notice issued by Antigua after he went missing. Also Read | UK judge’s order brings Indian banks closer to recovering debts from MallyaChoksi’s lawyer, Vijay Aggarwal, had said on Wednesday evening, “I have spoken to family, family is happy and relieved that finally whereabouts of Mehul Choksi are known. And efforts are being made to speak to him so that one can know the clearer picture that how he was taken to Dominica.” On Tuesday, the Antiguan Prime Minister had said that if Choksi had fled the country, he would have done so using a boat. The Antiguan government has said on several occasions that it is ready to extradite Choksi to India for which the process is already going on. His extradition case, as well as revocation of citizenship by Antigua, is currently being pursued in a court there, which he has challenged. If Dominica agrees to repatriate Choksi directly to India, it will happen on the basis of Interpol red notice because India doesn’t have any formal arrangement with Dominica to extradite persons, according to people familiar with the process. India has cordial relations with Commonwealth of Dominica, which has population of over 72,000. As part of Vaccine Maitri, India donated 35,000 doses to Dominica in February this year. India exports mainly pharmaceutical products, readymade garments, textiles and home furnishings, and food products to Dominica, while the latter exports mainly scrap metals. Bilateral trade between India and Dominica during 2017-18 amounted to US$2.38 million. The Indian government also provided financial support of US$ 1 lakh as immediate relief and granted US$ 1 million for infrastructure re-construction in Dominica under the India UNDP Fund in the aftermath of Hurricane Maria in 2017.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/repatriate-mehul-choksi-to-india-antigua-tells-dominica-101622088736819.html

He is now with the Hoover Institution, an arm of Stanford University.“I think people do worry of what would happen if things go badly,” Jaishankar added from New York, citing conversations he has had with counterparts around the world, especially in Europe, about the future of Afghanistan post US withdrawal, without settling the key issue of who will be in charge. He left shortly for Washington DC for the second leg of his five-day visit to the United States.President Joe Biden has announced that all US troops will be out of Afghanistan by September 11, the 20th anniversary of the terrorist attacks that led to the US-led invasion of Afghanistan in search of the perpetrators, al Qaeda leaders and operatives sheltering there under the protection of the Taliban regime.Also Read | Biden asks US intel officials to investigate Covid-19 origin amid Wuhan lab rowIndia has a place at the table in America’s post-pullout plan, as detailed in the leaked letter from Secretary of State Antony Blinken to President Ashraf Ghani. But New Delhi, irrespective of the party in power, has long advocated some US military presence in Afghanistan, no matter how small, for a scarecrow deterrent impact on terrorism in not only Afghanistan but all of South Asia, especially in Pakistan.Biden’s Afghanistan policy, which is a continuation of President Donald Trump’s policy moored in ending “endless wars”, is the only major issue muddying bilateral relations at this time. It was trade and related issues — such as the termination of special tariff concessions for Indian imports under a US programme called Generalized System of Preferences — during the Trump administration and trade and climate change under President Barack Obama.Defying Trump-supporting Indian skeptics and hawks, Biden has accorded top billing to the relationship with India: Prime Minister Narendra Modi was among the first world leaders he called after moving into the White House; hosted the first summit of the leaders of the Quad, which includes India; dispatched one of his senior Cabinet members Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin to New Delhi as part of first foreign visits by his top officials; invited Modi to a climate summit; backed a proposal by India and South Africa to temporarily waive patent protections for Covid-19 vaccines; and sent $100 million worth of oxygen supplies, PPEs and therapeutics to help India deal with a deadly second wave of Covid-19 cases.And now, Biden is expected to name a close political ally as ambassador to India, Eric Garcetti, currently mayor of Los Angeles.Jaishankar arrived in Washington DC Wednesday with an itinerary packed with meetings over the next two days. He is scheduled to meet Secretary of State Blinken, Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin, US Trade Representative Katherine Tai — all Cabinet members — and National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan. And possibly — chances are remote to none — President Biden.The minister is also meeting members of top business bodies US-India Business Council (an arm of the US chamber of commerce, one of the most powerful lobbying groups) and the US-India Strategic Partnership Forum, which is backed by most major US investors in India and the Modi government.Jaishankar will meet some lawmakers as well, but not as many as Indians would have wanted to, at a dinner hosted by Indian ambassador to the United States, Taranjit Singh Sandhu. “l look forward to meeting with India’s External Affairs Minister @DrSJaishankar, Ambassador @SandhuTaranjitS, and other leaders concerned with the US-India relationship, for dinner this evening,” said Congressman Brad Sherman in a tweet.

US health regulator rolled out the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine for children between the ages of 12-15 on May 14, Canada had approved their shot for children on May 5. The European Medicines Agency is also evaluating its use in children.The initial advisory had suggested that Pfizer vaccines should be stored at a temperature of minus 70 degree celsius, which was considered to be almost impossible for tropical countries with underfunded cold storage infrastructure, but the company has since revised the advisory and the vaccines can now be stored at minus 25 degrees and even at 2-8 degrees for a month.PTI had reported on May 26 that Pfizer is willing to export five crore vaccine doses over the course of four months, starting with one crore vaccine doses in July, one in August, two crore in September and finally another one crore in October. However, the manufacturer has agreed to hold talks with the Government of India and accept payments directly from them. Earlier, both Pfizer and Moderna had refused to sell vaccines directly to states.Pfizer also took up discussions on indemnity and liability protection against any claims that might arise from the use of their vaccine. Sources told ANI that the pharma giant asked for relaxation in some clauses before it supplies vaccines to India. Pfizer seeks indemnity and liability protections in all of their agreements consistent with applicable local laws and has one with 116 countries in the world. Indemnification clauses are often included in contracts with governments for the supply of necessary vaccines during any public health emergency.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pfizer-holds-talks-with-centre-on-covid-19-vaccine-s-suitability-for-children-101622085073444.html

Browne said he has requested PM Skerrit and law enforcement in Dominica to not return Choksi to Antigua where he has legal and constitutional protection as a citizen, the news agency reported.The prime minister also said that Choksi made a "monumental error" by fleeing the island. His family members staying in Antigua are legal citizens and they are not known to be "let's say criminals", the prime minister said."He (Choksi) was found in Dominica. He may have entered the island illegally, possibly by boats. The Dominican government is cooperating with the Antiguan and Indian governments. We have requested Dominican law enforcement agencies to not return him to Antigua where he has legal and constitutional rights as a citizen. We specifically requested them to have Indian law enforcement agencies make necessary arrangements to have him returned directly to India," Browne told ANI.Watch | ‘Dominica agreed for Mehul Choksi's repatriation to India’: Antigua PMThe Indian and Antiguan authorities are in touch with the Dominican government, he said.According to reports, Mehul Choksi, wanted in India in connection with a ₹13,500-crore loan fraud in Punjab National Bank, went missing on Sunday. He was last seen on Sunday evening at 5.15pm leaving the home in a car.

The cyclonic storm 'Yaas' weakened into a deep depression and lay centred at 2330 hours IST of the 26th May over south Jharkhand and adjoining north interior Odisha. Likely to move northwestwards and weaken gradually into a depression during next 12 hours," IMD posted on Twitter on the early morning of Thursday.Click here for live updates on Cyclone YaasJharkhand was put on high alert and a complete lockdown was imposed in some parts of the state to prevent people from venturing out as the authorities evacuated those staying in low-lying areas and shifted them to storm centres ahead of the Cyclone's expected arrival in the state. As many as 10,000 people were moved to safer zones, officials told news agency PTI on Wednesday. "Operations are being executed on a war-footing in vulnerable areas in East and West Singhbhum, besides some other districts which are expected to be hit by the cyclonic storm Yaas," disaster management secretary Amitabh Kaushal said."We are witnessing heavy rainfall and there has been damage to the power transmission network besides trees have been uprooted," East Singhbhum Deputy Commissioner Suraj Kumar said. At least four people were killed due to the storm and it left behind a trail of destruction with damaged homes and flooded farmland in West Bengal and Odisha. In view of the storm, more than 21 lakh people had to be evacuated from danger zones in Odisha, West Bengal and Jharkhand.

27-05-2021||India||WhatsApp users in India won't be affected, says Centre amid legal battle over privacy||The Centre on Wednesday clarified that the normal functioning of Whatsapp will not be impacted because of the measures the information technology ministry proposes to take if the platform does not comply with the new rules where the Centre wants the first originator of a message to be identified if required. The ministry specifically mentioned WhatsApp as it moved the Delhi high court and challenged the Centre's new rules, stating that this violates the right to privacy and the company's end-to-end encryption policy. The government said this last-minute challenge was clear defiance.Here is what the government said:Tracing the first originator is only the last stepThe ministry clarified that the clause with which WhatsApp raised a problem is not the first step. When all other remedies will prove to be ineffective, then only this route will be taken following a law-sanctioned process.Why knowledge of the first originator is importantThe Centre has said that punishing one who started mischief leading to crimes like rape is in the public interest. "We cannot deny as to how in cases of mob lynching and riots etc. repeated WhatsApp messages are circulated and recirculated whose content are already in the public domain. Hence the role of who originated is very important," the government said.WhatsApp should find a solutionThe ministry on Wednesday said that the debate on whether encryption would be maintained or not is misplaced. WhatsApp should find a technical solution through encryption or otherwise so that privacy is maintained and necessary information to ensure public order and national security can also be obtained by the government.Services won't be impactedNone of the measures proposed by India will impact the normal functioning of WhatsApp in any manner whatsoever and for the common users, there will be no impact, the Centre said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/whatsapp-users-in-india-won-t-be-affected-says-centre-amid-legal-battle-over-privacy-101622080285242.html
27-05-2021||India||Jaishankar arrives in Washington DC, to meet defence secretary Lloyd Austin||External affairs minister S Jaishankar, who is currently on a visit to the United States, arrived in Washington DC on Wednesday for a series of meetings with key officials of the Biden administration including secretary of state Antony Blinken.During the three days stay in Washington DC, Jaishankar will also meet his American counterpart, defense secretary Lloyd Austin, and National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan, along with other key members of the Biden administration. According to a report by ANI, the discussion between the ministers will focus on the progress made in the bilateral relations in the first 100 days of the Joe Biden-led government. The discussions will also lay the groundwork for the rest of the term of US President Joe Biden.However, the timing for a meeting between Blinken and Jaishankar has not been announced as of yet, as the US State Secretary is travelling in the Middle East to continue with the peace process in the wake of the Israel-Palestine conflict. "The secretary is meeting with the external affairs minister, will continue discussions that the two held in New Delhi in March and will continue the robust bilateral defence and security relationship between our two countries. We are looking forward to having him here at the Pentagon and hosting him for a good set of talks," Pentagon press secretary John Kirby informed in a press conference.Jaishankar arrived in the US on May 24 and the visit will continue till May 28. This is the first visit by any senior Indian minister to the US since President Biden took over the office in January.Before arriving in Washington, the foreign minister was in New York, where he met senior United States officials and discussed Covid-related cooperation between the two countries.On May 26, Jaishankar also met United Nations' secretary-general, Antonio Guterres. During the meeting, Jaishankar stressed the need for finding “urgent and effective” global vaccine solutions and called for “greater production” and “fairer distribution.”Later in the day, Jaishankar also held a discussion with US National Security Advisor General (retd) HR McMaster. During the discussion, Jaishankar said that there is a real appreciation of the potential of the India-US relationship and what it can do.Emphasising that he has a "big agenda" for the US-India relationship going forward, Jaishankar said, "I think our relationship has come a long way. It's today one of the major relationships in the world and my own sense is that in Washington today, there is a real appreciation of the potential of this relationship, what it can do. And it's true of New Delhi as well".(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jaishankar-arrives-in-washington-to-meet-defence-secretary-lloyd-austin-101622079296481.html
27-05-2021||India||Death in Himalayas: Poverty, fear and stretched resources worsening Covid crisis||Pramila Devi's shrouded body lay on a bier, resting on a rock on the banks of a muddy Ganges.The 36-year-old mother-of-three died the previous night in a village in the mountainous northern state of Uttarakhand, a day after testing positive for Covid-19.Devi's death on Sunday is a sign of how poverty, fear and a lack of facilities are adding to Covid-19 fatalities in remote villages, where many shun tests for fear of testing positive and being forced to go to hospital far from home.India's Covid-19 caseload stands at 27.16 million, with 311,388 deaths, federal government data from May 26 show. But some experts estimate numbers are far higher, due in part to low testing rates in India's hinterlands where Covid-19 cases are spreading rapidly.Devi's eldest daughter got married and moved away in late April after the family hosted a ceremony attended by over two dozen people, her husband Suresh Kumar, 43, told Reuters.Two weeks after that Devi suffered a bout of diarrhoea. But it was not until 10 days later that Kumar, who has no income and depends on handouts, took her to a nearby dispensary that has been turned into a small Covid-19 facility with four beds.The dispensary is equipped with one oxygen cylinder and one concentrator, said Aishwary Anand, the only doctor there.Devi tested positive for Covid-19 with very low blood oxygen levels. Anand advised Kumar to take her to a bigger hospital, but costs were a deterrent.The couple returned home, where their two other children - a 16-year-old boy and 10-year-old girl - were waiting.The next day Devi's nephew carried her to a creaky taxi which returned her to the dispensary. Another patient was using the oxygen cylinder and the oxygen concentrator did not work due to a power outage."We need power," Anand pleaded with an electricity department employee over the phone, as he paced the dispensary wearing white protection gear.Eventually power was restored, Devi had access to the concentrator and felt well enough to return home. But feeling sick again, the family called an ambulance to take her back to the clinic, where she was pronounced dead on arrival."I'm yet to inform my eldest daughter of her mother's death," a distraught Kumar said, as he crouched on the banks of the Ganges.FEAR OF TESTINGThe state of Uttarakhand, which shares its border with China and Nepal, reported 45,568 Covid-19 cases and 6,020 fatalities as of May 25.Its city of Haridwar recently hosted the weeks-long Kumbh Mela gathering that saw hundreds of thousands of ash-smeared ascetics and devout Hindus jostling to take a dip in the Ganges, which is considered a holy river.Some experts fear that the event led to a surge in Covid-19 infections both in the crammed city and other parts of India as devotees returned home.On the eastern edge of Haridwar, Uttarakhand's Pauri Garhwal district - where Devi's family live - has reported 5,155 Covid-19 cases and 241 deaths. But locals and doctors say many in the district suffering Covid-like symptoms refuse to get tested or test too late."We've launched radio and newspaper campaigns to spread awareness about Covid and encourage testing," said Manoj Kumar Sharma, the district's top health official. "But despite our efforts there is some resistance in rural areas to getting tested."Reuters reporters hiked uphill with medics for over an hour to get to Pitha, a village in the district with no road access.There, Jai Prakash, 38, pleaded with his neighbours to get tested. Despite his appeals, a dozen of the village's nearly 60 inhabitants did so.Only nine of around 200 inhabitants in the nearby village of Tangroli - declared a Covid-19 containment zone with more than a dozen positive patients - showed up for testing the same day that a medical team camped outside their village."My neighbour did not want to get tested," said Deepak Singh, who works for a company in New Delhi but returned to his village this month. "He asked me if I was willing to take care of his household expenses if he tested positive."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/death-in-himalayas-how-poverty-fear-stretched-is-worsening-covid-crisis-101622077187697.html
27-05-2021||India||Kejriwal inaugurates Delhi’s 1st drive-through jabs centre||Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Wednesday inaugurated the city’s first drive-through Covid-19 vaccination centre, set up by Akash Healthcare Super Speciality Hospital in Vegas Mall in Dwarka’s Sector 14 for people aged between 18 and 45, and said more such centres would be set up in the city.The centre will administer Covishield doses.“More drive-through vaccination centres are going to come up in Delhi in the coming days. One of them will be at a government centre in Chhatrasal (stadium), which is likely to be ready by Saturday. At least one more private drive-through centre is also set to come up,” he said.He added, “We can keep opening more drive-through sites for the convenience of people. But the problem is with the shortage of vaccines.”The centre in Dwarka’s Sector 14 has two vaccine sites -- one drive-through and the other a regular site. Charges at the drive-through facility will be ₹1,400 per dose, and shots can be availed only through appointment that can be made on telephone by calling 8800015999. The working hours are 9am to 5pm. “The drive-through site will also reflect in the CoWin system in another day or so,” said Dr Aashish Chaudhry, managing director at Aakash Healthcare Super Speciality Hospital.“We have set up a dedicated lane for vehicles which queue up for the vaccine drive. There is also a dedicated area where those inoculated can park their cars, switch on the AC and wait for 30 minutes for monitoring any potential adverse effects. In case of an emergency, they have to honk twice or flash their headlights. We have staff for emergency response and instructions are written on the wall in the parking area,” he said.On Wednesday, the centre vaccinated 40 people. “In the coming days, we aim to scale up the capacity to 100-150 beneficiaries per day,” said Chaudhry.“The other vaccine site at the centre will also have on-the-spot registration facility. This site will charge ₹1,000 per dose,” said a spokesperson of the hospital.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kejriwal-inaugurates-delhi-s-1st-drive-through-jabs-centre-101622076340571.html
27-05-2021||India||Black fungus cases grow, but Amphotericin B in short supply||With over 620 patients being treated for mucormycosis in city hospitals, Delhi is facing a severe shortage of the only last-line drug for the lethal fungal infection.The city has received 3,850 vials of Amphotericin B till Tuesday, against a requirement of over 30,000 doses a week, said senior officials in Delhi’s health department.“Delhi received some 400 vials of the medicine yesterday (Tuesday) and another 400 the day before. For 620 patients, Delhi needs nearly 4,000 vials of the medicine a day. The shortage is delaying patients’ treatment,” said Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Wednesday.State health minister Satyendar Jain said: “On May 23, 200 cases of the infection were reported. Now, there are around 70 cases being reported each day. Delhi has been allocated very few doses of Amphotericin when compared with this number. Of the total patients with black fungus, nearly two-thirds are from Delhi and the rest are from outside the state.”Instances of mucormycosis, commonly known as black fungus, have shot up in the Capital as a complication among some Covid-19 patients, after a surge in Covid-19 cases between mid-April and early May. Over 100 patients with the fungal infection are currently being treated at AIIMS. The premier hospital used to receive only about 12 to 15 cases in a year before the pandemic, according to doctors.Officials said that a patient being treated for black fungus needs at least 50 vials of Amphotericin B every week.“Some need 100 vials as well. It depends on the severity of the infection... Due to the shortage, we are unable to issue all 50 vials [for a patient] in one go, so we give 10 to 20 vials at a time,” said an official at Delhi’s drug control department. The Delhi government has written to the Centre asking for 100,000 doses of the medicine over a two-month period, arguing that Delhi is likely to see around 1,000 cases of the fungal infection at its peak.The state has also set up an expert panel who approve hospitals’ requests for the medicine.“Earlier, patients had to go around the city looking for the medicine. Now, the government ensures that we get it. If someone needs the medicine urgently, we give it from another patient’s quota and replenish it later,” said Dr SCL Gupta, medical superintendent, Batra hospital.However, some patients said they are still running from pillar to post to get the medicine.The brother of a 35-year-old woman suffering from the infection said, “My sister has been given 10 doses of the medicines so far, but doctors said she will need another 50. I have probably been to every big medical store in the city, but I cannot find it.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/black-fungus-cases-grow-but-amphotericin-b-in-short-supply-101622075938258.html
27-05-2021||India||India-US relations one of the major ties in the world today: Jaishankar||India-US ties are one of the major relationships in the world and the challenge before New Delhi and Washington is how to translate their fundamental, societal and geopolitical convergences into actionable policies, External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar said on Wednesday.Emphasising that he has "big agenda" for the US-India relationship going forward, Jaishankar said, "I think our relationship has come a long way. It's today one of the major relationships in the world and my own sense is that in Washington today, there is a real appreciation of the potential of this relationship, what it can do. And it's true of New Delhi as well."During a virtual conversation with former US National Security Adviser General HR McMaster in ‘Battlegrounds’ session on 'India: Opportunities And Challenges For A Strategic Partnership’ presented by the Hoover Institution, Jaishankar said that keeping in mind issues such as impact of the Covid-19 pandemic, rise of different powers, "today we all recognize that it's not a question of one or two or three countries who will decide how the world.""The world is truly much more multipolar and if it is multipolar, then it's all the more important for countries to learn how to work with each other more effectively. And I see a big change in the American mindset in that regard,” Jaishankar said responding to a question on the trajectory of US-India relations."So the United States has not only an enormous ability to reinvent itself, it also has a great ability to assess its situation and re-strategise in a way."Noting that when it comes to the big issues of the day, "maybe because we are pluralistic societies, because we are political democracies, because we are market economies, that we have fundamental convergences."He said these convergences are societal and geopolitical. "I think the challenge before us is how to translate those convergences into actionable policies,” he said, adding that he certainly looks forward to working on these with the Biden administration.Jaishankar, who arrived in New York Sunday and met UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres, travelled to Washington Wednesday where he is expected to meet US Secretary of State Antony Blinken.A State Department spokesperson said Blinken and Jaishankar would discuss a wide range of issues, including Covid-19, efforts to strengthen Indo-Pacific cooperation through the Quad, enhanced UN and multilateral cooperation.In addition to meeting his counterpart, Jaishankar is scheduled to meet US National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan, other senior officials of the Biden Administration, influential lawmakers, think-tanks, leaders of the corporate sector and members of the Indian American community.It is the first visit by a senior Indian minister to the US after President Joe Biden assumed office in January.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/indiaus-relations-one-of-the-major-ties-in-the-world-today-jaishankar-101622075540300.html

There is still no clarity on his condition, said the police.The police added that investigators are exploring multiple angles to ascertain the motive of the crime and the identity of the perpetrators. However, no breakthrough was made until Wednesday evening, they said.The police have picked up some suspects for questioning, but no arrests were made until evening.Hassan lived with his family in Chauhan Bangar and had taken up garments embroidery work at the shop.The incident took place around 6.30pm on Tuesday when Hassan and his friend Soni were at the shop.A case of murder has been registered at the Jafrabad police station, and a hunt for the suspects is underway, the police said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/man-shot-dead-in-jafrabad-hunt-on-for-suspects-101622075280449.html
27-05-2021||India||Centre in UP gives different vaccines in 1st and 2nd jabs||At least 20 people were each administered two separate coronavirus vaccines -- Covishield as their first dose and Covaxin as their second, or booster, dose -- by health workers at an inoculation centre in Uttar Pradesh’s Siddharthnagar district bordering Nepal border, district officials said, terming it a case of negligence.An inquiry has been ordered into the case and a team of the district health department visited the spot to record the statements of villagers and health workers. “Action will be taken against those found guilty,” Dr Sandeep Chaudhary, chief medical officer, Siddharthnagar, said on Wednesday.According to guidelines, each vaccine recipient is supposed to get two doses of the same vaccine about 4 to 16 weeks apart depending on whether it is Covaxin or Covishield.No adverse reactions have been reported among the 20 people, the CMO said, adding that authorities were monitoring their health.The 20 recipients -- all residents of Audahi Kalan village who are in the 45-plus age group -- were first given a dose of Covishield on April 1 at the Barhni primary health centre in the area.However, on May 14, they were accidentally administered Covaxin as their second dose by the health care workers. “When villagers visited the health centre to take the second dose, the health workers did not check the card to find out which vaccine was administered to them earlier,” said Ram Surat, a 64-year-old resident of the village who was among the 20 recipients.The CMO, too, said it appeared the health care workers at the centre did not check the first dose certificate of the 20 people. The certificate states the type of vaccine administered to a person.Dr DS Negi, direct general of the Uttar Pradesh health department, said the state government has sought a report from the CMO. The inquiry has been ordered against health centre in-charge Dr SK Patel, auxillary nurse midwife (ANM) Kamlawati and accredited social health activist (ASHA) Gayatri.Some countries such as Germany and France have allowed two vaccine types (Covishield and Pfizer/Moderna vaccines) to be administered to the same recipient in some cases, but the decision was taken after studies were carried out to check for efficacy and safety. India has not permitted the same for any vaccine so far.“We have no idea of whether Covaxin and Covishield doses can be mixed for immunisation. There have been studies abroad with the AstraZeneca vaccine (named Covishield in India) and Pfizer or Moderna vaccine that show there is no ill effect of mixing the doses and the individuals do get a good immune response. But we do not have a comparative study for Covaxin in India. These cases where the vaccine doses have been mixed due to an error should be identified and their immunological profile should be studied. Such information will be helpful especially when there is a shortage of one vaccine,” said Dr Lalit Kant, former head of the department of epidemiology at the Indian Council of Medical Research.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-in-up-gives-different-vaccines-in-1st-and-2nd-jabs-101622074566400.html
27-05-2021||India||WhatsApp moves High Court against new IT rules||Citing “dangerous invasion of privacy” and threats to free speech of its 400 million users in India, WhatsApp has moved the Delhi high court seeking the squashing of a rule framed by the Union government that obligates social media intermediaries to identify the first originator of a message upon an order by a competent court or executive authority.The petition filed in the high court claims that enforcement of rule 4(2) of the Information Technology (Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code) Rules, 2021, will break WhatsApp’s end-to-end encryption and the privacy principles underlying it, besides impermissibly infringing upon users’ fundamental rights to privacy and freedom of speech.WhatsApp has requested the high court to ensure no criminal liability is imposed on it for not complying with the provision, which, it contends is, “unconstitutional, illegal” and beyond the purview of the Information Technology Act.The Union government in a statement on Wednesday defended the rules and called WhatsApp’s “last minute challenge” a “clear act of defiance meant to keep the guidelines from coming into effect”. The government also stated that while it respects the right to privacy, no fundamental right, including the right to privacy, is absolute.Rule 4(2), which comes into effect from Wednesday, makes it mandatory for social media intermediary providing messaging services to trace the originator of a message if required by a court or a competent authority under Section 69A of the IT Act. While the rules clarify traceability order may only be passed for serious criminal offences, some categories such as “public order” are relatively broad in operation.“Requiring messaging apps to “trace” chats is the equivalent of asking us to keep a fingerprint of every single message sent on WhatsApp, which would break end-to-end encryption and fundamentally undermines people’s right to privacy,” a WhatsApp spokesperson said.“We have consistently joined civil society and experts around the world in opposing requirements that would violate the privacy of our users. In the meantime, we will also continue to engage with the Government of India on practical solutions aimed at keeping people safe, including responding to valid legal requests for the information available to us,” this person addedA person in the company aware of the technicalities involved said the tracing feature sought by the government is unlikely to be practical since people also copy-paste messages, and that bad actors can separately spoof or modify information in a way that could lead to people being framed.In its petition before the high court on the IT rules, WhatsApp has claimed that the new set of guidelines is “unconstitutional”, for it tramples upon privacy of users apart from being “manifestly arbitrary” and in breach of the principle of data minimisation.“This [the traceability feature] would require petitioner to build the ability to identify the first originator of every communication sent in India on its platform, as there is no way to predict which message will be the subject of such an order seeking first originator information. This eliminates the right of the hundreds of millions Indian citizens using WhatsApp to maintain the privacy of their messages, which is antithetical to end-to-end encryption and the core privacy principles underlying it,” the company stated in its petition.It added that since the provision does not require an approval of a court, it is clear that the power is without judicial oversight and hence, there is no “guarantee against arbitrary State action”. If WhatsApp adds these features, the company said, it could put journalists and civil and political activists at risk.Taking another ground to challenge Rule 4(2), WhatsApp has said that the provision was not backed by any statutory power since Section 79 of the IT Act only allows the Union government to prescribe “due diligence” guidelines that intermediaries must observe to maintain their exemption from liability for third-party content.“However, Impugned Rule 4(2) seeks to impose obligations that fall far outside ‘due diligence’, as it forces fundamental alterations to WhatsApp by breaking end-to-end encryption and changing the fundamental nature of the service that people love and use today in India and across more than 100 countries,” it maintained.The petition sought annulment of the rule also on the ground that it ran counter to the intent of the IT Act which sought to promote “uniformity of the law” with other nations with respect to “alternatives to paper-based methods of communications”.Raman Chima, Asia Pacific policy director at Access Now, said WhatsApp needs to do better in its practices to protect and safeguard the interests of its users — including reconsidering its data sharing with Facebook and changes to its privacy policy. “The present legal challenge does reflect [WhatsApp is] prioritising safeguarding its users’ security and privacy from an overbroad, unlawful, and dangerous government mandate. The government’s insistence on ending traceability has to be seen against the broader context of shrinking civic space, where exceptions carved out in laws are weaponised and selectively applied against dissenters and at-risk communities,” he said.A second expert said there are questions over the legality of the rules. “The IT Rules go far beyond the scope of the IT Act. The traceability requirement unreasonably enhances the scope of obligations under the parent legislation. Section 69 of the IT Act provides the power to seek technical assistance for securing access, interception, decryption or monitoring of information stored in computer resource. The IT Rules, however, may require changes to the technical architecture of messaging platforms which would affect the privacy and security of all users across the board,” said Tanmay Singh, associate litigation counsel at the Internet Freedom Foundation.He added that weakening encryption by mandating traceability would undermine the privacy and security of all users and that even if there are ways to enable traceability without breaking end-to-end encryption, it would still amount to weakening the very purpose of encryption.NS Nappinai, Supreme Court lawyer and founder of CyberSaathi, said: “The government seems to have modified its stance. Till now they were categorically saying they were not asking WhatsApp to break encryption. Whereas this press release does not say that.”“WhatsApp is pitching its claim too high by weighing in only on the aspect of breaking encryption. According to me that’s likely to boomerang,” she said, adding that the government too has more to answer for.“Similarly, the government is not clarifying when and how tracing is mandated. That is, at the time the message is sent or when notice is received? This is likely to be the crux of the issue in deciding constitutionality according to me. For, if it’s at the time of sending messages that would not be sustainable at all. If it’s at the time of notice subject to all other due processes being followed, it cannot be said to be unsustainable. Providing this info is anyway contingent on the messages being on WhatsApp servers, which they have claimed will not be available after one month. Then where’s the disproportionality? Or breaking encryption?”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/whatsapp-moves-high-court-against-new-it-rules-101622073962404.html
27-05-2021||India||Yaas fury lashes east coast||Howling winds and waves the height of double-decker buses marooned villages and rendered hundreds of thousands of people homeless in eastern India as Cyclone Yaas swept inland in Odisha on Wednesday, killing four people and triggering torrential rainfall.India Meteorological Department (IMD) officials said “very severe cyclonic storm” Yaas made landfall near Barajadhauli village in Odisha’s Balasore district at 9am, and then moved north-west.Winds gusting at 140 kmph tore through coastal villages and cities in Odisha and West Bengal, crushing homes, uprooting trees and snapping power lines. Yaas coincided with the spring tide as rising waters breached river embankments and flattened mud houses.Chief minister Naveen Patnaik said the districts of Bhadrak and Balasore were worst affected and people in 128 submerged villages will get relief for the next seven days. He said power will be restored in the next 24 hours in 80% of the affected areas.West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee quoted initial estimates to say 10 million people were affected, 300.000 homes were destroyed and 134 embankments breached by Yaas-triggered storm surges.“Extensive damage has been done because the cyclone coincided with the spring tide. The water level will reach its peak, more than 5m, on Thursday morning so we have to stay alert for the next 48 hours,” she added.Yaas also caused widespread rainfall in Jharkhand and Andhra Pradesh and is expected to cause some showers in Bihar, northern West Bengal and northeastern states. “Cyclonic storm Yaas is likely to move further northwestwards and weaken gradually into a deep depression during next three hours over Jharkhand,” IMD said in the evening.In Odisha’s Keonjhar district, an elderly man was crushed to death after a tree was toppled by strong winds. In Balasore town, a young man was killed after a tree fell on him. In Mayurbhanj, an old woman died after the wall of her house collapsed. In West Bengal, a man stepped out from a cyclone relief centre to catch fish and drowned in the storm waters.Yaas is the second powerful cyclone to hit the country in 10 days, after Tauktae pummeled the western coast and killed nearly 100 people. Last year, West Bengal and Odisha were devastated by cyclone Amphan which killed 98 people.Odisha’s special relief commissioner Pradip Jena said the cyclone did not inflict any major damage on electrical and telecom infrastructure as it had considerably weakened from its initial assessment due to vertical wind shear.“Under influence of the cyclone, heavy to very heavy rainfall started in Mayurbhanj and Keonjhar district from Wednesday. The highest rainfall, 304mm, was recorded at Kusumi in Mayurbhanj district. We are also expecting that large number of trees will be uprooted in Mayurbhanj district,” he said.Jena said most roads blocked by fallen trees in Balasore, Bhadrak, Kendrtapara and Jagatsinghpur were cleared by rescue personnel. The National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) has deployed 113 teams for relief and rescue operations.Tidal surges inundated three seaside village in Balasore district marooning 5,000 people and a flash flood in Basudevpur block of Bhadrak district marooned people in 10 villages. People in Basudevpur dig up a road to divert seawater. In Mahalakpada area of Kendrapara district, several villages were flooded by seawater following breaches in saline embankment, officials said.Preliminary assessment in West Bengal estimated that it would take at least three days to assess the actual damage. “I will soon be undertaking an aerial survey of the affected areas in Purba Medinipur, South 24 Parganas and North 24 Parganas districts,” Banerjee said.Rainwater also swamped the Bengal seaside resort of Digha with visuals showing people wading through chest-deep water. Many rivers were in spate owing to the phenomenal rise in water level -- caused by the dual effect of storm surge and the astronomical tide due to the full moon.In Kolkata, too, low-lying areas along the banks of Hooghly and Tolly’s canal such as Chetla, Kalighat and Rashbehari were flooded. The high-profile assembly seat of Nandigram was flooded, as were many villages in the east Midnapore district.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/yaas-fury-lashes-east-coast-101622073533925.html
27-05-2021||India||Centenarian freedom fighter who spoke truth to power||Harohalli Srinivasaiah Doreswamy was 24 years old and just taken up a new job as a schoolteacher when he was first arrested and imprisoned for 17 months for organising strikes against the British government.His second visit to prison was at the age of 57 when he took on then prime minister Indira Gandhi during the emergency.Doreswamy has never held any political position and was the driving force behind several people’s movements in the state of Karnataka, often leading from the front, even at the age of 102.The man, known as the conscience keeper of Karnataka, as someone who always spoke for the people, regardless of the party in power, passed away at the age of 103 on Wednesday following a cardiac arrest, just days after recovering from Covid-19. His mortal remains will be cremated with state honours, said the Karnataka government.Born on April 10, 1918, in Harohalli village in the then princely state of Mysore, Doreswamy was raised by his grandfather and his mother as his father died when he was five years old.He was first drawn towards the radical movement against the British government. With help of a friend, he began planting bombs in government offices and postal boxes. “Our aim was not to harm anyone, but we wanted to disrupt the government machinery,” he told HT during an interview on February 18.His life took a turn in 1936 when Mahatma Gandhi came visiting. Doreswamy met him at Nandi hills where the father of the nation was staying -- a rest cure to recover from a spot of high blood pressure. After the meeting, Doreswamy became a follower of Gandhi.Six years later, he was at the forefront of the Quit India movement in the state. “During the Quit India Movement, I helped organise a strike by all major cloth mills in the city -- Binny Mills, Minerva Mills and Raja Mills, especially since they were stitching parachute cloth, used by the British in the Air Force during the war,” he recounts in his memoir “Nenapina Suruli Teredaga”, which translates as memories unravelled.He was jailed for 17 months between December 1942-May 1944 for this, but for Doreswamy, jail was a learning experience.“I learnt a lot during my time in the jail and it was a university for me. I learnt Hindi and Tamil. I even became good at volleyball during that time. We used to get lectures on politics from great leaders,” he said during the interview.After his release, he became the editor of “Pouravani” newspaper, which was promptly banned by the Mysore government for its forthright editorials, pushing him to publish and distribute it underground.From Vinoba Bhave’s Bhoodan movement in the 1950s to Jayaprakash Narayan’s Sampoorna Kranti movement in the 1970s to the India Against Corruption movement in the 2010s, Doreswamy was part of the several movements that followed. He was even jailed during the Emergency for writing a letter against then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi.“After the Emergency was announced, I wrote a letter to Indira Gandhi, saying she was a dictator. In the letter, I threatened to go from village to village and mobilise the people against her dictatorship. Soon after that, I held the first meeting in Gandhi Bazar (in Bengaluru). I was arrested. But I was in jail only for four months,”he recounted during the interview.In recent years, he was part of the protests against the Kaiga nuclear plant in north Karnataka and also part of the movement to get land rights for landless farmers across the state. A vocal critic of the current Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government, he came out of the streets to protest the Citizenship (Amendment) Act and the new farm laws.He was convinced that things would change.“Nothing is permanent,” he said in the interview when asked about the policies of the current BJP government. “There will be ups and downs. During the freedom struggle there was Gandhi, during the emergency there was JP (Jayaprakash Narayan) and then Anna Hazare also came, even though he was misguided later. If not a leader, there will be a movement that takes on what is wrong in our country.”The centenarian was also a big believer in the young. When asked about the future of the movements he was part of, he had said: “Today’s young people are smart and wise. The young people of the country have always fought for the right causes. They know what should be done and no one can stop them.”It was almost as if he were passing on the baton.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centenarian-freedom-fighter-who-spoke-truth-to-power-101622071967473.html
27-05-2021||India||In June, Delhi may get only 400,000 free shots for 18+||The Capital will get a little over 400,000 doses of Covid-19 vaccines directly from vaccines makers in June, according to estimates shared by the Union government to the Delhi health department, which translates to roughly 40,000 additional shots that can be given to adults above the age of 18 compared to May.The Centre also said it will send 415,810 doses in the first fortnight of the month under its vaccine supply programme, which is meant to be distributed among people aged 45 above. Compared to the first 14 days of May, this number is a drop of around 81,120 doses for this category.These estimates suggest the city is unlikely to receive any significant boost in its supplies and could run out of the free doses meant for the 18-45 age group, which the state government administers after directly procuring it from manufacturers. In the month of May, it was allotted 360,530 doses -- according to an affidavit submitted by Centre in the Supreme Court this month. The city ran out of doses for this age group on May 22.“States were informed that more stocks will be available in June, and a plan has been shared with them. The Centre has to ensure equitable distribution [of vaccine doses], and efforts are being towards that, so that there is no disparity among states,” said a central government official aware of the matter.The Union government caps the amount of doses states can buy directly from vaccine makers in ratios that account for a state’s population, and distributes its share of doses using a mechanism that is based on the severity of the outbreak in a region.It announces the doses it will distribute on a fortnightly basis, while the cap for the direct procurement is announced for the full month’s duration in advance.In a letter written to Delhi’s principal secretary (health), Vikram Dev Dutt on May 17, Manohar Agnani, additional secretary of the Union health ministry, said, “…the Phase 3 of Covid-19 vaccination is ongoing since 1st May, 2021... In this regard for your State/UT the availability of Covishield from M/s Serum Institute of India, under free supply from government of India for the first fortnight of June ’21 is 319,510 doses.”The state can procure 309,220 allocated Covishield doses on its own for the entire period of June.In a separate letter, the Centre said it will provide 96,300 doses of Covaxin during the first two weeks of June, while the state can on its own procure a maximum of 91,960 doses. Private hospitals procure doses separately.The Serum Institute of India (SII), which manufactures Covishield, and Bharat Biotech, which makes Covaxin, can together make around 70-75 million vaccine doses a month, government officials have said in recent days, and this capacity is expected to rise to around 120 million by July -- with some enhancements possible before that.“By next month [June], there will be more doses available, as companies are making all efforts to ramp up production capacity. The vaccine basket will also expand and there will be more choice,” the official added.Experts have said that the weeks ahead will be crucial to ramp up the vaccination drive as cases go down, since inoculations alone can blunt any future wave of infections without the need for more lockdowns.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-june-delhi-may-get-only-400-000-free-shots-for-18-101622067782612.html

27-05-2021||India||Lancet panel lists 8 suggestions for Centre, states to check surge||The Lancet Citizens’ Commission has recommended centralised procurement and distribution of coronavirus disease (Covid-19) vaccines free of cost instead of the current policy of decentralized procurement through state governments, as part of a set of recommendations proposed in response to the alarming resurgence of Covid-19 in India.The eight recommendations made by 21 experts were published in an article in the British medical journal, The Lancet, on Wednesday.“In response to the alarming resurgence of Covid-19 in India, authors drawn from the Commission and its network of fellows have proposed eight urgent recommendations in an article in The Lancet. These recommendations are focused on the immediate steps central and state governments must take to help curtail the loss of life and suffering caused by Covid-19 amid the recent surge in cases,” said the Commission in a press statement.The Lancet Citizens’ Commission on Reimagining India’s Health System was launched in December 2020 with the aim of laying out a road-map to achieve universal health coverage in India over the coming decade.Among other measures suggested by the members of the Commission to manage the situation in India are: district level organisation and financing of essential health services; transparent national pricing policy and caps on the pricing of all essential health services; and wide dissemination of evidence-based information on the management of Covid-19, especially on what not to do.The members also recommended the marshalling of all available human resources, including those in the private sector; an emphasis on community engagement and public participation with no restrictions on civil society organizations to access resources; complete transparency and sharing of government data to enable districts to proactively prepare for future cases ; and urgent investment in genomic sequencing.By early February, the daily new Covid-19 cases dropped to under 10,000, letting everyone believe that the worst was over. However, the numbers touched as high as 400,000 in the first week of May, catching many off-guard, and experts announcing that India was in the midst of a ferocious second Covid-19 wave.Vaccination, which experts hailed as the key to fighting subsequent waves, started going down because of the acute supply crunch that forced many states to stop vaccination in the 18-45 years category. At about 2 million doses a couple of weeks ago, the daily vaccinations dropped to about half of what was in April when the process was at its peak.The article synthesizes and amplifies the suggestions already being made by grass root level workers and experts across the country.“The humanitarian crisis the resurgence (of Covid) has precipitated requires all persons in central and state governments to set aside their political differences and work in solidarity with each other, and with civil society, to implement the eight clearly articulated recommendations in our article,” said Vikram Patel, one of the Commission members, in a statement.Patel is the Pershing Square Professor of Global Health, Harvard Medical School; Professor, Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, Cambridge, USA; and Co-founder, Sangath, Goa, India.Another member, Poonam Muttreja, executive director, New Delhi’s Population Foundation of India, said, “When it comes to Covid-19 vaccines, we are not only talking about centralization but a certain kind of centralization. It is not just about procurement of vaccines, but the Centre should also look at pricing, and equitable distribution.”Finally, the team also recommended that the profound suffering and risk to health caused by loss of livelihoods should be minimised by making provisions for cash transfers by the state to workers in India’s vast informal economy who have lost their jobs and requiring businesses not to lay-off their workers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/lancet-panel-lists-8-suggestions-for-centre-states-to-check-surge-101622066747632.html
27-05-2021||India||Book Ramdev for sedition, IMA writes to PM Modi||The Indian Medical Association (IMA) has written to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, asking that yoga guru Ramdev be booked under sedition charges for allegedly spreading misinformation on vaccination and challenging government protocols for treatment of Covid-19 patients.The letter said that in a viral video, Ramdev was seen claiming that 10,000 doctors have died in the country despite taking both the doses of the vaccine. Such statements were persuading people not to get the Covid-19 vaccines against national interest of overcoming the pandemic, IMA said in its letter. “This in our opinion is a clear-cut case of sedition in addition to causing irreversible damage to the national interest and the poor masses of this country,” read the letter by IMA.The association clarified that the country lost 753 doctors during the first wave of the pandemic when vaccines weren’t available and 513 so far during the second wave of the pandemic. “None in the first wave could receive the vaccine and the majority who had died in the second wave also could not take their vaccine for various reasons,” the letter said.The IMA alleged that this was a ploy to make profits at the expense of several lives. “We opposed certain drugs which were being falsely promoted as “curative” drugs, without any approval from the ministry or competent authorities. Ministry of AYUSH had also issued a Press Release to Patanjali to stop advertising or claiming its drug Coronil as a cure for Covid-19,” the letter said.The IMA also claimed that it was making the task of frontline workers of getting people vaccinated more difficult. “They (frontline workers) are being assaulted and attacked by people who have fallen for such rumours and superstitions. In some cases, it has been reported that people are fleeing the vaccination drives even by jumping into the river,” the letter said.The Uttarakhand chapter of IMA has also sent a ₹1,000-crore defamation notice to the Yoga guru.The Indian Medical Association had previously demanded apology from Ramdev over his remarks on allopathic medicine calling it a “stupid science”. He withdrew his statements after receiving a strong-worded letter from Union health minister Dr Harsh Vardhan, who called his remarks “inappropriate”. However, Ramdev retorted by posing 25 questions to the IMA in an ‘open letter’ on Twitter, asking if allopathy offered permanent relief for ailments such as hypertension and type-1 and 2 diabetes. He went on to list modern-day ailments such as Parkinson’s disease and wondered if allopathy had any painless cure to treat infertility as well as to reverse ageing and increase hemoglobin.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/book-ramdev-for-sedition-ima-writes-to-pm-modi-101622066755079.html
27-05-2021||India||Our planet won't be the same after Covid: Modi||The Covid-19 pandemic is a once-in-a-lifetime crisis that brought tragedy to the doorsteps of many but also resulted in humankind demonstrating its tenacity through the development of vaccines within a year, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on Wednesday.Delivering a keynote address during virtual global Vesak celebrations on the occasion of Buddha Purnima, Modi said nations around the world were witnessing a “mix of continuity and change” a year after the Covid-19 outbreak. “The Covid-19 pandemic has not left us. Several nations, including India, have experienced a second wave. This is the worst crisis humanity faces in decades. We have not seen a pandemic like this for a century,” he said.“This once-in-a-lifetime pandemic has brought tragedy and suffering at the doorstep of many. The pandemic has impacted every nation. The economic impact is huge as well. Our planet will not be the same after Covid-19.“To those who have suffered and lost their near and dear ones, I would like to extend condolences. I grieve with them.”The PM lauded the efforts of first responders, frontline workers, doctors, nurses and volunteers who “selflessly risked their lives every day to serve others in need”, and scientists who worked to develop vaccines.“But over the last year, there have been many noteworthy changes as well. We now have a better understanding of the pandemic, which strengthens our strategy to fight it. Most importantly, we have the vaccine, which is absolutely important to save lives and defeat the pandemic,” he said.“The emergence of a vaccine in a year of the pandemic striking shows the power of human determination and tenacity. India is proud of our scientists who have worked on the Covid-19 vaccines.”Vesak, which celebrates the Buddha’s birth, enlightenment and death, is an occasion to celebrate the life of the Buddha and also reflect on his ideals and sacrifices for the betterment of the planet, Modi noted.Just as the Buddha devoted his life to removing human suffering, individuals and organisations rose to the occasion over the past year and worked to reduce suffering amid the pandemic, he said. Contributions of equipment and materials were made by Buddhist organisations and followers of the religion around the world, and these actions were in line with the Buddha’s teachings of “blessings, compassion and welfare of all”, he said. Amid the fight against Covid-19, people must not lose sight of other challenges such as climate crisis since reckless lifestyles are threatening future generations, Modi said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/our-planet-won-t-be-the-same-after-covid-modi-101622066601068.html
27-05-2021||India||Serum Institute of India begins production of Covovax vaccine||The Serum Institute of India (SII) has begun at risk production of its second Covid-19 vaccine, Covovax, in India, according to people familiar with the development.US biotechnology company Novavax’s protein-based Covid-19 vaccine, NVX-CoV2373, is being locally manufactured by SII under the brand name Covovax.The company is already locally producing the Covishield vaccine developed by Oxford University and AstraZeneca.“The numbers obviously cannot be disclosed but the manufacturing and stockpiling has already begun like it happened for the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine last year; in a small way though,” a person at the industry said on condition of anonymity.The development, however, was not confirmed by the Union health ministry or the national drugs controller’s office.Besides the Covishield vaccine, SII is also committed to sharing Covovax doses with the COVAX facility to be distributed among low and middle income countries.In an interview to CNBC-TV18 last month, SII chief executive officer Adar Poonawalla said that they planned to begin stockpiling soon even though manufacturing was impacted somewhat because of curbs that the US had earlier put on export of raw materials.“…we are starting to stockpile and manufacture Covovax this month itself… Right now, we could have been making twice as much if we had the raw materials; having said that, in the next four to five months, we would have made adequate arrangements from other suppliers outside of the US which is good news, so this is only a temporary problem. We just need it for these three months; after that we will be completely self-reliant,” he said.In March, Poonawalla had informed that Covovax clinical trials had begun in India.Covovax, however, has not received regulatory clearance anywhere so far.“After Novavax gets approvals abroad with efficacy trials, then we can look at maybe launching it in India. Having said that, I still want to complete my trials in India for Covovax to be absolutely sure that this product we made is identical to Novavax, and we want to adhere to those standards before we launch the product in India, so it’s going to take two-three months. But the good news is that if we can start stockpiling enough quantities, it won’t matter because in three or four months, we can then give those doses to India, and other parts of the world. The key issue is that we are going to establish that the quality of the product that we are making and stockpiling here is identical to standard quality compared to Novavax, and that’s going to take a couple of months,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/serum-institute-of-india-begins-production-of-covovax-vaccine-101622063634956.html
27-05-2021||India||Rumblings grow within Karnataka BJP||The clamour for leadership change within the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in Karnataka has grown louder in recent days, people aware of the developments said, fuelling speculation about possible changes in the state for the BJP.While the buzz of a change in leadership has lived through several news cycles ever since BS Yediyurappa seized power in 2019, people aware of the developments said that a decision may be imminent after the second wave of the pandemic ebbs.“We are about 35-40 legislators who are hardcore party workers and have asked for things to be set right,” said a three-time BJP MLA on condition of anonymity.He said that the situation in Karnataka is “shaky” but added that “there was no guarantee” that the central leaders would consult the state legislators over any changes. At least two legislators from Karnataka were in Delhi on Tuesday to meet with the central leadership, people aware of the developments said. One of the legislators, requesting not to be identified, confirmed having gone to Delhi but refrained from divulging more about his visit. “They have had a word with state unit in-charge Arun Singh. But so far, they have not been given time to meet the party president,” a senior party functionary said.Yediyurappa’s relationship with BJP’s central leadership has soured over the last few months, adding to the challenges of the chief minister who was forced to secure his chair, assuage dissent within his own government and party as well as lead the calamity-prone state out of the raging Covid-19 pandemic at the same time; many say his handling of the Covid situation in the state hasn’t been very good. The loss in the recent bypolls in Maski, people aware of the developments said, has also added to the disenchantment of the senior leadership.“It has come to my notice that there are meetings being held in several places. Several ministers are also involved as I have noticed their statements in the media,” R Ashok, the state revenue minister and BJP MLA said on Wednesday. He is close to Yediyurappa.“That they are meeting and going to Delhi has come to my notice. All of this is 100% true, there is no doubt about it. Some people are doing it directly and some indirectly,” Ashok added.One senior leader said that there were murmurs within Karnataka but no direct signal has come from Delhi yet.The “unwritten rule” within the BJP says no person shall hold any administrative post beyond 75 years of age.

He is the first doctor at AIIMS-Patna among 102 medical practitioners in Bihar to have succumbed to the virus during the second wave of the pandemic. Already over 140 doctors have died due to the virus so far in the state, said Dr Ajay Kumar, senior vice-president of the Indian Medical Association (IMA), Bihar. A resident of Sheohar district, who did his MBBS from Patna’s Nalanda Medical College Hospital, Dr Kumar was admitted to AIIMS on April 27 and shifted to the intensive care unit the next day before being put on the ventilator. “Dr Kumar’s father passed away last year and he was the sole bread earner of his family. We request the state government as well as the AIIMS authorities to provide compensation and a job to one of his two brothers since he sacrificed his life in the war against Covid-19,” said Dr Vinay Kumar, president of the Resident Doctors’ Association, AIIMS-Patna. One death and 15 new cases of mucormycosis or black fungus, associated with coronavirus, were reported in Bihar on Wednesday, taking its total cases to 244 and deaths 14. The death was reported at Patna’s Indira Gandhi Institute of Medical Sciences. The state health department on Tuesday evening uploaded patient information on the government of India (GoI) portal, a month after the state reported the first case of mucormycosis. The health department activated its integrated disease surveillance programme (IDSP) and tasked it to upload information on the GoI portal after the Centre made it clear that it would allocate Liposomal Amphotericine-B, a specific drug for mucormycosis, to the state on the basis of the number of patients, as per information uploaded on the GoI portal. The state made mucormycosis a notifiable disease on May 22 but had failed to compile a “line list” of mucormycosis until recently. As such, it did not have exact details on patients dying due to the fungal infection. Repeated efforts to reach Manoj Kumar, executive director, State Health Society, Bihar, proved futile.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/doctor-at-aiims-patna-dies-of-covid-19-15-new-cases-of-black-fungus-in-bihar-101622057835084.html
27-05-2021||India||Chennai civic body starts home vaccination for differently abled||Chennai: After Madras high court’s directive to prioritise vaccination of people with disabilities, the Greater Chennai Corporation (GCC) has begun door-to-door inoculation for the differently abled. Medical officials and nurses visited homes of those suffering from cerebral palsy, multiple sclerosis and mental illness on Wednesday and administered Covid-19 vaccines, officials in know of the development said. The medical team then stayed back for 15 minutes to check for any post-vaccination side effects. Among the differently abled, those who could travel, vaccination was made available in camps and healthcare centres, officials said. The high court had recently directed to prioritise vaccination of people with disabilities at centres so that they don’t have to wait. Chief minister MK Stalin had launched the Covid-19 vaccination for people with disabilities on last Saturday, when 26 people were vaccinated at a wedding hall in Chennai. The government issued two helpline numbers -- 18004250111 and 9700799993 – through which the differently abled can register their names for vaccination. In a statement, GCC said a total of 169 people have registered through helpline numbers, of which 118 have been vaccinated till May 25. As many as 90 people took the vaccine through special camps while 28 at home, the GCC statement said. Meanwhile, organisations working for the differently abled have given a list of people with disabilities to be vaccinated at home to the state commissionerate for the differently abled, who in turn shared it with GCC. “Home vaccination is a relief to all persons with severe disabilities and their parents as it reduces the anxiety of managing the care, transport, safety amidst a pandemic,” said Smitha Sadasivan, an alumna of Vidya Sagar, an organization working for the differently abled, and member of Disability Rights Alliance (DRA). “Persons with disabilities are highly vulnerable due to an inaccessible environment, and some require a high degree of support in maintenance of personal hygiene, transportation and assistance,” Sadasivan added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/chennai-civic-body-starts-home-vaccination-for-differently-abled-101622057414222.html
27-05-2021||India||Rebel YSR Congress MP shifted to AIIMS||Hyderabad: Rebel YSR Congress party MP Kanumuri Raghurama Krishnam Raju, who was granted bail by Supreme Court last week in a sedition case registered by Andhra Pradesh Criminal Investigation Department (CID), was discharged from Military Hospital in Secunderabad and shifted to All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) in New Delhi on Wednesday.“The MP was discharged from the military hospital in the morning as per the doctors’ suggestions. Soon after his discharge, he left for New Delhi,” his lawyer B Adinarayana Rao said. The legislator had complained of police torture, following which the top court had directed that he be medically examined. The legislator is undergoing treatment for pain in legs and hypertension. He had undergone a bypass surgery in December. A bench comprising Justice Vineet Saran and Justice B R Gavai later granted him bail on May 21 on furnishing a personal bond of ₹1 lakh and providing two securities of the like amount before the trial court. On Monday, Raju’s lawyers had filed sureties petition in the CID court in Vijayawada as per the Supreme Court directions but the court had asked for the discharge summary of the legislator. “The doctors said it would take another four days for the discharge of Raju. So, we shall get the discharge summary only after four days,” another lawyer Lakshminarayana said. But on Wednesday, authorities at the Military Hospital discharged Raju after being convinced that his health was stable. “The CID court has given 10 days’ time for him to submit the sureties from the date of discharge from the hospital. Now that we got the discharge summary, we have time to submit the sureties in another 10 days,” Rao said.Raju, who represents Narasapuram parliamentary constituency in West Godavari district, was arrested by the Andhra CID police from his residence in Hyderabad on May 14. He was charged under Sections 124A (sedition), 153A (promoting enmity between different groups), and 505 (conducting public mischief). A statement from the agency said Raju had been indulging in hate speeches against certain communities and promoting disaffection against the government. “It was found that through his speeches on a regular basis, Mr Raju was indulging in systematic, schematic effort to cause tensions and by attacking various government dignitaries in a way which will cause loss of faith in the government which they represent,” the CID said. On the same night, Raju moved a bail petition in the state high court on medical grounds following which the court directed the government to send him to Guntur government hospital and later to a private hospital. The high court, however, rejected his bail plea and asked him to approach the lower court. The state government submitted the medical report by Guntur hospital and opposed his plea to send him to a private hospital. Raju later moved the Supreme Court for bail and also alleged that he was subjected to physical torture by CID police during his stay at the police station. On May 17, the Supreme Court ordered that Raju be admitted to Military Hospital in Secunderabad for medical examination and treatment under the supervision of a judicial officer appointed by Telangana high court. It also asked hospital authorities to submit the medical report to the court in a sealed cover. On May 21, the apex court bench confirmed that Raju had suffered a fracture in his left foot and there were bruises on both legs. Based on the report, the apex court granted him bail.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rebel-ysr-congress-mp-shifted-to-aiims-101622057354194.html
27-05-2021||India||New interface for CoWin app delayed as K’taka awaits Centre’s nod||Bengaluru: The Karnataka government’s efforts to develop a new interface for the CoWIN (Covid Vaccine Intelligence Network) mobile application, to provide state-specific features such as geo-tagging, will be delayed as the project is awaiting nod from the central government, officials aware of the development said. The Centre is currently finalising its plan to allow state governments to integrate their interfaces with the central portal that is used for Covid-19 vaccine registration, they added. Karnataka deputy chief minister Ashwath Narayan said the proposed interface in Karnataka will consist of features like geotagging for geographical limitations on vaccine distribution and details like when a person seeking vaccination last tested positive for Covid-19, among others. “There is a provision to interface it through their open API and we will build an interface on this. However, we are yet to get permission from the government of India,” Narayan told HT. The move to create an interface comes after several techies resorted to coding to secure vaccination slots on the CoWIN app. As the city ran out of slots amid huge demand, these techies targeted slots in rural areas surrounding Bengaluru. Several groups were also available on instant messaging apps through which citizens learned about available slots and managed their booking within minutes. However, people in the rural areas struggled to attain slots due to lack of technical knowledge.Explaining the status of the interface development, a senior bureaucrat in Karnataka said the central government is still working on its API policy. An API (application programming interfaces) is a set of programming code that enables data transmission between one software product and another.“Only after this API policy is finalised will we be able to complete our interface. We are looking at June 1 as a possible rollout date but we can’t be certain about this,” the official said, preferring anonymity. Several Bengaluru residents have complained of having to wait for hours at crowded vaccination centres allowing onsite registration but return home without getting inoculated. They also cited difficulties securing a slot on the CoWIN app, which makes the development of the interface crucial, especially when the state is planning to resume vaccination for the 18-44 age group. The vaccination drive for an estimated 35 million people in the 18-44 age group was initiated but called off at least thrice since May 1, with only a handful of private hospitals which managed to procure vaccines on their own currently administering doses to this age group. In Karnataka, the daily infection count has declined over the past few days but experts believe it is too early to celebrate, pointing at the fatality rate which has consistently remained above 2% in the last three days. The state, like other parts of the country, is relying on vaccination in its battle against the pandemic. On Wednesday, Karnataka reported 26,811 fresh Covid-19 cases, taking the active caseload to 4,09,924. Bengaluru accounted for 6,433 new infections, which pushed its active caseload to 2,07,357. At least 26,929people have died due to Covid-19 in the state so far, including 530 within 24 hours on Tuesday. Bengaluru accounted for 285 new fatalities on Wednesday, according to the health department data.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/new-interface-for-cowin-app-delayed-as-k-taka-awaits-centre-s-nod-101622056874313.html

All the four districts-- Katihar, Araria, Kishanganj and Purnia –known as Seemanchal share their border with Bengal.The step has been initiated following instructions from chief minister Nitish Kumar who on Tuesday instructed officials to conduct Covid-19 tests of passengers coming to the state by trains and buses from Bengal, which has a much higher positivity rate.West Bengal on May 25 reported a positivity rate of 25.7% as against 2.3% reported in Bihar. In Bihar there are 35,130 active cases and 4746 people have so far lost their lives due to the Covid-19 pandemic.The CM instructed the administration after conducting a high-level meeting on the Covid-19 situation with health department officials as well as DMs. He stressed on aggressive testing for the infection in rural areas.All the four district magistrates (DMs) of Seemanchal have been asked to keep strict surveillance on the people coming from West Bengal.“We are testing people at almost all the points adjoining West Bengal including at Dalkhola checkpoint on NH-31,” Purnia DM Rahul Kumar said adding, “Besides, health officials and panchayat representatives have been asked to keep an eye on the people coming from Bengal.”Health officials in Seemanchal districts are deeply concerned as people of two states and their villages hardly make any difference especially along the border areas. “People from Bengal villages often come to the village markets (haats) in Bihar and vice versa for shopping and it is impossible to keep a watch over them,” Ranjit Kumar a social activist based in Kishanganj said fearing the wave in the neighbouring state would badly affect the rural populace in Seemanchal in the coming days.Seemanchal districts which witnessed a record rise in Covid-19 positive cases in the second wave with over 300 deaths, has registered a dip in confirmed cases recently.Purnia civil surgeon Dr S K Verma said, “Our testing teams are visiting all the villages adjacent to West Bengal besides they are testing at various places on the road and train routes to West Bengal.”Katihar DM Udyan Mishra and Kishanganj DM Aditya Prakash have asked testing teams to remain alert on all the routes which lead to West Bengal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bihar-orders-testing-of-all-arriving-from-bengal-vigil-beefed-up-along-border-101622054715185.html
27-05-2021||India||‘No template of apt behaviour after assault’: Experts on Tarun Tejpal verdict||The Mapusa sessions court acquitted journalist Tarun Tejpal, who was being tried for raping a junior colleague, and contended that the survivor’s account “neither demonstrates any kind of normative behaviour on her own part that a prosecutrix of sexual assault on consecutive two nights might plausibly show, nor does it demonstrate any such behaviour on the part of the accused.”In the judgment, a copy of which was made available on Wednesday, Additional Sessions judge Kshama Joshi said that the prosecutrix did not prove herself a sterling witness, and pulled up the Goa police, which was investigating the case, for destroying evidence that was “inconvenient” to the investigation and would have proved Tejpal’s defence.The former editor of Tehelka magazine was accused of raping a junior colleague in an elevator of a five-star hotel in Goa during the THiNK festival in November 2013. The complainant alleged that Tejpal had raped her in a lift in the hotel on November 7 and attempted to assault her again on November 8. Tejpal, who refuted the charges in court, was acquitted by the fast-track court on May 21. The Goa government filed an appeal against the verdict in the Bombay high court on Tuesday.Admitting that the sole testimony of a rape survivor is enough to put an accused behind bars if her deposition is of “sterling quality”, the judge went on to note that the complainant’s behaviour after the purported rape was inconsistent with the charges.“The printouts of photographs clearly proves that the prosecutrix was absolutely in a good mood, happy, normal and smiling at the time she… did not look distressed or traumatized in any manner whatsoever though this was immediately a few minutes after she claims to have been sexually assaulted by the accused putting her in a state of panic and trauma,” the court said.“The circumstances’ plausibility and above all, the requirement of the prosecutrix to prove herself a sterling witness are essential in law before lending absolute credence to her word. Yet, at every stage, anomalies, discrepancies, wild inaccuracies, improvements, omissions, contradictions and sheer impossibilities mark the narrative of the prosecutrix and yet the IO [investigating officer] and the prosecution have turned a blind eye to them at every stage,” the 527-page judgement stated.Experts point out that there is no template of correct behaviour after or even during an incident of sexual assault, rape and harassment. Often survivors feel the need to appear “normal” out of fear of retribution by the assailant, women’s rights activists said.“There is a belief that a woman should react in a certain way to be worthy of justice. However, there cannot be a standard operating procedure of how a woman should behave after sexual assault,” Mumbai-based women’s rights lawyer Veena Gowda said.In an internal email sent in the days following the incident, Tejpal had said: “I apologise unconditionally for the shameful lapse of judgement that led me to attempt a sexual liaison with you on two occasions on 7 November and 8 November 2013, despite your clear reluctance that you did not want such attention from me.”However, the judge said that the email did not constitute an admission of guilt.“If the email titled ‘personal’ is looked at... it will reveal that there is absolutely no admission or confession of any incriminating fact even remotely suggesting sexual assault by the accused on the prosecutrix in the email. the word sexual assault or any of its attributes are neither implicitly nor explicitly stated in the said personal email… Even assuming that the personal email was sent to the prosecutrix, the contention of the accused that the said email had been sent involuntarily and against his wish and therefore would not be admissible against the accused has to be accepted,” the court said.The court further noted that the investigating officer in the case collected the footage from the ground floor, first and second floors of the hotel but failed to produce footage for the first floor which the judge called a “material lapse by the investigation officer”.“It can be said that because the footage of the First Floor would have wholly destroyed the prosecution’s case, the IO sought to keep out the relevant footage for the First Floor and render it unavailable,” the court said.“If the first-floor footage was viewed on 29.11.2013 where did it disappear and there is absolutely no explanation for the same from the prosecution,” the court noted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-template-of-apt-behaviour-after-assault-experts-weigh-in-on-tarun-tejpal-verdict-101622054594179.html
27-05-2021||India||SII begins production of Covovax vaccine||New Delhi The Serum Institute of India (SII) has begun at risk production of its second Covid-19 vaccine, Covovax, in India, according to people familiar with the development.US biotechnology company Novavax’s protein-based Covid-19 vaccine, NVX-CoV2373, is being locally manufactured by SII under the brand name Covovax. The company is already locally producing the Covishield vaccine developed by Oxford University and AstraZeneca.“The numbers obviously cannot be disclosed but the manufacturing and stockpiling has already begun like it happened for the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine last year; in a small way though,” a person at the industry said on condition of anonymity.The development, however, was not confirmed by the Union health ministry or the national drugs controller’s office.Besides the Covishield vaccine, SII is also committed to sharing Covovax doses with the COVAX facility to be distributed among low and middle income countries.In an interview to CNBC-TV18 last month, SII chief executive officer Adar Poonawalla said that they planned to begin stockpiling soon even though manufacturing was impacted somewhat because of curbs that the US had earlier put on export of raw materials.“…we are starting to stockpile and manufacture Covovax this month itself… Right now, we could have been making twice as much if we had the raw materials; having said that, in the next four to five months, we would have made adequate arrangements from other suppliers outside of the US which is good news, so this is only a temporary problem. We just need it for these three months; after that we will be completely self-reliant,” he said.In March, Poonawalla had informed that Covovax clinical trials had begun in India.Covovax, however, has not received regulatory clearance anywhere so far.“After Novavax gets approvals abroad with efficacy trials, then we can look at maybe launching it in India. Having said that, I still want to complete my trials in India for Covovax to be absolutely sure that this product we made is identical to Novavax, and we want to adhere to those standards before we launch the product in India, so it’s going to take two-three months. But the good news is that if we can start stockpiling enough quantities, it won’t matter because in three or four months, we can then give those doses to India, and other parts of the world. The key issue is that we are going to establish that the quality of the product that we are making and stockpiling here is identical to standard quality compared to Novavax, and that’s going to take a couple of months,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sii-begins-production-of-covovax-vaccine-101622054534120.html
27-05-2021||India||Tamil Nadu govt to bring resolution against new farm legislation||Tamil Nadu chief minister M K Stalin on Wednesday said that the government will bring a resolution in the assembly, asking the Centre to withdraw the three farm laws.The statement coincided with various farmer unions holding a ‘black day’ protest across the country to mark six months of their agitation against the three laws: Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, Farmers’ (Empowerment and Protection Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020, and Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act, 2020.In this, Tamil Nadu will join several other non-BJP and non-NDA-led states, which have passed assembly resolutions opposing legislations promulgated through ordinances last year during the first wave of the pandemic. These include Punjab, Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh, Delhi, Kerala, and West Bengal, with the eastern state passing the resolution in January, two months before the assembly elections there.A resolution for the rollback of the laws was an election promise of Stalin’s party, the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK). The CM said that six months have passed but the Union government hasn’t tried to have a constructive dialogue with the farmers to resolve the issue or taken steps to revoke the three farm laws that were passed in haste. “This is a matter of concern,” he said.The previous All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK) government, an ally of the BJP, had supported the legislation and continues to back it. “We supported the new laws because they allow the farmers to directly sell their produce through which they can gain more profits,” said AIADMK spokesperson C Vaigaichelvan.But when asked if AIADMK will not back the resolution when it’s tabled in the assembly, Vaigaichelvan said the party will hold a meeting to arrive at a fresh decision.Stalin drops cases against politicians in anti-Sterlite protestsThe Tamil Nadu government on Wednesday announced that it was withdrawing 38 cases against political leaders in connection with the anti-Sterlite protests in Thoothukudi in May 2018 in which 13 people had been killed in police firing. This includes Marumalarchi Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam chief Vaiko, Amma Makkal Munnetra Kazhagam founder T T V Dhinakaran, Communist Party of India leader R Nallakannu, and Desiya Murpokku Dravida Kazhagam treasurer Premalatha Vijayakanth.This was based on the recommendations by the Justice Aruna Jegadeesan commission in an interim report, the government said in a statement.Last week, cases against the protesters were withdrawn, and 93 people were offered compensation.However, cases against other protesters filed by the Central Bureau of Investigation and those pending in the Supreme Court have not been withdrawn.The protesters had been demanding the closure of a copper smelting factory owned by Vedanta when things turned violent on the 100th day, leading to police firing on May 22, 2018. A day later, the then AIADMK government appointed the Justice Jegadeesan committee to investigate the case and shut down the factory for environmental violations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tn-govt-to-bring-resolution-against-new-farm-legislation-101622054414770.html

27-05-2021||India||Share compliance details: Govt to social media firms||The Indian government has written to all social media companies such as Facebook and Twitter to send details of their compliance officer, nodal contact person, resident grievance officer and physical contact address in India, asking them to confirm if they have complied with the new Information Technology Act guidelines after the deadline to do so ended on Tuesday.The guidelines, seen as controversial by the industry as well as activists, put in place a new mechanism for companies to regulate content, appoint officers who will be liable for compliance, and adopt features such as traceability of messages and voluntary user verification.“Government through a separate notification has also prescribed that a social media intermediary having fifty lakh (5 million) registered users in India will be considered a Significant Social Media Intermediary (SSMI),” the ministry of electronics and information technology (Meity) said in its communication to the companies.“Additional set of due diligence for SSMI and are being administered. The additional due diligence required from SSMI have come into effect today, at the conclusion of three additional months given to SSMIs.”The government asked the social media intermediaries to preferably share the details by the end of Wednesday.Most of the prominent companies, including social media giants Facebook and Twitter, instant messaging application WhatsApp, and Google are yet to comply with the new rules, the deadline for which lapsed on May 25.While WhatsApp has a resident grievance officer, it is yet to appoint a compliance officer. Twitter and Facebook too have not appointed anyone yet.Facebook on Tuesday said it aims to comply with the new guidelines but indicated there were unresolved issued.Google has advertised for the post of a compliance officer and in a statement said that it “respects India’s legislative process”. “We respect India’s legislative process and have a long history of responding to government requests to remove content where the content violates the local law or our product policies. We realise that our work in keeping our platforms secure is never done and we will continue to refine our existing approaches, and evolve our policies and be as transparent as possible about how we make decisions,” a Google spokesperson said.The government has further asked social media intermediaries to specify why they may not be considered a significant one by providing the number of registered users on the platform. “The Government reserves the right to seek any additional information, as may be permitted within these Rules and the IT Act,” it wrote.Under part four of the guidelines, the intermediaries are required to appoint compliance officers, “responsible for ensuring compliance with the Act and rules” and be “liable in any proceedings relating to any relevant third-party information, data or communication link made available or hosted by that intermediary where he fails to ensure that such intermediary observes due diligence while discharging its duties under the Act”.Intermediaries are also required to appoint nodal contact persons for 24x7 coordination with law enforcement agencies and resident grievance officers.Koo, the Indian social media app, has announced it had complied with the new requirements and appointed a resident grievance officer, chief compliance officer, and nodal contact officer.HT on Monday reported that officials warned of stern action if the companies did not adhere to the deadline.The new policy also includes bringing digital news publishers under the ambit of Section 69(A) of the Information Technology (IT) Act. The provision empowers the government to order the blocking of access to content that is considered a threat to public order.An officer, who will head an inter-ministerial committee at the apex of the three-tier self-regulatory system, can also issue this order under emergency circumstances where the companies will not be given a chance for explanation. The committee will have to meet within 48 hours to ratify the emergency block. The news media publishers and over the top (or streaming) such as Netflix and Hotstar, will fall under the ambit of the ministry of information and broadcasting.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/share-compliance-details-govt-to-social-media-firms-101622054354208.html
27-05-2021||India||Cyclone Yaas: 4 killed, mass evacuations minimise loss||Mass evacuation of people from the coastal areas of Odisha and West Bengal saved a lot of lives as cyclone Yaas made landfall in Odisha on Wednesday morning, said government officials. Four deaths were reported in the two states till evening.Yaas wasn’t as ferocious as the India Meteorological Department (IMD) had predicted it to be when it hit the Odisha coast. But it still caused the sea to surge up to four metres, inundating coastal villages in Balasore and Bhadrak where it made landfall. The wind speed stayed between 130 and 145 km/hr, less than the predicted speed of 155-165 km/hr, but it was enough to knock down trees and walls, resulting in three deaths.Odisha chief secretary Suresh Mohapatra said they evacuated over 650,000 people, most of them from Balasore, Kendrapara and Bhadrak districts. “The CM wanted no casualties, so we ensured that no person living in kutcha houses near the coast remained there. Many kutcha houses collapsed due to storm surge and high winds, but people living in those houses did not die as they had been evacuated,” Mohapatra said.Professor Santosh Kumar of the National Institute of Disaster Management in Delhi, who has studied the post-disaster response of Odisha in the 1999 super cyclone and the 2019 Fani cyclone, said Odisha has come a long way in minimising the loss of human life in successive disasters by physically removing people to shelters.“Odisha has been able to protect its people. That’s the most important part. In terms of bringing down the number of lives lost and people getting affected, the state has done well. This has never happened in one day. Odisha built multi-purpose cyclone shelters under National Cyclone Risk Mitigation Project and effectively empowered the local communities while building an early warning dissemination system with last-mile connectivity,” said Kumar.Dr Kailash Gupta, director of the India chapter of The International Emergency Management Society, echoed Kumar. “The first rule of any cyclone is to keep people away from its path. Odisha has done wonderfully well in that aspect. Besides, they are using technology intelligently. The huge number of cyclone shelters that have come up in last 20 years is helping the State in no small measure,” Gupta said.But he added that Odisha needs to do a lot to minimise infrastructure damage. “In 2019, when Fani struck, Bhubaneswar was without power for almost 10 days while it took over a month to bring power to Puri, the ground zero of the cyclone. A poor state like Odisha can’t afford such a huge blow to its infrastructure on a regular basis and needs to build infrastructure that is resilient to disaster. The state needs to graduate to the next level,” Gupta said.West Bengal launched the biggest evacuation drive the state has ever undertaken before any calamity. More than 1.5 million people were evacuated since Monday and shifted to 14,000 cyclone shelters and relief camps.When Amphan had hit the state in May 2020, around one million people had been evacuated. Yaas spared it, but the storm surge flooded many areas. One person who was evacuated to a relief shelter was killed when he went out for fishing.“The chief minister stayed back at the control room at the state secretariat on Tuesday. She virtually spoke to the district magistrates and pressed that more people be evacuated and brought to the relief centres,” said a senior state government official requesting anonymity.District officials had been taking steps to evacuate people since May 22. “We had told the villagers to keep their important documents such as marksheets, identity cards and bank passbooks in one polythene bag along with some dry food so that they could be rushed to cyclone shelters without delay,” said an official of North 24 Parganas district.People living in remote islands were evacuated on May 24 because the sea was expected to be rough by May 25. Pregnant women were also evacuated from some remote islands in the Sunderbans at least 48 hours before the cyclone hit.Gupinath Bhandari, associate professor of civil engineering at Jadavpur University, said Yaas cannot be compared to other cyclones such as Amphan and Aila that had directly hit the state, killing many people. “But this time we saw very good coordination at every level. Control rooms were set up right up to the block level and the chief minister was sitting at the secretariat, monitoring and giving instructions. This I think made the difference,” said Bhandari, who has specialisation in disaster management.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cyclone-yaas-4-killed-mass-evacuations-minimise-loss-101622054235423.html
27-05-2021||India||Book Ramdev for sedition, IMA writes to PM||New Delhi: The Indian Medical Association (IMA) has written to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, asking that yoga guru Ramdev be booked under sedition charges for allegedly spreading misinformation on vaccination and challenging government protocols for treatment of Covid-19 patients.The letter said that in a viral video, Ramdev was seen claiming that 10,000 doctors have died in the country despite taking both the doses of the vaccine. Such statements were persuading people not to get the Covid-19 vaccines against national interest of overcoming the pandemic, IMA said in its letter. “This in our opinion is a clear-cut case of sedition in addition to causing irreversible damage to the national interest and the poor masses of this country,” read the letter by IMA. The association clarified that the country lost 753 doctors during the first wave of the pandemic when vaccines weren’t available and 513 so far during the second wave of the pandemic. “None in the first wave could receive the vaccine and the majority who had died in the second wave also could not take their vaccine for various reasons,” the letter said. The IMA alleged that this was a ploy to make profits at the expense of several lives. “We opposed certain drugs which were being falsely promoted as “curative” drugs, without any approval from the ministry or competent authorities. Ministry of AYUSH had also issued a Press Release to Patanjali to stop advertising or claiming its drug Coronil as a cure for Covid-19,” the letter said. The IMA also claimed that it was making the task of frontline workers of getting people vaccinated more difficult. “They (frontline workers) are being assaulted and attacked by people who have fallen for such rumours and superstitions. In some cases, it has been reported that people are fleeing the vaccination drives even by jumping into the river,” the letter said. The Uttarakhand chapter of IMA has also sent a ₹1,000-crore defamation notice to the Yoga guru. The Indian Medical Association had previously demanded apology from Ramdev over his remarks on allopathic medicine calling it a “stupid science”. He withdrew his statements after receiving a strong-worded letter from Union health minister Dr Harsh Vardhan, who called his remarks “inappropriate”. However, Ramdev retorted by posing 25 questions to the IMA in an ‘open letter’ on Twitter, asking if allopathy offered permanent relief for ailments such as hypertension and type-1 and 2 diabetes. He went on to list modern-day ailments such as Parkinson’s disease and wondered if allopathy had any painless cure to treat infertility as well as to reverse ageing and increase hemoglobin.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/book-ramdev-for-sedition-ima-writes-to-pm-101622054234200.html

27-05-2021||India||B.1.617 spread grows in India and overseas||The B.1.617 variant has become the most dominant in the country, Union health minister Harsh Vardhan announced on Monday, confirming growing clues from the global scientific community that show the mutated virus has spread rapidly not just within India but in several other nations.The minister said this variant now accounts for 65% of all variants of concern found in India when researchers carried out whole genome sequencing of samples. This data matches information uploaded to a global database known as the GISAID Initiative, where the variant accounts for over 70% of samples analysed in the most recent 45-day period in India, and has spread to 49 other countries.“When we talk about genome sequencing, over 25,739 samples have been sequenced by INSACOG and 9,508 were found with variants of concern. Out of these, B.1.617 variant was found in almost 65% of the samples making it one of the most common variants,” said Harsh Vardhan, who was speaking at the 27th meeting of the high-level Group of Ministers (GoM) on Covid-19.Also read | Covid-19: What you need to know todayThe INSACOG is a consortium of 10 institutes of the Centre, which is involved in the genome sequencing of the Sars-CoV-2 virus. The health minister also said that state governments have been requested to send the samples regularly for genome sequencing.The B.1.617 is a variant with three sub-lineages – B.1.617.1, B.1.617.2 and B.1.617.3.While the minister did not give frequency data, GISAID data analysed by outbreak.info showed the spread has been rapid: In the last 45 days, B.1.617.1 and B.1.617.2 together account for 70% of all Sars-CoV-2 genomes sampled in India. Of these, B.1.617.2 appears to be particularly gaining prevalence, rising from around 1% prevalence on March 1 to over 70% in the beginning of May.Till Monday, there were 14,737 sequences uploaded from India. Sequences data uploaded to GISAID allows researchers to study the timing and distribution of variants – a level of detail that Indian authorities have not fully disclosed.According to outbreak.info, Maharashtra, Gujarat, Delhi and Bihar may have the highest proportion of cases with B.1.617.2.In the case of B.1.617.1, which is slightly different and appears to have been overtaken by B.1.617.2 in recent days, the states with the highest prevalence are Maharashtra, Haryana, Andhra Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh.To be sure, these are not based on random sampling and prevalence may be biased based on how widely and regularly a state sends samples for whole genome sequencing.Also read: No proof that kids will be affected more in the next wave, say expertsMaharashtra, with 3,250 sample data shared on GISAID, has carried out the most genome sequencing than any other state. In comparison, Uttar Pradesh, with the largest population in the country, has uploaded 34.“Unfortunately, we are still very under sampled in terms of the sequencing data in India so hard to tell what exactly is happening. Specifically, how the B.1.1.7 lineage and B.1.617 lineage and sublineages are competing. Right now, most of our preliminary analyses are coming from the data out of the UK,” said G Karthik, researcher at Scripps Research Institute, which has put together the mutations tracker at outbreak.info.The B.1.617 lineage has triggered alarm in several other countries and has been designated a variant of concern by most health agencies. In the US, federal health officials said late on Sunday they are ramping up their surveillance of the variant as experts warned that under-vaccinated areas could become hot spots as the country opened up.Late on May 22, the UK released preliminary assessments that show vaccines, while still effective, may have a reduced ability to prevent symptomatic disease with the new variant, especially if people have only taken one dose, as compared to how they worked with the old variant.Public Health England, in its latest technical briefing, also found that the variant first seen in India leads to more secondary infections than the B.1.1.7 variant, which was first seen in the UK and was among the first set of mutations that could spread faster than the virus that was originally seen in Wuhan.Another analysis of GISAID data showed 50 countries have together found B.1.617.2 in over 7,500 samples. Of these, 1,200 have been shared from India, which first found the variant in a sample taken on December 10. Since then, India has uploaded 7,476 samples while the UK, which has done the highest amount of sequencing, has shared 331,773 samples since it first found the variant on March 18, according to cov-lineages.org.Cov-lineages.org also showed that there were a large proportion of samples with the lineages recently in Hong Kong, DR Congo, China, Bangladesh and Singapore.India passed 300,000 confirmed coronavirus deaths on Monday, with fatalities remaining high despite the country flattening out the number of new cases in its devastating pandemic wave. Experts have on several occasions called for authorities to do more to improve the rate of genome sequencing in order to catch dangerous variants before they become widespread.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/b1617-spread-grows-in-india-and-overseas-101621898174172.html
27-05-2021||Today's||Covid-19 and the disease of inequality||Abandoned by the State that insisted on locking down, refusing to recognise the damage done to their livelihoods, India’s workers asserted their rights and made themselves heard by walking home in March 2020. The long march home was emblematic of the suffering and hardship unleashed by the first wave.A year later, it is India’s broken health system and the suffering it has unleashed even on the most privileged that have dominated public imagination. Ironically, the scale of the health crisis has rendered invisible the deepening livelihood crisis that India confronts, drowning out the voices that fought a callous State and asserted their rights barely a year ago. It is a measure of how easily the State abandons its people that two months into the second wave, the looming livelihood crisis awaits acknowledgement by the government and relief, such as it is, remains sporadic and inadequate. The poor, long abandoned by India’s broken health system, is now being forced to suffer the indignity of abandoning their dead.Also Read | India runs the risk of losing its pharma edgeThe second wave hit an economy that was showing signs of deepening structural inequality caused by Covid-19. The recently released State of Working India report by researchers at the Azim Premji University points out that 2020 saw a dramatic decrease in incomes for a majority of India’s workers. The cumulative income loss was higher among poorer households (27% for the bottom 10%). For the poor, the loss of income on a low base inevitably resulted in a significant cutback in consumption. A Hunger Watch survey points out that in October 2020, one in three respondents reported skipping meals “sometimes” or “often”, and 71% of households reported a worsening in the nutritional quality of their food intake.The dynamics of India’s post-lockdown economic recovery pointed to a structural problem, which India failed to confront in 2020. The formal economy, notably large, saw listed firms benefitting through the pandemic at the cost of, as economist Pranjul Bhandari has pointed out, putting several small and informal firms that employ the bulk of India’s workers, in distress. This profit-led, jobless recovery saw formal salaried employees entering informal employment. Drawing on Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy (CMIE) data, the State of Working India report reveals that nearly half of India’s formal salaried workers moved into informal work, either as self-employed (30%), casual wage (10%) or informal salaried (9%) workers, in 2020.The State, on its part, responded with a bare minimal relief. This did little to stem rising inequality. The limited fiscal stimulus and lack of income support arguably contributed to deepening inequality, even as it provided some succour against extreme hunger and starvation.The second wave has brought with it a new set of challenges that will exacerbate inequality. First, because the Centre has abdicated all responsibility, state governments are charting their course. The result has been a medley of state-level lockdowns, with the burden of providing economic relief now solely on state governments.In principle, state governments ought to lead the charge on relief and income support, for they are likely to face differential economic consequences, linked to disease transmission dynamics and state-specific socioeconomic profiles. However, now that states are being asked to take on the financial burden for vaccines, health infrastructure and relief, adequate fiscal support, denied in the first wave from the Centre to states, is critical. Absent this, relief measures, especially in poorer states, will inevitably be sporadic and inadequate.Also Read | Tough but crucial lockdown decision enabled Delhi to tame deadliest waveSecond, state governments have failed to learn crucial lessons from 2020. The one relief measure announced by the Centre, and complemented by state-specific efforts, has been the reinstatement of last year’s provision of supplementary food rations through the public distribution system (PDS). However, migrant workers were ignored. It has taken the interventions of the Supreme Court to get state governments to expand grain provision to migrant workers who, despite grand announcements of one-nation one-ration card, still do not have access to PDS outside their home states. And even today, bureaucratic obsession with paperwork and the need to distribute temporary ration cards, is coming in the way of enabling easy access. In recent weeks, NGOs are reporting a rise in distress calls.Finally, unlike last year, Covid-19 is now spreading to rural areas. In 2020, India’s workers relied heavily on the rural economy to survive the crisis and the economy depended on rural demand. This is not the case now. CMIE data is indicating increased unemployment in rural India in May. And demand for Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS) has outstripped supply. The livelihood crisis is visible and stark.Reports have it that the Centre is mulling over a fiscal stimulus, no doubt worrying about its implications for fiscal deficit and spooking markets. Yet the longer the government takes to act, the greater will be the demand shock. The policy prescriptions are well known. We need expanded fiscal support to state governments, universal PDS, continuous and expanded funding of MGNREGS. The Indian economy cannot afford a callous State. If not for citizens, then at least for the markets, the State needs to act now.Yamini Aiyar is president and chief executive, Centre for Policy Research The views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/covid19-and-the-disease-of-inequality-101622117390142.html
27-05-2021||Today's||India runs the risk of losing its pharma edge||The world now agrees that the only solution to the Covid-19 pandemic is to vaccinate, vaccinate, vaccinate. New Delhi has joined the consensus, thanks to a brutal second Covid-19 wave. Equally belatedly, India has realised there is a race among countries seeking vaccine dominance. A major step in India’s new vaxpolitik was placing jabs at the heart of an upgraded British relationship and in its present interactions with the United States (US).The world has so far produced two billion vaccine doses but needs 11 billion more by year-end —with several billion boosters possibly needed every subsequent year. The countries on top of this process will benefit enormously, from goodwill to profits to know-how.India, long the world’s largest vaccine maker, could lose its crown of jabs. It excels in mass manufacturing, but lags in innovation. The country’s workhorse Covid-19 vaccine, made by the Serum Institute of India, uses a British formula. Worse, there is no Indian vaccine using mRNA technology, though one is in the works, and this is the future of vax tech. With the world’s largest child population, vaccines crucial to its pharma sector, and for national security concerns, India needs to work hard to ensure its vaccine throne is not usurped.Also Read | Covid-19 vaccine supply hasn’t closed, says Dr VK PaulTo stay ahead of the pack, India must create its own pack. This means international partners for funding, tech and markets. The Astra Zeneca-Serum Institute-Oxford University triad is seen as exemplary leading to inexpensive vaccines, zero patent hassles and export opportunities. Britain’s pharma sector is infused with a non-profit culture. All of this provides a template for a future bilateral partnership in vaccines, diagnostics and more. In contrast, while US inputs are indispensable to India’s vaccine production, New Delhi’s experience with US big pharma has been bruising – Pfizer and Merck were at the forefront of the intellectual property rights (IPR) pharma battles between India and the US in the 1990s and early 2000s, which still rankles.The meat of the new India-United Kingdom (UK) relationship is medicinal. Foreign minister S Jaishankar highlighted the “action plan on health and life sciences, that includes cooperation on vaccines, therapeutics and diagnostics”. The bilateral road map puts down the ambitious target of “helping guarantee equitable global supply [of Covid vaccine] by April 2022.” As important is the long-term plan to align medical standards, institutions and people.Britain was a thought-out choice. Its medical researchers are second in quality citations using the H index, number two in medicine Nobels, and its universities are among Europe’s best. And London is willing. Prime Minister Boris Johnson often cites the Astra Zeneca success, but also needs partners to fulfil his government’s plans “to develop vaccines against emerging diseases in 100 days.”New Delhi’s science bureaucracy was fixated on simply adding more vaccine assembly lines. Foreign assistance was treated as only about funds – like the Quad vaccine agreement. Overseas tie-ups for new technologies were spurned. It was proud of a domestic pipeline of 30 plus vaccine possibilities, even though few are cutting edge and their development meant a leisurely time frame. Events have tragically shown this attitude as misguided. India should have put vaccines on mission mode; instead, they were left to a five-year plan.A longer-term problem is the lack of urgency about mastering mRNA vaccine technology. Mutating viruses require nimble vaccines. The older technologies India depends on have gestation periods of 10 years or more. mRNA vaccines can be put together at warp speed — no living cells are needed, fewer ingredients are required, and batches can be cooked up in two hours. Next-gen mRNA are scalable and do not require deep freezers.Also Read | India scraps local trials for Covid vaccines to fast-track importsPresently, Gennova is the only Indian firm with an mRNA candidate. If the next few years are a race between Covid variants and vax upgrades, mRNA will become the global standard. And if India does not find allies to develop its own versions, it will lose its vaccine supremacy and end up seeing its own costs rise. China has begun trials of its first mRNA vaccine, Walvax. Pfizer’s CEO has told investors he plans to sell Covid boosters for $150 plus.Signing up with Britain is not the only element of India’s new vaxpolitik. The US, the European Union and Japan are crucial as well. A single vaccine vial can require as many as 200 different ingredients and components. Many of these are monopolies. The capping technology used in all mRNA vaccines, for example, is the monopoly of one US firm. When the Indian foreign minister and his US counterpart, Anthony Blinken, met at the G-7 foreign minister’s meeting, vaccines were topic number one on the agenda — as will be the theme of their discussion during Jaishankar’s current visit to Washington.Vaxpolitik requires the country’s health care and life science bureaucracy to think in strategic terms, with India as part of a global coalition rather than a stand-alone nation. A deep-seated tradition to see pharmaceuticals as a matter of price haggling, using other’s intellectual property, and sticking with obsolete processes needs to be changed.Washington’s leftward shift on the issue may mean India will get patent waivers for mRNA ingredients. If so, New Delhi needs to have a plan to help Indian pharma firms master the new techniques and standards required. Vaccines were once a sleepy low-margin high-volume niche that pharma multinationals were happy to leave to India. It is set to become cut-throat, high-tech and geopolitical with no guarantee India will come out a winner.The views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/india-runs-the-risk-of-losing-its-pharma-edge-101622114315490.html
