05-05-2021||News||A self-destructive consensus explains the CPI(M)’s West Bengal disaster||The Communist Party of India (Marxist) or CPI (M) has failed to open its account in the West Bengal assembly. The party-led Left Front (LF) ruled the state from 1977-2011. For an established political party within a democratic set-up to atrophy within a decade, is a rare, if not an unprecedented, political event.To be sure, the CPI(M)’s decimation in West Bengal should not come as a surprise. It has lost ground in the state in every election since the 2009 Lok Sabha. That this could not be arrested in time in what is a Stalinist organisation — the CPI(M) still adheres to the principle of democratic centralism where the lower leadership is constitutionally bound by the decision of the higher leadership — entails that the buck, when it comes to the CPI(M)’s decimation in West Bengal, stops right at the top.The history of decline A brief recap of the West Bengal CPI(M)’s recent history is useful for this discussion.In 2006, the LF under the leadership of Buddhadeb Bhattacharya scored a massive victory, winning 236 out of the 294 assembly constituencies (ACs) in the state. It interpreted this victory as an endorsement of its line of krishi amader bhitti, shilpo amader bhobishyet (agriculture is our base and industry will be our future). The 2006 victory was followed by announcements of large-scale industrial projects, including the ones in Singur and Nandigram.Trouble erupted in these places once the state-led land acquisition was started. Ironical as it may sound, the West Bengal leadership of the CPI(M), a party which had built its political fortunes by mobilising the peasantry on the land question, displayed a misplaced vanguardism in the wake of such protests. All opposition was dismissed as either a conspiracy or anti-industry dogma. Senior leaders of the party described the protesting peasants as children who did not know that the injection they were getting was necessary. Even setbacks in the 2008 panchayat elections failed to forewarn the party leadership of what was coming. In fact, they conveniently deployed a red herring to successfully obfuscate their own mistakes.In July 2008, a couple of months after the panchayat polls and less than a year before the 2009 general elections, the Left parties withdrew support from the United Progressive Alliance (UPA) government on the question of the Indo-US nuclear deal. Mamata Banerjee, who had recorded her worst-ever performances in the 2004 and 2006 elections, jumped at this opportunity. The All India Trinamool Congress (TMC) formed an alliance with the Congress in the 2009 Lok Sabha polls. The TMC-Congress alliance won 26 out of the 42 Lok Sabha seats in these elections, while the LF, for the first time since 1977, fell below the halfway mark.The West Bengal leadership of the CPI(M), in collaboration with a section of the all-India leadership, blamed its reverses on the decision to withdraw support from the UPA, which led to a TMC-Congress alliance. This argument was based on superfluous logic. The LF had polled more than 50% votes in both 2004 and 2006 elections. Had its own supporters not deserted it — its vote share came down to 43% and 41% in 2009 and 2011 — it would not have lost, no matter what the index of opposition unity.An inability to course-correct The LF government and the CPI(M), while admitting that the police firing in Nandigram was a mistake, kept defending its land acquisition policy. This gave the TMC an opportunity to portray the CPI(M) as anti-peasant and it gained further ground, eventually unseating the 34 year old LF government in 2011. A senior party leader from West Bengal used to campaign in a Nano car when he would contest the elections. The party released an audio-clip of an ailing Buddhadeb Bhattacharya even in these elections, defending the LF’s industrialisation (seen as forced land acquisition by most) policy.This is in sharp contrast to the conduct of the Kerala unit of the CPI(M). It defended the Supreme Court (SC) 2018 ruling allowing entry to women of all age-groups in the revered Hindu shrine of Sabarimala and invested significant amount of political capital in championing its stance. The move backfired badly, and the Congress-led alliance won 19 out of the 20 seats in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections.The CPI(M) manoeuvred itself out of this tight spot at the first opportunity when a larger SC bench stayed the original judgment. It also sent conciliatory gestures to sections which were against this decision by withdrawing police cases filed during the agitation. This has played an important role in the party’s victory in the 2021 elections in Kerala.There is no reason to believe that the CPI(M) has revised its principled position vis-a-vis the women entry issue in Sabarimala, whatever its merits or demerits. But the Kerala party has had the political wisdom to realise that a political party can only bring policy change, and more importantly survive, only if it is in power and does not keep alienating its supporters.Searching for an elusive silver bulletTo come back to West Bengal, the CPI (M) leadership, instead of realising its mistake after losing power in 2011, was still obsessed with finding a silver bullet which could put it back in power in the state. This entirely ignored the fact that while land acquisition was the immediate trigger, there were deeper political economy reasons which had contributed to the CPM’s problems in West Bengal, as documented in political scientist Dwaipayan Bhattacharyya’s book Governance as Practice: Democratic Left in a Transforming India. But there was no effort to deal with these issues.The CPI(M) thought it had found this silver bullet in 2012, when the Congress put up Pranab Mukherjee as the presidential candidate. By announcing its support to Mukherjee, the CPI(M)’s West Bengal leadership and those sympathetic to them in the all-India leadership thought that a wedge could be created between the TMC and the Congress in West Bengal and that the CPI(M) would reap the benefits of this wedge in a first-past-the-post system.These hopes were demolished in the 2014 Lok Sabha polls and 2016 assembly elections. The TMC fought on its own in 2014 and won convincingly. The CPI(M)’s own tally dropped to just two Lok Sabha seats. The party then took the Congress question a step further and formed an alliance with it in the 2016 elections. This time, it ceded even the opposition party status to the Congress.The CPI(M) central committee, its highest decision making body, in its review of the 2016 elections, “concluded that the electoral tactics adopted in West Bengal was not in consonance with the Central Committee decision not to have an alliance or understanding with the Congress”. No disciplinary action was taken against the people responsible for violating party discipline though. Neither has anyone in the leadership taken responsibility of the party’s never ending debacle and stepped down. Even bourgeois parties are far more forthcoming when it comes to fixing individual responsibility for electoral reverses.The 2021 debacle2019 and 2021 were mere formalities in the CPI(M)’s atrophying. It did not win even one assembly segment in both these elections and will now suffer the ignominy of being a communist party whose only pre-poll ally in the assembly will be a legislator from the Indian Secular Front, which has been floated on the eve of elections by a religious cleric.It remains to be seen whether the CPI(M) central committee, in its review of the 2021 elections, finds that the electoral tactics of allying with a religious cleric’s party was (again) not in consonance with the basic principle of keeping religion and politics separate.What is even more remarkable is the fact that during this entire period, there has never been any precipitation or division of opinion (at least officially) within the CPI(M) over the West Bengal question or the leadership’s role in handling it. This clearly shows that the relationship between the West Bengal and all-India leadership of the party has been that of a tail wagging the dog. While the proponents of the West Bengal line might have been wrong, those who have accepted these positions within the party uncritically for the sake of unity cannot absolve themselves of their complicity in the CPI(M)’s decimation in what used to be its strongest bastion.Even in the 2019 elections, the CPI(M) had polled 3.6 million votes in West Bengal, which was almost double the 1.8 million it had polled in the rest of the country excluding Kerala. Without a revival in West Bengal, the CPI (M) will be reduced to just a party in Kerala. If the party does not make radical decisions to resuscitate itself in West Bengal — and the 2023 panchayat elections will be the litmus test — every serious political observer will treat it as a Kerala-based regional party, with some isolated islands of limited influence elsewhere.In 2024, when the Narendra Modi government will seek its third term in office, the CPI(M) will be celebrating its 60th anniversary. 60 is also the age of retirement in India. The commissars who sit in AKG Bhawan, the all-India headquarters of the party in New Delhi, face the challenge of preventing a permanent retirement of the CPI(M) from the national political stage. If they cannot break out of their self-destructive consensus, they must retire themselves in the interests of the Left movement in India.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/a-self-destructive-consensus-explains-the-cpi-m-s-west-bengal-disaster-101620206604074.html
05-05-2021||News||India to see expansion of agri sector in summer, despite Covid pandemic||India has forecast an expansion of agriculture despite a massive surge in Covid-19 numbers, as farmers are projected to raise output to record levels in the oncoming kharif or summer-sown season, following a pandemic-defying performance in 2020. The Union government is anticipating an increase in sowing and higher demand from the farm sector. It has issued instructions for the seamless availability and supply of critical inputs, such as fertilisers, seeds, pesticides, and machinery. Millions of farmers have worked hard to keep agricultural operations going throughout the pandemic, aided by an exemption of the farm sector from Covid-related restrictions. The pandemic has hit urban centres and smaller towns harder, relatively sparing farming activities in the countryside, another reason why the farm sector has outpaced other spheres of the economy. Nearly half (48%) of all Covid-19 cases reported in India in March were from urban areas, home to just 14% of the population, with cities having the largest proportion of new infections since June 2020, according to an April 8 analysis by the HT. “We expect a nearly 10% increase in fertiliser demand,” an official of the agriculture ministry said, requesting not to be named. Also Read | Cabinet approves PMGKAY food aid schemeA key reason for the optimism has been the forecast of a normal 2021 monsoon, the third straight year of optimal rains. The India Meteorological Department on April 16 forecast rainfall during the June-to-September monsoon season to be 98%. Rainfall between 94-106% is considered “normal”. On April 27, fertiliser minister DV Sadananda Gowda reviewed the demand-supply situation. In the meeting, officials projected that fertiliser demand could be around 35 million tonne in the summer-sown season, up from 32 million tonne during the corresponding period last year, a second official said. The review concluded that the country has enough stocks of fertilisers. On April 30, agriculture minister Narendra Tomar led a meeting of strategists and officials who will steer the so-called “Kharif Campaign 2021”. Tomar announced a higher foodgrains production target of 307 million tonnes for 2021-22, up from 301.92 million tonne in 2020-21. According to a presentation by agriculture commissioner Suresh Malhotra at the meet, there were sufficient supplies of seeds, fertilisers, pesticides and machinery, except soyabean and maize seeds. States have been asked to procure these seeds from the National Seed Corporation and farmers could use their own “saved seeds” from previous harvests in case of an emergency, he said. In 2020, when a harsh lockdown stoked a countrywide recession, the agriculture sector showed resilience to register positive growth. It grew 3.4% in the June 2020 quarter, when rest of the economy shrunk -24.4%. All-India growth returned to positive territory in the December 2020 quarter, the latest available data, expanding 0.4%. Agriculture grew at 3.9% in the same quarter.“When you have a normal monsoon, that in itself takes care of most of the issues in agriculture. But the government should also be ready with adequate plans for patches where droughts are still possible in a normal year,” said RS Mani, a former faculty of the Tamil Nadu Agricultural University.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/india-to-see-expansion-of-agri-sector-in-summer-despite-covid-pandemic-101620201562505.html
05-05-2021||News||In state elections, when incumbents had a high success ratio||One indicator of the competitiveness of an election is the ability of incumbent candidates to secure their re-election, or individual incumbency. It is usually understood that contrary to most democracies, incumbent candidates in India face a disadvantage towards their challengers when they seek re-election. Individual incumbency data also allows to map turncoat candidates and their performance.In this article, we use an original dataset, derived from Election Commission of India (ECI) data and the results of the 2021 state elections, to explore the performance of incumbent candidates and turncoats.A high re-running incumbents’ ratio Except for Puducherry, most sitting members of the legislative assembly (MLAs) got a chance to re-run and win a consecutive term. 83% of all sitting MLAs in Kerala and 73% of all sitting MLAs in Assam re-ran, which is unusually high.In West Bengal, multiple defections and changes of strategy have led parties to let 65% of all sitting MLAs re-run. Less than half of Tamil Nadu legislators re-contested, the consequence of the churning occasioned by the new leadership in both main parties. These remain high numbers considering that most parties across India usually discard about half of their sitting MLAs, usually to prevent anti-incumbency.What is also noteworthy is the high strike rate — or success ratio — of these re-running incumbents. Except for Puducherry again, a large majority of sitting MLAs who re-ran won their race, which again is unusual. Parties across these states have been able to retain large numbers of the seats they won in 2016, a sign of electoral stability.Of course, one needs to break down those figures by party. In West Bengal, the All India Trinamool Congress (TMC) fielded 139 of its 211 sitting MLAs (66%), 114 of whom won (82%). The Communist Party of India (Marxist) or CPI (M) fielded only 12 of its 26 sitting MLAs and all of them lost. The Congress did not fare much better with the few sitting MLAs who re-ran (19 out of 44).The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which only held three seats in Bengal, fielded 16 incumbents, drawn from other parties. Only six of them won, including Manoj Tigga, the only BJP MLA to have been re-elected in Bengal.In Tamil Nadu, 56 of the 89 Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) MLAs elected in 2016 re-ran (63%). 42 were successful. The All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK) tried to beat anti-incumbency by fielding many new candidates (only 46 of its 134 MLAs re-ran) and little more than a third of its re-running incumbents have been re-elected.In Kerala, the Communist Party of India (Marxist) fielded 23 of its 58 sitting MLAs. All but two won. In an unusual move, the party decided not to field any candidate who had served two terms or more. The other three major parties – Communist Party of India, the Congress and the Indian Union Muslim League – share similar numbers, a sign of the great territorial stability of political representation in Kerala. Most parties kept the seats they won in 2016. Only 27 seats changed hands in this election.In Assam, the BJP fielded 44 of its 60 MLAs. 37 of them won. The Congress and the Asom Gana Parishad also re-ran most of their sitting MLAs, with high strike rates. All six re-running incumbents from AUDF won their race.Most turncoat candidates are going home Turncoat candidates got a lot of attention in this election cycle. The BJP in West Bengal made it its strategy to cannibalise its opponents’ organisation by drawing as many MLAs and cadres as it could. In this piece, we consider turncoat candidates who previously ran, successfully or not, on a different party ticket than in 2021. It therefore excludes the party workers who were poached, lured with the opportunity to contest for the first time.By that measure, we find that most turncoat candidates end up losing. In Assam, only seven of the 49 contesting turncoats won their race. In Kerala, only five turncoats out of 14 succeeded. Puducherry saw a higher success rate (10 out of 20, in a much smaller house), while 39 of the 46 contesting turncoats in Tamil Nadu lost. In West Bengal, only 26 out of the 87 turncoat candidates won their race, only eight of them on BJP tickets.It is quite ironic that most successful turncoats in West Bengal ended up winning on party tickets other than the BJP. Unbeknownst to most, the TMC ran 28 turncoat candidates, out of which 18 were elected (nine from the Congress, five from the CPI(M), and four from smaller communist formations). Of the eight elected BJP turncoat candidates, only four come from the TMC. The turncoat phenomenon makes for appealing headlines but ends up concerning a fragment of the contestants, most of which ending up losing. What this data tells us about the five elections that have just occurred is that despite some spectacular outcomes, there remains much underlying stability. Most re-running MLAs ended up keeping their seat, which shows that individual anti-incumbency in these states is not as strong as it is thought to be. It also tells us that many voters decide to reward the MLAs they elected in the previous election, which may indicate that the bonds that tie MLAs to their constituencies may still have some meaning after all.

05-05-2021||Gurugram||4,740 new cases reported, state positivity rate at 37%||The district reported 4,740 new cases of the coronavirus disease on Wednesday, as it continues to struggle with the second wave of infection that has overwhelmed its healthcare system.With regard to the sheer surge in case numbers, Gurugram is fifth among 30 districts across the country that are reporting a constant increase in cases over the last two weeks, as per the union ministry of health and family welfare data. Haryana, meanwhile, has the second-highest positivity rate in the country, of 37%, which is more than Delhi’s positivity rate of 32%, and behind only Goa, which has a positivity rate of almost 48%.“Several measures are being adopted to control the surge, such as imposing lockdown and increase in testing. It will take some time to see the impact of lockdown in regulating the spike. Until then, we are continuing with high testing and strengthening hospital infrastructure. Other hospitals that are not yet registered to provide beds for Covid-19 patients have been asked to come forward,” said Dr Jai Prakash, district surveillance officer.According to the health department data, from April 13 to 19, the district reported 12,261 new cases. The following week (April 20-26), this number increased 23,305 and the surge continued, with 26,840 new cases being reported between April 27 and May 3.Gurugram is currently fifth among 30 districts showing a rapid growth in daily cases. Other most affected cities are Bengaluru, Chennai, Kozhikode and Ernakulam that are showing a higher growth rate than Gurugram. According to senior health officials, the peak of the Covid-19 second wave is expected to arrive by May 15. Until then, cases are likely to grow with a test positivity rate of 25% - 30%.As of Wednesday, the active case count in the district was 38,901, which accounts for at least 34% of the overall active cases in the state. With more than 100,000 active cases, Haryana is currently among the 12 worst-affected Covid-19 states. The state announced 15,416 new infections over the past 24 hours.At least 2,451 patients have been undergoing treatment in hospitals, but many more are being denied treatment due to a dearth of oxygen supply, ventilators and medicines. As the crises continue, the death toll also reached 537, with 15 deaths confirmed by hospitals and the district health department. At the state level, at least 153 succumbed to the illness.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/4740-new-cases-reported-state-positivity-rate-at-37-101620237700101.html
05-05-2021||Gurugram||Residents ferry patients, bodies in private vehicles as ambulances go off roads||Covid-19 patients and relatives of Covid-19 victims are staring at a major crisis as around 250 private ambulances went off the roads, in a protest against the administration’s decision to cap ambulance charges. Residents were left to fend for themselves, with many ferrying infected patients and bodies of victims in private vehicles, even as doctors warned that this could lead to a further spike in Covid-19 infections.Members of the Private Ambulance Association (PAA), which represents 39 operators, on Wednesday met senior officials in Chandigarh and were assured that the charges would be revised within two days. The association members said they will continue to strike if the demands not met.Rajesh Yadav, president of PAA, Gurugram, said that they will only call off the strike when the prices are revised by the transport department. “A meeting was held with the transport department in Chandigarh, but the decision is pending. The notification is of 2009, when petrol cost ₹40 per litre. At present, fuel costs ₹80 per litre, so they will have to revise the fares,” he said.Prashant Singh, the mission director of National Health Mission issued an order on Wednesday, directing that a uniform policy for hiring of private ambulance be adopted. He directed deputy commissioners to hold a meeting with the operators and decide rates. “It is decided by higher authorities that rates decided by the deputy commissioners will prevail,” he said. At present, there are only 55 ambulances in total in the district, 35 of which are run by the municipal corporation and 20 by private hospitals.Ashish Singla, chief medical officer (CMO), MCG, said that they are transporting bodies to crematoriums free of charge. “These ambulances are working round-the-clock and are enough for the city. We have not faced any issues until now and are responding to all calls. The only challenge is that it takes one hour to respond to a call as the ambulances on back-to-back duties,” he said.Doctors warned that residents transporting Covid-infected patients and bodies of the victims could have serious consequences. They said that if the current situation persisted, the number of Covid-19 cases will increase manifold, as private vehicles do not have emergency and safety facilities for carrying a patient without coming into contact. Dr Neeraj Thakur, director, Ayushman Hospital, said that the chance of infections increasing is high due to increased contact with Covid-19 patients. “There are no ambulances available since Monday and we are struggling to find any. Taking a patient on their own can risk their lives, as they are not medically trained and cannot handle a patient in case of an emergency,” she said.Dr Vikram Singh, director of Aarvy Hospital, said that two patients died due to the non-availability of ambulances on Tuesday. “There are majorly two issues due to the ambulance strike. First, critical patients are not getting timely help as ambulances have big oxygen cylinders and operators know how to use them as they are well trained. Second, it is risky for the family members also to ferry patients. Two patients were brought dead as families could not transport them to the hospital on time,” he said.More than 100 families shifted their patients and bodies of victims in the last two days, and were facing a tough time managing them.Sumit Agarwal, a resident of Sector 56, said that he had to shift his brother to a private hospital after his vital signs dipped, but despite trying for two hours, he couldn’t find any. “I drove him to the hospital along with my 10-year-old as it was difficult to manage it by myself. Even the hospitals had no ambulance available and most of the numbers shared by people on groups and social media were switched off,” he said.A resident of Sector 10A said that he lost his father to Covid-19 and could not find an ambulance to transport his body to the crematorium. “We waited for more than six hours and contacted more than 15 drivers but they refused and said there is a strike of ambulances. I took my father’s body to the crematorium and arranged for a stretcher too. Later, I was told by the staff that the MCG is providing ambulances,” he said.Ambulance operators said that they asked the drivers to switch off their phones as they were getting continuous calls for help.Sandeep Sharma, the in-charge of Mokshdham cremation ground in Sector 32, said, “On Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday, we received around 70 bodies that were brought by families at both the crematoriums (including one in Madanpuri). All the pressure has come on MCG ambulances and they are working for more than 18 hours to transport bodies from homes. The situation has worsened due to the strike,” he said. Private hospitals said they were helpless as they did not have enough ambulances or vehicles to shift patients and that ambulances are currently shuttling between the hospital and oxygen centres. They also expressed concerns over relatives of Covid-19 victims ferrying them to their premises without wearing personal protective equipment (PPE).Anil Khatana, head of operations, W Pratiksha Hospital in Sector 56, said that they have only one ambulance which is entirely on oxygen duty. “The ambulances get oxygen on priority, so we send our ambulance to refill oxygen. The hospital has received over 200 calls for providing ambulance as residents are not able to find any, but even our vendors are on strike,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/residents-ferry-patients-bodies-in-private-vehicles-as-ambulances-go-off-roads-101620237698760.html
05-05-2021||Gurugram||Residents struggle to get second vaccine dosage||Even as the district health department is prioritising Covid-19 vaccine beneficiaries who are awaiting their second jabs, many of them have been continuously struggling to book a slot on the Co-WIN portal or getting inoculated through a direct walk-in. Health officials said that 30 vaccination centres have been administering only 100 doses in a day, each, due to the limited supply of the vaccines.“The state has allocated additional 13,000 doses on Wednesday to inoculate prioritised population group above 45 years with the second dose. They are on priority, but every vaccination centre gets only 100 doses for inoculation, so only limited people receive doses every day,” said Dr Virender Yadav, chief medical officer.On Wednesday, at least 3,250 people aged 45 years and above took the jab, including over 2,963 people who took their second shot, at government health centres, while 154 received their jabs at private hospitals. Owing to the restricted stock, only 88 managed to get their first dose, said officials.The vaccination has declined dramatically since the inoculation of the population aged 18-44 started. Private hospitals have run out of stock after state administrations, complying with the vaccine policy, directed hospitals to procure vaccine doses from manufacturers.Citizens who have taken their first shot in private facilities are now visiting multiple centres to get their last dose at the scheduled time.Atul Sarin (50), a resident of DLF-Phase 1, visited four health facilities on Wednesday but failed to get the shot. “It has been almost eight weeks since I took the first dose. To avoid further delay, I tried booking a slot on the CoWIN portal, but it showed no slots were available. I personally visited four private hospitals and government health centres on Wednesday, but everyone cited the same problem, of unavailability of vaccine stock,” said Sarin.Relating a similar experience, 60-year-old Naveen Rangera faced troubles in finding centres where Covaxin is administered. “Covaxin is not easily available. Wherever it is available, a huge crowd is seen, which is dangerous to encounter during this time, when infections are being rapidly transmitted. Since health centres in the city are crowded, we thought of getting the shot in rural centres through a direct walk-in. But they too had no vaccine doses,” said Rangera.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/residents-struggle-to-get-second-vaccine-dosage-101620237699320.html
05-05-2021||Gurugram||Limited antigen kits hold up Gurugram efforts to increase testing||A day after the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) issued an advisory to ramp up testing through Rapid Antigen Test (RAT), the Gurugram health department on Wednesday said they had limited stock available.“Currently, there are about 2,000 antigen testing kits with the health department. The state has allocated almost 10,000 kits, which are likely to arrive by Wednesday night. We have been conducting over 4,000 antigen tests every day in large outbreak areas (LORs, where there are 15 or more cases) for timely detection and isolation of cases. the measures required to increase RAT can only be followed based on the sufficient allocation of kits by the state health department,” said Dr Virender Yadav, chief medical officer.The district does not get daily stock of testing kits. The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) on Tuesday advised setting up of dedicated round-the-clock RAT booths and drive-through booths at multiple locations in cities, towns and villages. Yadav said this could be done at the polyclinic in Sector 31 provided they get the additional testing kits. “But there is no clarity on when it is likely to start. For setting multiple booths, department needs health staff along with sufficient kits,” he said. The ICMR had earlier emphasised on at least 70% of testing in any region to be using RT-PCR kits, which is more accurate but slower than RAT that gives a result within 20 minutes. Experts said the new measure is to break the chain of transmission through early diagnosis. Since the beginning of the week, the health department has increased antigen tests. Over 8,700 antigen tests were done over the last two days. On Wednesday, however, only 2,392 antigen tests were administered. The seven-day average of antigen tests in the last week of April shows at least 1,679 RAT were administered every day. Like other cities, Gurugram has been reeling under pressure to give timely RT-PCR results within 36 hours due to intense case load. But people have been getting test results within three to four days, which has been a hurdle in breaking the transmission chain. The new ICMR testing strategy said round-the-clock booths were to improve access and availability of vaccines. Even drive-through for RAT testing facilities has to be created. To reduce the existing burden on the laboratory, ICMR has suggested that RT-PCR test results should be removed for interstate domestic travel.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/limited-antigen-kits-hold-up-gurugram-efforts-to-increase-testing-101620237697588.html
05-05-2021||Gurugram||Oxygen shortage continues due to spike in serious Covid-19 cases||The increase in the number of critically ill patients at large private hospitals continues to put pressure on the oxygen distribution system in the district, despite Gurugram receiving additional oxygen stock over the past few days.Against an allocated quota of 40 metric tonnes (MT) of oxygen, the district on Wednesday received around 48 MT. However, officials familiar with the development said that there is demand for 60 MT of oxygen and that the shortage of oxygen is also hampering the treatment of patients in smaller hospitals and owners of some of them said they have stopped taking new patients.“The demand is rising exponentially as the number of serious patients is rising. We are distributing as per the demand and also to ensure there is no distress situation at any hospital. We don’t want a situation where there is an emergency,” said Yash Garg, the deputy commissioner of Gurugram.On Wednesday, the city received oxygen from one tanker from Faridabad, one from Bhiwadi and two from the oxygen express train between Faridabad and Rourkela, while the city will receive two tankers from Panipat on Thursday morning, said officials. On Tuesday, the city had received 43 MT oxygen against a demand of 55 MT.Last week, the Haryana government directed that hospitals with fewer than 15 beds should not admit Covid-19 patients as they did not have adequate oxygen infrastructure. However, larger hospitals are also struggling to cope with the shortage.The management of Artemis Hospital in the city on Wednesday stopped new admissions, citing oxygen shortage, and that the policy will continue till the situation improves. “We have suspended admissions because of extremely limited oxygen supply. We will not be able to create any extra space for Covid-19 patients, even in the emergency (ward),” said an official spokesperson for Artemis Hospitals.While larger hospitals struggled to increase the facilities of critical patients, smaller private hospitals and nursing homes called for streamlining oxygen distribution and checking overcharging.Dr Prithvi Raj Aryan, the director of Aryan Hospital on Old Railway Road, said that they have not received oxygen supply despite a quota being fixed. “The refilling station is demanding ₹40,000 in cash apart from the payment in cheques. They are charging ₹450 per oxygen cylinders, instead of ₹250. How we will run operations if all the agencies involved demand cash? Our patients will die, but we are not responsible as we are unable to provide them with oxygen,” he said and wanted the authorities to intervene.Even as hospitals and residents complained over malpractice at refilling facilities, the Haryana government on Wednesday ordered all district deputy commissioners to constitute a committee to oversee oxygen refillers.M Shayin, additional chief secretary of Haryana health and family welfare department, said that they have come to know that the oxygen being delivered to refillers was often not being optimally utilised. “The committee will include an executive magistrate and police personnel,” said Shayin in the order.The order also asked deputy commissioners to prepare a list of chronic oxygen-dependent patients and designate at least one refiller in the district to fill their cylinders. Deputy commissioners and civil surgeons were directed to assess the utilisation of oxygen at hospitals. Drug control officers will have the overall responsibility to enforce the penal provisions applicable for oxygen as a medical drug and to ensure its non-diversion, the order statedOwners of smaller hospitals also demanded an increase in the allocation of oxygen.Dr Swati Rathore, director, Kriti hospital in Sector 56, said that eight people had died on April 30 in her hospital due to lack of oxygen and the situation is the same at present. “I have six critical patients and one on a ventilator. We can’t keep them without oxygen but we have not received a single cylinder in the last two days. The officers from the district administration and municipal corporation are not responding to our calls and messages and we are helpless,” she said.Administration officials said that they are doing their best to ensure supply, despite a shortage.Garg said, “We received 48 MT on Wednesday while the demand is almost 60 MT. We are trying hard to meet the demand somehow and the distress calls have reduced in the past two to three days.”He said that wherever the hospitals have flagged emergencies, oxygen was supplied.He said that to resolve the problem faced by smaller hospitals, a fixed quota has been set for 72 hospitals. “I have also allocated gas to Star Gases in Manesar for issuing the same to individuals who are isolated at home,” Garg said, adding that he had not received any complaint regarding overcharging.A few private hospitals said that the situation improved after the district administration allocated a fixed supply for smaller hospitals. “We have been allotted 10 cylinders daily by the administration and we are getting the same. The authorities have finally woken to the problems faced by nursing homes that form the backbone of the city’s healthcare system,” said Dr Shyam Lal Kohli, managing director, Chirag Hospital.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/oxygen-shortage-continues-due-to-spike-in-serious-covid-19-cases-101620237698172.html
05-05-2021||Gurugram||Health officials to check oxygen use at hospitals||The district administration is planning to deploy health officials at private hospitals for conducting checks to ensure that medical oxygen is being used judiciously.Amandeep Chauhan, district drugs controller officer, who is part of the oxygen management team, said, “We are focusing on proper management of oxygen and ensuring that it does not go to waste. We are planning to deploy our existing health officials at private hospitals, who would be conducting regular checks to ensure that there is no misuse, leakage or black marketing being done.”He said that the team has not received any complaint so far about black marketing of oxygen at private hospitals, but officials are being extra cautious due to the high demand.“We are trying to ensure that all hospitals get the required amount of oxygen, with no hospital getting extra or less than the requirement. We are calculating the requirement of different hospitals based on the number of oxygen and intensive care unit (ICU) beds available at each facility,” Chauhan said.Meanwhile, officials of the health department said that many hospitals are not taking proper measures for distributing oxygen to patients and placing excessive demands, whereas the condition of the patient can be managed by either giving steroids or other medicines.“We understand that the demand for oxygen is high and patients need it, but there are known medical procedures or medicines that can be given to patients to stabilise their condition without giving them oxygen. If hospitals follow these medical procedures correctly, then oxygen supply can be diverted to patients who actually need it; there are many patients in home isolation who also need oxygen but are not able to get it,” said a senior health official, requesting anonymity.The official cited above said that the health officials deployed at private hospitals will also be able to keep a check on whether apt medical procedures are being followed and families do not have to run from pillar to post for procuring oxygen for the patients.At present, Gurugram is allotted 40 metric tonnes (MT) of oxygen but is currently in possession of additional stock due to increased supply over the past few days. The district received 43 MT of oxygen on Monday from plants in Bhiwadi in Rajasthan and neighbouring Panipat, besides a consignment from the oxygen express train on its route from Rourkela to neighbouring Faridabad. The supply was eight metric tonnes more than the supply on Sunday, said officials.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/health-officials-to-check-oxygen-use-at-hospitals-101620237639944.html
05-05-2021||Gurugram||‘Haryana will see Covid-19 second wave peak by May 15’||Haryana is already among the 10 worst-affected Covid-19 states across the country, but it is yet to witness its peak, says Rajeev Arora, additional chief secretary, health and home affairs department, Haryana government. Arora spoke to Archana Mishra about the projections, mutant strains of SARS-CoV-2 virus prevalent in the state and oxygen supply disruptions in the district.Gurugram has been witnessing a powerful resurgence in coronavirus infections. How do you assess the situation and what are the projections?The projections made by the central government on the current growth rate of the infection shows that Haryana will see the Covid-19 second wave peak by May 15. Currently, there are 108, 830 active cases in the state. It is expected that by May 15, it will reach about 140,000. Thereafter, the curve of the active case will begin to plateau. The surge will not be from Gurugram alone, which has been reporting maximum coronavirus case every day, but from other districts too. In the case of Gurugram, the average test positivity rate has been around 25% in the last few days, which was earlier around 29 to 33%. This test positivity rate of Gurugram will remain for some time, as, in all likelihood, the decline will be seen first in the northern belt of Panchkula, Ambala and Kurukshetra.The district is already grappling with a lack of oxygen and beds for critically ill Covid-19 patients. How is the state planning to address the situation when the cases increase further?Haryana’s oxygen production has been high. But, as per the allocations made by the Government of India, we are providing it to other states like Delhi and Punjab. There are diversions in the oxygen supply even after the allocation. Certainly, there are logistical issues, but the state has already detailed the oxygen demand of every district. In the last seven to 10 days, there have been dramatic changes in the oxygen plant contract policy, which has also affected the certainty of oxygen supply and the existing mechanism between oxygen plants and hospitals in Gurugram. It was not expected that oxygen demand would shoot up within a week. To timely address the shortfall in oxygen supply, we are airlifting cryogenic oxygen containers from Rourkela. For Covid-19 bed management, deputy commissioners have already been assigned the task of arranging facilities.How many mutant strains of the SARS-CoV-2 virus are currently prevalent in Haryana?Based on the genomic sequencing of 922 samples collected across the state, at least 555 showed no mutation while 367 showed mutant strains. Of these, 310 samples were of the UK variant. Results provided by a Delhi-based lab mentions that 45% of samples had “variant of concern” and 3% with “variant not of concern”.Covid-19 vaccination has also become a big challenge in the district, especially for those who need to take the second shot within the allotted time frame. How is the state planning to address the problem?Undoubtedly, the process has been disrupted. The vaccine stock which was to be used only for the prioritised population groups has been now divided into two categories, 18 to 44 years and citizens aged over 45 years. Since the state is no longer linked with private hospitals to provide the vaccine, people who require the second dose can get the inoculation at government facilities. We have already allocated 13,000 additional doses to Gurugram to streamline the vaccination process.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/haryana-will-see-covid-19-second-wave-peak-by-may-15-101620237639227.html

He said that one oxygen plant each in Rewari, Mahendragarh and Mewat will also be set up under the aegis of the National Disaster Management Authority, which has sanctioned 50 plants for the state.The announcement assumes significance as the city presently is getting around 45 metric tonnes (MT) of oxygen, against a daily demand of 60 MT, said officials.“The work on these plants has already been initiated and I have asked officials to expedite the process to identify land and create infrastructure for setting up these plants at the earliest,” said the Gurugram member of Parliament, who also held a review meeting with the district officials.Singh also said that an oxygen tank would.be soon made available to the medical college in Nuh, which will ensure that ventilators and other equipment become functional at the earliest.In a related development, the state government on Wednesday also issued directions that committees be formed at the district level to ensure that refilling of oxygen cylinders is streamlined and home-isolated patients don’t have to struggle to get cylinders refilled.The committees would check that cylinders are filled as per correct weight and that buyers are not overcharged, as per an order issued in this regard.“The deputy commissioners will also, through Red Cross societies, prepare a list of chronic oxygen-dependent patients and designate at least one refiller to supply oxygen to them on presentation of chronic disabilities certificate,” said an order issued by the health department, adding that authorities will also keep a tab on the usage of oxygen at private hospitals and government facilities to ensure these are not diverted for non-medical use.The government on Wednesday also appointed Rajnarayan Kaushik, an IAS officer of the 2010 batch, to assist the district administration in Covid management.

The UP BJP leaders claimed that the attacks on BJP cadres were carried out at the behest of the ruling TMC. While state BJP chief Swatantra Dev staged a dharna outside his residence, several party functionaries and ministers follow suit across the state. “There is Corona curfew in the state and hence as representatives of a disciplined party, we staged protests in keeping with the Covid protocol. But the situation that prevails in West Bengal is shocking. Such things were heard during the partition,” said the UP BJP chief. The BJP leaders claimed that within 24 hours of the election results in West Bengal, the TMC cadre unleashed terror, targeting BJP cadres. “Such violence is unacceptable in a democracy,” the BJP leader said adding they would continue to fight against such violence in a democratic way.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/up-bjp-leaders-stage-sit-ins-to-protest-bengal-violence-101620235957175.html

05-05-2021||Other||BJP woos Independents as SP upsets its applecart||The three-tier panchayat elections, considered a semi-final before the 2022 Uttar Pradesh assembly polls, provided a boost to the Samajwadi Party (SP) that bagged the single largest chunk of zila panchayat wards, but the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) ended up with a below par performance and was now looking to make amends in the indirect election for zila panchayat chief and block pramukhs, who will be chosen by zila panchayat members. The trends and results available for the 3,050 district panchayat wards on Wednesday evening showed the SP winning or leading in 779 wards, the BJP at 579, Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) at 361 and the Congress at 76. Independents and smaller parties won or led in 1,272 wards.The BJP, which secured a landslide victory in the 2017 UP assembly election bagging 312 out of 403 seats in the state assembly over four years ago, suffered setbacks in its bastions of Ayodhya, Varanasi, Lucknow and Gorakhpur in the panchayat elections even as the SP maintained its grip on its strongholds of Etawah (western UP), Kannauj (central UP), Mainpuri (western UP), Azamgarh (eastern UP), Etah (western UP), Kasganj (western UP) and Farrukhabad (western UP) by bagging the maximum seats.Although the panchayat elections are not contested on party symbols and the State Election Commission (SEC) has said results won’t be declared on party lines, all parties have officially released the names of the candidates backed by them.The BJP has already opened channels with the independents, a majority of them rebels from various parties, to try and win the maximum of the zila panchayat chairpersons’ and block pramukhs’ post. “Several independents are in touch with us,” a BJP leader confirmed.The indirect elections are to be held for 75 posts of zila panchayat chairpersons and 826 kshetra panchayat chairpersons (block chiefs).“In 2015, when the Samajwadi Party was in power, they had claimed win in nearly 2100 zila panchayat seats. Naturally, they won the indirect polls to elect the zila panchayat chief and block pramukh too. But this time our performance wasn’t up to the mark and a major reason for it could be several party candidates contesting for the same post, which created confusion and ultimately division of our votes,” a BJP leader said. The victory of the SP and other Opposition candidates in the panchayat election is likely to set the ground for fresh political realignment and alliances before the assembly election. The smaller political parties, including the Suheldev Bharatiya Samaj Party (SBSP), the Aam Admi Party (AAP), the Apna Dal, the Azad Samaj Party (Bhim Army) and the Pragtisheel Samajwadi Party-Lohia also bagged wards in the areas of their influence. The Bhagidari Sankalp Morcha launched by the smaller parties has called for a united alliance against the NDA in the 2022 assembly election, said SBSP chief Om Prakash Rajbhar.The farmers’ agitation against three central agrarian laws dented the BJP’s fortunes in west UP where it had won the maximum seats in the 2017 assembly elections.The Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD) that won only one seat in the 2017 assembly election and was wiped out in its stronghold in west UP made a comeback in the panchayat election, winning seats in Meerut, Shamli, Bulandshahr, Baghpat, Hapur and Bijnor (all in the west UP region).The BJP had “organised” chaupals in the villages before the panchayat elections with party MPs, MLAs and a battery of ministers campaigning in the rural areas.In Varanasi, the SP won 15 of the 40 wards, the BJP seven, the BSP seven and the Congress five wards so far. In Ayodhya, the SP won 24 of 40 wards, BJP bagged six and BSP five wards.In Lucknow, SP won 10 of 25 wards, the BJP bagged three and the BSP secured five wards. The Congress failed to win in any ward in the two regions. In Gorakhpur, the SP won 19 of 68 wards, the BJP won 20, theEven as the BJP and the SP claimed victory in the panchayat election, chief minister Yogi Adityanath on Wednesday congratulated the victorious party candidates and thanked the voters for supporting the BJP candidates.In a tweet, Yogi called upon the victorious candidates and people to assist the administration in fighting the Covid pandemic. They should follow the Covid guidelines and corona curfew protocol, he said.Samajwadi Party (SP) chief Akhilesh Yadav said the ruling BJP was a sinking ship. The results of the panchayat elections clearly showed that BJP would face defeat in the 2022 assembly elections, he said. The BSP that won merely 19 seats in the 2017 assembly elections also made a comeback in its strongholds of Saharanpur (western UP), Mau (eastern UP), Amroha (western UP), Ghaziabad (western UP), Bhadohi (eastern UP) and Ambedkar Nagar (eastern UP) by bagging the maximum number of the zila panchayat wards there.BSP chief Mayawati has directed the party leaders and workers to begin preparations for the assembly election. UP BJP chief Swatantra Dev, however, said the party had done well in the polls.BSP legislature party leader Lalji Verma dismissed BJP claims of having done well in these rural polls. “I would have agreed that they did well had they announced their candidates for block pramukh, zila panchayat and block development council. This they didn’t do. Rest is immaterial for the BJP is currently the ruling party,” Verma said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/bjp-woos-independents-as-sp-upsets-its-applecart-101620235717244.html

We have received a very less quantity of vaccines. Now the kind of infrastructure we have developed based on that we can ramp up the vaccination drive within 24 hours," he said.Full-fledged vaccination of people in the age group 18-44 years began in Delhi on May 2, after the city government received 4.5 lakh doses of vaccine.The vaccination drive in the city has begun at both private and government facilities, and a large number of youth are turning up for taking jabs, the Chief Minister said."As I earlier said that we want to vaccinate every citizen here within three months but to do that we need proper supply of vaccines. I am very hopeful that we can reach that target but for that sufficient supply of vaccine should be ensured."Kejriwal also said his government is working with the Centre on the issue of oxygen supply. "We completely understand that the Central government is responsible for ensuring oxygen to the entire country. But we hope that Central will provide Delhi with its quota of required oxygen," he said.The Centre has allocated 590 MT of oxygen per day to Delhi. The city government has complained of getting less oxygen than the fixed quota and demanded it to be raised further to 976 MT."For the past several days, we are battling with the scarcity of oxygen. During this tough time, we have also received massive support from the Supreme Court and the High Court. I am hopeful that in the coming days the situation will improve.”The oxygen supply is being constantly monitored, he said.A total 43 SOS calls for oxygen were received from hospitals on Tuesday, Kejriwal said, and added the Delhi government is working round the clock to ensure there is no fatality due to lack of it.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-not-receiving-enough-covid-19-vaccine-doses-says-cm-arvind-kejriwal-101620231792305.html

05-05-2021||Pune||PMC extends Swach contract, but evaluating other options||The Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) has extended the contract of Swach, a non-profit responsible for door-to-door waste collection in the city by another month but is also checking out options to appoint other agencies for merged villages.The plan is to continue with Swach in the old city limits. Swach is a PMC supported non-profit organization for door-to-door waste collection. PMC renews the contract with Swach every five years, which ended in December 2020. Based on the complaints of corporators, the PMC standing committee was earlier pursuing bids of other agencies for fair competition in the collection and segregation of garbage in the city. However, due to Covid-19, there was no general body meeting taking place and hence the decision was pending but it was passed in a general body meeting in March 2021 to extend Swach’s contract for two months. Now, the standing committee has given another one-month extension to Swach on the background of Covid-19 situation. One of the PMC officials said, “In the coming days, we are working on the proposal to call tenders for merged villages and give extension to Swach in the old city limit areas. In the Covid-19 situation, if we carry the fresh tender for garbage collection of garbage, it will hamper the existing waste collection system. So, without disturbing the existing Swach system, we are working to call tenders for merge areas.” Hemant Rasane, PMC standing committee chairman said, “The administration demanded to give an extension of three months to Swach. However, we have given an extension by a month and instructed the administration to start a new tender process.” Kunal Khemnar, PMC additional municipal commissioner said, “We prepared all necessary steps to call fresh tenders for door-to-door waste segregation and collection. Now, the committee has given a month’s extension to Swach. After the merger of 23 villages, we will check the option of appointing other agencies.” Ajit Deshmukh, head of solid waste department of PMC said, “We have mentioned in the proposal that there is a need to give extension to Swach for five years. On the other side, there will be a merger of 23 new villages in the PMC limit. There is no proper system to collect garbage and Swach is also not covering these areas. Therefore, the administration will have to outsource garbage transportation and collection but, it will take some period.” Swach covers around 8.5 lakh properties in the city and gets ₹4.5 to ₹5 crore from residents every month in addition to ₹2.5 to ₹3 crore paid annually by PMC as supervision fees. However, there are numerous complaints from corporators, and some citizens are against Swach workers for not lifting garbage properly.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/pmc-extends-swach-contract-but-evaluating-other-options-101620231696406.html

05-05-2021||Pune||No frequent heat wave conditions reported in April: IMD||As per India Meteorological Department (IMD), like March 2021, the heat wave conditions in April 2021 were occasional and also for shorter periods over very small pockets. In Maharashtra and rest of Central India, no frequent heat wave conditions were observed and the maximum temperature over Maharashtra and Central India was below normal by 1 to 3 degrees Celsius.Explaining the cause of fewer heat waves, OP Sreejith, scientist, climate monitoring and forecast, IMD Pune said that the cause of isolated heat waves in Central India is that we are experiencing La Nina conditions this year. “We generally observe fewer heat waves during the La Nina condition. Also, the major reason for fewer heat waves in the region is attributed to regular wet spells observed over western Himalayan region and adjoining plains of northwest India and adjoining central parts of India in April. Due to the presence of lower-level wind convergence on many days in April this year, Maharashtra and adjoining parts of peninsular India, experienced rainfall and thunderstorm activities at regular intervals, thus reducing the heat intensity in April. The warmer days with higher maximum temperature were relatively less in number due to frequent rainfall activity,” said Sreejith. He further added that a few occasional shorter duration spells of heat wave were reported at isolated pockets in other parts of the country like Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh. According to IMD officials, the month of April this year was the 12th warmest for Central India since 1901 with an increase in day temperature by 0.6 degrees Celsius. As per data shared by IMD, the maximum temperature over Central India that includes Maharashtra, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and Odisha exceeded the normal temperature during April by 0.6 degrees Celsius.According to the department, the subdivision of Konkan and Goa from west coast is likely to report warmer than normal day temperature in the month of May.“As predicted for the month of May, the Konkan and Goa region may have warmer than normal day temperature. The temperature may vary due to various local weather patterns that are at play. For other parts, local forecasts are given by IMD. For monsoon, IMD will issue an updated forecast by the end of May,” said Sreejith.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/no-frequent-heat-wave-conditions-reported-in-april-imd-101620231636315.html

The survey assessed the condition of 13 pedestrian subways and nine FOBs in Pune after a physical site visit and conditions using parameters defined in the city’s pedestrian policy.This report is yet to be presented to the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC), but shows that many facilities of subways and FOBs are poor in terms of lighting, ventilation, have no firefighting equipment, and have water seepage.According to Priya Pharanade, Parisar NGO junior programme associate, the organisation conducted the survey between December 2020 and January 2021 by visiting 16 subways, of which conditions of 13 were noted. “During our survey, we found that three subways are closed, while we found that there are two subways for vehicle movement and a pedestrian subway. Similarly, we surveyed 10 FOBs of which only one FOB was closed. After conducting the survey, we think that subways and foot overbridges are undesirable and should not be constructed, and if the authorities are planning more they should be maintained and should be used by people,” said Pharande. “It should be maintained, so pedestrians can use it. Some of the subways and FOBs are closed because of not being maintained properly and others are not used much as it is not convenient. This means that large amount of public money has been wasted on FOBs and subways which in the absence of proper maintenance makes them a dead expenditure,” added Pharande. According to Pune’s pedestrian policy, PMC should ensure regular maintenance and security for the pedestrian infrastructure (including FOBs, subways) to retain it in a good, clean, usable and safe condition at all times. Ward officers are responsible for pedestrian infrastructure in respective ward areas and necessary coordination with other departments such as road, traffic, electrical, garden department. “They have to ensure regular maintenance and security of existing FOBs, subways to retain it in a good, clean, usable and safe condition at all times in the pedestrian policy,” Pharande said.

Many visitors are seen without masks and violating social distancing rules. Large number of visitors has been observed at the health and building permission department. Those who visited the offices following the Covid protocol a few days ago expressed fears that unchecked crowding could lead to spread of the virus infection.During lockdown, PMC has issued guidelines that only 15 per cent of the staff would remain on duty and outsiders would need mandatory pass to gain entry into the premises.However, visitors to the PMC headquarters claim that many are gaining entry without being checked. “The offices are getting many visitors and it is a cause of concern. We request PMC to toughen measures and ensure that only genuine ones are allowed inside the campus,” said Somnath Patil, a visitor with mandatory pass.Social activist Anagha Deshmukh said, “Most people seen inside the building visit the health department and could be Covid positive patients or can be asymptomatic as they usually come to take letters from the department for free medicine or availing scheme for poor patients or other health related work.”Ajit Kankariya, who visited the health department office, said, “I saw people getting inside without being checked at the main gate. They don’t wear masks properly and social distancing norms are being violated blatantly. Only those who have the pass must be allowed while those not wearing masks must be fined.”.Pune mayor Muralidhar Mohol said, “Only citizens with genuine work and mandatory pass are allowed. We will ensure that the strictest protocols are followed so that we can make the surroundings healthier for citizens.” He said steps will be taken to check the increase in footfall at PMC main office.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/pmc-headquarters-fail-to-keep-visitor-count-as-per-lockdown-norms-101620229295994.html
05-05-2021||Ranchi||Over 2k deaths since April||Jharkhand, which has been witnessing more than 100 deaths due to Covid-19 daily for last 11 days, on Tuesday reported its highest ever mortality rate of 1.24%, more than the national average of 1.10%.While the unprecedented surge in number of casualties in last 34 days played havoc across the state, health experts opine that the spike in cases will lead to a corresponding surge in deaths. With 132 casualties reported on Tuesday, the state’s Covid-19 toll climbed to 3,205, including 2,092 deaths in last 34 days between April 1 and May 4.The state, which discovered it’s first one lakh cases in a period of seven months between March 31 and October 27 last year, detected the same number of cases in merely one month in April this year. The increase in mortality rate was more disturbing, as the state recorded more number of deaths in these 34 days than the first 12 months of the pandemic’s outbreak combined.While Jharkhand registered a total of 1,113 Covid-19 deaths till March 31 this year, it added another 2,092 deaths in between April 1 and May 4.Besides, the state was adding over 100 deaths daily for the last 11 days, sending shock waves across every section of the society. On May 1, it logged its highest ever single-day spike in the toll with 159 deaths.The rising number of cases in the state has put health care and services in crisis, causing trouble to patients with many of them dying for want of adequate and timely treatment.The state was also facing acute shortage of oxygen supported beds. Many deaths were allegedly caused due to non-availability of oxygen to needy patients.However, health experts suggest that the high number of deaths can be averted by taking preventive measures and timely medical intervention. “The number of deaths will largely depend on the number of cases in a given period of time, the infrastructure to match and accommodate the surge without diluting the quality of care,” said Dr RK Jha, former professor and head, department of medicine, Rajendra Institute of Medical Sciences (RIMS), Ranchi.He added, “It is also possible that this new Covid-19 strain--Indian and UK variants--is far more infectious and difficult to detect through the conventional RT-PCR / RAT. No wonder many deaths took place due to late diagnosis or death outside hospital due to denial of admission to such cases.”Dr Dewesh Kumar, assistant professor of department of preventive and social medicine, RIMS, said, “The infection spread is wide. So, with rise in cases, deaths will also increase. This is a pan-India scenario. The high number of deaths could have been averted had there been adequate preparations. It is suggestive to start taking medicines with the first advent of symptoms in order to ward off fatality. Every fever, diarrhoea and other symptoms should be considered as Covid-19.”Capital city Ranchi, which is the hardest hit by the pandemic, reported the maximum 741 out of the total 2,092 deaths in the last 34 days.NTPC provides health infrastructure supportNational Thermal Power Corporation (NTPC), Pakri Barwadih Coal Mining Project, Hazaribagh, has come forward to provide assistance to RIMS in installation of oxygen piping system to convert a four-storied unit (16 wards) with additional 332 oxygen equipped beds. Under its CSR initiative, the corporation is extending financial support of ₹45 lakh. The work is in progress and around 150 beds will be ready for admission this week, officials said. NTPC was also assisting Hazaribagh’s Seikh Bhikari Medical College to facilitate and install a centralized oxygen system in identified wards to support 84 beds for critical care.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ranchi-news/over-2k-deaths-since-april-101620228635833.html

As per the new direction, all migrant workers returning from other parts of the country will have to undergo Rapid Antigen Test, and will have to stay in quarantine for seven days even if they test negative, the order issued by chief secretary Sukhdev Singh said. “Those who test positive will be treated as per Covid-19 protocol,” the order said. The migrant workers will be tested again before their departure from the quarantine centre, the order further stated. The decision was taken in view of the rising number of cases in district towns and villages. The order observed that there was an exponential increase in Covid-19 cases in the state during the last fortnight. It was anticipated that the large-scale inflow of migrants back to their respective villages might pose a considerable threat in spread of the disease in rural areas, it said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ranchi-news/mandatory-weeklong-quarantine-for-returning-migrant-workers-101620228575894.html

Meanwhile, the Opposition and tribal bodies demanded a CBI enquiry into the case.Twenty six-year old Tirkey was found hanging inside her official quarters at police line in Sahibganj on Monday night. Sahibganj superintendent of police (SP) Anuranjan Kispotta said, “We have set up a five-member special investigation team, comprising two deputy superintendents of police, one inspector and two sub-inspectors to probe the case. We are waiting for the postmortem examination report. I have requested the doctors to provide it at the earliest.”According to Tirkey’s roommate, the quarters’ door was locked from inside when she returned home from duty around 8.30pm on Monday. When the door was broken, Tirkey was found hanging in a room, she told the police.Even though police said prima facie it appeared to be case of suicide, Tirkey’s family members, who live in Ranchi’s Ratu area, suspected murder. Her mother Padmawati Orain on Tuesday lodged a complaint with Sahibganj police station, alleging that Tirkey was being tortured by two female police officials.Former chief minister and senior BJP leader Babulal Marandi on Tuesday evening tweeted a copy of Padmawati’s complaint and demanded CBI enquiry into the case. “In view of gravity of the case, I would request chief minister Hemant Soren that her postmortem examination be conducted by senior doctors of medical college and the case be immediately handed over to the CBI,” Marandi said.Ranchi’s Hatia legislator Naveen Jaiswal also wrote a letter to the CM minister on Wednesday for the same. “I would request the CM to conduct a CBI probe so that the tribal police officer gets justice,” he said.Several tribal outfits in the state also demanded proper investigation into the case. Former Tribal Advisory Council (TAC) member Ratan Tirkey requested the CM, home secretary and director general of police (DGP) that the case should not be probed as a case of suicide, as “circumstantial evidences tell a different story”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ranchi-news/police-station-in-charge-death-case-sit-set-up-101620228515835.html

As per data available with the Election Commission of India (ECI), JD(U) managed a mere 0.11% of total votes polled in Assam, where all its 34 candidates lost their deposit. Sources said majority of candidates got around 600- 800 votes. In 2016 assembly polls in Assam, JD(U) had contested four seats and got 0.07% votes. In Bengal, JD(U) got 0.02 % votes of the total votes polled and majority of its 16 candidates lost deposits, sources said. The RJD, which contested one seat in Assam as part of the Congress-led alliance, got only 0.07% of total votes polled. In West Bengal, the party had not fielded any candidate and had extended support to the Trinamool Congress. The Lok Janshakti party ( LJP), which contested 10 seats in West Bengal and around a dozen seats in Assam, got 0.01% and 0.04% of the total votes polled in the two states, respectively. The CPI-ML(Liberation), which is a major Left party in Bihar, got 0.03% votes of total votes polled in West Bengal and 0.14% in Assam. Sanjay Verma, JD(U) leader in-charge of Assam polls, said the party did not perform as per expectations in Assam that saw a straight contest between BJP and Congress-AIUDF alliance and in West Bengal because of straight fight between BJP and Trinamool. RJD’s Abdul Bari Siddiqui, a former minister, said his party could have done better in Assam had it got more seats in alliance with Congress.Headline: Dismal performanceJD(U)’s all 34 candidates in Assam and 16 in Bengal lost their depositsAssamParty: Votes (%)JD(U): 0.11% RJD: 0.07%LJP: 0.04% CPI-ML(Liberation): 0.14%BengalJD(U): 0.01% LJP: 0.04% CPI-ML(Liberation): 0.03%||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/bihar-parties-bite-dust-in-assam-bengal-polls-101620228396469.html

The CM’s instruction came during a high-level meeting attended by two deputy CMs, industry and health ministers, besides senior officials to assess the oxygen supply and demand in the state. Bihar on Wednesday reported 14,836 new Covid-19 infections and 61 deaths during the last 24 hours. Patna continued to be worst hit, reporting 2,420 cases, followed by 857 in Vaishali, 671 Nalanda, 655 in West Champaran and 635 in Samastipur. The number of active cases rose to 113,479 from 110,430 on Monday. During the meeting, the CM also asked to increase number of beds in hospitals to meet future requirements, ambulances and ensure supply of medicines and oxygen at all cost. “Take action against private ambulance operators who are charging exorbitantly,” he said. Meanwhile, big hospitals in Patna reported near normal supply of oxygen cylinders on Wednesday. “We are getting near normal supply. On May 4, we got 856 D-type (jumbo) cylinders which created a crisis for a short duration but it was immediately fulfilled. On an average we require 900-1000 D type cylinders daily,” said Dr Binod Kumar Singh, superintendent, NMCH, a Covid dedicated hospital. Some private hospitals reported “less supply than demand” while others reduced number of beds to overcome oxygen short supply. Bihar has been allotted a daily quota of 194 MT of medical oxygen by the Centre, which was increased to 214 MT on May 2. Of this, 34 MT is to be obtained from the air separation units (ASU) functional in the state whereas the rest are to come from Air Water, Jamshedpur, Linde Jamshedpur, Inox Bokaro, Ellenberrrrie, Satyam, Vedanta Electro Steel, Bokaro, and Narayan. “The situation will ease further once the three plants, two in Patna district and one at Samastipur, with a capacity to produce/refill 2000 cylinders per day, starts operating within a week,” said industry minister Shahnawaz Husain.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/bihar-steps-on-the-gas-to-beat-oxygen-crisis-101620228395768.html

05-05-2021||Other||South, central Bihar worst hit in second wave||PATNAA review of the Covid-19 pandemic in rural areas by the panchayati raj department has found the spread of the virus is less in north-east districts comprising Kosi and Seemanchal regions in comparison to the southern districts like Aurangabad, Gaya , Nalanda and some central Bihar districts, mainly Patna. The department has instructed all mukhiyas (village heads) in the vulnerable districts having higher case load, especially in southern Bihar, to track symptomatic patients and ensure they are put on early medication after proper tests so that complications and mortality rate is reduced. Bihar reported 14,794 cases on Tuesday, taking the tally of active cases to 110,430. Sources said an internal assessment by the health department has concluded similar findings based on positivity rate (the percentage of people turning positive as against total number of tests daily) in the districts. The district-wise positivity rate could not be assessed as senior health officials did not respond to messages and phone calls.Bihar’s positivity rate stood at 15.6% on Tuesday while it was 16.1% on April 30, the highest so far after resurgence of Covid cases in the second wave. “North-east Bihar is far less affected by Covid cases whereas southern districts are witnessing a surge in cases. The positivity rate in districts also indicate the same. Our review meeting with mukhiyas and other officials on Tuesday indicated the same trend,” said Amrit Lal Meena, additional chief secretary, panchayat raj department. Officials said panchayat representatives have been asked to monitor general health of people in their respective gram panchayats, especially in households where members are running fever. “For us, the next seven days are crucial as there are reports that an average 30% of the households in rural areas have some members having fever. It could be seasonal flu but we are taking updates from rural areas on a daily basis,” said a senior official in the department, seeking anonymity. Some of the districts, whose Covid related data for last few days are available, corroborate the findings. For instance, Aurangabad recorded 535 new cases on Tuesday against 356 cases on Monday. Gaya recorded 767 cases on May 3 and 662 cases on May 2.Nalanda, the home district of chief minister Nitish Kumar, too has seen an upward trend, with 618 cases detected on May 3. Begusarai has also witnessed a surge in cases.On the other hand, the number of new cases in north-east districts has fluctuated from 100 to 400 on a daily basis over last few days. The lowest number has been in Kishanganj and Madhepura, the latter recording 210 cases on May 1 and 299 cases on May. In other districts like Purnea, Katihar and Saharsa, the number of cases has remained below 400, as per official data. “Our priority is to check the spread of Covid in rural areas in all districts,” Meena said, adding that panchayat representatives have already bought 40 lakh masks for distribution as per norms. Each household this time is being given six masks for protection against Covid. Principal secretary (health) Pratyaya Amrit could not be reached for comment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/south-central-bihar-worst-hit-in-second-wave-101620228275819.html

This despite the fact that the CT scan machine in Beli hospital is just the second one in a government hospital in the district, the only other one is installed at SRN Hospital.The CT scan costs ₹5,300 to 5,500 at private diagnostic labs in the market against ₹600 at government hospitals for regular patients and the scan is free for those suffering from Covid-19. RT-PCR tests detect coronavirus in around 80 per cent of the cases and for confirmation in other cases clinical features and CT scans/chest X-rays are being used to rule out false negatives in symptomatic patients followed by a repeat test after 24 hours.“However, people like me having kin suffering from Covid-19 have to get it done at private labs paying almost 9 to 10 times the cost despite being able to ill-afford it,” said Manas Srivastava, a shop owner and a resident of Pratapgarh whose father is undergoing treatment at SRN hospital in Prayagraj.In Prayagraj, the scanning facility under the government system is presently available only in SRN Hospital, which is limited to the patients of this very hospital. Here the screening of Covid patients is being done free of cost whereas the patients admitted in other wards (non-Covid) have to pay ₹600 for the CT scan of the chest.“We are on an average performing 50-60 scans every day here,” shared a senior doctor of SRN Hospital.“The CT scan fee for Chest at SRN Hospital is ₹600. However, the screening of Covid patients is free of cost and we are doing it every day for our patients,” said Gautam Tripathi, deputy superintendent in charge of SRN Hospital.As for Beli Hospital’s machine non-functional for more than 15 days, the hospital administration claims that it has appealed to senior officials several times, but no one seems to be listening.“We are trying to get it fixed,” said Kiran Malik, chief medical superintendent of Beli Hospital.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/in-covid-19-times-ct-scan-machine-at-this-prominent-prayagraj-hospital-is-lying-nonfunctional-101620225396337.html

The court also clarified that there will not be any impact on admissions to post-graduate medical courses that were granted till September 9, 2020. Maratha youth are disappointed with the verdict. Shailesh Patil, a post-graduate student who also participated in Maratha Kranti Morcha’s protests, said, “After my post-graduation I was planning to apply for a government job and under this reservation was hoping to get it. This verdict will not only impact on us, but all forthcoming generations of Maratha community. Still there are lakhs of students in the state from the community who come from rural areas and giving them a boost is necessary through this reservation.” Last year, Class 11 (first year junior college - FYJC) admissions were delayed by close to two months due to the reservation case going on in the court. An interim stay given by the Supreme Court (SC) on the implementation of the quota for the Maratha community in jobs and education, saw the state education department stop the admission process for FYJC on September 9, 2020. It resumed from November 26, 2020. Talking about the SC verdict Kuldeep Ambekar, a student and president of the Students Helping Hand organisation said, “It was expected that this reservation will get cancelled and now all the Maratha students are in great disappointment. We respect the SC judgment and we hope that state government will find a solution over this critical issue which is related to the careers of lakhs of students.” Another student Pooja Thite said, “There are several post-graduate courses where fees are not affordable. There is a large number of students from the Maratha community who come from economically weaker families. I wanted to opt for higher education in computer engineering, but getting a good college and affordable fees is not possible now due to this reservation getting cancelled.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/maratha-youth-fear-for-future-with-reservation-gone-101620224074982.html
05-05-2021||Other||‘Very disappointing for the Maratha community’||After the Supreme Court quashed the reservation for the Maratha community on Wednesday, strong reactions came in from within the community. Constitutional experts said this verdict was expected. In its judgment, SC ordered the 2018 law framed by the Maharashtra government to give reservations to the Maratha community void as citing that the state cannot breach the 50 per cent ceiling on quotas. Speaking about the judgment, Ulhas Bapat, a constitutional expert, said, “I had earlier also said that giving reservation above 50 per cent is not possible. It was clearly mentioned in the Indira Sahani case that reservation cannot be given over 50 per cent. The SC verdict is final. Despite knowing this, how did the high court allow this law to happen?” According to Bapat, also an academician, the state government has an option to file a review petition in the SC, although the government will have to look at accommodating the Maratha community in the other backward class (OBC) quota. “In the current situation, reservations cannot breach the 50 per cent ceiling. So it will directly impact OBC reservation and then lead to issues between OBCs and Marathas,” said Bapat. Prakash Ambedkar, grandson of Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar and Vanchit Bahujan Aghadi leader said, “A large section of the Maratha community, which is economically downtrodden, deserves reservation. There are two segments within Marathas. While the rich don’t require this, economically poor Marathas should be included in the quota.” Rajya Saba member Sambhajiraje, who was at the centrestage of the Maratha reservation issue, said, “Today is a very disappointing day for the Maratha community. In the end, the state government failed to convince the Supreme Court and now the supernumerary quota method should be implemented, it is the only option left. I appeal to the Maratha community not to undertake protests or huge gatherings in view of the current Covid situation.” Shiv Sangram party leader Vinayak Mete, who is also one of the coordinators of the Maratha Kranti Morcha, alleged that the state government failed to strongly put up a legal fight for the Maratha community in front of the Supreme Court. “Taking moral responsibility of this Ashok Chavan should immediately resign from the cabinet. Throughout the last one year, as the case was going on in the court, there was no proper coordination between the committee headed by Chavan and the Maratha community leaders. It is high time Sharad Pawar intervenes in this matter and helps to resolve this entire reservation quota issue.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/very-disappointing-for-the-maratha-community-101620223474800.html
05-05-2021||Indore||Centre, Madhya Pradesh government failed to stop Covid-19 deaths: Kamal Nath||Senior Congress leader Kamal Nath on Wednesday held the Centre and the Madhya Pradesh governments responsible for the Covid-19 fatalities which he attributed to the failure to take timely measures to deal with the "second wave" of the pandemic. “Should we blame the public for the deaths due to Covid-19? Both the Centre and the state governments led by the BJP are responsible for the fatalities. They are playing politics over dead bodies. They have no concern for the common people,” Nath told reporters here. He said the national and international media had been alerting about the second wave of coronavirus for the last three months, but no preparations were made in advance. "..Rather India was exporting medical oxygen and Remdesivir injections that time,” the Madhya Pradesh Congress chief said. Targeting the Shivraj Singh Chouhan government, Nath said the administration was indulged in politics and distributed Remdesivir injections to leaders of the ruling BJP. "The injections are being sold in the black market," he alleged. Attacking the Union government over the vaccination program, Nath said, “The government has no adequate stock of vaccines but still it announced the launch of the inoculation drive for the people in the age group of 18 to 44 years”. Nath reiterated his allegation that the announcement to launch the drive for the younger lot was made in a bid to attract voters to the BJP during the recently-held Assembly elections. “Today the people are dependent on God and not on the government. I have prayed at the famous temple of Lord Hanuman in Chhindwara (Nath's constituency)," he said. As of Tuesday, Madhya Pradesh's Covid-19 tally stood at 6,12,666 with 6,003 fatalities, the state health department had said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/indore-news/centre-madhya-pradesh-government-failed-to-stop-covid-19-deaths-kamal-nath-101620221459750.html

We are treating all patients from Haryana. But in Gurugram, nearly 40% of the Covid patients are from Delhi. In Faridabad, 20% patients are from Delhi and Noida. Other cities in Haryana are also taking in patients from these regions. We will keep on treating patients from Haryana as well as from outside because a patient is a patient. Our hospitals have not refused treatment to anyone from outside the state.”The Haryana government is working towards creating 1,000 more hospital beds across the state, Khattar said. With the help of the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO), a 500-bed hospital is being made in Panipat as well as Hisar, he added.Also Read| Haryana’s Faridabad to have doctor-on-call service for Covid patientsAs hospitals in the state are reporting a severe shortage of oxygen supplies in view of the recent spike in cases and deaths along with patients coming in from outside, Khattar informed reporters a control room has been set up in Chandigarh to monitor the supply.“We’ve been allotted 70 MT per day of oxygen from Odisha.

05-05-2021||Patna||Patna’s Mahavir temple offers free oxygen lifeline during Covid-19 crisis||Patna’s historic Mahavir Mandir is closed for devotees due to the raging Covid-19 pandemic but it has opened up a lifeline for Covid-19 patients, many of whom have died in hospitals and at homes in absence of oxygen support.Amid the shadow of gloom cast over the state’s healthcare sector which is crumbling under pressure from an increasing number of Covid-19 patients requiring oxygenated beds or ventilator support, the over 300-year-old temple is spreading hope from dawn to dusk by giving out oxygen cylinders to patients for free. All that patients’ attendants or kin need to show is the prescription and the Aadhaar card of the patient.“People need to register online for oxygen, but if one is unable to do so, oxygen is given on presentation of required documents. The idea is to help people in genuine need for free,” said Acharya Kishore Kunal, the administrator of the temple.Ramchandra Sheshadriji and his team, who were earlier engaged in preparing Tirupati laddoos for famous ‘navedyam’, have now got down to public service whole-heartedly. Since many visiting the temple for oxygen are either aged or physically frail, the temple volunteers deliver cylinders to their vehicles while offering reassuring words.While black marketing of oxygen cylinders and important drugs continues to create a depressing scenario for Covid patients, harried residents recognised that selfless initiatives such as these are ‘god sent’, spreading hope and positivity.“For us, this is not just oxygen, it comes along with Hanuman ji’s blessings,” said Abhay Kumar, who got an oxygen cylinder from the temple for his teacher, a Covid patient in home isolation.Acharya Kunal said the temple management wanted to set up an oxygen plant, but it was going to take time at a time when people were crying out for immediate help.“We contacted many firms, but the minimum time it would take is four months. So, we decided to refill small cylinders. Industrialist Sanjay Bhartiya has helped in this pious endeavour and we appreciate his gesture,” he added.Mahavir Mandir has also started a 40-bed Covid hospital at Patna-based Mahavir Arogya Sansthan and another 25-bed hospital in Begusarai.A couple of years ago, the Mahavir Mandir Trust, which runs 12 big institutions including hospitals and orphanages, started free treatment for cancer patients under the age of 18 years and children born with holes in hearts, Kunal said.Mahavir Mandir is not alone in this pious movement, several voluntary organisations and individuals such as Gaurav Rai have also pooled in critical resources such as oxygen cylinders to help the needy. Fondly called oxygen man, Rai carries small cylinders in his car everyday to deliver at the doorsteps of the needy – all for free.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/patnas-mahavir-temple-offers-free-oxygen-lifeline-during-covid-19-crisis-101620217114332.html

05-05-2021||Patna||11-day lockdown underway in Covid-rattled Bihar, authorities face difficulty ensuring compliance||An 11-day complete lockdown, imposed in the wake of a state-wide Covid-19 surge on an unprecedented scale, got underway on Wednesday in Bihar where the authorities had a tough time ensuring compliance from people.Police personnel had begun patrolling the streets since early in the morning, anticipating heavy rush and overcrowding between 7 A.M. and 11 A.M., the four-hour period during which shops selling vegetables, meat, fish, poultry, and grocery items have been allowed to do business.Owners of many shops, not dealing in items deemed as essentials, faced a rude shock as they were made to down their shutters, besides being slapped with fines, by the men in uniform.The policemen were also seen striking their canes against the ground at many places to scare away and disperse people who had come out to make purchases and gathered at shops or around hand-pulled vegetable and fruit carts throwing physical distancing norms to the winds.Many motorcycle-borne youths, loitering around to enjoy high-speed rides on the deserted streets, tried to brazen it out when stopped by police personnel whom they told with a sheepish grin that they had come out for "hawakhori" (breath of fresh air).Some of them ended up being fined and even their vehicles being impounded. The luckier ones were let off after being made to undergo, in public, the humiliation of doing squats with their hands grabbing their earlobes.Some of the businessmen and residents, whose behaviour was deemed to be recalcitrant, also ended up being arrested.The number of arrests made, vehicles seized and amount of money recovered by way of fines is likely to be provided by the state police headquarters by the evening.The lockdown from May 5 to 15 was announced by Chief Minister Nitish Kumar on Tuesday on his official Twitter handle, a day after the Patna High Court pressed the panic button and told his government that it will have to pass a judicial order if the state failed to show the resolve to impose restrictions necessitated by the raging "second wave" that has wrought huge devastation across the country.Meanwhile, many people complained of alleged high- handedness by the authorities in enforcing the lockdown and claimed that the guidelines issued by the state home department have left plenty of room for ambiguity."We are in the restaurant business. In the morning some police personnel came and ordered us to down our shutters. The guidelines say we can do home delivery of food from 9 A.M. to 9 P.M. but in the same breath, they add that restaurants have to remain closed.'Why could they not be more specific and make it clear that our kitchens be allowed to function and our delivery boys be allowed to perform their jobs", said a Boring Road resident who did not wish to be named.A male nurse, residing in Sipara locality who visits Shri Krishna Nagar, about five kilometres away, to attend to an elderly patient, said, "it is not clear whether or not auto rickshaws are allowed to ply. During my commute today, I could see the driver of the three-wheeler I rode paying bribes to constables at three places."The burden fell on my shoulders, finally. The autorickshaw driver insisted that I cough up ₹50 for my daily commute which costs less than half of that. I had to do as he said. But how are we going to survive in this manner? We have limited means", he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/11day-lockdown-underway-in-covid-rattled-bihar-authorities-face-difficulty-ensuring-compliance-101620215311860.html

Their initiative, ‘Breathe India’, has raised more than ₹3 crore in a week and they are hopeful it will soon touch ₹4 crore mark. For UP, they have tied up with a Lucknow -based NGO, RightWalk Foundation, headed by Samina Bano, an IIM Bangalore alumna. On Wednesday, a Memorandum of Understanding was signed between KGMU and RightWalk Foundation for donation of oxygen concentrators. The foundation will give 25 units of oxygen concentrators. Of these, 5 units of 10 LPM machines were given today and 15 units of 5 LPM will be given by Friday. RightWalk Foundation works to implement the Right to Education 12.1(c) and the Apprenticeship Act, 1961. Currently, they are supporting the Covid relief efforts by distributing food kits and other items. With the demand for oxygen being higher than ever before, Dr Suryakant, head of the department pulmonary sciences made an appeal to civil society, on the Lucknow Management Association platform. This appeal was then promoted by Prof Nishi Pandey from the English and Modern European Languages Department, Lucknow University. Later KGMU vice chancellor Lt Gen (Dr) Bipin Puri and programme director, Kush Tripathi of RightWalk Foundation, signed an MoU. How IIT-K alumni partneredwith Rightwalk Foundation Ashutosh Ranka, Class of 2017 and four others took to Milaap fund raising platform. They raised more than ₹3 crore, of which ₹2.4 cr will be used to meet crisis situation in Delhi and the rest of the money will be used for Uttar Pradesh. “We decided to get oxygen concentrators for Delhi and tied up with NGO Save Life. Working closely with the Delhi government, we started the fund raiser, Preet India and raised ₹3 crore in a few days. Now we have placed an order for 300 concerntrators with different vendors,” Ashutosh said. Road-map for UP “We decided to expand and in UP we collaborated with RightWalk Foundation. The IIT alumni community also pitched in and we received ₹10 lakh from the batch of 1985,” Ashutosh said.. “As the number of Covid cases started spiralling in April, the demand for oxygen also went up. Realizing the need, our first step was to quickly finalize suppliers of oxygen concentrators. Our consignments from China and Turkey will be reaching us soon,” said Samina Bano, founder and CEO of RightWalk Foundation. She added: “RightWalk has a presence across all the 75 districts of Uttar Pradesh, but we have chosen to intervene in 12 districts where Covid has spread like wildfire. These districts are Lucknow, Varanasi, Agra, Gorakhpur, Kanpur, Amroha, Prayagraj, Noida, Bareilly, Ghaziabad, Aligarh and Moradabad. We plan to keep a fixed number of oxygen concentrators in each district and offer it to needy people free of cost. The intervention will help in saving 30,000 to 40,000 lives in the next four-six weeks. We also plan to distribute medical and ration kits among Covid-affected families.” Currently, RightWalk’s fundraiser has raised more than ₹50 lakhs and counting. Other organizations join in The Swasth Foundation and ACT grant combination has sent 50 units of oxygen concentrators (OCs) to Lucknow that are to be distributed through RightWalk. These are in addition to the 135 concentrators RightWalk has procured from China and Turkey. The former is a non-profit social enterprise focused on providing the poor a range of affordable and high-quality primary-preventive health services, while the latter is a movement by India’s startup ecosystem to fight societal problems at scale. Furthermore, GiveIndia is supporting RightWalk with procurement and deployment of 100 units of 10L OCs and 10 units of 5L OCs in several districts of UP.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/breathe-india-iit-k-grads-fundraiser-for-o2-concentrators-101620215493276.html

05-05-2021||Pune||Sutradhara’s tales: “Kasba Pune” Gao, with its movers & shakers||Time travel is not an easy task. But, as we jump across to Pune’s medieval period, from the early medieval and ancient era, the hazy blur starts changing to a clearer picture. The discovery of paper and use of written correspondence for recording court proceedings and grants grew in the medieval period, which updates us about the political and administrative events of medieval Deccan.The Bahamani rule in Pune continued without a hiccup from 1347 till the 1480s, but the kingdom started disintegrating due to internal conflicts. Malik Ahmad Nizam Shah I, was the son of Nizam-ul-Mulk Malik Hasan Bahri, originally a Hindu Brahmin (originally Timappa) from Bijapur (or Bijanagar). Ahmed Nizam Shah was initially appointed as governor of Beed and Daulatabad and was honoured with title “Nizam-ul-mulk”. As the Bahamani Sultans were made puppet monarchs under hands of Baridshahi prime ministers, Ahmad Nizamshah, who was Junnar governor then, rebelled against the Sultan and successfully defended the attack. He established the new kingdom of Ahmednagar with the early capital at Junnar near Pune; it was subsequently shifted to Daulatabad.Pune to the south of Junnar, thus, became part of the Nizamshahi kingdom of Ahmednagar in the 1490. This period witnessed the migration of many families from Karnataka province to the Pune region.The Thakaars, were a Brahmin family who migrated to Pune, and were later responsible for the establishment of the Gram-daivat, or village deity of Pune, the Kasba Ganapati. Shaligram, Kavalange/Kalange, Kanade, Dhere, Vaidya, Nilange, Bharait and Bharange, were the eight original resident Brahmin families (aath-ghare) of Pune. Pune had some significant Kanadi Brahmin families such as Dharmadhikari, Honap, Nilange and later, the Panses. Before arrival of kokanastha Peshwas, Pune was occupied primarily by deshasta Brahmins such as Purandares and Pethes, who had mansions built in southern Kasba and practised Vedic learning.Zambres are the oldest known resident family of Pune, spanning a period of 800 years.Around 1510 CE, Bengal’s famous saint Chaitnaya Mahaprabhu Maharaj visited Pune. His disciple, Govinddas, described Pune as “Purnanagar”, and in his verses says that the citizens of Purnanagar were well versed in the various fields of knowledge. The pathshalas in the town taught Vedic and Bhagawat literature. The views of the scholars were well accepted. Thus, Pune appears to be an important centre for study of religion and an educational hub, even back in 16th century CE.Pune functioned as Kasbe Pune - a tehsil-like headquarter, as well as a large village, under Nizamshahi. During this period, we find records of various families in the Pune region who were appointed to administrative positions which were passed on to the generations in a hereditary manner. The Zambre family were the Patils of Kasbe Pune and the remains of their open office called Zambre chawdi, existed near Gujarat High school in Kasba peth, until recently. They served as village head, head of police and justice, and were responsible tax collection. The Bharat Itihas Samshodhak Mandal’s secretary and historian, C G Karve, reports its existence in the form of a two-storeyed building till 1943. The Ladkat family were appointed as Patils for the Mali area and till today, they are responsible for upkeep of Nava Kalbhairav temple in Pune. Rajashris were the Brahmin Kulkarnis of Pune. Traditionally, Kulkarni was a title used by people who maintained the accounts and records of villages, used in collecting taxes. Dharmadhikaris were Upadhyays or the religious heads also responsible for religious teaching and decision making. The Saptashri family provided the priest for the Nageshwar temple.As Pune functioned as a Nizamshahi Pargana, the Shitoles were appointed as Deshmukhs, responsible for revenue collection, taxation, police and judiciary for the Pune Pargana. The “Deshmukhi vatan” of Pune and the adjoining territory was granted in a hereditary capacity. They were supported by the Deshpande-Honap family who were responsible for record keeping of the Pargana. Indian villages and towns did not grow as strictly planned townships in historical times, except for a few exceptions. However, there has been an organic method to the madness of its seemingly chaotic growth.The story of Kasba Pune followed the same logic and the core grew organically in the beginning. It had narrow meandering lanes and narrower by-lanes (alis, gallis and bols), distinctly medieval in their layout. Most of the houses then were made of “bhendyachya vita” (unbaked bricks) and few with rectangular book- shaped baked bricks. Like most medieval towns, it was built for pedestrian or animal drawn traffic. Houses were densely packed and close to each other opening into courtyards in the centre. A prominent village deity, such as Kasba Ganpati, marked the religious centre of the settlement. Unlike European settlements, the wards of Kasba were mixed-class areas where rich and poor lived in the same place - stately wadas surrounded by smaller houses and huts of the poorest. This was quite different from modern towns where economic class- based neighbourhoods are the norm. However, these neighbourhoods were caste–based. Thus people of same caste and often, occupation, whether rich or poor lived close to each other.In the last column, we saw potters living near Kumbhar Ves and the Mali community cultivating in Mali were near the Nagjhari stream. Bhoyis, or the fishermen, occupied the area next to Kumbhars near the river Mutha and even today, the oldest fish market in Pune functions from the same area. A small Wadar (stone workers) community stayed next to the fisherman area. A significant Muslim population occupied the area around Dhakta Shaeikh Salla dargah and the area within Killa-e-Hissar. As seen in most medieval settlements, the Mahar and Mang communities lived on the outskirts, to the northeast of Kasba; a stark caste divide was observed. The Kasai community lived next to them due to similar occupational interests. Central Kasba was occupied by Shimpis (tailors), Shoshka Kasars (bangle makers), and Tavastha Kasar/tambats (coppersmith) who lived along streets with respective names. In these kinship/community areas, they built temples and shrines to their community deities (for instance, the Twastha Kasar Mandir, of the Kasar community).

05-05-2021||Bhopal||Villagers in MP oppose cremation of Covid-19 victims fearing for their own lives||A 65-year-old Kuntibai died in a private hospital of Madhya Pradesh’s Dewas district on Monday. She was Covid 19 suspect. When her daughter-in-law Babita brought her body for cremation to their home in Chapda village, the villagers asked her to cremate the body 40 km away at her mother-in-law’s native village of Matmor. However, villagers at Matmor also prevented her from performing Kuntibai’s last rites. After a five hour long struggle, Babita approached Bagli police station. With their help, the body was cremated in a nearby crematorium, but not without opposition from the locals.Bagli town inspector Jayram Chauhan said they assured the villagers that Kuntibai’s cremation in the local crematorium will not lead to Covid-19 infection spreading in the areas, as feared by the locals.This is just one example of many cases when villagers across Madhya Pradesh have prevented cremation of Covid 19 infected people fearing it may infect them.Last Friday, in Niwari district, an employee of district court, Sandhya Vyas, 45, died of Covid 19. His father Kamal Mishra and son Shivam Vyas were not allowed to cremate him at Chirpura village in Niwari district.“The villagers locked themselves in their houses and hid the wood required for cremation. Later, Niwari, superintendent of police (SP), Alok Kumar Singh and other district officials reached the crematorium and threatened to take legal action against the villagers. The cremation took place after 14 hours,” said Shivam Vyas, son of the deceased.A local villager Umesh Mishra said, “Our purpose is not to hurt anyone but to save our families from Covid-19. Unlike cities, the crematorium grounds in villages are not too far from our houses. If the infection spreads, what will we do?”In Dhar too, members of two village panchayats opposed the cremation of outsiders. Even, the SDM put a ban on the cremation of outsiders and deployed teachers to check the Aadhaar cards of those approaching local crematorium. The order was cancelled on Monday.The state government spokesperson and medical education minister Vishwas Sarang said, “The collectors have been asked to create awareness among villagers about Covid-19. They have also been asked to ensure respectful cremation of the infected people.”A local activist of Bundelkhand Manvendra Singh said, “Villagers are really afraid of getting infected in the second wave. They have stopped entry of people into the villages. The government should make necessary safety arrangement at the crematorium grounds.”As of Monday evening Madhya Pradesh’s Covid-19 caseload had crossed the six lakh-mark while the death toll stood at 5,905. 12,062 fresh infections and 93 deaths due to the disease were recorded in the 24 hour period up to the release of data.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bhopal-news/villagers-in-mp-oppose-cremation-of-covid-19-victims-fearing-for-their-own-lives-101620209662785.html

05-05-2021||Mumbai||Uddhav-led MVA govt, ex-CM Fadnavis trade words over SC verdict on Maratha quota||Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray on Wednesday said that the legal battle on Maratha reservation will continue and termed the verdict given by the Supreme Court as “unfortunate”. Thackeray also requested Prime Minister Narendra Modi to take a decision on Maratha reservation since the authority to decide on the Maratha quota reservation lies with the Centre.The apex court on Wednesday quashed the 2018 law which was brought by the Maharashtra government in 2018 to give reservation to the Maratha community citing that the state could not have breached the 50% ceiling on quota.Maharashtra minister Ashok Chavan, who heads the state cabinet's committee on Maratha reservation, said that the MVA government will send a recommendation to the Centre for Maratha reservation since the apex court upheld the validity of the 102nd constitutional amendment and ruled that the central government is the only authority which has the power to determine socially and educationally backward classes (SEBCs).“The Fadnavis-led government enacted the Reservation Act in November 2018 after 102th constitutional amendment which took away the state's power to give reservation,” Chavan said. He also accused the former chief minister of misleading the people of Maharashtra by passing a law when it had no power to do so.“The responsibility of giving reservation to the Maratha community now lies with the Centre after the Supreme Court order which makes it clear that states do not have right to give quotas to any community,” NCP minister Nawab Malik said.Former chief minister Devendra Fadnavis blamed the Shiv Sena and said that every single decision was taken after keeping Uddhav Thackeray into confidence since he was part of the previous government. He also highlighted that the Solicitor General had highlighted that the state's power to award reservation has not been taken away. “The law on Maratha quota was passed by our government by taking Uddhav Thackeray into confidence as his party was part of our government at that time,” Fadnavis said.“The Solicitor General had clearly told the Supreme Court that states' right to provide quota had not been taken away,” he further added.The five-judge bench, headed by justice Ashok Bhushan said that the decision to provide quota to the Maratha community beyond 50% violated equality and also said that the state failed to show any particular reason as to why the Maratha community should be considered as socially and economically backward class.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/uddhavled-mva-govt-ex-cm-fadnavis-trade-words-over-sc-verdict-on-maratha-quota-101620209044984.html

A few hours later, John picked herself up, reported to the Covid ward of the hospital and discharged her duties for the day.The 32-year-old said her grandmother raised her after she lost her mother at the age of one. “I addressed her as Amma. She was more than a mother to me. The news of her demise shattered me. I felt helpless, and orphaned at the same time. My husband asked me to take leave and go home. But I knew I would not be allowed to attend her last rites because of the Covid norms. Besides, there are so many patients banking on me. If I manage to save their lives, it will be my tribute to Amma,” she said.Amid the deadly second wave of Covid-19 in the country, and the fourth in Delhi,thousands of people are testing positive for the disease and over 2,000 are succumbing to the infection every day. The virus has not spared healthcare workers either. Many of them have tested positive, are in need of oxygen support themselves while some have lost their loved ones to Covid-19.Also Read | Centre moves SC against show cause notice of contempt over oxygen supply deficitJohn, who hails from Thiruvananthapuram, and lives here with her husband and two children, said her decision of not going home in such a situation was not easy. “I would have collapsed emotionally had I visited home now. I am needed here right now and that’s why, I decided to continue doing my duty. My aunt recorded the video of Amma’s last rites and shared it with me. I am yet to watch it. I am avoiding it so that I can remain mentally strong and work right now,” she saidSeveral other doctors, nurses, and healthcare workers have been on duty without a break. A senior doctor from Rajeev Gandhi Superspeciality hospital said, “A couple of days ago, two of my doctors lost their family members. One of them, who lost his parent, called me and said, ‘Sir, I am going for the cremation, I will not be able to make it to the evening shift. Can I take the morning shift instead?’ This is the level of dedication among my staff. Many of them have several family members who are down with Covid-19 and yet, they come for their duty.”A 48-year-old nursing officer at Safdarjung Hospital, who tested positive for Covid-19 during the course of her duty, reported back to work immediately after testing negative. “I lost 6kgs in the last 14-15 days. I feel weak all the time. It is difficult to climb to the second floor without getting tired. But I cannot afford to take a break at a time when almost half of my colleagues are down with Covid-19. My husband and two daughters also got infected because of me,” she said.A senior nursing officer at Ram Manohar Lohia (RML) Hospital said two of her colleagues lost their husbands to Covid-19. Similarly, officials at the Employees’ State Insurance Model Hospital in Basaidarapur said many of their colleagues have been discharging their duties despite having personal losses. Babita Rani, a senior nursing officer at the hospital, said, “A colleague recently lost her husband to Covid-19. The husbands of two other nurses are currently undergoing treatment for Covid-19 at the hospital. They are performing their duty without a break. It’s very difficult but we cannot help.

It said the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act obliges reporting of child sexual abuse only if one has knowledge of such offences. It does require a person to investigate and gather knowledge, it added.A division bench of justices ZA Haq and Amit Borkar said it was clear from the wording of the law that it imposes a legal obligation on a person to inform the authorities in case of knowledge that an offence under it has been committed. It said the expression used is “knowledge” which means some information received by such person about the commission of a crime, and that is when it is required to report the authorities. “There is no obligation on such person to investigate and gather knowledge,” said the bench.Also Read | 26/11 Mumbai attacks’ key witness to be rendered homelessMaroti Pimpalkar was booked in connection with abuse of the schoolgirls at a hostel in 2019.

It added the crime came to light only when the girls were shifted to the hospital as their condition deteriorated. “There is no material on record to show that the applicant [doctor] was made aware about the sexual assault...,” the court said. “On the contrary, from the statement of the teacher of victims, it appears that the sexual assault was detected only in General Hospital, Chandrapur.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/hc-strikes-down-doctor-s-prosecution-for-failing-to-report-child-sexual-abuse-101620201924771.html
05-05-2021||Delhi||#FightAgainstCovid: Doctors go beyond their call of duty||There seems to be no stopping the havoc that the pandemic is playing in our lives. And amid this crisis, even though the frontline workers are facing a severe burnout, there are some doctors in Delhi-NCR, who are going above and beyond their professional call of duty to ensure that they serve denizens in whichever way possible.Some like Dr Harjit Singh Bhatti — who started an initiative Doctors on Road to help the underprivileged in Delhi — have so far catered to migrant labourer in certain colonies of Okhla, South Extension, Nehru Nagar and Kidwai Nagar. “Small bastis in and around Delhi still have no access to healthcare or information about the pandemic. We provide them with masks, soaps and sanitisers since the infection can be curbed by these preventative measures,” says Bhatti. Overseeing work of 25 volunteers in his team, he adds: “There is a shortage of oxygen and beds in the city, so I believe teaching the poorer sections about Covid appropriate behaviour will go a long way in mitigating the problem. We are trying to connect more doctors in different cities and create a network that will aid all those in need.” Turn your attention to the community hall at Saket Court Residential Complex, and here’s Dr Kiran Kukreja tending to the non-critical Covid patients, with urgent care to those who have lowering oxygen levels. “Till they get transferred to a hospital, it’s important that they get some medical attention. And this seemed to be the best possible way in such times,” says Kukreja, who is working on shifts with another Delhi-based doctor, Dr Vinod Raina. She adds: “I received a request from the Residents Welfare Association to help with non critical members in the society, for they had a lot of infected people and a few casualties. To provide relief to the families, I opened the centre with round the clock nurses and doctors from my own team... Once a young girl was brought to me in a state of unconsciousness. We managed to stabilise her oxygen levels, till the time she could be referred to a hospital. This makes me happy. My family and friends worry about my safety, but I tell them – It’s our responsibility to help those in need.”Not just on ground physical care, even over the telephone, doctors are voluntarily extending help to those in need. For patients who were finding it difficult to seek medical advice in these times, Gurugram-based Dr Rajan Taneja started providing free teleconsultation services, after his office hours. “People are in a state of panic because of the extent of the second wave of the pandemic. And many patients are not seeking proper medical advice due to the inability to move out or financial constraints. We do not want them to suffer because of lack of resources, and offer sound advice,” says Taneja, who is presently attending more than 50 callers everyday. He adds that he doesn’t stop there. “After finishing our shifts at the hospitals, my wife, sister-in-law and I offer consultation both on WhatsApp and calls, to Covid patients and pregnant women in particular, guiding them on the right course of action. I get tired, but helping others gives me a dopamine surge, a feeling of happiness and fulfilment. As doctors, this is all we can do today.” Author tweets @bhagat_mallikaFollow more stories on Facebook and Twitter||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/fightagainstcovid-doctors-go-beyond-their-call-of-duty-101620201923715.html

05-05-2021||Kolkata||As Mamata Banerjee takes her oath, BJP vows to 'dismantle' political violence in Bengal||As Trinamool Congress (TMC) supremo Mamata Banerjee on Wednesday took her oath as the chief minister of West Bengal for the third consecutive term; elsewhere in Kolkata, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) took another -- to 'dismantle" political violence in the state. BJP national president JP Nadda, addressing party workers in the city, said, "We take an oath to carry out our responsibility, by happily accepting the mandate, and play the important role of Opposition. What we fought in Bengal - political violence, appeasement, and tyranny - we won't step back from carrying out our duties."Post-poll violence has ensued over the past two days across West Bengal, with reports emerging of clashes between rival political workers, torched offices, and the deaths of workers and supporters cutting across party lines.The BJP has been protesting this alleged "rampant violence" in the state, accusing the TMC of hunting down its workers in retribution. The party is also holding a nationwide dharna today to protest what it calls the debilitating law and order situation. West Bengal BJP chief Dilip Ghosh, along with other members of the party's state unit, has demanded that President's Rule be imposed to bring the scene under control. At the same time, however, the BJP is also maintaining a line of political courtesy, with Prime Minister Narendra Modi taking to his official account on Twitter to congratulate Mamata Banerjee on Wednesday for her swearing-in.Addressing BJP workers on this day, JP Nadda said, "Those who were supposed to protect others are the ones responsible for this violence. They can take the oath, everyone has the right to do so in a democracy. But we also take an oath to dismantle political violence in Bengal."The TMC secured 213 seats in the recently concluded eight-phased West Bengal Assembly elections, while the BJP won 77 seats. This is the third consecutive time that Mamata Banerjee has been sworn in as the state's chief minister. She assumed the post for the first time in 2011, by ending the 34-year-long CPI(M) regime, one of the longest-serving elected governments in the world.After ruling the state for two successive terms, the game of thrones of 2021 was no less than a do-or-die situation for Mamata Banerjee. However, these elections saw the people of West Bengal once again rewarding her with an overwhelming mandate, and punishing the Left Front with zero seats, paving the way for a state legislature to be formed without any Left representation for the first time in history.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/as-mamata-banerjee-takes-her-oath-bjp-s-jp-nadda-vows-to-dismantle-political-violence-in-west-bengal-101620196309147.html

Two children of the dead woman, Jwala Mahto and his sister Sharmila Kumari, were arrested by police. Sharmila told reporters that her mother was “not treated properly” and the nursing staff at the hospital sought bribes at every step.“Nurse [name withheld] asked [for] money for treatment [of mother]. The other staff members were asking for cash separately to go check on my mother. When they were refused money, the medical staff referred her [mother] to Patna Medical College Hospital (PMCH). It is complete medical negligence,” Sharmila told gathered reporters.A case was registered after the incident with the Town police station for rioting, assaulting public servants and criminal intimidation along with the sections of Epidemic Disease Act. The hospital has denied medical negligence.“There was no negligence. Patient’s condition was critical when she was brought to hospital. Her oxygen level was very low,” said civil surgeon Dr Indradeo Prasad. He added that policemen have been posted outside the hospital on his request after the incident.In the second incident, reported from Sri Krishna Medical College and Hospital (SKMCH) Muzaffarpur, angry relatives of a Covid patient admitted in ward 14, vandalised hospital property alleging the patient died due to medical negligence. The hospital staff ran for cover. The situation was brought under control after the station house officer (SHO) of police outpost Sumanji Jha arrived at the hospital with his team.In Bhagalpur, two brothers, Akshay Kapri and Chhotu Kapri were arrested earlier today allegedly for assaulting medical staff and vandalizing property at Mayaganj Hospital accusing them of mismanagement and negligence.Police said the accused attacked Dr Rahul Kumar Bharti and Dr Ranjan Kumar alleging they had cut off oxygen supply to their grandfather. After the situation was brought into control, the doctors at the hospital staged a flash protest refusing to return to work in absence of adequate security.The brothers said they had already lost their father and uncle to the coronavirus and were enraged to see the knob of oxygen cylinder supplying gas to their grandfather switched off. “I made a video, which went viral on social media. This led to police taking action against me,” alleged Akshay.Incidents of attacks on doctors and nurses have increased in Bihar in the past couple of weeks following the healthcare infrastructure crumbling under pressure from the second wave of Covid-19 infection. While the hospitals struggle to treat a rising number of patients, their problems have been compounded by a shortage of ICU beds and critical medical supplies such as oxygen and life-saving medicines, which are being hoarded and black marketed by unscrupulous elements. Unable to contain the crisis quickly, the state government has announced a 10-day long lockdown.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/bihar-covid-crisis-goes-on-with-kin-of-dying-patients-assaulting-hospital-staff-101620197181925.html

05-05-2021||Delhi||#NewNormal: Tired of household chores? Delhi-NCR folks put robotic cleaners on the job||Robotic cleaners are the new it thing when it comes to cleaning. With most city folks giving paid leaves to their house helps, to support them during the lockdown, and managing work from home and work at home alongside, the queries for these robotic cleaners are seeing a rise on various online platforms. And Delhi-NCR residents say that these robotic cleaners are a boon especially for households that have young children or pets. With work from home having become a norm, getting a robot to do the cleaning became a necessity for Meena Kapoor, a Delhi-based freelance writer. She explains, “It’s quite a lot of floor area, so I would end up cleaning two rooms every few days (in absence of my house help). For some time I could tolerate it, but not on a regular basis. Then my house help also developed a severe spinal problem, which made me start research on robot vacuums. I have lots of friends abroad who have robots, and was aware that these things exist. A couple of my friends here have also bought them recently. I asked them about their experiences with robotic cleaners, and then decided to buy one for myself online. Now having experienced it, I feel things work better than humans as a robot will gather more dust than a jhadu would.” Seema Sandhu, a Gurugram-based radiologist, who didn’t have a house help for almost 10 months last year, initially bought a vacuum cleaner and has of late invested in a robotic cleaner. She recalls, “In September we got home two dogs, and my workload increased like anything. The hand held vacuum takes a lot of time. So we decided to buy the robot cleaner. One has to map the place for the robot, and it takes some time to get a hang of it. It needs to be charged as well, and sometimes gets stuck. But if you use both the vacuum cleaner and robot, then it’s just perfect!” For those battling Covid, robotic cleaners have been a boon in disguise. Take for instance Ruchi Vidhani, a Gurugram-based business manager who recently bought one such machine. “I was down with Covid and nobody could enter my room to clean it. And I was obviously not in the state to clean it myself due to exhaustion. That’s when this robot came in handy and did the job for me. It’s such a worthwhile buy, and kept me stress free about the cleaning concerns while I recovered from the illness,” she says.Some like Surbhi M Tangri, a handicraft dealer, saw this challenge coming and bought a robotic cleaner right when the pandemic intensified. “I haven’t kept any domestic help since the pandemic hit last year since both my parents have comorbidities. I gave my house help a paid leave, and learnt to manage things on my own. But when the lockdown was lifted last year, I rushed to buy a dishwasher and a robot cleaner. These gadgets have been a blessing and totally worth the money. In fact, now I’m trying to convince my neighbours and friends to buy such cleaners till the new Covid wave settles down,” she says. And there are some who have made up their mind to buy these machines pretty soon. Paarul Chand, an author is now looking for available options to buy a robotic cleaner. “I’m not sure which one? But I have to buy for sure! We have live in house help, but when everyone is home during such lockdowns, it’s extra work for them to do cater to each family member’s demands and also do the cleaning. Also, when everyone’s home, the house gets dirty faster than usual. So I’m keen to buy a robot cleaner that mops as well, as that would be an extremely big help,” says the Gurugrammer.

He then arranged a cardiac ambulance and got all three of them shifted to the Pune-based hospital where he works."My father, who was aged and co-morbid, was diagnosed with renal failure. While undergoing treatment, his heartbeat also increased and he was diagnosed with pulmonary embolism (blockage of arteries in lungs). His blood pressure also became low and he died of Covid-19 on April 26," the physician said.Dr Penurkar said when he moved his parents here, his father was of the opinion that he should continue to serve the patients in these difficult times. At the time of his father's death, his mother and brother were also undergoing treatment in the hospital."My mother could see the situation in the hospital and told me to continue serving the Covid-19 patients as the services of MD physicians are required at this time," he said.Dr Penurkar said he performed the last rites of his father alone and resumed duty the next evening. "Fortunately, my mother and brother have now recovered," he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/pune-doctor-resumes-treating-covid-19-patients-day-after-coronavirus-takes-his-father-away-101620194925019.html
05-05-2021||Delhi||This Delhi-based doc is honouring the fighting spirit of Covid warriors through music||Since the Covid-19 pandemic has struck, alongside the health care workers there have emerged many kind souls who are relentlessly working as warriors to combat challenges at the frontline. Honouring their fighting spirit is a lyrical tribute by Dr Gurpreet Gulati, a former AIIMS professor turned musician. His recently released lyrical poem, Tere Saath Hoon (on YouTube/joerocks _aka_gurpreet) is a tribute to corona warriors.‘Tere saath tha, tere saath hun. Aae mere dost, Mai tere paas hun...’ are the opening lines of this tribute by Gulati, a radiologist who goes by the stage moniker Joerocks. He explains: “Earlier when we would talk about frontline warriors, we’d talk about people in the healthcare industry. But now, ordinary people are working silently and tirelessly, risking their own lives. This poem is for all those who today make us believe that humanity exists and together, we shall overcome.” He answered his inner calling of becoming a musician in 2013, and since then there has been no stopping him. “My career as a doctor was very demanding. I had to quit music for a few years, but while revaluating my choices, I decided to quit medicine and dedicate myself to music,” he says, adding how he hopes to bring positivity in the lives of people during such tough times. In 2020, during the initial months of the lockdown, Gulati came up with a corona warriors anthem, Kahe Ghabraye, which went viral on social media for its motivational theme. He recalls: “I had to record at home, and we had to film the whole song — that had doctors from AIIMS Delhi performing in it — in one day! It was another tribute to all the corona warriors, and showcased sanitisation techniques, PPE kits, masks, etc.” The singer-songwriter, who often writes on social and health issues such as mental health and organ donation, has been working on multiple songs during the pandemic; including two projects that are yet to release. “Agrasar is one of them. It’s a motivational song that tells us not to fear, go ahead and get vaccinated while maintaining all precautions; it’s the only way to beat the virus! I’ve other songs in the pipeline that I will release once we all have recovered and the situation isn’t grim. Till then, whatever little I can do with music, is all I can do right now while at home. But I wish to contribute in whichever way I can,” he concludes.

05-05-2021||Lucknow||UP panchayat poll results start coming in, parties claim stupendous performances||As results for the Uttar Pradesh panchayat polls started trickling in Tuesday night, rival political parties claimed sterling performances, apparently taking advantage of the fact that these elections were not contested on party symbols.SP spokesperson Anurag Bhadauria told PTI, "Samajwadi Party-backed candidates have won 760 seats for the post of zila panchayat members."AAP leader Vaibhav Maheshwari said that 71 candidates backed by the party have won the post of zila panchayat members.UP Congress chief Ajay Kumar Lallu also told PTI that 389 party supported candidates have won the zila panchayat members' post.He said that a large number of party-backed candidates have won the post of pradhan of village panchayats as well.UP BJP chief Swatantradev Singh said party workers have emerged victorious for the posts of members of zila panchayats, members of kshetra panchayats and village pradhans.He also claimed that after the results, the party will get into formation of zila panchayat and kshetra panchayat boards.The BJP had on Monday claimed 918 party candidates have been elected for zila panchayats while over 500 are leading.In a statement issued here, Uttar Pradesh BJP chief Swatantradev Singh had said that in the three-tier panchayat election in the state, over 45,000 party-supported candidates have won the post of village pradhan, while more than 60,000 party-supported candidates have emerged victorious as members of kshetra panchayats."As many as 918 party-supported candidates have won the post of members of zila panchayat," he had said."On more than 450 seats, the party-supported candidates have taken a decisive lead," Singh had said, attributing the performances to rural development and farmers' welfare ensured by the Yogi Adityanath government in the state.A senior State Election Commission (SEC) official said Tuesday evening that counting of votes for members of village panchayat, pradhans of village panchayat and members of kshetra panchayat has been completed.Only the counting of votes polled to elect zila panchayat members is left.At the end of counting, result sheets are being tallied and declaration of seats was likely to be done late Tuesday night, the SEC official said.The SEC also said that there should not be any delay in handing over the certificates to the winning candidates, and strict action will be initiated against officials concerned in case of any complaint.The counting of votes began Sunday morning at more than 825 centres across the 75 districts of Uttar Pradesh.Over 8.69 lakh posts were up for grabs in these polls. Of these posts, more than 7.32 lakh seats were in the gram panchayat wards, 58,176 in the gram panchayats, 75,852 in the kshetra (block) panchayats and 3,050 in the zila panchayats.Meanwhile, Samajwadi Party supremo Akhilesh Yadav, on Tuesday claimed that in the UP panchayat polls people gave first priority to his party and said that they did a tremendous job to save the democracy by electing his party candidates."Even in the Prime Minister's constituency (Varanasi) and CM's turf (Gorakhpur), the BJP had to taste defeat. In Lucknow too, the BJP had to taste defeat despite misuse of official machinery," the SP chief said.He said, "The panchayat election results showed that the BJP is now a sinking ship. Signals emanating from the panchayat polls in the state show that the BJP will be wiped out in 2022 (UP Assembly elections)," he said.The state election commission said over 3.19 lakh candidates were elected unopposed in the panchayat election. In all, there were over 12.89 lakh candidates in the poll fray.Uttar Pradesh held panchayat polls in four phases ending April 29 in which candidates contested on free symbols given by the SEC. The election was held at four levels of panchayat bodies --- gram panchayat members, gram pradhan, block panchayat and zila panchayat.In Ayodhya, the BJP won just eight out of the 40 zila panchayat seats, a disappointment for the ruling party in the district on which the Centre and the state government have lavished much attention.The opposition Samajwadi Party claimed to have made major gains in the panchayat elections, saying candidates it backed won 22 district level seats in Ayodhya.The Bahujan Samaj Party claimed its candidates won four zila panchayat seats in Ayodhya.Contrary to the BJP's claim of overall success in the state, its Ayodhya unit has conceded that it did not do as well as expected."The results are disappointing. Despite having sitting BJP MLAs in all constituencies in Ayodhya district, we won only eight out of 40 zila panchayat seats," BJP's district spokesperson Diwakar Singh told PTI.The Samajwadi Party claimed to have won three of the four zila panchayat seats there, leaving one for an independent candidate.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/up-panchayat-poll-results-start-coming-in-parties-claim-stupendous-performances-101620192916926.html

The crackdown comes amid rampant black marketing of essential medical supplies to treat Covid1-19 patients, several of whom have died due to their shortage while several others have been forced to buy these at exorbitant prices.The EOU has constituted two teams comprising 10 policemen each to conduct raids and also set up a 24x7 control room with dedicated phone lines-- 0612-2215142 and 8544428427 inviting residents and NGOs to report illegal trade of essential medical supplies. “Traders are cashing in on the virus panic by jacking up prices of essential products,” said an official.12 oxygen cylinders (50 litres each) were seized on Tuesday from Madhav Market near Maurya Hospital in Patrakar Nagar police station area in the capital along with the arrest of traders Dhiraj Kumar Mehta and Kameshwar Rai for hoarding. Police also raided Agamkuan police station area and seized another five cylinders (50 litres each) following the arrest of two hoarders, Priyansu Raj and Pratik Singh.Earlier 57 oxygen cylinders (5 kg each) were seized in a raid in the SK Puri police station area.

The centre has allocated 214MT of medical oxygen to Bihar every day. However, the state is struggling to store liquid medical oxygen in absence of cryogenic storage.Additional director general of EoU, Nayyar Hasnain Khan said informers and plain clothes cops were keeping an eye on private hospitals, oxygen generation plants and medicine stockists to check illegal trade. The unit is also using technical surveillance to track offenders.“We also appeal to people to not hoard oxygen cylinders and drugs as those who immediately need them will face difficulties,” Khan said.Enforcement officers said several gangs were suspected to be involved in the hoarding of oxygen cylinders.Facing criticism over its handling of the crisis, the Bihar government on Tuesday announced a statewide lockdown for 10 days from May 5 in order to get a grip on the situation after rebuke from Patna high court. 105 people died due to the infection in Bihar on Tuesday, while 14,794 fresh positive cases pushed the tally of the diseased to 523,841, health department bulletin said.

05-05-2021||Patna||JD(U) and other Bihar parties hit rock bottom in Assam, Bengal polls||Bihar based political parties including the ruling Janata Dal (United) (JD-U) couldn’t win even a single seat in the recently concluded Bihar and Assam assembly elections. What is even worse, most of their candidates lost even their deposits in a grim reminder of their limited influence in politics outside Bihar.The JD(U) managed 0.11% of the total votes polled in Assam with all the 34 party candidates losing their deposits as per election commission data. JD(U) leaders, aware of the poll outcome, said the majority of party candidates polled around 600- 800 votes with only a few getting over 1000 votes. In 2016 Assam assembly polls, the JD(U) contested four seats and earned 0.07% votes.In Bengal, JD(U) fared even worse with 0.02% vote share with majority of the 16 party candidates losing their deposits, the JD(U) leader quoted above said.The Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) candidate got 0.07% votes on the single seat contested in Assam with support from the Congress-led alliance. The RJD didn’t field any candidates in West Bengal and extended support to chief minister Mamata Banerjee’s Trinamool Congress.Similarly, the Lok Janshakti party (LJP) contested 10 seats in West Bengal and around dozen seats in Assam with a negligible return of 0.01% and 0.04% votes respectively.The CPI-ML( liberation), which has re-emerged as a political force in Bihar after last year’s assembly elections, got 0.03% of all the votes cast in West Bengal and in Assam, it could manage only 0.14% votes.Sanjay Verma, a senior JD(U) leader and in-charge of Assam polls, said the party did not perform as per expectations because of a straight contest between BJP and Congress –AIUDF alliance in Assam. Similarly, its 16 candidates in West Bengal did not gain much due to the straight fight between the BJP and the TMC in the state.“But in both the states, the JD(U) has managed to strengthen its organisational base and would strive to gain political space in the coming days,” Verma said.RJD’s Abdul Bari Siddiqui, a former minister, said his party could have done better in Assam had it got more seats in alliance with the Congress. “The party has made considerable inroads in Assam. In Bengal, we did not contest,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/jdu-and-other-bihar-parties-hit-rock-bottom-in-assam-bengal-polls-101620184221118.html

The cause of the fire remains unclear.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/fire-in-delhi-s-vikaspuri-covid-hospital-26-patients-rescued-101620183801032.html

However, funeral pyres were finally lit by KSS volunteers as none of the relatives, who stayed 50 meters away from the crematorium, could muster the courage to come close to perform last rites despite being provided with a PPE kit.“We faced a tough time a few days ago in arranging for the funeral of a 45- year old suspected corona victim (ward no. 27). Only one distant relative was willing to handle the body. People in the neighbourhood shut their doors. Finally, we managed to carry out his last rites 20 hours later,” Sinha said.He said the KSS was formed to arrange for the funeral of unclaimed bodies with the help of dozens of volunteers.Meanwhile, district magistrate Thiyagrajan SM, at a review meeting on Monday, asked officials to arrange manpower for providing assistance in the funeral of the deceased.SDO (Sadar) Rakesh Gupta said there were instances of kin abandoning the bodies of corona victims.Now, Darbhanga municipal commissioner Manesh Kumar Meena has issued a circular that cleanliness in-charge of the municipal ward concerned would ensure the lifting of unclaimed bodies while identifying four employees under his jurisdiction for this purpose. The municipal corporation has set a control room for the disposal of unclaimed dead bodies.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/control-room-set-up-in-bihar-s-darbhanga-to-dispose-of-unclaimed-bodies-of-covid-19-victims-101620181336832.html

The Union home secretary has assured the state of additional oxygen allocation and tankers from Gujarat's Jamnagar, Arya added.He said a plant with a capacity of 12,000 oxygen cylinders in Dariba is likely to be operational by Friday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/jaipur-news/covid19-rajasthan-adds-16-more-tankers-for-oxygen-transport-total-38-101620178464568.html
05-05-2021||Delhi||Gangs from other states under scanner for duping Covid patients, families||The prevailing crisis in supply of oxygen, life-saving medicines, injections and equipment for treating Covid-19 has not only thrown open opportunities for hoarders and black marketeers, but also activated syndicates previously involved in phishing and other online cheating, police said. The new trend is that these online fraudsters dupe Covid patients and their family members by offering to deliver essential items.Pointing to how such incidents of online cheating have increased in the last 10 days, officers said they have reason to believe that gangs operating from Delhi-NCR, Jharkhand’s Jamtara, Bengal’s Purulia, and Mewat in Haryana are behind several of the crimes.They said most of the bank accounts to transfer the cheated money were being hired on a commission basis -- a common modus operandi of these gangs.Delhi Police said they busted one such gang on Monday, and arrested a 26-year-old man from Faridabad who was not only directly involved in cheating Covid patients and their relatives but also rented out his bank accounts to other gang members to transfer money.Pointing to the home town of the accused, Rohit Kumar Yadav, who is from Jharkhand, police said they were not ruling out his links with cyber frauds operating out of the Jamtara area in the state.“Yadav and his associates, who are yet to be caught, used to call people who were sending SOS messages for oxygen cylinders or life-saving drugs on social media, and trick them into depositing advance money for delivery of the goods. They collected between ₹2,000 and ₹4,000 but never delivered the items and subsequently ignored the victims,” said DCP (south) Atul Kumar Thakur.Police officers said that apart from looking for targets posting SOS messages along with their contact numbers on social media, these gangs were also widely circulating their phone numbers online, claiming to be the suppliers of oxygen cylinders, medicines and medical equipment used for treating Covid-19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/gangs-from-other-states-under-scanner-for-duping-covid-patients-families-101620170493493.html
05-05-2021||Delhi||Delhi Police to freeze 95 bank accounts of Covid frauds||A day after Delhi Police said that they were joining hands with different agencies to prevent cyber criminals from duping Covid victims, investigators have identified 200 mobile phone numbers and initiated steps to freeze 95 bank accounts involved in some of the frauds.Police said they have coordinated with banks to freeze accounts so that the duped money is not withdrawn or spent, Delhi Police spokesperson Chinmoy Biswal said.“We have also sent the 200 suspicious phone numbers to the Department of Telecommunications for mandatory KYC verification so that these numbers are not used anymore,” said Biswal.In addition, police have identified 33 unique transaction reference (UTR) numbers and 17 UPIs and online wallets used by the fraudsters to target victims, most of who fell prey in their desperation to find oxygen cylinders, concentrators, and medicines.“For the UTRs, UPIs and wallets, we have reached out to the National Payment Corporation of India (NPCI) to block the payment so that the money can eventually be reversed to the victims,” said Biswal.As on Tuesday morning, Delhi Police registered 113 FIRs related to different kinds of crimes committed against coronavirus patients and their kin. Of these, 61 were related to cheating on the pretext of providing medicines or oxygen, and the rest were related to black marketing, hoarding or overcharging. Biswal said that 100 people have been arrested so far for their alleged roles in these crimes.Delhi Police, in association with the ministry of home affairs (MHA), already has a cyber helpline number, 155260, to help victims of online financial frauds recover their money, if they report the fraud in time.On Monday, police decided that apart from the complaints received on this number, even the online financial fraud complaints received on the police’s Covid helpline number, 011-23469900, were to be dealt in the same way, with a focus on helping victims recover the money.Police have said their analysis of some of the cheating cases has suggested that some phishing gangs from Mewat in Haryana and Jamtara in Jharkhand were also taking advantage of the situation in the national capital.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-police-to-freeze-95-bank-accounts-of-covid-frauds-101620170258925.html
05-05-2021||Delhi||Makeshift site at Delhi's Pusa road boosts jabs drive on Day 2||The expanded inoculation programme for people aged between 18 and 44 picked up pace in the national capital on Tuesday at 301 vaccination sites across 77 government schools, and at a large makeshift facility set up by a private hospital in central Delhi.Over 89,000 people received a shot of either Serum Institute of India’s Covishield or Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin on Monday, after the numbers dropped to just over 1,500 on Sunday, with just one government site and a handful of private sites operating on the day.Tuesday’s vaccination numbers, which the government did not disclose till the time of going to press, are likely to be boosted by a temporary vaccination facility set up in 48 hours by BLK-Max Super Speciality Hospital at the Radha Soami Satsang Beas (RSSB) campus on Pusa Road.The makeshift facility currently has 20 vaccination sites, while 30 will be added later; these will allow the hospital to administer 10,000 jabs a day, officials said.Over 3,000 jabs of Covishield, at Rs.900 a dose, were administered at the centre on Tuesday.The doses were provided by Max Healthcare, which procured vials directly from the Serum Institute of India (SII).“The facility is spread out over a large area, and patient flows have been organised in a manner that ensures social distancing, with Covid norms being followed at all times,” the hospital said in a statement.Dr Abhay Soi, chairman and managing director, Max Healthcare, said, “I am happy to share that our team has been able to set up this facility in just about 48 hours with complete support from members of RSSB. We will scale up vaccinations in the coming days and try and reach out to as many people as possible.”While vaccinations also picked up in government schools that were converted into vaccination points exclusively for the 18-44 age group, people reported a lack of social distancing and delays for the second day in a row.Amrita Paul, 28, who went to a school in Sangam Vihar, said that although she booked a 9am slot, she got her shot only after 11am because of a delay in the delivery of doses.“I reached the centre at 8.45am and there was already a queue outside. Once the gates opened, people rushed in, but the vaccines hadn’t arrived. People kept standing in the queue, but got impatient as the day started to get hotter. However, once doses arrived and the tokens were handed out, it just took 10 minutes to get the shot,” she said.Some others, however, said the vaccination system was efficient. “We feel quite relieved now. It is amazing how efficiently resources are being managed to run vaccine sites in public schools smoothly,” said Deepak Vohra, a lawyer, who along with his wife Shilpa Vohra, a teacher, took the first dose of vaccine at a school in New Ashok Nagar.Meanwhile, uncertainty over supplies meant that vaccination sites run by private centres fell behind. There were only 65 sites run by private centres on Tuesday, according to the government’s Co-WIN portal, of which 20 were at the BLK site in Pusa Road. Private hospitals said they had no assurance from Delhi government on receiving doses, while the two vaccine manufacturers in the country turned down requests for supplies.“No vaccines are available from either of the companies,” said an administrator from Holy Family hospital. Sir Ganga Ram hospital previously said that Serum Institute of India told them that vaccine doses will be available only after six months, whereas Bharat Biotech said it would get back.Dr Narin Sehgal, Delhi secretary of the Association of Healthcare Providers (India), said, “We haven’t received any communication from the Delhi government as well.” The Delhi government has ordered 13.4 million doses, split into half Covaxin and Covishield.With inputs from Abhishek Dey||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/makeshift-site-at-pusa-road-boosts-jabs-drive-on-day-2-101620169761635.html
05-05-2021||Delhi||Delhi RWAs ask L-G for nod to set up shot centres in colonies||Several resident welfare associations (RWAs) in Delhi have requested Lieutenant Governor (LG) Anil Baijal to allow them to set up paid Covid-19 vaccination facilities in their colonies in a bid to extend the coverage of the jabs amid a spike in cases that has overwhelmed the Capital’s health care infrastructure.In a letter sent to the LG on Monday, the resident groups also asked for permission to begin “drive-in vaccinations”, as hs been started in Mumbai. HT has seen the letter.The Delhi government began vaccinating people aged 18 to 44 on Monday, across 301 government centres in 76 schools. Several private hospitals have also been offering paid vaccinations.“Most residents in our colony wish to get vaccinated but are scared of contracting Covid-19 due to the crowd at centres. Most of the residents are willing to pay for the vaccination facility and don’t mind paying a little extra if it is made available in our colonies,” the letter read.“We feel that if free vaccination camps are being held in government schools, paid camps can be held in residential colonies in association with RWAs. Most RWAs and residents will be willing to sponsor the paid vaccination for their staff – guards, helps, drivers, garbage collectors, etc,” it added.The letter was signed by the RWAs of around 30 localities, including Sainik Farms, Navjivan Vihar, Vasant Kunj, Hauz Khas Enclave, Chattarpur Enclave, Nizamuddin East, Green Park Extension, New Friends Colony, Mehrauli, and Defence Colony, among others.Officials at the L-G’s office did not respond to requests for comment.The RWAs said that they have prepared a list of beneficiaries. “RWAs will provide full support – arrangement of space, support staff, vaccine storage facility, and other requirements,” the letter read.They also suggested that the vaccines could be administered in neighbourhood clinics or nursing homes.The RWAs also said they would pay for doctors, nurses and ambulances for these proposed vaccination sites.Ruby Makhija, secretary of Navjivan Vihar RWA, said, “Nearly all residents wish to take the vaccine, but their biggest fear is the risk of getting infected in crowded centres. Vaccination camps in their own colonies will encourage more residents to get vaccinated, resulting in maximum coverage in the shortest time leading to control of the disease at the earliest.”“Doorstep vaccination has been very successful in many countries as it obviates the risk of further spread of infection. RWAs can provide much-needed logistical support in tandem with the governmental agencies,” said Devalina Kohli, vice president of the Hill View Apartments RWA in Mehrauli.The L-G office did not respond to requests seeking comment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-rwas-ask-l-g-for-nod-to-set-up-shot-centres-in-colonies-101620168607649.html

The move comes days after the university deferred the final-year undergraduate examinations, which were to begin on May 15.“In view of sudden surge in Covid-19 cases, online teaching shall remain suspended till May 16, 2021,” read the order signed by DU registrar Vikas Gupta.Following this order, students of Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) also demanded the same for the varsity’s postgraduate students. Hundreds of JNU students are scheduled to appear for their end-semester exams this month. However, the university’s administration has made no announcement yet.Later in the day, the Union education ministry asked all central universities to postpone offline exams scheduled in May. “The online exams may however continue,” higher education secretary Amit Khare said in the letter to all centrally funded institutes on Monday. “The situation will be reviewed in the first week of June and appropriate decisions conveyed.”HT on April 29 reported that first-year undergraduate students of several DU colleges asked their principals to suspend all online learning activities for at least two weeks. Students of these colleges are now focusing on assisting those peers who missed their classes due to Covid or other reasons.“The administration should facilitate voluntary revision or doubt-clearing sessions (without attendance), which could be arranged between small groups of willing and healthy students and teachers, so that those who have missed their classes till now can cover the syllabus and are on an equal footing with their classmates by the end of the two-week class suspension,” said Kshitij Jain, a first-year student of St Stephen’s College.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/du-suspends-online-classes-till-may-16-due-to-covid-surge-101620168298371.html
05-05-2021||Delhi||App data on beds, ground reality at odds in Delhi: Residents||People with Covid-19 seeking medical assistance have reported being confused by available bed data released on a realtime, with many turning up at facilities that were meant to have vacancies as per a government mobile app -- Delhi Corona -- but were in reality full.Around 3pm on Tuesday, the government’s Delhi application showed there were 1,515 Covid-19 beds and 56 intensive care unit (ICU) beds available.But people reported none were available. HT reached out to eight of the 65 hospitals where beds were apparently vacant as per the Delhi Corona app. Requests for beds were turned down in all of these hospitalsExperts and officials said this is happening mostly since hospitals are too stretched and have been unable to update their vacancies and occupancy data.Dr Vikas Maurya, director and head of department (pulmonology) at Fortis Hospital, Shalimar Bagh said, “At this crucial time, which hospital will want to turn down patients? The problem is there aren’t enough ICU beds, so we are having to keep critically ill patients, who need ICU care, in wards. So, as soon as a bed gets vacated in the ICU, a patient from our ward moves in”.“This is happening because people get admitted to private hospitals expecting better treatment and care,” said Dr Maurya.The Delhi government did not respond for comment.Aditi Raj, a 27-year-old resident of south Delhi’s Saket, said she was looking for an oxygen bed for her sister on Monday after her oxygen saturation levels dipped to 82. She followed the information on the Delhi Corona app but was turned away from all hospitals where beds were reportedly vacant.“I tried at least five hospitals.The app showed there are 20 vacant beds in one hospital. When we went there, the administration told us that they have not had a vacant bed in the last two days. Is this the ‘real-time’ information that the government is providing to people? When families are already in the worst mental state, they are misleading us and wasting our time,” said Raj who finally admitted her sister to a private hospital in Greater Noida.A senior official of the Delhi government said the oxygen shortage also led several hospitals, including Guru Teg Bahadur (GTB), Rajiv Gandhi Super Speciality and Batra hospitals, to reduce their bed capacity, which might not have been updated on the portal by the hospital administrations.“Amid the rising Covid cases, we are also facing a shortage of oxygen supply, which has thrown plans off gear. The responsibility of updating the status of beds in real-time is the job of the respective hospitals. Many hospitals are also refusing to admit critically ill patients because of this (oxygen) shortage,” said the official, asking not to be named.According to a letter written by deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia to Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Monday, Delhi has total 21,138 Covid beds, of which 16,272 are normal beds and 4,866 are ICU beds. Not all, however, are hospital beds. This number includes beds in Covid Health Centres and Covid Care Centres.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/app-data-on-beds-ground-reality-at-odds-in-delhi-residents-101620167695467.html
05-05-2021||Delhi||High court asks centre to reply on plea seeking to strike down new NCT act||The Delhi high court on Tuesday asked for the Centre’s response on a PIL that sought to strike down the Government of National Capital Territory of Delhi (GNCTD) Amendment Act, which hands the state Lieutenant Governor greater power, that was passed in Parliament in March, and was notified last week.A bench of chief justice DN Patel and justice Jasmeet Singh issued notice to the Union ministries of law and home affairs, seeking their stand on the plea. Additional Solicitor General (ASG) Chetan Sharma and central government standing counsel Ajay Digpaul accepted the notice on behalf of the ministries.The plea, by law student Shrikant Prasad, claimed that the Act, “redefines Delhi government as the Lt Governor” and curbs the Delhi Assembly’s power to conduct proceedings.“Further, the Act provides that the opinion of the L-G must be obtained before taking any executive action on decisions of the Delhi government, on such matters as may be specified by the L-G,” the petition has claimed.Prasad contended that the provisions of the Act are in contrast with the Supreme Court’s July 2018 order on the powers of L-G and the Delhi government. The apex court said the L-G will be bound to follow the aid and advice of council of ministers except in matters of land, police and public order.Prasad argued that the Act was only going to increase the suffering of the citizens of Delhi, who are already grappling with the Covid-19 pandemic and related problems of shortage of oxygen, essential medicines and beds.The Delhi government did not respond to requests for comment||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/high-court-asks-centre-to-reply-on-plea-seeking-to-strike-down-new-nct-act-101620167340716.html
05-05-2021||Delhi||Mohalla clinics a waste if not used during pandemic: Delhi HC||The Delhi high court on Tuesday pulled up the Delhi government for not using its Mohalla Clinics to augment the facilities for Covid-19 patients, saying that “it’s a waste of resources” if they are not being used, even as the government submitted that the clinics cannot handle serious patients.A bench of justices Vipin Sanghi and Rekha Palli said it was the best time for the use of these Mohalla Clinics, while also asking the Delhi government to explore using government and municipal schools for adding more facilities for the citizens.“What is the use of your mohalla clinic?... It’s a waste of resources… If you made this infrastructure.. what worth is it if it can’t be used for any purpose during the pandemic?” the bench asked.The observations come after senior advocate Rahul Mehra, for the Delhi government, told the court that the Mohalla Clinics cannot be used as addition to the existing infrastructure as they are very small facilities and have one only one entry and exit point. He also said that the mohalla clinic cannot deal with the serious patients as it is meant for community service where private doctors come and see patients voluntarily for a couple of hours.Additional standing counsel Satyakam, for the Delhi government, added while testing is taking place in the Mohalla Clinics, vaccination cannot be done there as it may lead to crowding.Additional Solicitor General (ASG) Chetan Sharma for the Centre took a jibe at the Delhi government and said, “The situation has been like this for more than one year. The entry and exit should have been changed… You said that you have a world-class facility.” He also argued that in the last 10 months, the Delhi government had not bought a single ventilator.Mehra shot back, “I am happy that Centre is acknowledging that the Mohalla Clinics are good.” He also assured the court that they will speak with the civic bodies and explore the feasibility of using schools.The discussion took place on the suggestion by senior advocate Tushar G Rao, appearing for one of the petitioners, who said that the Delhi government can use its Mohalla Clinics.The court, during the hearing, also asked the India Council of Medical Research (ICMR) to create awareness among the public by releasing videos and graphics on Covid-19 symptoms, treatment, protocol, and equipments.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/mohalla-clinics-a-waste-if-not-used-during-pandemic-delhi-hc-101620166912692.html
05-05-2021||Delhi||Amid oxygen supply crisis in Delhi, smaller hospitals hit hardest||A children’s hospital in south Delhi’s Kalkaji sent out an SOS on Tuesday morning, saying it had only two hours of oxygen supply left with at least 10 children on oxygen support and six on ventilator.Triton Hospital is among several mid-size and smaller hospitals or nursing homes which continue to face a supply crisis, with Delhi receiving roughly half of its daily liquid medical oxygen demand. Need for medical oxygen in the city has shot up in the wake of hundreds of people rushing to hospitals with severe lung infection, requiring oxygen support as an unprecedented wave of Covid-19 infections sweeps through the city.Most of these hospitals or nursing homes depend on oxygen cylinders for their supply, requiring up to 100 cylinders that need to be refilled at 14 designated vendors every day.The Delhi government sent supplies to Triton after several people shared a written appeal by the hospital on Twitter. “Fret not! We’ve got this. Have assigned 3 D-type cylinders from our SOS reserves maintained at Rajghat Reserve Point, to Triton Hospital. We will also assist the hospital re-establish their oxygen supply chain,” tweeted senior AAP leader Raghav Chadha.The Capital on Monday received 433 MT medical oxygen – lower than Saturday’s 454MT, which was the highest for a single day yet – even though the Supreme Court asked the central government on Sunday to ensure Delhi receives 700MT. With the city receiving over 400MT for three days in a row, bigger hospitals received supply with some time to spare. The smaller ones, largely dependent on oxygen cylinders, continued to face the crisis and resorted to pooling cylinders.By Tuesday noon, Delhi received 307MT, which includes 205MT that arrived through oxygen express trains, said a government official, who did not wish to be identified. The full figures for Tuesday will be summarised after midnight, the official said. A senior railway official said another 244MT oxygen was scheduled to arrive in Delhi on oxygen trains in the early hours of Wednesday.“On May 3, we received 433 MT oxygen against a demand of 976MT oxygen – which is roughly 44% of the total demand. Over past one week, Delhi received around 393MT oxygen per day on an average – which is around 40% of the total demand. This oxygen deficit is leading to distress situation in hospitals across the city. We have put in place an effective management system to deal with distress calls from hospitals. We have created SOS reserves,” said Raghav Chadha, who is in charge of the oxygen SOS management system in Delhi.He further said, “Yesterday (May 3), we received 41 SOS calls from hospitals. These hospitals collectively have 7,142 oxygen beds. It gives a sense of the scale of risk we are dealing with. All 41 calls were resolved. We sent total 21.3MT oxygen in response to the distress calls from the hospitals – which include Irene, Kukreja, Triton and Rainbow hospitals. In one case, an oxygen truck heading for one hospital – which still had some oxygen left in its reserves -- was diverted towards another that suddenly reported a worse crisis.”Among the hospitals that sent out calls for help was Indian Spinal Injury Centre. Early Tuesday morning the hospital said its stock will last only 30 minutes. “We got the supply in the nick of the time. We are always in a crisis like situation – our requirement is around 4.8MT, the government allocated us 3.9MT, and we have been getting around 1.83MT. And, in the last 10 days the number of sick patients has gone up, they need a lot of oxygen to maintain saturation,” said Jasleen Kaur, general manager marketing, Indian Spinal Injury Centre. She said that the government has been helping with the liquid oxygen supply but getting their hands on cylinders has been a challenge. The hospital need cylinders for the additional beds that do not have facility for oxygen pipeline as it is mainly an orthopaedic hospital.Govt sets up helplineThe Delhi government said on Tuesday that it has set up a new 24x7 emergency helpline and a call centre to attend distress calls from hospitals regarding oxygen shortage, even as it estimated that the supply was likely to increase over the next two days.In a statement, the government said that the new helpline is expected to bolster the current strategy of oxygen allocation among hospitals on a day-to-day basis aimed at “optimal utilisation of the given oxygen”.The statement further said that the government has deployed officials across several oxygen plants in other states to ensure hassle-free supplies.“The Delhi government has appointed three IAS officers and more than 20 call centre executives to ensure smooth functioning of Oxygen supply and distribution,” the statement read.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/amid-oxygen-supply-crisis-in-delhi-smaller-hospitals-hit-hardest-101620166049474.html

This tree, here in Green Park, must be an exception.It is that giddy time when summer begins and Delhi avenues lit up with the blooming of the amaltas. But in this year of pestilence, when people we personally know are dying due to the coronavirus infection, the blossoming might not bring that same happiness. This evening, nobody stands under the tree. Nobody is to be seen on the road either, except for a masked guard outside a bungalow.Indeed, this year, one can’t go out to view the amaltas in bloom. The grief-stricken Capital is in curfew. You will miss the show at central Delhi’s Hailey Road, where the sleepy stretch of tarmac will soon be lined on both sides with dense bunches of amaltas flowers. You will not be able to experience what you had taken for granted in any other summer — all day long, flowers falling down on the pavement like a continuous snowfall, making the dusty ground look as if it covered by a golden mat.Nor will you be able to see the splendour of the alamtas at Amrita Shergill Marg. There, the blooming trees appear like a painting by an artist who has lost all her sense of proportion, and has gone overboard with golden-yellow smudges.Nor will you be able to make that noon-time trip to Second Avenue, the path that links Lodhi Road to Jor Bagh Road. There, just beyond Bharat Taxi Stand, a row of amaltas trees is splayed out into a dramatic sight. You feel as if you’ve entered a tropical forest of florescent yellow. In a week or so, the snaky branches will transform into impenetrable thickets of yellow that will spar with the unforgivingly hot sky.Gone this year, too, the pleasure of walking down Bungalow Road, in north Delhi. Its great treasure of amaltas flowers is swept away every morning by the municipal staff.And forget, too, about enjoying the amaltas at night, when its yellow colour becomes entangled with the gold of the street lamps, the branches twinkling like baby chandeliers.Meanwhile, here under this Green Park amaltas, a flower is falling dead every other moment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhiwale-amaltas-in-a-season-of-loss-101620163158001.html
05-05-2021||Delhi||HC ultimatum on Delhi O2 crisis: ‘Lives at stake’||The Delhi high court on Tuesday put the Union government on notice for contempt of court after taking a strong view of the continuing oxygen crisis in the Capital, which was seeking at least 700 metric tonne (MT) in a day but has been making do with far lower quantities that, coupled with the Delhi government’s inability to transport oxygen, has pushed hospitals to the brink of a catastrophe.The city was set to receive at least 550 MT of supplies by the end of Wednesday, including two deliveries through “oxygen express” trains – one of these arrived in the morning with 205 MT and another was expected with 244 MT later in the day.But these quantities were still lower than the 700 MT projected demand, which the Supreme Court said must be met when it issued final orders on Sunday.On Wednesday, the high court pulled up the Union government for the continuing deficit. “We are not going to take no for an answer. There is no way that you won’t supply 700 right away. We won’t hear anything except compliance,” the judges, justices Vipin Sanghi and Rekha Palli, told the Centre’s lawyer, additional solicitor general Chetan Sharma.In its order, the bench issued a show-cause notice for why contempt proceedings shouldn’t be initiated against the Union government and sought the presence of Piyush Goyal, additional secretary, ministry of home affairs, and Sumita Dawra, additional secretary, to be present during the next hearing on Wednesday. “Enough is enough. We mean business and give it by whatever means. ….We had said that contempt action against the officers will be the last thing on our mind. But that does not mean we cannot do it. That option still remains. Your officers will face the notice. We are not going to take this.”The most amount of medical oxygen Delhi has received in a day was on Saturday after the high court first warned of contempt proceedings. From 454 MT that day, the number marginally dipped over the next two days, leaving smaller hospitals that rely on more ad-hoc arrangements struggling for supplies.“On May 3 we received 433 MT oxygen against a demand of 976 MT oxygen – which is roughly 44% of the total demand. Over the past one week, Delhi received around 393 MT oxygen per day on an average – which is around 40% of the total demand. This oxygen deficit is leading to distress situation in hospitals across the city. We have put in place an effective management system to deal with distress calls from hospitals,” said Delhi MLA Raghav Chadha, who is currently in charge of the oxygen SOS management system in Delhi. A Delhi government statement later said it expects supplies to improve. “Today the oxygen supply should touch 450 MT and by tomorrow or the day after tomorrow, the supply should be in the range of 500 MT... The Delhi government is working on strengthening supply chain management of oxygen,” said the statement.Hospitals have said that they are running at reduced bed strength in order to ration whatever oxygen they get among their existing patients, and most still face a tense wait for replenishments that often with only hours or minutes to spare.“We got the supply in the nick of time. We are always in a crisis like situation – our requirement is around 4.8MT, the government allocated us 3.9MT, and we have been getting around 1.83MT,” said Indian Spinal Injuries Centre’s general manager of marketing, Jasleen Kaur.At the court, the Union government and the Delhi government continued to spar over the crisis – with the ASG disputing the specifics of what the Supreme Court ordered.During one particular exchange, senior advocate Rahul Merha, who represented Delhi, said: “590 is what you have to deliver. With 420, citizens are dying”. To this, the ASG replied: “Let’s not get into rhetoric.”This particular exchange drew in a sharp remark from the judges. “This is not rhetoric. Is it not a fact? Sorry Mr Sharma. You may be blind, we are not. How can you be so insensitive? There are lives at stake,” the judges said. “…the Centre will quibble on these little things and let the people die by not supplying the oxygen. Mr Mehra is not saying this, we are telling you this. Are you living in ivory towers? You can put your head in the sand like an ostrich, we will not,” the judges added. “We are facing the grim reality everyday of people not able to secure oxygen beds, even ICU beds. Situation has come to this that hospitals have had to reduce beds offered by them because they are not able to service due to shortage of oxygen,” the bench said.The ASG disputed the 700 MT figure as what has been ordered by the SC, but the high court did not accept the contention. “We reject the submission that the Delhi government is not entitled to receive 700 MT per day in light of the present medical infrastructure... Even 590 MTs per day has not been delivered for a single day,” said the judges, while going on to point to specific parts of the order.In hearings that took place last week, the HC also pulled up the Delhi government for not preparing for the crisis by arranging for adequate number of cryogenic tankers, which emerged as one of the bottlenecks in expediting supplies.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/hc-ultimatum-on-delhi-o2-crisis-lives-at-stake-101620161591888.html
05-05-2021||Chandigarh||6th Punjab pay panel recommendations: 20% salary hike on cards for govt staffers||The 6th Punjab Pay Commission has recommended a two-fold increase in salaries of all employees over the previous pay panel, with increase in minimum pay from ₹6,950 to ₹18,000 per month, with retrospective effect from January 1, 2016. The pay panel headed by retired chief secretary Jai Singh Gill, which submitted its report to chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh on Friday, has suggested substantial hikes in salary and other major benefits, and also substantial increase in allowances for government employees. The average increment in salaries and pensions of employees is expected to be in the range of 20%, with salaries in for a 2.59 times increase after merger of dearness allowance (DA) over the 5th pay commission recommendations, according to a spokesperson of the chief minister’s office (CMO). The commission has also recommended abolition of all types of special pay and any add-ons in the basic pay by any nomenclature, besides rationalisation of the cabinet sub-committee in 2011 when pay scales were revised upwards following protests against the recommendations of the 5th pay panel. Finance dept to study report within two weeks The report, which was submitted to Punjab chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh on Friday, has been sent to the finance department for detailed study and directions for placing it before the cabinet this month for further action. A senior official said the commission has tried to align basic pay structures with those in the central government. “There is a substantial increase at the initial level. The new scales will be implemented from July 1 as already announced and payment of arrears will have to be phased out,” he said, pegging the expected overall financial implications, including the arrears for the previous five years, at ₹35,000 crore. Though finance minister Manpreet Singh Badal after presenting his budget for financial year 2021-22 had stated that he factored in ₹9,000 crore for the pay and pension hike, there are serious questions about the ability to state to raise resources for bearing such a huge financial implication, particularly amid the Covid-19 pandemic. The state, which has struggling to increase its revenue receipts and been reluctant to take measures for additional resource mobilization, does not have the financial wiggle room. The report has come at a time when the state’s economy is already deeply stressed and the financial situation is precarious with the Covid-19 pandemic hitting the tax and non-tax revenues of the state. The finance department will examine the various implications before submitting the report to the cabinet for further action. The Sixth Punjab Pay Commission, which was constituted by the previous SAD-BJP government on February 3, 2016, and reconstituted by the present administration a year later, took more than five years to submit its recommendations. Gill said the commission has submitted only the part one of its report. “We will now look at promotion schemes, health insurance and representations received from employees’ unions, various categories of employees and even individuals as per the terms of reference set by the state government,” he said, refusing to discuss the recommendations made in the report. Sanjha Mulazam Morcha convener Sukhchain Singh Khehra, who has been leading a protest for the past two years against the delay in pay revision, said they would not comment without studying the report. Fate of 2011 pay revision uncertain “The official statement talks about rationalisation of 2011 revision in pay scales. If they have based the new scales on those implemented from 2006, then many employees won’t gain much. In case the recommended scales are based on revision done in 2011, there will be complications relating to employees whose salaries were not increased at that time and they would seek parity,” he said. The CMO spokesperson said that a significant hike has been recommended in the report in pensions and dearness allowance, while fixed medical allowance and death-cum-retirement gratuity are recommended to be doubled under the scheme suggested by the pay panel. While fixed medical allowance has been recommended to be doubled to ₹1,000/- per month for employees as well as pensioners uniformly, the maximum limit of death-cum-retirement gratuity is proposed to be enhanced from ₹10 lakh to ₹20 lakh. Enhancement in ex-gratia grant rates in the case of death of government employee, as also in case of death in harness directly attributable to the duty performed, is another key recommendation aimed at benefitting government employees. The commission has also suggested doubling of design allowance to engineering staff and kit maintenance allowance to police personnel, with mobile allowance enhancement varying from ₹375 to ₹750. Burden of ₹3,500 crore per annum While implementation of the recommendations relating to pay and pension has been recommended from January 1, 2016, those relating to allowances are recommended from the date of notification by the government. The commission’s recommendations is likely to lead to an additional expenditure of ₹3,500 crore per annum with effect from January 1, 2016, said an official spokesperson. Another recommendation is that the present system of DA on central pattern should continue and dearness allowance be converted into dearness pay each time the index increases by 50%, to be counted for all purposes including retirement benefits. For pensions, the revision suggested by the commission is by the application of a simple factor of 2.59. Further, pension should continue to be paid at the rate of 50% of the last pay drawn, on completion of 25 years of qualifying service, as per the pay panel’s recommendations. Besides recommending a simple, transparent and easy to implement pay matrix for all Punjab government employees, the commission has suggested that old age allowance for pensioners and family pensioners, at the existing intervals of five years from the age of 65 years onwards, should continue on revised pension. It has also recommended commutation of pension to be restored to 40%. Though the existing classification of the categories of cities for HRA is proposed to be retained, with rationalisation in house rent allowance (by a factor of 0.8 of the existing rates and calculated as a percentage of basic pay, the commission has also recommended introduction of several new allowance categories, including higher education allowance in the form of lump sum rate for all employees acquiring higher qualification. Besides Gill, the commission had DS Kalha as member and SS Rajput as member secretary.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/6th-punjab-pay-panel-recommendations-20-salary-hike-on-cards-for-govt-staffers-101620158839520.html

The move comes after an audio of the alleged incident surfaced on social media on April 29.In the audio clip, the DC’s reader, Narinder Singh Cheema, was purportedly heard threatening and pressuring assistant sub-inspector (ASI) Kulwinder Singh to let some men join investigations in a criminal case lodged them. Cheema is further heard saying that a contempt petition will be filed against the ASI if he doesn’t allow the men to join investigations. To this, the ASI is purportedly heard saying that he was busy as there had been a death in his family, and that he would allow the accused to join investigations soon. Cheema is also heard accusing the cop of registering a case without proper probe. When contacted, Cheema said the men named in the case had been granted bail on the condition that they join probe within a week (April 27). The cop, Cheema said, was deliberately delaying the matter, so he called him.In the letter to the DC, the SSP recommended action against Cheema for allegedly misusing his official position. The SSP had earlier sought a report from Kapurthala deputy superintendent of police Surinderpal Singh on the matter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/kapurthala-ssp-recommends-departmental-probe-against-dc-s-reader-101620158659961.html
05-05-2021||Chandigarh||Mandis start winding up wheat procurement ops||Punjab’s food and civil supplies department and the mandi board on Tuesday began the process to wind up the wheat procurement for this season. As per a notice issued by the board, all mandis in six districts — Ludhiana, Sangrur, Patiala, Fatehgarh Sahib, Ropar and Mohali — will not function from Wednesday, while procurement across the state will come to a complete stop on May 10. So far, 121 lakh tonne wheat has arrived of which 120 lakh tonne has been procured and ₹19,007 crore disbursed among at least 7-lakh farmers. The arrivals are expected to touch 130 lakh tonne against previous season’s (2020) 127 lakh tonne and total disbursals are likely to cross ₹21,000 crore. The state department has already shut temporary mandis set up to spread out the procurement due to coronavirus. Mandis in Moga and Tarn Taran will not accept wheat after May 5, Bathinda after May 6 and Barnala, Mansa, Faridkot, Muktsar, Ferozepur, Nawanshahr, and Jalandhar after May 7 and Kapurthala after May 8. As against the previous season when the wheat procurement lasted for 40-45 days, this time the process took only 35 days as it started after 10 days’ delay on April 10. Due to late harvesting in Amritsar, Hoshiarpur, Fazilka, Gurdaspur and Pathankot districts, the procurement is expected to continue till May 10. Also, the procurement this time was different from all the previous seasons as the Centre asked state procurement agencies to pay farmers through the direct benefit transfer scheme. Though, initially there was opposition from arhtiyas who earlier used to transfer the money into farmers’ accounts, the state government was able to pacify them by offering them a window in the public finance management system (PFMS) to monitor payments made to the farmers. “It was a tough season, as the new payment system was introduced at the last moment and it took us at least a week to streamline it,” said food and civil supplies minister Bharat Bhushan Ashu, adding that earlier the agencies would deal with 30,000 active arhtiyas but this time they had to directly deal with 10-lakh farmers. LIFTING CONTUNUES TO BE SLOW As against arrival of 121 lakh tonne, only 84 lakh tonne wheat has been lifted so far. The officials of food department attribute the slow lifting of grain to shortage of labour and gunny bags. gfxWheat sheetTotal arrival 121 lakh tonneExpected arrival 130 lakh tonneProcured 120 lakh tonneLifted 84 lakh tonne||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/mandis-start-winding-up-wheat-procurement-ops-101620158362474.html

05-05-2021||Chandigarh||Vaccination drive reaches a trickle for want of vials||Punjab on Tuesday could inoculate only 15,953 people, which is the lowest count for a day this month, and the vaccination drive is likely to slow down further with Centre asking the states to keep at least 70% of free vaccine doses reserved for the second jab. Principal secretary, health and family welfare, Hussan Lal, said the state will get 15-lakh doses from the Centre for the 45-plus category in the first fortnight of this month out of which 70% vials need to be kept for those expecting a second jab. The state received 2 lakh doses of Covishield from the Centre on Tuesday afternoon. In a tweet on Tuesday morning, chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh urged the Union health minister to urgently review and enhance Punjab’s allocation taking into account the high incidence of Covid infections. “Our vaccine stocks stand depleted at less than 50,000. Centre’s allocation for May 1-15 is only 6-lakh doses i.e. 40,000 a day,” said Amarinder. Health director Dr GB Singh said state’s demand for the second dose will increase in the next few days and it was very important to vaccinate those who have already got the first shot. Punjab is also likely to get in the third week of May the first instalment of over 3-lakh doses of Covishield from its booking of 30-lakh meant for the 18-plus category. “If our allocation for 45-plus category is not increased, we will have very limited stock left for the first dose. Punjab has 2,610 sites for vaccination,” said the health director. The state has also not booked Covaxine for its 18-plus category despite data showing the vaccine having more efficacy than the Covishield. The decision on not booking Covaxine was taken on the recommendations of state’s experts group on Covid-19 and vaccination, an official said. “Covishield is equally effective. Moreover Covishield is cheaper and its availability is going to increase in the coming days,” said head of Punjab’s experts group and former PGIMER director Dr KK Talwar. Only 1,200 doses left in Amritsar The vaccination drive in Amritsar was badly hit as 22% of centres earmarked for the jabs remained shut on Tuesday. The district is left with only 1,200 Covishield doses and the health department officials say the stock is insufficient to run the drive even for one more day. As per the health department, only 2,907 people could be inoculated in Amritsar district on Tuesday. While many health centres couldn’t operate due to vaccine shortage, some community health centres remained non-operational after the community health officers went on a day’s strike over their long-pending demand of regular job. Till now, the district health department has administered 2,42,196 doses in Amritsar, including healthcare workers, frontline warriors and people above the age of 45. Of these, 55,212 have already taken their second jab. Drive only at 2 of 150 centres in Sangrur The Sangrur district has not received vaccine stock for the past four days, the vaccination drive is being run at only two sites in the district, senior health officials said on Tuesday. Sangrur assistant civil surgeon Dr Jagmohan Singh said stock of vaccines was collected from across the district and frontline workers were being inoculated at Sangrur and Malerkotla centres. “We are administering the second jab. The vaccination drive is going on only at two centres against 150-plus sites earlier,” he added. Many camps suspended in Bathinda, other districts Several vaccination camps were suspended in Bathinda and its adjoining districts on Tuesday for want of vaccine. People in large numbers had gathered at Bathinda Civil Hospital but the authorities did not have sufficient vaccine doses to cater to them all. Civil surgeon Dr TS Dhillon said against an average daily requirement of 2,300-2,500 doses, the district had only 1,700 vials. “Several camps were suspended today. Our team has gone to Chandigarh to get fresh stock of vaccine. Further vaccination programme will be decided tomorrow on the basis of availability,” he said. Mansa district had just 300 Covishield vials and the drive slowed down on Tuesday. Against the daily requirement of 1,000 doses, Muktsar had 1,250 vials, said civil surgeon Dr Ranju Singla.

The gangster had claimed that he had nothing to do with the case as he had been behind bars since 2015. Bishnoi further alleged that the police of Punjab, Haryana and Chandigarh are all out to eliminate him and had been implicating him in false cases. The HC had ordered that he be brought to Chandigarh from Rajasthan and then be handed over to the Haryana police, but that order had been stayed by Supreme Court on February 2, Bishnoi had told court, adding that the fresh order from the trial court would amount to violation of the apex court’s directions.

The draft proposal, which was sent to the ministry by the Maharashtra government in March, was gazetted on April 30. The ministry has given a 60-day window to receive public comments on the notification.The move will increase the area earmarked for protection by the forest department, which had initially proposed to include just 34.06 sq km within ESZ. The state government had, in March, written to the Centre proposing to include an additional 14 sq km of land within ESZ.An ESZ is a buffer area created around a wildlife sanctuary or national park to reduce developmental pressures. The proposal has also increased the maximum width of the originally proposed buffer area to a maximum of 3.98km, as compared to 3.5km earlier. At its southern-most point near Vashi bridge, the width of ESZ is 0km, while at its northernmost point at Thane-Kalwa bridge, the width is 2km.Spread across 1,690.5 hectares (ha) across Mulund, Vikhroli, Bhandup, Kanjur and parts of Mandale village, TCFS is home to 12 true mangrove species, 39 mangrove associates, 167 species of birds including flamingos, 45 fish species, 59 species of butterflies, 67 insect species, among other mammals such as jackals. In May 2018, the state had declared it a flamingo sanctuary.“There is increase of about 14 sq km from the earlier notified ESZ of 34 sq km. Mangroves of Navi Mumbai area have been included in the current notification. It will go a long way in conservation of mangroves in Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR) region,” said Virendra Tiwari, additional principal chief conservator of forests (mangrove cell).About 1,400ha of mangrove forests towards the Navi Mumbai side of ESZ were not originally covered in the ambit of the original ESZ delineation because they were already declared as reserve forests under the Indian Forest Act, forest department officials said. They are also covered under CRZ (coastal regulation zone). However, last February, the ministry recommended their inclusion in ESZ.Environmentalists, however, remained skeptical of the development. “The solution here is to declare TCFS as a wildlife sanctuary under the Wildlife Act. An ESZ notification won’t offer much protection as seen in case of Sanjay Gandhi National Park, where developmental activities are undertaken inches away from the boundary of the protected area,” said D Stalin, director, non-governmental organization (NGO) Vanashakti.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/centre-notifies-revised-eco-zone-around-thane-flamingo-sanctuary-101620158239835.html
05-05-2021||Chandigarh||Capt seeks PM help in replenishing state’s dwindling oxygen quota||Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh on Tuesday sought the immediate intervention of both, the Prime Minister and the Union home minister, to ensure uninterrupted supply of medical oxygen to the state, along with an additional allocation of 50MT liquid medical oxygen (LMO) from a nearby source. The CM sent separate letters to them, as the number of Covid patients on varying levels of oxygen support in the state went up to 10,000. With mounting caseload, the state was unable to increase beds for patients with moderate and severe symptoms due to oxygen availability constraints, he said, expressing concern over the “imminent loss” of lives. He said the central government had expressed its inability to even allow the local industry to undertake commercial import of LMO from Pakistan through the Wagah-Attari border. “Despite assurance about adequate supply from alternate sources, I regret to point out that this has not happened,” he said. Amarinder said the total allocation of LMO from outside the state was currently 195 MT but the state was not getting its daily allocated quota. The existing backlog from these facilities is 5.6 MT from Panipat, 100 MT from Dehradun and 10 MT from Roorkee. Pointing out that Punjab was given to understand by the Centre that there would be likely disruption of LMO supply Tuesday onwards from Panipat and Barotiwala, the CM said this would cause great stress on the limited oxygen availability in the state. The disruption should be avoided, he said, adding that, if necessary, the state must be compensated immediately from a nearby additional source. He further said the state was airlifting two empty tankers daily to Ranchi, with the filled tankers returning by road from Bokaro on a 50-hour journey. The state had requested for 20 additional tankers (conducive to rail travel) to bring LMO from Bokaro, but was told that only two would be provided, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/capt-seeks-pm-help-in-replenishing-state-s-dwindling-oxygen-quota-101620158059317.html

As of now, we have roped in these firms for the financial year 2021-22 for an annual charge of ₹49 lakh. In case these firms find any irregularities during audit, they will have to bring it to the notice of the SGPC headquarters. Every firm will have to submit its report by the 10th of each month,” said SGPC chief Bibi Jagir Kaur on Tuesday. She added, “Every firm will work under the rules promulgated by the SGPC. In addition to the audit, the staff of educational institutions and gurdwaras will also be given training on computerisation of records.” An Akal-Takht-appointed panel that probed into the misappropriation of 328 saroops of Guru Granth Sahib had pointed out that timely computerisation of the accounts by the private firm hired for the purpose could have averted the incident.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/24-firms-hired-for-audit-of-sgpc-s-religious-educational-institutions-101620157939304.html

With financial constraints, the fare hike will add to their woes, they said.“Fuel prices in the city were constant for some time. We were happy as a maximum number of people are travelling on their own vehicles to avoid contracting or spreading coronavirus. But the fuel prices in the city surged a day after the election results in other states.

For us, Covent Garden is a village, it’s a community. I just refuse to have the kitchens closed. It doesn’t make sense. It gives you hope.”When the lockdown started, Maan said he soon decided to use his kitchens for helping the communities in need. The restaurant, which specialises in North Indian cuisine, was founded by his great-grandfather Gurbachan Singh Maan and celebrated its 75th birthday this year.Talking about people who joined the cause as volunteers, Maan said: “There are people out there who are compassionate and courageous. I am dumbstruck by the incredible humanity and care of the volunteers.”He added, “You could sit at home and just shut the curtains and watch TV but I knew I was sitting on a blessed asset our kitchens are industrial kitchens. We have been helping the homeless for three or four years.”He even moved out of his family home to stay at the restaurant to keep his elderly parents safe during the first lockdown. Seven of the 40 staff stayed at the premises to help with the food aid. The team started making wraps for volunteers working with the charity “Under One Sky” to give to homeless people in London.“We were really blessed with the volunteers, they are an army of angels. With lockdown, there was nobody about and so some people were very hungry,” Maan said. Some of those people hadn’t eaten for days. They helped make 100,000 meals, while Maan started helping food banks and they’ve done about 50,000 meals for them. His team delivered urgent supplies to the food banks using their links with suppliers. Maan joined forces with other volunteers feeding the homeless and other needy communities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/punjaborigin-restaurateur-helped-feed-needy-londoners-during-lockdown-101620157640305.html

Two hospitals in Shimla — Indira Gandhi Medical College (IGMC) and Deen Dayal Upadhyay Hospital (DDU) — are full to capacity. At Deen Dayal Upadhyay, there are 127 patients against its 90-bed capacity. “Right now, we have adequate stock of oxygen,” said medical superintendent Dr Ravinder Mokhta. Patients in critical care from Rohru, Chopal, Theog, and Rampur are also referred to DDU. “We are trying to accommodate every patient requiring treatment,” said IGMC senior medical superintendent Dr Janakraj Pakhretia. “More beds are being added to the new OPD block. We have also taken over the wards in medicine department,” he added. As per the data, the state has a total capacity of 1,967 beds in DCHCs of which, 1,397 were occupied as of May 4. Himachal has 28 DCHCs and dedicated Covid hospitals of which, IGMC, Shimla; Dr Rajendra Prasad Government Medical College (RPGMC), Tanda; and Lal Bahadur Shastri Government Medical College in Mandi are tertiary centres. Among the patients admitted in the centres, 1,183 are on oxygen support and 43 on ventilator support. Meanwhile, the situation in the dedicated Covid care centres across the 12 districts is slightly better. Of the total 1,387 beds in these centres, only 286 (20%) are currently occupied. A government spokesperson said more than 90% of the people infected with Covid were in home isolation in the state and there was no need to panic as enough beds and oxygen were available. Rakesh Kumar Prajapati, deputy commissioner of Kangra, which is the worst-hit district, said the situation was bit grim there with 95% beds in Covid facilities occupied. “All 40 ICU beds at RPGMC, Tanda, are occupied and we are trying to add 25 more beds. Also, another 25-bed facility has been created at Rajiv Gandhi Government Ayurvedic College, Paprola,” he added. Twenty-five beds will be added to the facility every day, he said, adding that 40 beds will also be set up at Fortis Hospital on April 7.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/71-beds-in-himachal-pradesh-hospitals-occupied-shows-data-101620157639266.html
05-05-2021||Chandigarh||Hate-fuelled black assailant hits Sikh man with hammer in US||A Sikh man was attacked with a hammer by a black assailant who shouted at him “I don’t like you” and “You’re not the same skin” at a hotel in Brooklyn here, prompting a prominent New-York based advocacy group to call on investigators to examine if the assault was a hate crime incident. Sumit Ahluwalia, 32, of Astoria has said his assailant was fuelled by racial hatred, according to a report on New York Daily News website. Ahluwalia said the man, a black, assaulted him on April 26 at his workplace, the Quality Inn in Brownsville. He said the man came into the lobby of the hotel at around 8am and started shouting while the front desk lady asked him if he needed help. Ahluwalia stepped into the lobby to speak with the man and to seek the hotel security guard. At that point, the assailant “started running towards me, very fast, and he put his hand in the pocket — I thought, ‘He’s pulling out a gun’’’, the report said. Pleading with the man, the victim said, “What happened? You’re my brother.” The attacker responded “You’re not the same skin,” Ahluwalia said, adding that the man then “banged on my head with the hammer so hard.” The assailant then screamed, “I don’t like you,” and ran away, according to the report. It said the victim “couldn’t feel what happened with me” and was eventually taken to an emergency room. “I couldn’t sleep. I had a big bump on my head. I could fall — feeling dizziness, and the next morning I went to the doctor,” he said, adding that five days later, he was still feeling anxious and fearful. “I didn’t do anything… I don’t deserve this. I’m a hardworking guy, wake up in the morning 6 a.m. and go home at 7 pm,” he said. Police have released pictures of the suspect, who was still being sought. Advocacy group The Sikh Coalition said its legal team is providing free legal services to Ahluwalia. “We have already been in direct communication with law enforcement and demanded that investigators examine the real possibility that bias was a motive,” it said, adding that anyone with information about the incident should contact the New York Police Department. The incident comes as the US has witnessed a recent wave of anti-Asian hate crimes during this pandemic. Eight people, including four Sikhs, were killed in a mass shooting at a FedEx facility in Indianapolis last month.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/hatefuelled-black-assailant-hits-sikh-man-with-hammer-in-us-101620157399401.html
05-05-2021||Chandigarh||More Covid fatalities in Majha’s urban belt||Amid the second Covid, the Majha region—comprising four districts Amritsar, Tarn Taran, Gurdaspur and Pathankot—has been witnessing more fatalities in urban areas, according to the health department data from April 30 to May 3.Experts attribute it to congested areas and overcrowded markets in the cities. They also term less testing in rural areas as compared to the urban pockets as another reason behind the gap.Out of 53 deaths reported from April 30 to May 3 in Amritsar district, 47 were from urban areas, mostly Amritsar city. Amritsar, which is the largest and most populous city of the region, has so far reported 998 deaths, which is the highest among other districts of the region. 54% population of the district lives in the urban areas.Amritsar assistant civil surgeon Dr Amarjit Singh said: “Due to congested areas and markets, mostly in Amritsar city, the positivity and death rate is higher in the urban pockets. There are small houses where large families reside. In many such cases all family members are being tested positive.”Another reason, he said, is that the population in the rural areas show reluctance to get themselves tested. “We have launched a campaign to make the people of the rural areas aware, especially the elderly, to go for a test if they are symptomatic. People above 40 in the rural areas should get themselves tested instead of taking medicines from quacks,” he said. In Gurdaspur, 10 deaths have been reported from April 30 to May 3 of which six are from villages. Of the 13 deaths during the period in Tarn Taran district, six are from urban areas. This despite the fact that 87% population of the district is from the rural area.In Pathankot, 19 deaths were reported in the past four days and most are from urban areas. The district has 53% rural population.Tarn Taran senior medical officer Dr Swaranjit Dhawan said: “Most of the people from the rural areas are not showing their willingness to get tested for Covid. We believe that deaths in the villages are underreported as many of them prefer to get themselves treated from quacks.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/more-covid-fatalities-in-majha-s-urban-belt-101620157219299.html
05-05-2021||Other||Have issued fresh orders for probe against Param Bir Singh: Maharashtra govt to HC||Fresh orders have been issued for conducting two preliminary inquiries against former Mumbai Police commissioner Param Bir Singh, the Maharashtra government informed the Bombay high court (HC) on Tuesday. The development comes about a week after Maharashtra director general of police (DGP) Sanjay Pandey recused himself from conducting the probe.Representing the state, senior advocate Darius Khambata informed the division bench of SS Shinde and justice Manish Pitale that the government issued the new orders on Tuesday morning. Khambata was responding to a petition filed by Singh – who presently holds the post of commandant general at Maharashtra home guards – challenging the April 1 and April 20 orders of the state government that directed Pandey to inquire whether the former Mumbai Police chief had violated provisions of the All-India Service (Conduct) Rules, 1968, as well as into the allegations made by police inspector Anup Dange that the senior IPS (Indian Police Service) officer’s brother had demanded ₹2 crore for getting him reinstated after he was suspended on disciplinary grounds.Khambata submitted that the petition had become infructuous as the Singh had challenged the decisions to entrust the inquiries to Pandey, but the DGP has recused himself from the probe and now fresh orders have been passed for the inquiries.The senior advocate added that the petition filed by the senior IPS officer was also not maintainable for it essentially involves service-related issues and Singh should have moved the Central Administrative Tribunal (CAT) for challenging the inquiries, and not the HC.Senior advocate Navroz Seervai, who represented Pandey, endorsed Khambata’s submission that the petition before HC was not maintainable. He added that the petition has made totally false allegations against the DGP.In his petition, Singh claimed that Pandey had advised him to withdraw the March 20 letter, levelling corruption and extortion charges against the then home minister Anil Deshmukh and in return offered to close the inquiries against him.Singh’s counsel, advocate Sunny Punmiya, however, urged the court to adjourn the hearing on the petition till Thursday on the grounds that senior advocates Mukul Rohatgi and Abad Ponda, who lead him in the matter, were not available today.Though the judges found substance in the objections raised by Khambata and Seervai and opined that the issues involved in the petition could be adjudicated by CAT, they decided to adjourn the hearing. They, however, refused to take it up on Thursday, and posted Singh’s petition for further hearing on June 9, observing that there was no urgency in view of the statement made by Khambata.On March 20, three days after he was shunted out from the post of Mumbai Police commissioner, Singh had written a letter to the Governor, the chief minister and others, alleging that Deshmukh had summoned assistant inspector Sachin Vaze, assistant commissioner of police (ACP) Sanjay Patil and deputy commissioner of police (DCP) Raju Bhujbal to his house and told them to collect ₹100 crore every month from establishments in Mumbai.Acting on a bunch of petitions, including the one filed by Singh and another by activist Jaishri Patil, HC on April 5 had directed the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) to conduct preliminary inquiry into the allegations. The CBI director was ordered to decide on further course of action on the outcome of the inquiry. Accordingly, after the preliminary inquiry, CBI on April 21, registered an offence against Deshmukh and also conducted raids at his residences.3-member panel to conduct inquiries The state government has formed a three-member committee, headed by senior Indian Administrative Services (IAS) officer Debashish Chakrobarthy, to conduct the preliminary inquiries against Singh, home department sources said. A senior IPS officer from the state police and an expert on legal matters, are likely to be the other two members of the committee. A 1986-batch IAS officer, Chakrobarthy is additional chief secretary (planning). He is known to be an upright officer. Chakrobarthy will inquire whether there was any dereliction of duty on Singh’s part in not apprising the government about the Antilia explosives scare. He will also probe the corruption allegations made by Dange.

05-05-2021||Chandigarh||In south Punjab, 60% Covid cases being reported from villages||In the last two weeks, more coronavirus infection and mortality cases are being reported from villages of southern Punjab districts.The trend has sent the health authorities in a tizzy as the rural segment from south Malwa, particularly Mansa and Bathinda districts, have a strong representation in the ongoing farmer agitation on Delhi borders. Health authorities say around 60% of cases are being reported from villages as there has been a poor response from villagers to the vaccination drive.On Tuesday, Bathinda reported 20 Covid deaths, the highest in a day since the pandemic outbreak last year. Also, the district recorded the highest number of new cases at 806, taking the active cases to 5,376.In-charge of Covid mortality cases in Bathinda Dr Sukhjinder Singh Gill said 11 of the 20 dead were from villages and nine from the city.Doctors say patients coming from villages are found to be suffering from lifestyle comorbidities, including obesity and diabetes, that deteriorates their condition when contracted with coronavirus.“For the last few days, Bathinda district has a daily average of 600 patients and more than half of them are from the rural segments. A majority of village patients contact health department after their medical condition deteriorates,” said district Covid officer Dr Ramandeep Singla.Villages are visiting hospital when they are at the advanced stage of level-2 treatment, or say when they need ventilator support. “This trend is a cause of concern as Bathinda villagers have a frequent movement to and from Delhi borders due to farmers’ agitation,” said Singla.Mansa civil surgeon Dr Sukhwinder Singh said the rural population has been opposing vaccination and even testing. “Medical teams visiting villages for vaccination camps, awareness campaigns or sample collection often face resistance from villagers. We had to take police protection on various occasions. Villagers are not ready to take life-saving jabs and it is contributing a sharp surge in Covid cases from rural areas of the district,” he added.In the last two days, Mansa reported news 381 cases out of which 217 were from the rural belt.Health officials in the region say villagers having Covid symptoms are taking self-medication or medicines prescribed by local medical practitioners.Muktsar chief medical officer Dr Ranju Singla said timely testing can lead to timely treatment. “Villagers have started rushing to hospitals. But in most cases, they come at the later stage when the infection has severely impacted their health,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/in-south-punjab-60-covid-cases-being-reported-from-villages-101620157099365.html

After lifting restrictions, authorities have setup micro-containment zones in Mohalla 5,8 12 in Dugri Phase- 1 and Blocks E, F and G in Dugri Phase- 2. These are areas from where nearly 400 cases have been reported so far.In the last two weeks, the health department had logged 581 Covid cases from the two containment zones. The decision to convert the populous area into containment zones was taken on April 19 after 65 fresh cases were reported from the two phases. Subsequently, the health department had launched a massive testing drive, in which 9,574 samples were collected, said senior medical officer (SMO) Avinash Jindal. The restrictions had invoked the wrath of many residents who said the whole area had been converted into a garrison, just because a few people had tested positive for Covid . Teachers living in the area had complained that school authorities were pressing them to report for work, despite their area of residence being declared a Covid zone. Businesses in the area also reported significant financial loss.It was not all smooth sailing for the health department officials as well as in some places residents did not open the gates for the testing teams.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ludhiana-2-weeks-158-cases-on-containment-restrictions-lifted-from-dugri-101620156859962.html

05-05-2021||Chandigarh||Virus in villages: Higher Covid toll in rural Punjab rings alarm bells||With the rural areas of the state witnessing four-time higher case fatality rate (CFR) as compared to cities, the state health department has directed the district health authorities to keep a tab on the elderly and patients with co-morbidities in home isolation. A large number of deaths in rural areas are being attributed to the patients getting self-treated at home and not coming to hospitals.According to the orders, medical officers have been asked to prepare a list of the elderly and comorbid patients of their areas and take feedback on their health condition by calling them. “Report any breach of home isolation or refusal to get referred to higher facilities as soon as possible to the SMOs and keep contacts of SHOs of the police stations concerned to involve them for the hospitalisation,” reads the communication sent to medical officers.Former director of Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER), Chandigarh, and head of expert group of Punjab government on Covid management Dr KK Talwar said: “We have adopted a new strategy for patients in home isolation with more focus on their surveillance. Reluctance in getting tested and late reporting has been the reasons behind high CFR in rural areas, but with the new system, we are hopeful to bring down,” said Talwar. Second wave deadlier in rural areas The second wave of Covid-19 has proved deadlier in the rural areas as villages have registered 2.8% CFR as compared to 0.7% in urban areas. “Deaths are more in the rural areas this year. The reason behind high CFR is that in the rural population is contributing to 23% of the total caseload in the second wave, whereas 77% of the cases belong to urban segments,” said state’s nodal officer for Covid-19 Dr Rajesh Bhaskar. According to the health department, the CFR in rural areas at the first visit to the health facility is high. 83.92% of patients visited the hospitals when their condition deteriorated, 0.11% with moderate symptoms and only 7% with mild symptoms, the health department data revealed. Villages report 35% of total deaths in Patiala Patiala: In the past two months, rural areas have reported 35% of total Covid deaths in the district. Of the total 268 fatalities between March and May 3, the rural areas of the district saw 94 deaths. Villages have reported 3,453 (21%) positive cases of the total 16,043 infections in the district in the past two months. Civil surgeon Dr Satinder Singh said the number of deaths and cases are increasing in rural areas. “Such trends were not witnessed during first wave of the Covid-19 last year, as the deaths reported in villages then were negligible,” he said.A doctor at a rural dispensary said people living in villages are visiting the health centres at an advanced stage. “Condition of many patients had already deteriorated when they come to us and we have no option but to refer them to Rajindra Hospital,” he said. In the past 24 hours, Government Rajindra Hospital reported 38 deaths, of which 12 were from Patiala district. Of the 12, seven belonged to rural areas.In Sangrur, 97 deaths have been reported from rural areas of the district this year. Of these three patients died in home isolation, according to a data collected by the district health department. Till now, the district has reported 372 deaths due to the virus. Of these 152 were from the villages. UK strain behind surge in Doaba JALANDHAR: In Jalandhar 60% of the total Covid deaths have been reported from rural areas since February. Health officials attribute this to UK strain, which was found in Phillaur and Nurmahal areas, considered a rural belt of the district. Hoshiarpur civil surgeon Dr Ranjit Singh said more Covid deaths are being reported from rural areas of the district as people were taking medicines from local practitioners and were reporting late to the hospitals. Shaheed Bhagat Singh Nagar civil surgeon Dr Gurdeep Singh Kapoor said: “We have increased contact tracing of Covid patients. People in rural go for self medication resulting in more fatalities,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/virus-in-villages-higher-covid-toll-in-rural-punjab-rings-alarm-bells-101620156679300.html

05-05-2021||Lucknow||Keep your vibrations high to beat anxiety and stress: Experts||Stress and anxiety levels are at an all-time high as the new Covid-19 wave has taken people by shock and surprise. The sudden spike in cases amongst the near and dear, medical conditions and mortalities are causing huge stress to everyone at some level. Psychologists, mental health experts, medicos and yoga gurus are flooded with distress calls from people seeking help to overcome their acute anxiety. “The intensity of stress and anxiety amongst people are at highest level. In last lockdown people had stress but right now the fear and grief are both at an all-time high. Since everything happened so very swiftly that the people were unable to cope with,” said Dr Manju Agarwal, professor of psychology and dean student welfare of Amity University. With her husband recovering from Covid-19, after hospitalisation, Dr Agarwal herself has faced it. “It was a tough phase, so along with giving the best possible treatment, I continued meditating, kept my energies high and regularly sent him good vibes. It’s very important to keep your vibrations high with right meditation and transfer it to others facing anxiety and battling Covid,” she said. Dr Agarwal shares importance of giving space to those in grief, talk to them on phone and let them pour their emotions out in the time when we can’t hold their hand and hug them physically. She warns people to stay away from negative news, WhatsApp groups and go for a digital detox.According to homoeopathic practitioner and Vipassana follower Dr SK Jain it’s time to keep optimistic and spread positivity. “Though there are some medicines that we prescribe in homoeopathy, but again it’s all about seeing good things that are happening around us. I know a lot of people are falling ill but we need to see that nearly 98.5% are recovering — most of them in home isolation while others after hospitalisation. We attract what we think so it’s important to meditate and watch light entertainment content, so we remain de-stressed and make others happy too,” he said. To help people tackle the stress during Covid-19, Art of Living has introduced three new free courses — for developing immunity against the infection, for people currently under isolation and for rejuvenation of patients recovered from the infection. Tanuj Narain, a senior teacher at Lucknow, explains, “To reduce anxiety the Vagus Nerve needs to be activated that nullifies the fight or flight response triggered during stress. Bhramari Pranayam, Nadi Shodhan Pranayam and the Straw Breath Pranayam are helpful in reducing the effects of anxiety. Every emotion corresponds to a specific breathing pattern within us. In Pranayam we apply the reverse engineering — by altering the breathing pattern our emotions can also change. All experts focused on feeling good, interacting with family members, friends and acquaintances to make them feel de-stressed and happy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/keep-your-vibrations-high-to-beat-anxiety-and-stress-experts-101620156139428.html

As of 7pm on Tuesday, only one hospital had claimed that they had received supply, while others were still struggling to source oxygen.The desperation was a continuation of the stressful events that unfolded on Monday when five hospitals in the city ran out of oxygen. In one of the hospitals – Arka Hospital in Yelahanka – two persons died due to oxygen shortage.Volunteers in Bengaluru who arranged for oxygen for these hospitals on Monday said that the government and ministers did not respond to the emergency calls, leaving volunteers to scramble for oxygen cylinders.“Yesterday (Monday) was the first time, our city experienced an oxygen crisis like what was witnessed in New Delhi. But the government and its ministers were not available throughout the day. It was volunteers who arranged for oxygen,” said Saqib Idreez, a volunteer, who helped two hospitals get oxygen on Monday.According to him, the panic calls began around the afternoon when he got a distress call from a woman who wanted an ICU bed. “When I asked her, she said that the hospital she is admitted, was running out of oxygen. We realized that there was a bigger problem than the one case, so we called up the hospital,” said Idreez.When Idreez and other volunteers contacted the hospital, they claimed that their supply of oxygen was running out and they have stock only till 5 pm. Soon the volunteer group began making calls and also asked the hospital to provide a letter stating the concern.In response, Dr Srihari Shapur, medical director of the hospital wrote a letter which read: “This is to inform you that we are running out of oxygen supply, we are unable to collect oxygen care for the patient. We have been informing since 01/05/2021, 6:00 pm. We will shortly run out of oxygen by 03/05/2021, 5 pm. Kindly arrange for beds in different hospitals. We regret this situation. And request you to co-operate in view of patient well-being.”Idreez said that they made multiple calls to BBMP officials to talk about the issue, however, there was no response. Later, we were told that the deputy chief minister CN Ashwath Narayan had tweeted saying his office will dispatch oxygen supply. “In the meanwhile, we were getting similar calls from two other hospitals. Since the DCM had offered oxygen to Medex, we shifted our attention to the other two hospitals,” he said.While they were procuring cylinders from the other two hospitals, we got a call from Medex saying they were running out of oxygen. “We were surprised because the DCM had offered to help. Then we called up his office and the men there kept saying the stock is on the way, but nothing reached. So, we decided to arrange cylinders ourselves and we managed to get around 15 of them, which gave the hospital some time,” said the volunteer.But even in the late evening when no supply came, a volunteer from the group made calls to the Karnataka health minister Dr K Sudhakar. “We thought he would help, but instead he asked us to go to BBMP and fill the required forms. We told him that it was an emergency and explained the situation, but he kept telling us to go through BBMP. As he continued to argue, he cut the call,” said Idreez.On Tuesday, at least five hospitals including Safa hospital, Mediscope hospital, Rajarajeshwari Nagar medical college, had placed emergency requests for oxygen. As the numbers were increasing Mercy Mission, a collective of volunteers and other volunteers were scrambling for cylinders from whichever centre or homes they could find them.Medex was about to get a refill from Hosur in Bengaluru’s outskirts late at night and others were provided cylinders by the volunteers. “The one thing we realized was that the government hasn’t taken the oxygen crisis seriously. When we spoke with them, they were acting as if the hospitals were blowing the situation out of proportion. They haven’t learnt anything from what happened in New Delhi,” said a volunteer on the condition of anonymity.Deputy chief minister Narayana and health minister Sudhakar didn’t respond to Hindustan Times’ calls for their version on the incident. A BBMP official on the condition of anonymity said that there was no shortage of oxygen in the state and there was a problem with storage, especially at the smaller hospitals. “Many hospitals, especially the smaller ones, don’t have enough storage facilities. They are mostly storing oxygen in small cylinders, and they have a requirement to refill multiple times in a day, this is leading to a shortage,” he said.However, on Tuesday, the high court had pulled up the State and Central governments for the lack of oxygen supply in the state. “The requirement of the state is 1,467 metric tonnes and you have increased it only to 865 metric tonnes from existing allocation… Are you not aware that people have died in the state due to non-availability of oxygen,” a division bench of Chief justice Abhay Oka and justice Aravind Kumar asked the central government’s council.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/ktaka-ministers-didn-t-respond-to-oxygen-sos-callsvolunteers-101620155959660.html

The procurement is expected to cost the state government ₹700 crore.Amid the acute shortage of the oxygen and Remdesivir injections during the pandemic, the state government had floated global bids last week for the procurement of 25,000 metric tonnes (MT) of liquid medical oxygen (LMO), 4,000 oxygen concentrators, 250 PSA plants, 20 liquid oxygen storage tanks and anti-viral drug Remdesivir. The international players were given three days to respond, to which Indian suppliers dealing in international products have responded.“We have received 38 bidders for oxygen concentrators, nine for PSA plants, one for LMO supply and a good number of bidders for the storage tanks. We have been talking with the players day-and-night and expect the delivery in three days. We are evaluating products by the doctors and have also been keeping our embassies in various countries in the loop,” said Aseem Kumar Gupta, principal secretary, relief and rehabilitation.Public health department minster Rajesh Tope said that the state is expecting delivery of 20,000 oxygen concentrators, 27 storage tanks and 350,000 Remdesivir doses shortly.Another official from the relief and rehabilitation department has been put the bidding process on war footing for procuring the oxygen-related equipment amid the acute shortage.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/20000-oxygen-concentrators-350k-remdesivir-doses-expected-soon-in-maharashtra-101620155718482.html
05-05-2021||Other||Bengaluru: 2 patients die due to oxygen ‘shortage’||Bengaluru Two Covid-19 patients died in Bengaluru’s Arka Hospital on Tuesday allegedly due to shortage of oxygen, the hospital management said. The incident highlighted the growing scarcity of critical supplies amid the raging pandemic in Karnataka and especially its capital Bengaluru. Dr Manju Aditya, director of the hospital, said he had raised an SOS call on shortage of oxygen on Monday night. He added that by 3 am on Tuesday, the hospital managed to get the supply of around 15 cylinders. “During the time of low oxygen (stock), two patients died. Both were severely infected by Covid-19,” Dr Aditya told Hindustan Times. “We asked in vain for help. We went to neighbouring hospitals and managed to arrange 10 cylinders from them,” he said, adding that there was no supply of oxygen at the plant from where the hospital gets its supply. The incident came a day after at least 24 Covid-19 patients died in Chamarajanagar district, about 175 km from Bengaluru, allegedly due to lack of oxygen. At least five private hospitals in Bengaluru have raised SOS calls for oxygen supply since Monday night. The hospitals that raised the SOS on Monday and Tuesday include Medax, RajaRajeshwari hospital, Sree Saiprasad among others.With only “stop-gap” arrangements from the government, private hospitals find themselves with full occupancy and no critical medical supplies, to treat Covid-19 patients, according to managements of at least three such establishments. Meanwhile, Mandya district in-charge minister KC Narayana Gowda on Monday evening said there was a severe shortage of oxygen in the district, about 99 km from Bengaluru. Amid reports of deaths due to shortage of oxygen, Karnataka chief minister BS Yediyurappa has come under sharp criticism for not increasing preparedness of essential medical supplies like oxygen, hospital beds, life-saving medicines and even space to cremate the rising number of dead. After the incident in Chamarajanagar, Yediyurappa met oxygen manufacturers and suppliers on Monday to fix the teething issues in distribution. But various hospitals claimed that they were yet to get any real assistance from the government. Priyank Kharge, former minister and Congress legislator from Kalaburagi, a border district that is one of the worst-impacted regions in the state, on Tuesday said that several oxygen suppliers were profiteering from the pandemic. “While Kalaburagi hospitals are gasping for oxygen & people are dying due to shortage in supply, a private oxygen plant in district has been profiteering by sending O2 cylinders to Maharashtra while @BJP4Karnataka Govt sleeps throughout pandemic,” Kharge said in a post on Twitter. Gaurav Gupta, chief commissioner of Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) on Tuesday sought the help of people to upgrade public healthcare infrastructure. “Calling out for your support in procurement of oxygen concentrators, oxygen cylinders and NIV ventilators for BBMP healthcare facilities,” he posted on Twitter. The state government has also been accused of ignoring the warnings of imminent second wave of pandemic by the state-appointed technical advisory committee (TAC) on Covid-19 in November last year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/bengaluru-2-patients-die-due-to-oxygen-shortage-101620155658487.html

He had been admitted to the city’s Rajiv Gandhi Government General Hospital and was on ventilator support. Ramaswamy, a self appointed traffic regulator, for hours used to direct traffic near the Madras high court in the 1990s from where commuters began calling him ‘Traffic’ Ramaswamy. Later, he walked into courtrooms and became a regular filing petitions against road traffic norms, encroachments, unauthorised buildings, and erection of hoardings. In Tamil Nadu, which is notorious for its banner culture of sycophant cadre putting up huge cutouts and hoardings of their leaders only for it to be torn down by ‘Traffic’ Ramaswamy. He’s fearlessly tore down posters in front of homes of powerful former chief ministers J Jayalalithaa and M Karunanidhi. He didn’t spare the hoardings in front of AIADMK and DMK party offices. “His fight against big digital hoardings and banners was phenomenal,” says Jayaram Venkatesan who founded the anti-corruption movement, Arappor Iyakkam. “He fought both on the road as well as in court to get it banned at one stage. His other cases on encroachments, granite scam will always be remembered. He inspired many youngsters to become active citizens.” He has been arrested several times and has grabbed eyeballs when he would sit or lie down on a main road in protest. He has filed more than 200 public interest litigations (PILs) for the larger good. One of his PILs, led the court to direct the city police to reverse its decision on converting the NSC Bose Road (near the court) into a one-way. He moved court stating that the police were taking an easy way out by not regulating traffic and converting a broad arterial road into a one-way. He also got fish carts, that were causing road accidents, banned. For all his mighty work, he was a frail man dressed in white shirt, khaki trousers under which his catheter was strapped, oversized spectacles and always carried a bundle full of petitions in his hands and in his pocket. In 2018, a Tamil biopic of him was released in cinemas. Until his health deteriorated, he was active following several cases. Politicians and public mourned the loss of the activist who brought several changes for the better in Tamil Nadu.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/traffic-ramaswamy-dies-due-to-covid-19-at-87-101620155539826.html

He added that it made little sense for the government to take over the supply of critical medicine to control profiteering and black marketing.However, black marketing has become rampant in Bengaluru, if recent arrests over hoarding of Remdesivir, a drug used to treat critically ill Covid-19 persons are any indication.Families of critically-ill patients told HT that they have paid between ₹10,000 to ₹60,000 per vial to get Remdesivir.“The poor cannot spend their life savings to arrange it (Remdesivir and other drugs). In spite of drug stores having stock of Remdesivir, they have to wait till the drug controller sends them a request to supply it to hospitals. The government appointed only one to two officials for such a huge responsibility and this has led to black marketing of Remdesivir,” Yunus Nawab, a city-based lawyer, said. After making frantic calls to friends and relatives, it took Nawab more than two days to get Remdesivir for his mother who was admitted in a private hospital.“I have a report that it (Remdesivir) is being sold in black and to other states. There will be a detailed enquiry into this and all you will have to face the consequences. I won’t spare anyone,” Yediyurappa reportedly told a few officials during an emergency meeting convened by the chief minister on Tuesday.According to the report, he said, there was evidence to show the involvement of several people in blackmarketing of these drugs.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/as-cases-surge-city-faces-acute-drug-shortage-101620155539141.html
05-05-2021||Mumbai||Messages on Covid adoption illegal; follow due legal process for adoption: Experts||Responding to multiple viral social media messages, concerning the adoption of children whose parents have allegedly died of Covid-19, the state government on Monday issued a clarification stating that such attempts at adoption are illegal and can attract punitive action under the Indian Penal Code, the Care and Protection of Children Act (2015) as well as the Centre’s Adoption Rules (2017). The Maharashtra Women and Child Development Department also urged citizens to follow the due legal process for adoption in such cases and to report matters to the Centre’s 1098 helpline or the State Adoption Resource Agency’s helpline at 8329041531.“Deaths of both the parents due to Covid-19 are causing serious problems... which are exacerbated by the fact that such children are sometimes not accepted by relatives. On the one hand, the issue of such children is taking a serious turn and the picture on social media shows that some miscreants are using this issue as an opportunity to sell each other’s children. For this, various emotional posts are being posted on social media like Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram, Twitter etc. and a picture is being created that children are available for adoption,” the Women and Child Development Department said in a statement issued Tuesday.For example, one such widely circulated message read, “If anyone wishes to adopt a girl, please feel free to contact 09711104773 (Priyanka). One girl is 3 days old and another is 6 months old, they have lost their parents recently due to covid. Please help these kids get a new life, spread the word.” HT tried to reach out to the number but was met with a constant busy tone.Commenting on the matter, IA Kundan, secretary, Women and Child Development Department, said, “We are aware of such messages going around on social media platforms. But, so far we haven’t received any official complaint. To raise awareness among people, we have posted about the guidelines on the website and social media pages of women and child development. It is punishable offence to indulge in such illegal adoptions.”Yashomati Thakur, woman and child welfare minister said that the state government has taken suo motu cognisance of the cases of the children becoming orphans by losing their parents due to the pandemic. “The cases of children becoming orphans have gone up during the pandemic. We have asked the district collectors and Child Welfare Committees (CWCs) at the district level to look into them immediately to extend their support. Legal adoption is a must, otherwise, it may be very dangerous for the future of the child. We have appealed to the relatives of such children to come forward and bring it to our notice so that all kind of help is provided to them,” she said.The minister said that she has convened a meeting this week to discuss this issue and discourage people from directly adopting such children without following the legal process. “Some people may have knowingly or unknowingly resorted to illegal ways of adoption, it would not be tolerated. There are legal, psychological issues involved with the parenting of such children that need to be addressed accordingly,” she said.Thakur said that the orphanages in Maharashtra are in very good condition and every care is taken to through dedicated welfare officers for these institutions.Manisha Birasis, assistant commissioner, woman and child development department, said that legal adoption was very important to give the child its right of biological parents and legal powers coming therewith. “The direct adoption may lead to trafficking. We have witnessed such cases in the past and have registered criminal cases under the Indian Penal Code and Juvenile Justice Act. We have initiated action through cybercrime cell after we came across such an attempt through a Facebook post for the adoption of two children who had lost their parents of Covid-19. The adoption should be done only through CARA and by following the legal process,” she said.Birasis said that at least 20,000 genuine applicants are waiting in Maharashtra for adoption. “The applicants go through the procedure of the home study, ability to adopt, review by the expert panel before they are made eligible for the adoption. The illegal adoptions also deprive the children from these eligible parents who are scrutinized through a set procedure,” she said.The department has also launched a helpline (8308992222 and 7400015518) with the help of Save The Children India for counselling and helping orphan children. The helpline will also extend support to the children whose parents have tested positive for Covid-19 and need help for time being.Birasis said that besides the adoption, the department has a scheme called Balsangopan Yojana which financially helps the parents, single parents, relatives looking after orphan children with the monthly assistance of ₹1,125. “The children are thus maintained in the family without going to the orphanage or adoption and it’s the basic principle of the JJ Act,” she said. The issue isn’t isolated to Mumbai alone. Earlier this week, Delhi’s Commission for Protection of Child Right (DCPCR) appealed to people on social media to call on their helpline number and report cases where children need essential supplies, have lost their parent(s), or are struggling to support themselves due to the illness. The Delhi child rights body said that requests for adopting children orphaned amid the pandemic have also started pouring in.“The DCPCR has come across many instances on social media (Facebook, Twitter and WhatsApp), where the people who have information about the orphan children are encouraging people to adopt these children. In some cases, they post updates that the child or children have been adopted. I am sure that some of these are out of innocence and ignorance of the law governing adoption. However, they may also be cases of trafficking and sale-purchase of children. Either way, deserve to be inquired into to get to the depth of the matter,” DCPCR chairperson Anurag Kundu wrote to the Delhi police this week.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/messages-on-covid-adoption-illegal-follow-due-legal-process-for-adoption-experts-101620155538561.html

The children took up the ball from a vacant plot of land adjoining their house and took it for playing but when they tried to open, it exploded, police said, adding condition of one of them was serious. The incident occurred in Muzhakunnu police station. Certain pockets of Kannur district are notorious for violent clashes between the CPI(M) and RSS cadres and many lives were lost in three-decade long rivalry. In party villages crude bomb-making is a routine affair to check political opponents. To avoid detection many hide crude bombs in vacant plots and houses and many such freak accidents were reported from the area, police said. Police have launched a search operation in area to find hidden crude bombs, if any, and detained the owner of the plot. “We have detained the owner of the plot and two others in connection with the incident,” said a senior police officer. Two weeks back, a CPI(M) supporter lost both his hands while making a crude bomb in Kadirur. Last September, an accused in TP Chandrasekharan murder case also sustained serious injuries when a bomb which he was assembling went off accidentally. Chandrasekharan, who floated a new party after leaving the CPI(M), was hacked to death by a group of CPI(M) workers in Vadakara in 2012. Most of the accused in the case were later sentenced. His widow K K Rema got elected to the assembly in the just-concluded elections. At least 200 party workers of both, CPI(M) and RSS, were killed in past three decades in recurring political clashes in north Kerala district.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/bomb-inside-ice-cream-ball-explodes-two-children-hurt-in-kerala-101620155479066.html

The CPI(M)-led Left Democratic Front (LDF) won 99 out of 140 assembly seats in the state on Sunday, bucking a four-decade-old political tradition of oscillating the Congress and CPI(M)-led fronts alternately. In the Left surge, the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) drew a blank in Kerala. Talking to reporters after the party secretariat meeting, Vijayaraghavan said the new government will be sworn in after the LDF meeting on May 17. “Due to pandemic situation, strict restrictions are in force. Let the situation ease a bit, there is no hurry,” he said, adding the LDF will observe a victory day on May 7. Workers have been asked to lit lamps in their homes observing Covid -19 protocol.He said “historic victory” in Kerala has given a fresh impetus to secular and democratic forces in the country and the party will take initiative to build a new alternative against communal forces. “Our victory and high vote share are historic. It is a victory of the Left and secular forces. This victory has national relevance also,” Vijayaraghavan said, adding the victory was clinched in trying times. He said all opposition parties, including the Congress and BJP, had teamed up against the government and many central agencies had pitched their tents in the state and intimidated officials and others but their designs fell flat with people’s mandate. He said the loss in Kerala will hasten the fall of the Congress in the country. Vijayaraghavan added that the Congress tried its best to weaken secular forces in Kerala and its national leaders were also part of it, while referring to Gandhi family’s intense campaign in the state. “The Congress and BJP were in a race to raise baseless allegations against the government. At one point both were talking in single voice. They also tried to sabotage some of the welfare programmes. People have given them a befitting reply,” he said.Meanwhile, outgoing opposition leader Ramesh Chennithala has alleged a CPI(M)-BJP nexus to weaken the Congress in Kerala. “A close look at the results show in many seats NDA vote share has gone down. Most of these votes have shifted to the LDF camp. We suspect it a part of a conspiracy of the BJP’s pet “Congress-mukt” campaign,” he said in Thiruvananthapuram. BJP state president K Surendran has denied Chennithala’s claims, saying the Left successfully injected a fear psychosis among minority communities that led to consolidation of their votes in its favour.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/after-kerala-win-left-to-draw-up-fresh-national-plan-against-bjp-101620155418572.html

After the May 2 results ended the AIADMK’s 10-year rule and brought back the DMK, Palaniswami graciously accepted defeat and wished Stalin on Twitter, the platform for new-age politics. Stalin reciprocated by seeking Palaniswami’s ideas and cooperation. “Democracy is a fusion of both ruling and opposition parties,” Stalin said. This was unheard of during previous regime changes in Tamil Nadu. A prime factor is that the two new leaders have no personal animosity unlike the history of rivalry between DMK patriarch M Karunanidhi and MG Ramachandran (MGR), and later J Jayalalithaa. It began when the matinee idol and popular leader MGR split from the DMK in 1972 and founded the ADMK (later renamed AIADMK) ending the MGR- Karunanidhi friendship and successful partnership in films and politics. MGR won the first election in 1977 after launching his party and continued to remain chief minister until his death in 1987. “Their personal vengeance gave rise to politics of hatred in Tamil Nadu,” says former journalist Durai Karunanidhi. “Both of them wanted to abolish each other’s parties. DMK foisted false cases against MGR and after he came to power, MGR managed to keep a Chanakya-like Karunanidhi away from electoral victory until his death. Yet, they were on speaking terms; they would participate in common public events.” MGR and Karunanidhi had together attended the wedding of Tamilisai Soundararajan, the daughter of Congress veteran Kumari Ananthan. She is now a BJP leader and governor of Telangana and lieutenant governor of Puducherry. Videos from her wedding show MGR, who was then chief minister, and Karunanidhi sitting together, speaking and laughing. After MGR’s death, Jayalalithaa took over the reins, became the state’s opposition leader, as Karunanidhi returned as chief minister in the 1989 elections. Jayalalithaa inherited the rivalry, which increased after an infamous incident in the assembly when the DMK was two months into its third term. Violence broke out between the two parties and DMK’s present organising secretary Durai Murugan is accused of hitting Jayalalithaa and she came out of the assembly weeping and dishevelled. In 2001, in less than a month after Jayalalithaa became chief minister, a then 78-year-old Karunanidhi was arrested over corruption charges. In a midnight drama, police woke him up at 1.45am, roughed him up and took him into custody, all the while with Karunanidhi shouting, ‘kolapandranga’ meaning “they are killing me”. “He spent a week in prison, that’s all Jayalalithaa wanted. She didn’t pursue the case,” says DMK veteran and MP TKS Elangovan. Karunanidhi and Jayalalithaa never saw eye-to-eye and avoided assembly proceedings with each other. “Jayalalithaa has expelled AIADMK cadre when she heard reports of them speaking to DMK cadre,” said Durai. Elangovan narrates that though AIADMK MPs and MLAs would speak to him when they were together in Delhi in parliament or outside, the same members wouldn’t dare to be seen with him in Chennai. “We would fly back from Delhi to Chennai together and chat together on-air but from the minute we land, they will stop speaking and won’t even walk next to me,” says Elangovan. “That’s how much they feared Jayalalithaa.” The change perhaps started with Stalin who attended Jayalalithaa’s swearing-in in 2016 even as several DMK MLAs boycotted it. Karunanidhi complained that Jayalalithaa insulted his son in the seating arrangement as he was seated in the 16th row. The following day, Jayalalithaa clarified that it wasn’t intended and if she was informed of Stalin’s attendance, she would have relaxed norms and seated him in the front row. The erstwhile hardened stances began to wither after Jayalalithaa’s death in December 2016 after she was re-elected for a second term earlier that year. After a long-drawn succession battle, Palaniswami became chief minister and helmed the AIADMK along with O Panneerselvam. “Though the ruling and opposition debated and criticised each other, they came out of the assembly speaking to each other similar to the Delhi culture and respectful politics began to peek in Tamil Nadu,” says Durai. It was beginning to bring back a healthy political culture that was seen even between former chief ministers-- Congress’s K Kamaraj and DMK founder CN Annadurai. Palaniswami gave audience to a Stalin-led delegation in his chamber because they wanted to submit reformations -- a scene perhaps common in other states such as Kerala where ruling and opposition leaders travel and work together, but not in Tamil Nadu. Ministers led by Pannerselvam visited Karunanidhi’s residence when his health was deteriorating. It hit a rough spot when the AIADMK government cited new environment rules and denied permission for Karunanidhi, who didn’t die in office, to be buried alongside former chief ministers and his Dravidian mentors and rivals in Chennai’s Marina beach in August 2018. DMK went to court and the AIADMK allowed it after the Madras high court’s approval in a special late-night hearing. Palaniswami justified that it was the state’s inability due to policy. It was also a time when the Palaniswami-led government was seen as being subservient to the BJP at the Centre which Stalin has consistently criticised. “Stalin doesn’t seem to be the one to carry personal vengeances and Palaniswami and Panneerselvam are soft too,” said Durai. Stain went to Palaniswami’s Chennai residence for his mother’s memorial service in October 2020 just before both leaders would begin a high-octane campaign mocking each other. On Tuesday, a few DMK workers tore down banners of an ‘Amma canteen’ in Chennai, launched by Jayalalithaa in 2013 and replicated across the country to serve budget meals for the poor. “Our leader (Stalin) asked for the board to be fixed back; the two workers have been arrested and expelled from the party,” said M Subramanian, former Chennai mayor and newly elected MLA. Such actions and their exchanges post campaigns even as they trade important places as chief minister and opposition leader indicates that the new-generation leaders are overturning decades of hate politics built on personal vengeance into a healthy atmosphere. However, Stalin, in his election manifesto has stated that the DMK would form a special court to try corrupt ministers. He has submitted two complaints to governor Banwarilal Purohit against Palaniswami, Paneerselvam and other top ministers on graft charges. Stalin has also promised to speed up investigations into Jayalalithaa’s death. It remains to be seen how the DMK would pursue these two promises which would earn the wrath of the new opposition.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/stalin-palaniswami-chart-new-path-with-healthy-political-ties-101620155359118.html
05-05-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai: Vaccination for second dose for 45+ restarts amid confusion||After a gap of four days, vaccination drive for the second dose for those in the 45+ age group restarted on Tuesday, leading to chaos and long queues as thousands rushed to several centres. The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) will continue to vaccinate the 45+ age group for the second dose and 18-44 age group for the first dose on Wednesday too. There is a possibility that the vaccination for the first dose for above 45+ may start from Thursday, however, nothing is finalised, said BMC officials. Vaccination centres, including BKC centre, Shatabdi Govandi, ESIS Mulund, BARC, Kurla Bhabha, ran out of stock before noon, which the BMC officials claimed, was because they did not receive any stock from the Central government. They said vaccine doses from the reserve quota were used for the 18-44 age group. The BMC expects to have a substantial amount of vaccine doses by Tuesday midnight. Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner, said, “We are likely to get 150,000 vaccine doses by Tuesday night and they will be used for the vaccination drive on Wednesday. However, we will continue vaccinating citizens above the age of 45+ for the second dose on Wednesday and first dose for the 18-44 age group.” Several citizens above the age of 45 also went to get their first dose but were sent back by the authorities. Firuza Dastoor, an Andheri resident, said, “My parents and I were scheduled for a second dose. My parents have been eligible for the second dose for the past one week, but have not been getting it despite going to the vaccination centre thrice. Finally, on Tuesday we went to SevenHills hospital for the fourth time and got the doses. Our experience at SevenHills was good.” Another Andheri resident Vicckey Ajwani said, “I had taken my first dose of Covaxin a month ago and my second dose was scheduled 28 days later in the last week of April. However, I had to go to Cooper Hospital multiple times to figure out when and how I will get my second dose. This is not the experience one would want for vaccination. Also, there is always a risk of getting exposed to the virus considering the long queues and large crowds at the vaccination centres. It was only after a lot of struggle and multiple calls that I got my second dose.” Meanwhile civic authorities made operational the first drive-in vaccination centres in the city at Dadar in a parking lot. According to BMC officials, it got good response there. Senior citizens and specially abled will be vaccinated at the centre. According to BMC’s data, 417 citizens were vaccinated in 227 cars on Tuesday at the drive-in vaccination centre.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-vaccination-for-second-dose-for-45-restarts-amid-confusion-101620155358475.html
05-05-2021||Other||Chennai scrambles to find ICU beds as Covid cases soar||Chennai: As Covid-19 cases rise in Tamil Nadu with the highest caseload in Chennai, people were struggling to find beds with oxygen support and ventilators in time. As per 5.30 pm data from the state government’s Covid bed status on its website, among the five government hospitals in Chennai, only nine oxygen supported beds were available out of 1,823 while all 919 ICU beds were occupied. “On an average, we are admitting 150-200 patients per day and most of them are in critical condition. Discharges are 70-90 in a day… we are extending oxygen lines,” said Dr E Theranirajan, dean, Rajiv Gandhi Government General Hospital (RGGGH), the largest public hospital in Chennai treating Covid-19. The hospital has now formed a four-member committee to exclusively monitor consumption of oxygen. “The team will monitor and plan how to conserve oxygen in the wards,” said Theranirajan. The hospital is also planning to add 20,000 kilo litre oxygen from other blocks, to meet the demand for Covid-19 treatment. “We are working with the technical team as well as the oxygen team to be able to conserve it even as we increase the oxygen points,” Theranirajan added. ICUs in most private hospitals in the city are full and the struggle is to find beds in either government facilities or smaller private hospitals. “It’s a very bad situation,” said a doctor of a private hospital. “More patients are critical in the second wave. In the first wave, even those with mild, moderate symptoms were hospitalised, but now they’re in home treatment. Our ICU is full and there are 12 patients on the waitlist. We use 3,500 metric cubes of oxygen every day for more than 250 patients on oxygen support. We are worried about managing oxygen so that it is not replenished,” the doctor added. Archanaa Seker, who volunteers for a group Chennai Cares formed to help people find drugs and beds, said it took them more than eight hours to find an oxygen supported bed for a 65-year-old man with comorbidities in Chennai last week. The patient’s oxygen levels were 89 at 11 am last Tuesday and began to drop. The group called 108 ambulance service operated by the government and which had oxygen support and the family went to a private and government hospital where there were no beds before reaching RGGGH. “They had to wait for a few hours at the hospital before he got a bed with oxygen support. At 11.30 pm, he was struggling to breathe but his treatment had started,” said Seker. The patient died in the hospital on Tuesday. “The hospital had rightly escalated his treatment at every stage, but despite being on high flow oxygen his health deteriorated,” said Seker. “The struggle for beds is showing us many sides of why the situation is grim in Chennai. It’s not just a shortage of resources but lack of information. Who is going to guide you? Where do you go first if you are told you need to be on a ventilator? It’s also the first time we are pushing people to use the government system whether it’s for treatment or the 104 helpline to avail beds because the system is in place,” Seker added. On Tuesday, Tamil Nadu reported 21,228 fresh Covid-19 cases, taking the total active caseload in the state to 123,258. Chennai accounted for 6,228 of the total new cases, taking its active case count to 33,222, according to state health department. The state also reported 144 deaths due to Covid-19 on Tuesday, which took the toll due to the pandemic to 14,612. Meanwhile, health authorities said it has been more challenging as compared to the first wave. “We are increasing hospital beds with oxygen and ensuring oxygen is sustained as cases are increasing and we have sought inputs from Kerala on their management,” said a health official, who did not wish to be named. Tamil Nadu is going through a transition from the AIADMK-led government to the newly elected one led by DMK chief MK Stalin. A day after victory, chief minister-elect Stalin held two review meetings with the state’s chief secretary, health secretary among other top bureaucrats on the Covid-19 situation on Monday and Tuesday. “After the meeting we introduced new restrictions,” an official said. Late Monday night, the new restrictions such as 50% workforce in government and private offices from May 6 to 20 were announced. “Don’t think of this as restrictions imposed by the government but as the restrictions that people put on themselves,” said Stalin in a statement. “Only by turning this into a people’s movement can we break the chain,” he added. Experts said that though Tamil Nadu has a better public health system and administration compared to other states, it is getting overwhelmed. “If you see the curve in the second wave, it’s a steep rise,” said virologist Jacob John, former director of the ICMR’s Centre of Advanced Research in Virology. “The spread is three-four times faster because of the variants, which is most concerning,” John added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/chennai-scrambles-to-find-icu-beds-as-covid-cases-soar-101620155298489.html

All three civic bodies are waiting for vaccine doses; especially the Covaxin. For the last two weeks, Kalyan Dombivli Municipal Corporation (KDMC) has not been getting doses of Covaxin, whereas Thane and Navi Mumbai last received Covaxin on April 25. For 56 years old, Rama Iyer from Vrindavan Society in Thane, this is the last week for her to get vaccinated with the second dose of Coviaxin. “We have tried visiting vaccination centres last week, but to no avail. My daughter spoke to our regular physician who assured us that we could wait for another week, despite the schedule to get vaccinated. However, the government should ensure that there is enough stock for those who have taken the first dose.” There are many senior citizens like Iyer, who are awaiting the arrival of Covaxin for their second dose. “I have been calling hospitals in Thane, Navi Mumbai and Mira Road for the last two weeks. I am not a tech-savvy person and my children live in another city. Hence, I rely on my neighbours to help me find vaccination centres. Two weeks ago there were two centres in KDMC that had Covaxin but I was not aware of it. By the time I got to know, they were short of vaccines. There is a continuous appeal from authorities to get vaccinated but there is no help or support on how to go about the vaccination process,” said Hemant Shah, 64, resident of Dombivli. Prashant Patil, secretary, Indian Medical Association (IMA), Kalyan chapter, informed, “People need not panic as they can wait for two weeks from the time frame for the vaccine. For both vaccines, there is enough time suggested and the authorities are also working to get additional doses as soon as possible.” Moreover, a few senior citizens are on high medication, hence the doctors have suggested Covaxin. Prachi Choudhary, a resident of Navi Mumbai who helps senior citizens with the vaccination process, said, “I have a list of 140 senior citizens waiting to get vaccinated; among these, we have prepared a separate list of those who need the second dose as they are a priority. However, the shortage of supply is proving to be a hindrance. Covishield was available in most places until last week and many went ahead with walk-in vaccinations for the same.” Various citizen organisations are working towards helping senior citizens get their doses as per schedule, especially for second doses. “Once the hospital gets the vaccine stock, we are plan to start the immunisation drive. Housing societies could join us in this mission and help their members get vaccinated,” said Kasber Augustine, resident of Thane. Over 23,000 people in Thane city have taken Covaxin, of which 17,000 are yet to get the second dose. “We received Covaxin on April 25 and we had six centres open the next day. Post that we have not received any doses of the vaccine. Sunday onwards we have only been focusing on those between 18 and 44 years of age,” said a senior officer from Thane Municipal Corporation (TMC). Similarly, KDMC has not received Covaxin doses for the last two weeks and no doses are available for those above 45 years of age in the last four days. Abhijit Bangar, commissioner, Navi Mumbai Municipal Corporation (NMMC), said, “We are expecting more vaccines on Wednesday. As of now, the vaccination process has been stalled for 45 years and above age. We received Covaxin last on April 25 and Covishield on Thursday.” Meanwhile, Thane district officials are also unable to meet the demand for vaccines. A senior officer said, “There is a shortage all over the state. We are not getting the desired number of vaccines. The ones that we get have to be equally distributed in all civic bodies, municipal councils as well as rural areas. This is a difficult task, especially, considering the population in urban areas.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/shortage-of-vaccine-doses-irks-senior-citizens-in-thane-101620155238476.html
05-05-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Oxygen tankers to be fitted with GPS to monitor their movement||All tankers being used to carrying liquid medical oxygen in Maharashtra will be fitted with Global Positioning System (GPS) devices for monitoring their movement. Nearly 250 tankers are presently being used to transport medical oxygen in the state. Of them, 125 tankers have GPS installed in them. GPS will enable the transport authorities and the Food and Drug Administration(FDA) to track the movement of liquid oxygen in the state. It will help them in better management of oxygen supply to the hospitals. Maharashtra transport commissioner Avinash Dhakane stated on Tuesday that all the tankers will be fitted with GPS systems in a few days.Further, a control room for the monitoring of movement of liquid oxygen in the state has been set up and will be used to track the tankers after GPS is installed.“We have nearly 250 tankers that are used for transporting medical oxygen. The installation process in half of the tankers have been completed and the process is on. The control room is already set up and will be used to track all movements of tankers after GPS has been fitted in all vehicles,” said a senior transport department official. The GPS devices are being installed in the tankers by the Federation of Automobile Dealers Association (FADA). The organisation has raised ₹10 lakhs for the installation. “We have tried to do our best as this is a small contribution towards enabling the transport department to monitor oxygen tankers movement on a single dashboard. This will help save the lives of patients by providing them lifesaving oxygen on time,” said Vinkesh Gulati, president, FADA.Liquid medical oxygen in tankers is being moved by road and railways in the state. The Central and Western Railway have transported liquid oxygen tankers by Roll On Roll Off (RORO) flat wagons from Visakhapatnam and Gujarat to Nagpur, Nashik and Kalamboli in Navi Mumbai. The tankers were then transported to oxygen plants in Nagpur and Nashik and moved to government and private hospitals.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-oxygen-tankers-to-be-fitted-with-gps-to-monitor-their-movement-101620155178478.html
05-05-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra’s vaccine wastage 0.22%: Cong demands apology from Javadekar||After the figures released by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare revealed that Maharashtra’s rate of vaccine wastage was one of the lowest, the Maharashtra Congress general secretary and spokesperson Sachin Sawant demanded an apology from the Union minister Prakash Javadekar over his claims that the state wasted more than 500,000 vaccines.Maharashtra’s vaccine wastage rate has dropped to 0.22% while some other states have reported it as high as 7-8%.In its press release on Monday, the Union ministry stated that out of 16.36 million doses of vaccines supplied to Maharashtra, the wastage was 0.22%. Against it, other states and Union territories like Haryana (5.72%), Assam (7.7%), Lakshadweep (9.71%), Tamil Nadu (8.83%), Uttar Pradesh (3.54%), Gujarat (3.61%) reported high wastage of the vaccine. Six of the states have also reported it in minus, but the state authorities have contested computing saying it is because of errors in keeping account of the received stock.On April 7, Union minister Prakash Javadekar had said that the Maharashtra government was playing politics over the allotment of vaccine stock. He also alleged that it should first reply about the high wastage of vaccine. “Maharashtra Govt should not play politics over-vaccination. Here are the facts: Total number of COVID vaccine supplied to State till date - 1,06,19,190 ; Consumption - 905,3,523 (of which 6% wastage - over 5L) Vaccine in pipeline - 7,43,280. Dosage available - nearly 23 lakhs,” he had tweeted.His remarks had sparked the political slugfest and Congress and Nationalist Congress Party leaders had said that in Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-ruled states the wastage was more than that reported in Maharashtra.On Tuesday, Maharashtra Congress general secretary and spokesperson Sachin Sawant said that Javadeklar should apologise to the people of Maharashtra for his lie. “Javadekarji’s falsehood has been exposed by the Central government’s press note as the wastage is not 6% and is just 0.22%. The Union minister has insulted Maharashtra by spreading wrong information for the sake of politics,” he said.Sawant also cited a report prepared by Ashok University on Covid-19 in which it has been stated that the vaccine given to the state by the Centre were in not in the proportion of the population and the cases.BJP’s media cell chief Vishwas Pathak said, “On one hand public health minister Rajesh Tope says that Maharashtra has trained manpower in the healthcare sector and they can ramp up daily inoculation to 1.2 million doses, why there was the wastage of 600,000 doses. In percentage, it may be less, but the wastage of such a huge stock when there was an acute shortage, is not acceptable.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtras-vaccine-wastage-0-22-cong-demands-apology-from-javadekar-101620155119163.html

As on Tuesday evening, 19,134 cases remain active across the tricityWith 847 cases and 12 deaths, Mohali district accounted for the bulk of the Tuesday’s Covid-19 tally, followed by 780 cases and 11 casualties in Chandigarh, and 584 cases and six fatalities in Panchkula district. For Panchkula, it was the highest number of cases in a day, while Mohali reported a record 12 deaths for second consecutive day and third time in a week.Just four days into May, the tricity has logged 8,170 cases and 88 deaths, as compared to 43,145 cases and 311 deaths throughout April. Curbs in 54 more areas in Chandigarh After setting records for two consecutive days, the number of cases in Chandigarh saw a dip, but the situation remains grim. Among those dead are a 34-year-old man from Sector 34 and 37-year-old woman from Sector 38.The daily positivity rate rose to 25%, which means of every four people sampled, one had the infection.Amid the rising numbers, the UT administration has declared 54 more micro-containment zones in the city. The areas are spread across Sectors 8, 10, 11, 14, 15, 16, 18, 19, 20, 21, 45 and 46 besides Ram Darbar, Hallomajra, Behlana, Khuda Lahora and Dhanas. The administration has also stationed two officials of the Chandigarh Housing Board at the INOX oxygen plant in Solan’s Barotiwala to ensure smooth supply of oxygen to government hospitals and private refilling vendors in Chandigarh.Meanwhile, as Government Multi Specialty Hospital, Sector 16, has exhausted its bed capacity, the administration has directed Government Medical College and Hospital, Sector 32, to accommodate all patients from Chandigarh, irrespective of their zones. Don’t deny admission to critical patients: Mohali DCAmid a steep spike in critical cases and deaths in Mohali, deputy commissioner Girish Dayalan has asked private hospitals in the district not to refuse hospitalisation to such patients. “L3 patient (those needing ventilator) may be accommodated on L2 beds (with oxygen support) till the next discharge from L3 facility, subject to the approval of patient’s attendant,” said Dayalan, while adding that admission in a lower facility and being under medical supervision may give the patient some chance to recover. With good samaritans coming forward with the offer to set up Covid Care Centres, Dayalan said the facility should have at least 50 beds, and such people can contact the civil surgeon to get the certification for the site. He also authorised hiring of three funeral vans in each subdivision to help the families in distress. Vax for 45+ at 12 sites in Panchkula todayAmid confusion over vaccination sites that has left many senior citizens running helter-skelter in Panchkula, the district administration announced that jabs will be given to the 45+ age group at 12 sites on Wednesday. These sites are Polyclinic, Sector 26; Government Dispensaries, Sector 12A (covaxin) and 21; Mansa Devi Complex, Sector 4; Subdivisional Hospital, Kalka; Community Health Centre, Nanakpur; Command Hospital, Chandimandir; and Primary Health Centres in Surajpur, Old Panhckula, Morni, Barwala, and Hangola.The timings are 9am-11am for those in 70+ age group, 11am-12:30pm for 50-69 years, and 12:30pm-2pm for 45-49 years.Meanwhile, those in the age group of 18-44 will be vaccinated at six sites, only after online appointment: Urban Health Centre, Sector 16; Government Dispensary, Sector 25; Government Ayurvedic Dispensary, Sector 9; Community Health centre, Raipur Rani; and Primary Health Centres in Pinjore and Kot.The administration also said that it has received 174 calls on the helpline number (0172- 2590000) launched for Covid-19 on May 1. “Most of the callers inquire about delay in test reports, or seek medical advice,” said an official.

05-05-2021||Delhi||Covid spread in ‘empty’ women’s cell takes Tihar admin by surprise||At least 57 of the 444 women prisoners lodged in the women’s jail in Tihar have tested Covid-positive in the last one month, according to prison officers privy to the development who added that the spread of the infection was far quicker than seen in jails holding male prisoners.Sub-jail number 6 holds only women prisoners and is far less populated than the barracks and jails meant for men. While jail number 6 has just 444 inmates, a men’s jail like sub jail number 1 has over 2,000 prisoners. Other jails have around 1,000-1,300 inmates.The officers quoted above also said that of the five prisoners who died of the infection last week, one was a woman inmate -- Kahkashan, 41; she died on Aprl 29 -- who was admitted to the GTB hospital.Currently there are 49 active cases in the women’s jail, the officers said.There are 16 sub jails under Tihar prisons where nearly 20,500 prisoners are currently lodged. Prison officers said that there are 253 active cases in the prisons system at the moment.Besides 49 women, 204 male prisoners lodged in 16 different jails at Tihar, Rohini and Mandoli campuses have got the infection.There is only one jail for women at the Tihar campus.An officer, who asked not to be named, said, “For some reason, the infection spread rapidly in jail number 6 (women’s jail). We have created a Covid-19 ward inside the women’s jail. Any women prisoner who shows symptoms are not only quarantined or isolated but their health is also monitored at a special ward that has been set up inside jail 6. There are oxygen cylinders too in case of any emergency. Still if anyone is critical, we immediately refer them to hospital.”Last week, the prison administration stopped sending new prisoners directly to jail number 6. Unlike male prisoners who are isolated or put in quarantine within the same complex for at least 14 days, the new women prisoners are first sent to Mandoli jail for 14 days before being brought to Tihar. At Mandoli campus, too, in the last one month, 12 women prisoners have tested positive but many of them recovered or were released after treatment. There are only two active cases of infection in the women’s cell at Mandoli.The prison administration wrote to the Delhi government last week to consider releasing prisoners on parole and special bail, like last year when over 6,000 inmates were released after the pandemic broke out in March.The jail officials said it was important to decongest the prison since there were almost double the number of inmates inside Tihar than the jail’s capacity.Delhi government officials said they were looking into the request.Until April 6, the jail had only 19 cases of Covid-19 among prisoners. In fact in February, there was not a single active case, as the overall positivity rate for Covid-19 in Delhi dropped to 0.17%.As Delhi is going through the fourth wave of the infection now, the positivity rate is hovering around 30%. In February, not a single member of the jail staff was infected.With over 20,500 prisoners at the moment, Tihar holds the highest number of inmates in its history. Experts such as former law officer Sunil Gupta and Ajay Verma have suggested that the government either set up temporary jails in school buildings or release some prisoners who are not a threat.In March last year, the 6,000 prisoners who were released to decongest the prison surrendered over February and March this year to complete their sentences after remaining outside the jail for nearly 11 months||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/covid-spread-in-empty-women-s-cell-takes-tihar-admin-by-surprise-101620153999603.html

So far, the administration has allowed five organisations to set up such facilities.Yashpal Garg, the nodal officer for mini Covid care centres, also allotted the Infosys Red Cross Sarai, Sector 12, to Sri Guru Granth Sahib Society to urgently set up a 100-bed Covid care centre with oxygen facility. On Monday, the society had started a 50-bed centre at Bal Bhawan in Sector 23.Meanwhile, the other four organisations—Sri Sathya Sai Gramin Jagriti, Competent Foundation and Bharat Vikas Parishad, and Be Sure Buddy Private Limited—will be setting similar centres at Badminton Hall, Government Girls Sr. Secondary School, Sector 8-B; Indira Holiday Home, Sector 24; and Aurobindo School, Sector 27A, respectively.The centres will provide doctors, nursing staff and patient-care attendants, who will be available round the clock. Qualified persons will be designated as managers to run the centres.Garg said, “We have put a new condition that at least 80% of beds have to be oxygenated. We will tie up with a vendor to refill them at the same rates being charged from GMCH-32.”Meanwhile, the municipal corporation (MC) has also decided to offer its community centres to set up mini Covid centres. MC commissioner KK Yadav said, “We have been receiving several requests from people for setting up the centres, so we have decided to open up community centres for the purpose.”Any individual, organisation, NGO, religious organisation, corporate, firm or trust can come forward for setting up a mini Covid care centre for asymptomatic positive patients.UT adviser Manoj Parida said, “If the crisis deepens, all three hotels run by CITCO will be converted into Covid hospitals.”“I have been receiving many calls, offering funds for Covid management. My request to donors is to give items like oxygen cylinders, concentrated ventilators, etc, instead,” added Parida.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/more-mini-covid-care-centres-to-come-up-in-chandigarh-101620154098993.html
05-05-2021||Chandigarh||Summer break in Chandigarh’s government schools from May 10||The UT education department has announced the summer vacation for teachers from May 10 to June 8.May 8 and 9 will also be holidays, so the last working day for the teachers will be May 7. The decision comes after a long wait and is being appreciated by the teachers: in 2020, the educators had to take online classes even during the summer vacation, which they will not have to this year.Principals and heads of schools, however, looking after admissions and preparing the Class-10 results will attend school as per requirement. Teachers who will be deputed on Covid duty by the Chandigarh administration will also have to carry them out.President of UT Cadre of Educational Employees’ Union, Swarn Singh Kamboj, said, “Those teachers who are deputed on Covid duty should be given a few extra days off. The department should also provide some support to those teachers on Covid duty in containment zones in case they fall sick.”Meanwhile, city’s private schools will mostly declare summer vacations as per schedule towards the end of May. They will reopen around the second week of July and a call will be taken regarding offline classes for students.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/summer-break-in-chandigarh-s-government-schools-from-may-10-101620153919566.html

Around 300 students occupy hostels in various colleges in the city. However, many of these college students are in the process of shifting to their hometowns.At PEC, of the 300-odd hostellers, only a few remain on campus at present. Also, over 700 students are residing in PU hostels, of which 650 are research scholars.Record of hostellers to be submitted with DHEThe heads of institutions have been asked to take the decision with respect to each student. They have also been advised to maintain a proper record of all hostellers—their names, class, residential address, Aadhaar number—and submit the information to the DHE or to the additional secretary, technical education, by May 4.Covid-19 testing of staff and students staying in hostels has been advised to the institutions. PU has been advised to coordinate with UT director, health services, regarding the testing. Moreover, the heads have been directed to ensure that Covid appropriate behavior is followed at all times.In fresh guidelines issued by PU on April 30, the varsity advised that only those residents/students who have the most essential work related to research should stay on in the hostels. The students were also asked to seek guidance from their chairpersons/supervisors in this regard. In recent days, a few PU hostellers have been found to be Covid-19 positive.PU DSW (women) Sukhbir Kaur said, “Our advice is that, since the infection is spreading fast, those students who do not have any urgent work should return to their families for their own safety and the safety of the others.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/college-varsity-students-in-chandigarh-advised-to-vacate-hostels-101620153799457.html
05-05-2021||Chandigarh||Complaints against mining officer ignored for 3 yrs, says Ropar MLA||A day after the arrests of a woman mining officer and her two aides in a bribery case, Ropar MLA Amarjeet Singh Sandoa claimed that in the past three years, he wrote at least ten letters to the authorities concerned, including the chief minister, complaining about the rampant corruption by the officer, but no action was taken against her.The vigilance bureau on Monday arrested Ropar mining officer Simarpreet Kaur Dhillon, also having additional charge of Mohali stone crushers, mining guard Pal Singh and clerk Aman while taking a bribe of ₹25,000 from the owner of a crusher at Anandpur Sahib. The arrest was made at the district mining office in Phase 7, Mohali.All three were produced before a court on Tuesday, which sent them to three-day police remand.MLA Sandoa said Dhillon used to take bribes from stone crushers in Ropar area on a monthly basis, and if anybody failed to make the payment, she used to seal their units. Her aid Pala Singh used to collect the money. “I have written at least 10 letters to the authorities concerned complaining about her corruption, but no action was taken against her,” he said.Sandoa alleged that she used to take the money in the name of minister and director of the mining department.Last month, Mubarakpur Crushers Association lodged a complaint with the principal secretary (mining) against Dhillon alleging that she along with mining contractors demanded monthly payments from all screening plant and crusher owners in the form of ‘goonda tax’.Association’s vice-president Ranjit Singh Teja said that Dhillon had created terror in the area and was considered the most corrupt person in the department. In December last year, when crusher owners refused to pay her money, she sealed all the screening plants and crushing units in the area. “We were not even able to work,” he said.In 2018, the woman officer had made news after lodging a police complaint against then general manager of the industries department, Tehal Singh Sekhon, for allegedly misbehaving with her. The complaint later turned out to be false. Sekhon retired last year.Deputy superintendent of police (DSP) Ajay Kumar, Mohali vigilance bureau, said, “We are checking her properties and have raided her residence in Sector 51, Chandigarh,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/complaints-against-mining-officer-ignored-for-3-yrs-says-ropar-mla-101620153739704.html
05-05-2021||Delhi||Delhi govt's plan to import oxygen from abroad hits hurdle||The Delhi government’s plan to import 18 cryogenic containers from Bangkok and 21 oxygen generation plants from France has hit a roadblock due to “technical and administrative” reasons, senior government officials said on Tuesday.Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal announced a plan to import these on April 27, as the crippling shortage of medical oxygen came into focus. The state has now put the plan on the back-burner, according to officials who asked not to be named.“The procurement of the tankers has been delayed due to some technical and administrative issues. It is taking longer than what we had anticipated,” a senior government official said on condition of anonymity. The officials, however, did not elaborate on what these technical and administrative issues were.This comes at a time when the Centre has failed to ensure the supply of 700 metric tonne (MT) quota of medical oxygen to the national capital, and the Delhi government has been unable to arrange for cryogenic tankers to pick up supplies, both of which continue to remain key hurdles in ensuring an adequate amount of the medical essential, as hospitals send out desperate appeals for uninterrupted flow to save critically ill patients.Now, to meet the growing oxygen demand in the city, the Delhi government has written to the central government, asking for 50 pressure swing adsorption (PSA) plants for Delhi, even as it continues to look for viable options of sourcing tankers from within India.On Sunday, the central government told the Delhi high court that, on April 26, the Delhi government wrote to the Centre saying it plans to import three cryogenic tankers from Thailand and requested its help to lift those tankers through Indian Air Force aircraft. But, it said that they “never heard anything” from the Delhi government after that, and awaited the request with specific details (like the date of airlifting, bill of loading, etc.) so that the air force planes can be allocated to bring the cryogenic tankers from Bangkok.“Till date, the Central government has not received any communication regarding the import of containers,” it told the court.Delhi government spokespersons did not comment on the matter.A second senior Delhi government officer said the administration is now looking at sourcing tankers from within the country.“We have made several attempts -- some have been successful, while others have failed. We have been able to procure at least five tankers on our own so far. The central government has given seven. Apart from this, the oxygen suppliers are also arranging tankers on their own. Many companies are also helping us,” said the official.In an email to HT, oxygen supplier Linde South Asia said it was using 18 tankers (2,000 gallons each) which can transport 8.65 MT of liquid medical oxygen (LMO). It is also using 5 T-75 ISO tankers that transport 20MT of LMO. It further said it has also converted a number of liquid argon and liquid nitrogen road tankers into liquid oxygen service to boost the supply chain.“Linde was the first to suggest the idea of renting ISO tanks from the international market to de-bottleneck the LOX (liquid oxygen) supply chain. In collaboration with our sponsors Tata Steel and ITC, Linde has been bringing such rented ISO tanks by air into the country… In collaboration with Indian Railways, Linde has further set up a railway delivery system for high speed delivery of LOX from Eastern India to Delhi. This has been tried for the first time in this country, and till Monday, 2 such rakes each capable of carrying 120 MT LOX and 1 rake capable of carrying 80 MT LOX have already been deployed and more will be deployed in the days to come,” the company said.Oxygen plants at Delhi hospitalsSenior government officials said that two of the four PSA oxygen plants being set up by DRDO are going to be operational by Wednesday. Apart from this, in 10 days, Delhi has set up PSA oxygen plants in at least four state-run hospitals, taking the total number of Delhi government hospitals having oxygen generation plants to five.These hospitals are Burari hospital, Deen Dayal Upadhyay (DDU) hospital, Lok Nayak hospital, Baba Saheb Ambedkar hospital in Rohini and Sanjay Gandhi Memorial hospital.The plant at Sanjay Gandhi Memorial hospital was set up on Tuesday and deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia said it will be operationalised from Wednesday. It is one of the four small-sized oxygen generation plants donated by France. The other three have been used at BLK Hospital, Haryana Super Specialty Hospital and state-run Ambedkar Hospital.In a statement issued on Tuesday, the defence ministry said two of the four plants to be set up by DRDO have reached Delhi and are being installed at AIIMS (main) and RML hospital, respectively.While these two will be ready by Wednesday, the other two will be set up by May 10. These are to be installed at AIIMS Trauma Centre, Dr Ram Manohar Lohia Hospital (RML), Safdarjung Hospital, Lady Hardinge Medical College and one at AIIMS, Jhajjar, Haryana.

As per the same, each state had to put out in public domain details of bed occupancy in government/private hospitals, availability of oxygen, drugs, vaccine and vaccination centres, remdesivir and tocilizumab.The court was also told that availability of beds in various government and private hospitals is limited. As a result, some patients have to stay at home. In the eventuality of needing oxygen support, they have to purchase the same from the open market. However, it is not easily available.UT’s senior standing counsel Pankaj Jain had assured the court that in case of any such problem, the SDM of the zone concerned in every sector shall be asked to step in to help the patients who are on oxygen support at home. One dedicated zone-wise phone line shall be allocated and widely publicised by way of broadcast on radio, television and assistance of telephone companies, he had said.The court directed that SDMs be asked to pitch in to monitor the situation and in case there is disobedience of court orders, it would take punitive action.The UT has also told the court that it has added 121 beds to its 692-capacity to deal with Covid and also sought 20 more ventilators from the Centre against the existing strength of 126. Current quota of oxygen to UT is 20 metric tonnes and Centre would be requested to increase it, in case more demand is reported, the court was told.The report given before the HC reveals that in PGIMER Covid facility, there are only 77 patients from Chandigarh. Maximum number patients (104) are from Punjab, 59 from Haryana, 22 from Himachal Pradesh, 20 from Uttar Pradesh, 14 from Delhi and 19 patients from other places.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/hc-seeks-chandigarh-s-reply-on-covid-bed-occupancy-data-101620153619008.html
05-05-2021||Other||Tackling the oxygen crisis: As people gasp, waiting time to install O2 plants goes up||The state government is approving applications seeking to set up oxygen plants on a priority. But due to the ever-increasing demand, the waiting time to install plants has gone up. This is due to a dearth of technical experts and skilled workforce required to set up such plants. Till April the state government had approved 54 applications seeking permission to set up oxygen plants. On state government’s request, the micro small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) sector has come forward to set up Oxygen plants. It is also willing to assist the government in setting up medical oxygen plants in 47 districts of the state which have been sanctioned by the PM under the PM-Cares Fund, set up last year to collect donations to battle Covid-19. “The demand for technical experts and skilled workforce required to set up Oxygen plants has increased manifold across the country, including Uttar Pradesh, since March-April. As the demand has gone up, skilled workforce is scarce,” said Pankaj Kumar, president, Indian Industries Association. “The waiting time to start a project (oxygen plant) has gone up by two-and-a-half months. Companies in the business of installing oxygen plants are flooded with orders,” said Manmohan Agarwal, senior vice-president, IIA. The IIA has requested the state government to set up a help desk dedicated only for oxygen plant projects and make available latest technology for setting up these plants. The MSMEs of Uttar Pradesh have also requested the state government to make available to them the DRDO’s latest technology relating to liquid oxygen plants. “The DRDO has the latest technology of liquid oxygen plants. We have requested the state government to make available this technology to us and required skilled workforce to set up oxygen plants,” said Kumar. Most oxygen plants being installed in the state are directly sourced from companies in the business of installing oxygen plants. “There are around seven or eight big companies that install readymade oxygen plants. These companies assemble oxygen plants on-site,” said Atul Bhushan Gupta, vice-president, IIA. “Now, due to manifold increase in demand of Oxygen plants there is a waiting time of two-and-a-half months if you place an order today for installing a plant,” Gupta added. “Another way to install an oxygen plant is to procure all parts and material required yourself. But only those who have full knowledge about oxygen plants can adopt this method. It also time consuming,” said Gupta. Also, individual efforts are also being made. Industrialist RK Chaudhary of Varanasi has donated an oxygen plant to Deen Dayal Upadhaya Government Hospital. The plant has a capacity to generate 650 litres of oxygen per minute. “The plant was purchased from Airox Technologies Pvt Limited, Aurangabad. It has started operating from April 29,” said Chaudhary. Rohit Maheshwari, owner of the Maheshwari Gas Pvt Ltd, Meerut, started operating his plant from last week. It has the capacity to refill around 1,000 jumbo oxygen cylinders daily. Meanwhile, the IIA is also in the process of procuring 12 oxygen plants from Russia with the help of state government. “Negotiations will start soon to purchase 12 oxygen plants from Russia,” Kumar said. What happened to the 42 O2 plants sanctioned in 2018?Uttar Pradesh could have easily warded off the present crisis, had not the government’s 2018 plan to set up oxygen plants in 42 government hospitals across the state, hit a bureaucratic hurdle. In the 2018 budget, the government had sanctioned ₹200 crore to set up oxygen plants in 42 government hospitals across the state, each plant with a capacity of 2000 MTD. The completion year was 2019. Among these hospitals, four were in the state capital, including Jhalkari Bai, Civil Hospital, Bhaurao Deoras Hospital and Thakurganj Hospital. But the project is yet to take off after a controversy over the health department’s tendering process.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/tackling-the-oxygen-crisis-as-people-gasp-waiting-time-to-install-o2-plants-goes-up-101620153378346.html

The group is also trying to give pointers on what to do and what not to in case someone begins to show Covid-19-like symptoms. The volunteers try to promote home remedies to keep Covid-19 at bay. The awareness drive has been launched at the initiative of the Banwasi Seva Ashram’s senior functionary, Shubha Bahan, said Jagat Vishwakarma, who is leading the team of volunteers. A WhatsApp group has been created for every 10 people possessing android phones in around 15 villages in remote areas. Each group has a volunteer. Each volunteer has circulated these home remedies, Vishwakarma said. Vishwakarma said that home remedies include taking steam, gargling thrice with lukewarm water and a pinch of salt, applying pure mustard oil on nostrils, chewing mulethi (Glycyrrhiza glabra), clove or misri (rock sugar) in case of sore throat, making a decoction of large cardamom, cinnamon and black pepper with spices and taking it twice daily. Every member of the house should take decoction in these days. Further, people are advised not to roam outside the house in case of fever, cold, cough or sneezing, and to avoid crowded places. If you have a cold, cough, fever, diarrhoea, vomiting, weakness, redness in the eyes, headache, difficulty in breathing, consult a doctor without wasting time. Without consulting doctors, do not take medicines. Keep paracetamol at home and take it in case of fever. It can be taken at an interval of eight hours. If fever remains for more than 24 hours, consult a doctor and have yourself tested, he added. The literate youths read out the message for the elderly and appeal to them to follow the advice. Volunteers have forwarded the remedies on WhatsApp groups in villages, including Jigan Tola, Ahir Budhwa, Manrutola, Kudpana, Faripan, Purvi Deohar, Manbasa, Jharo, and Jharo Khas, Majhauli. Volunteer Raghunath Bhai said, “We also demonstrate how to take steam after boiling water in a mid-size bowl.” The volunteers appealed to the people not to fall in trap of exorcists in case of ailments. Only take medicines by consulting doctors, they exhort.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/whatsapparmed-youth-create-awareness-among-sonbhadra-tribals-101620153198406.html

05-05-2021||Mumbai||Covid oxygen clinics for hsg societies?||To provide quick and timely care to symptomatic patients with oxygen requirements, the public health department has recommended setting up of Covid oxygen clinics in large housing societies, which can be manned by neighbourhood doctors. Adult residents, who are mostly home owing to the state-wide lockdown, can also volunteer. The idea is stabilising home-isolated patients in need of oxygen, until they get a bed in a hospital. The public health department has observed that only 9-10% infected patients require hospitalisation. The remaining patients can be provided care in home isolation or nearby Covid Care Centres (CCC). With most facilities having run out of beds, the public health department has mooted a unique concept of a ‘community model’ that will help reduce the burden on the already overwhelmed healthcare facilities. Currently, over 650,000 active Covid-19 patients are under treatment. To provide care and timely treatment, there is a need to establish one Covid-19 clinic per 25,000 people. Along with this, there would be a need for oxygen supply under a medical personnel. With this in mind, Dr Pradip Awate, state surveillance officer of the department, has submitted a ‘macro management’ proposal to the state health ministry for better handling of Covid-19 patients with local help. “These centres can run around-the-clock with the help of nearby doctors or members from the Indian Medical Association. Many college-going students, teachers and retired persons who are mostly home owing to the state-wide lockdown can work as volunteers. As this clinic will be established per 25,000-30,000 people at the level of electoral wards, home-isolated patients who will need oxygen, will be greatly benefitted until they get their bed,” said Dr Awate. The decision about admission in this clinic will be taken based on the minimum required tests done of all home-isolated patients. Suggestions have also been put forward to convert two-four-bedded small hospitals, day care and clinics to such make-shift centres. Citizens can be informed about it through social media. “When the infection burden is low, these teams can be trained online, and their doubts and difficulties can be addressed. Various local organisations such as Rotary and Lions clubs among others, local doctors’ organisations, police officers, business persons and locally influential people can be involved in the management of these centres. The management will help reduce the current burden on hospitals significantly,” he added. Dr Awate has also suggested establishing village CCC for mildly symptomatic patients, who don’t have the space for isolation. “Village CCC can be established at the level of sub-centre or other central locations of bigger villages such as marketplace and gram panchayat building, among others. This way, 30-50 CCCs of 10-20 beds each can be started in each block,” he said. These centres can be run by local private doctors, staff nurses, anganwadi and ASHA workers. “We have submitted the proposals to the health ministry. We are waiting for the final approval,” he added. Dr Deepak Baid, former president, Association of Medical Consultants, didn’t agree with the suggestion. He claimed a similar suggestion was made last year by the BMC, but the doctors opposed the concept. “A patient with low oxygen saturation doesn’t only need oxygen, but depending on their health, there are other requirements too. Who will provide such medication to patients? This is not a medically fit suggestion and should be avoided,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/covid-oxygen-clinics-for-hsg-societies-101620153138990.html

Fortunately, another Nashik type oxygen leakage disaster was averted after the alert medical staff acted on time. Twenty-two Covid-19 patients – 11 men and 11 women – died of oxygen deprivation in Nashik on April 21 after an oxygen tank leak led to the malfunctioning of ventilators and oxygen support equipment at Dr Zakir Hussain Hospital. Confirming the incident, Dr Ramdas Marad, nodal officer and medical superintendent of Rural Hospital, Jawhar said, “There was a leakage in the tanker and there were 90 patients on oxygen. My medical staff immediately connected spare oxygen cylinders so that the oxygen supply is constant. We have 150 oxygen cylinders in our hospital and that came in handy.” The leakage was reported in a valve in the jumbo oxygen tank installed in February. “We also informed the technician of the agency who installed the jumbo tanker. They arrived within an hour and the leakage was fixed,” said Dr Marad.The 250-bed government hospital has 302 Covid patients admitted, of which 90 are on oxygen support.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/oxygen-leak-at-palghar-hosp-fixed-in-time-101620153138365.html

For the second day in a row, Mumbai reported less than 3,000 cases. On Monday, Mumbai had recorded 2,624 cases, lowest since March 17, when it reported 2,377 cases. The testing was much low compared to previous days. Mumbai on Monday conducted 29,706 tests, lower than the average number of tests it conducted daily in April, at around 50,000. The active Covid-19 cases in Mumbai are down by 38.9% since mid-April. Over the past week, Mumbai has reported an average of 3,500 Covid-19 cases per day. Active cases have now dropped to 56,465, from the highest of 92,464 in mid-April, according to data from the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC). The decline in number of cases has also improved availability of Covid beds in Mumbai. Municipal commissioner Iqbal Singh Chahal on Tuesday said, “Our city has 7,409 Covid beds vacant today, including 100 ICU at 6:13pm.” Of the 12,183 oxygen beds, 2,428 are available; of the 7,082 non-oxygen beds, 4,348 are available; 14 ventilator beds are available out of 1,467 total ventilator beds, and 86 ICU beds are available out of 1,423 available ICU beds, Chahal said. The daily positivity rate has decreased by more than half. On Tuesday, it was 8.5% as opposed to 18-19% reported mid-April. So far, Mumbai has conducted a total of 5,542,859 tests with an overall positivity rate of 11.89%. Positivity rate is the number of positive cases reported as a per cent of total number of tests done. The growth rate of Covid cases in Mumbai is 0.58%, and the doubling rate has increased to 116 days, up from as low as 35 days reported in April. Doubling rate is the number of days hypothetically needed for the present number of cases to double, based on the growth rate of cases over seven days. The highest growth rate in Covid cases has been reported in North Mumbai, in wards corresponding to Borivli, Andheri East, Bandra East, and Kandivali. The lowest growth rate has been reported in Marine lines and Girgaum area of South Mumbai, Chembur, Mulund and Vikhroli.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-sees-2-554-new-cases-active-cases-dip-101620153078934.html

We have been able to bring down the numbers in 15 districts, but the cases continue to rise in 21 districts. Our main target is to bring down these numbers.” The state government has imposed a stricter curfew in six districts—Baramati, Sangli, Satara, Ahmednagar, Kolhapur and Beed – which have been witnessing an increase in Covid-19 cases. Tope justified stricter lockdown saying it was needed to bring down the cases. “There is definitely a lockdown in place, but this will be stricter,” said Tope. Due to the spike, these districts have been facing a shortage of hospital beds, ventilators as well as medicines like Remdesivir. Currently, the state needs approximately 40,000 oxygen concentrators, of which 20,000 will be provided to the state. Dr Ishwar Gilada, secretary general, Organised Medicine Academic Guild, said the problem is twofold in these 24 districts. “It has been observed that people there are very casual and some even don’t wear masks. For them, even lockdowns don’t matter. The second factor is this current mutant is highly infectious and it has been transmitting at a breakneck speed,” said Gilada. Tope also said the positivity rate dropped to 22% from 27%. “Our recovery rate of 84.07 % has been the highest in the country and better than that of the country which stands at 81%,” said Tope. The state has demanded an additional 200 metric tonnes supply of oxygen as 78,884 patients were occupying oxygen beds, while 24,787 were in intensive care units (ICU). The state procured 900,000 vaccines from the Central government on Tuesday which were used to vaccinate citizens above the age of 45 years, while the state has issued orders for purchasing 1,800,000 vaccine doses for those in the 18-44 years age group. The total number of active patients in Maharashtra currently stands at 641,910, while the total number of deaths right from the Covid-19 outbreak has now reached 71,742. There are currently 641,910 active patients across the state, of which Pune tops with 109,531 patients, followed by Nagpur with 64,554 active patients. The death toll has now reached 71,742, with Mumbai leading with 13,434 deaths, followed by Pune with 9,770.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/21-maha-dists-a-worry-strict-curbs-in-six-101620153078324.html
05-05-2021||Mumbai||Man stopped for flouting lockdown norms, kidnaps cop in his car, arrested||A 21-year-old student of Bachelor of Ayurvedic Medicine and Surgery (BAMS) from Sewri has been arrested by the police as he allegedly kidnapped a policeman in his car after he was stopped at a nakabandi for not wearing a mask and stepping out of home unnecessarily during the lockdown. The incident took place when the student, Cyrus Saldhana, had stepped out in the wee hours of Monday and was returning home.The police stopped his car during the nakabandi at the Milan Junction on the freeway as he was not wearing a mask. When constable Kundansingh Thakar, 41, asked him why has he ventured out during lockdown, Saldhana could not give a satisfactory answer.Following this, the police decided to take action against him. Thakar sat in his car and asked him to drive the vehicle to the police station.“The accused instead of driving the vehicle to Govandi police station took the freeway bridge and stopped the car only near Wadala station, covering a distance of almost 8 kilometres. Thakar informed his colleague and Saldhana was arrested on charges of kidnapping,” said Balasaheb Kedare, senior inspector of Govandi police station. The police have booked Saldhana under sections 365 (kidnapping a person with intent to cause that person to be secretly and wrongfully confined), 353 (obstructing public servant from discharging his duty) 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant) and 269 (negligent act to spread the infection of any disease dangerous to life) of the Indian Penal Code. Saldhana was produced before a court and remanded in magistrate custody, said Kedare.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/man-stopped-for-flouting-lockdown-norms-kidnaps-cop-in-his-car-arrested-101620153018345.html

The complaints were made for different portals like checking Covid test reports, bed trackers and allotments, and general helplines among others.Pradeep Kumar, a resident of Sector 39, said, “We are five in a family, including myself. We had developed Covid-19 symptoms and got our tests done four days later, on May 1. We are still waiting for our reports. We had tried reaching the persons concerned on the link: https://onemapggm.gmda.gov.in and were told that we can download a copy of the report, but I didn’t even get the OTP. I tried the helpline number as well, but either it was busy or the executives there guided us back to the portal with very less information.”Another resident, requesting anonymity, said, “I had registered for a bed at the district administration’s portal on April 26 for my uncle, whose oxygen level had been dropping continuously. We tried everywhere but were unable to find a bed for four days, even after registering on the portal. I just received a call, informing me that I will be directed to a hospital, but I did not get any response after that... My uncle died on Monday.”Vinay Singh, who was looking for an oxygen bed for a relative on Tuesday evening, said, “I have been trying to contact all possible helpline numbers since the morning, but did not get any help. Either some of the numbers were switched off or busy or the executives said they will get back to me. We don’t have time, so now we are trying to get a bed through social media.”Out of 43 hospitals in the district, no oxygen, ventilator or ICU beds were available in Gurugram as of Tuesday night, as per the district portal.Meanwhile, Prashant Panwar, additional deputy commissioner, Gurugram, said despite shortage of beds, the bed management team in the district has been continuously monitoring the situation, and directing patients to the hospitals. “We understand there is a shortage of beds and delay in response, but all requests on different portals are being directed to the respective teams, especially for bed management. We have also requested patients’ families not to wait to find beds till the situation gets critical, and they must directly approach hospitals. Our bed management team is also continuously monitoring patients,” Panwar said.Munish Sharma, nodal officer for bed management, Gurugram, said, “We were able to update the portal real time even a week ago, but now, with the rise in the cases, patients are seen waiting outside hospitals as beds are being occupied immediately. We have asked hospitals to check which patients actually need hospitalisation. It is not that we cannot increase the bed supply, but everything is dependent on the oxygen supply, which is also being increased gradually.”Gurugram reported 4,475 fresh Covid-19 cases and 11 deaths on Tuesday. There are 37,708 active cases in the district, and the recovery rate is 72.33%, while the fatality rate is 0.38%.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/residents-allege-long-wait-time-on-helplines-101620152178296.html
05-05-2021||Gurugram||Vegetable prices to be shared with residents to curb overcharging in Gurugram||Following complaints of vegetables and fruits being sold at inflated prices since a lockdown was imposed, the Haryana State Agricultural Market Board (HSAMB) has set a price list and will provide residents with a platform to report overcharging. Officials said that a wholesale and retail price list will be released on Wednesday morning and the same will be shared with RWA groups and on social media platforms.HSAMB officials dismissed concerns over low stocks and said that vendors are hiking prices to make a quick buck amid the lockdown. Officials said they received several complaints and teams were sent to Basai Road and Sector 4 to check for instances of overpricing. “Teams for inspection have been constituted by HSAMB and they visited few retailers, local vendors, and shopkeepers in a few parts of the city today for taking a stock of the on-ground situation. On Wednesday, the teams will be initiating enforcement measures across the city through random checks as well as checking tip-offs from residents and RWAs about vegetables and fruits being sold at inflated rates,” said Vinay Yadav, secretary, HSAMB.Officials said that the price list will have the maximum and minimum prices of at least 25 common fruits and vegetables per kilogram. It will also mention contact details for residents to lodge complaints of overcharging by vendors, local shopkeepers or other retailers.The district administration also issued a release late Tuesday, stating that action will be taken against violators , under the Essential Commodities Act, 1955, if food and essential items are sold at a price higher prices. Officials said that a hyper mart in Sector 48 was penalised on Tuesday.HSAMB comes under the ambit of the district administration in Gurugram.“The lockdown has been imposed to prevent the spread of Covid-19. The public will not be disturbed by the availability of essential commodities in any way. There is complete monitoring of black marketing by the district administration, while essential items such as packed company items cannot be sold at rates higher than maxium retail price (MRP). The district administration will deal strictly with those who do so. Buyers should also take care and complain about the rates charged above MRP on 9999097004,” said Dr Yash Garg, deputy commissioner.The city has been under a lockdown since Friday night. Initially, the state government announced a weekend curfew in nine districts of Haryana that had the highest number of Covid-19 cases, including Gurugram. On Sunday, the government announced a lockdown for the entire state till May 10 morning.Due to the lockdown and their inability to venture outdoors, many residents are relying on local vendors and shopkeepers for fruits and vegetables.Tanuja Kumar, a resident of Sector 53, said that she purchased onions from her local vegetable seller at ₹60 per kilogram, more than double the market rates. As per the price list of HSAMB, a copy of which is with HT, the maximum retail price for onions is ₹17-22.“Even though my local vegetable seller is selling items at steep prices, the fact that I cannot venture outdoors due to the lockdown leaves me with little choice but to rely on him for daily fruits and vegetables. It has started affecting my family’s daily expenses. If the state government decides to extend the lockdown, I will have to look for alternatives,” said Kumar.Yadav said that the rationale behind issuing a price list and circulating it among residents is to inform them about the actual prices of vegetables and fruits and to determine whether they are being sold at the correct prices or inflated rates. “Although we are yet to receive any formal complaint in writing, we have been verbally informed by a few residents, RWAs, and officials of the inflated rates at which fruits and vegetables are being sold in different parts of the city. Our teams will be initially concentrating on such locations and then act on any new complaints received from residents,” said Yadav.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/veggie-prices-to-be-shared-with-residents-to-curb-overcharging-101620152118328.html
05-05-2021||Mumbai||Maha to resume vaccination for 45+||After three days of vaccinating fewer than 100,000 adults, including the newly-added category of 18-44 years, Maharashtra received 900,000 doses of vaccines on Tuesday afternoon from the Centre and is set to resume its vaccination for 45 years and above starting today.“Till Monday we were left with only 25,000 to 30,000 doses under the national vaccination drive being run by the Centre for 45 years and above population and hence most of the centres were shut. This is despite Maharashtra’s capacity of vaccinating up to 800,000 beneficiaries a day. Only this afternoon, we have got around 900,000 doses of Covishield from the Centre, which will now be distributed across districts to resume the drive again,” said state health minister Rajesh Tope on Tuesday.Maharashtra also hit a milestone of administering the first jab of 100,000 beneficiaries in the 18-44 age group whose vaccination began from May 1. The state has vaccinated 45% of the 45+ age group, since the inoculation began from April 1, the health minister said. “We have also covered 100,000 beneficiaries under the 18-44 age group in four days and covered 45% of the total population that comes under 45 years and above the age group. Till date, the state has vaccinated 16.5 million of beneficiaries from 45 years and above age group,” Tope said on Tuesday.Maharashtra is also one the states with the lowest vaccine wastage in the country, according to figures released by the union ministry on Tuesday. Out of the 16.36 million doses of vaccines supplied to state till date, its wastage was only 0.22%. Compared to Maharashtra, Haryana had a wastage rate of 5.72%, Assam of 7.7%, Lakshadweep of 9.71%, Tamil Nadu of 8.83%, Uttar Pradesh of 3.54% and Gujarat of 3.61%. The national vaccination drive was started on January 16 among priority categories which initially included health care and frontline workers and was extended to include senior citizens above 60 years. In all, 2.4 million citizens have been vaccinated in Mumbai alone.Several centres across the state were shut for the third day in a row causing worry among senior citizens who are up for their second jab of either Covishield or Covaxin. On Tuesday, only 26,944 were vaccinated in Mumbai, for instance. The state’s highest one-day inoculation figure was 534,228 doses, administered on April 26. Since then, its numbers have steadily dropped to 47,613 on May 2 and 78,759 on May 3, according to figures on the CoWIN portal.According to a release issued by the ministry of health and family welfare on May 1, the state would receive 2,327,510 doses (1,750,620 of Covishield and 576,890 of Covaxin) from the Centre for the first fortnight in May.In addition, it will receive 1.8 million doses from Serum Institute of India (which manufactures Covishield) and Bharat Biotech (which has made and produces Covaxin) and has received only 300,000, with which it was able to begin the third phase of the inoculation drive (18- 44 years) in a limited way (five centres in each district).“We have also issued purchase orders of over 1.87 million doses (1,381,581 doses of Covishield and 489,150 of Covaxin) for this month for the drive started for 18-44 group. With 300,000 doses the drive was started on May 1 and district administrations have been asked to cover seven days with the existing stock. By that time, we are expecting to get the rest of the stock ordered by the state,” Tope said.“As the stock is received, we immediately dispatch them to the respective districts so that the drive need not be discontinued. From tomorrow, the drive is expected to be resumed at most of the centres,” a senior official, privy to the development, said.The government set a target of completing the drive for all adults in six months and wanted to procure 15 million every month but both the firms — SII and Bharat Biotech — have said that their production will increase in the next two months, after which the supply to the state will be more regular. “They have said that their production is expected to increase in June and July and they will be able to increase the supply of the state subsequently,” said a senior official, privy to the development.Tope said, “The state government wants to buy the entire stock of 120 million doses in one go but are struggling to get the doses due to its unavailability in the market.”Expanding the nationwide drive, the Centre threw open vaccination for all adults from May 1, asking the states to inoculate the 18-44 age group by procuring doses from the open market.According to the state government figures, 60 million of its population comes under the age group of 18-44 and thus will require 120 million doses to get them immunized from the virus. It has already declared to provide free doses of the vaccine for all the adults at government run centres. The decision was taken in the state cabinet meeting held on Wednesday. For this, it has estimated a spending of ₹6,500 crore.“Vaccination drive of the state got a setback as the Centre is unable to supply vaccines in adequate quantity. We had prepared and ramped up the drive to inoculate over 500,000 a day and wanted to increase it further but going by the supply getting from the Centre it may not happen in the near future,” said a senior official, requesting anonymity.Last month, union minister Prakash Javadekar had said that Maharashtra government was playing politics over the allotment of vaccine stock. “Maharashtra Govt should not play politics over vaccination. Here are the facts: Total number of COVID vaccine supplied to State till date - 1,06,19,190; Consumption - 90,53,523 (of which 6% wastage - over 5L) Vaccine in pipeline - 7,43,280. Dosage available - nearly 23 lakh,” he tweeted on April 7.As per the Central government’s figures, Maharashtra’s wastage of vaccines – which could occur on account of multiple factors such as not having access to a beneficiary after a vial has been opened (once opened, vials need to be used immediately given the temperature requirements) – comes to 35,992 doses.On Tuesday, Maharashtra Congress general secretary and spokesperson Sachin Sawant said that Javadekar should apologize for his earlier claims. “Javadekarji’s falsehood has been exposed by the central government’s press note as the wastage is not 6% and is just 0.22%. The union minister has insulted Maharashtra by spreading wrong information for the sake of politics,” he said.BJP’s media cell chief Vishwas Pathak said, “Public health minister Rajesh Tope says that Maharashtra has trained manpower in healthcare sector, and they can ramp up daily inoculation to 1.2 million doses. Then why is there wastage of 600,000 doses? In percentage it may be less, but the wastage of such a huge stock when there was acute shortage, is not acceptable.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maha-to-resume-vaccination-for-45-101620151938291.html
05-05-2021||Pune||Dive into the past: Tilak tank swims into the future with a 100-year heritage of sports service||The Lokmanya Tilak swimming tank in Pune was an old stone quarry with some natural springs when it was inaugurated on April 30, 1922. In its centenary year, Punekars recall some fond memories of the tank that has trained many swimmers. The Tilak tank hosted crowd-puller water polo matches that were so popular that they were advertised outside colleges in the city. “This tank came into being for the erstwhile Deccan Gymkhana which was established in 1906. The gymkhana officials dreamt of sending Indian athletes to the Olympics,” said Amit Golwalkar, secretary of the Tilak tank. A meeting about this dream was held at Deccan gymkhana with its members and Sir Dorabjee Tata who wanted to send Indian athletes to the 1920 Antwerp Olympics. With the help of leased land belonging to Shirole Patil a colony was built to cover the cost of constructing an Olympic size pool. The old stone quarry was used to get the stones to build this colony of bungalows surrounding the gymkhana, thus using the quarry to create the swimming pool. The mine had natural water and on the day of Gudi Padva on April 30, 1922, it was inaugurated by NC Kelkar, who was the then president of Poona Municipality. “The water was green in colour and initially people were afraid of getting into the deep end, but the attraction of swimming in an Olympic size pool was so much that parents would come along to see their children swim,” said Kalpana Agashe. Kalpana was around 4-years old when her father and her elder brother taught her how to swim. She went on to become a national swimming champion and later a coach for Vimlabai Garware school and now has her own students. “Whenever it rained, students would avoid coming to tank since it was open to air and had crude steps and border. That was the time for all the water lovers, coaches’ juniors and seniors to play volleyball with the half team in water and others on sides, or even hold relay swims. We had a lot of fun,” Agashe said. But what attracted a lot of people to the tank were the water polo matches which had the most audience during that time. “I was part of water polo and I remember that posters would be put outside colleges to advertise these matches and the Tilak tank would be fully surrounded from all sides, with people shouting, ‘shoot the ball’,” recalls Golwalkar. For veteran swimmer and coach Sham Karandikar, Tilak tank has some fantastic memories. “I was coaching at the tank for 25 years from 1977 to 2001 and used to swim regularly. The green water of the pool would often make people cringe at going into the deep which was around 7 feet or more and then there was a diving area of more than 15 feet deep. There was even a cement slide that students often enjoyed, some of the parents would be afraid of sitting on the steps then as there were many snakes in the crevices, but the love for swimming made people come every day. This was one of the biggest pools of 100 metres length,” said Karandikar. The current Tilak tank is an upgraded version of the earlier version which housed an olympic size pool of 50 metres with eight lanes and charged only ₹2 as fees. Now, the tank has 1,500 permanent members and a floating population in the summer which bring in around ₹60 to 70 lakhs in revenue. Latest upgradations The pool has been upgraded and offers a variety of sizes; an Olympic size of 50 metres and eight lanes, a mini short course, a newly built 25 metres pool with eight lanes, a baby pool of 25 metres with four lanes and a special walking pool of 20 metres by three metres for aqua therapy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/dive-into-the-past-tilak-tank-swims-into-the-future-with-a-100-year-heritage-of-sports-service-101620144617859.html

From Wednesday, the Agricultural Produce Market Committee (APMC), municipal commissioner and Pune Police are going to conduct inquiries about hawkers who have encroached on this footpath,” said Madhukant Garad, administrator and secretary, APMC, Market Yard, Gultekdi Pune.In the past as well, APMC have tried to bar hawkers from standing on the footpath.“There are many who are from the Pardhi community who to fight if you conduct an inquiry,” Garad added.Within the premises, a huge crowd gathers on Monday and Friday, with Market Yard closed on the weekends.“Tuesday to Thursday there is a very decent crowd in Market Yard, with 50 per cent shops closed and all rules followed. Only on Monday and Friday social distancing norms are not followed by the buyers,” said Rupesh Paygude, who runs a vegetable retail shop in Warje.Vegetable vendor Sanjay Dhote, who was standing on the footpath said, “APMC should have allowed us to stand inside then on the footpath. Where should we go to sell the vegetables, if not on the footpath.”Since April 20, Market Yard has not allowed hawkers within the premises.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/crowds-vendors-on-footpath-outside-market-yard-defy-covid-norms-101620141258869.html

As a result, the number of accidents on the expressway has also dropped for 2020 and 2021, as compared to earlier years. As per data shared by the Highway State Police, Pune division, in January to April 2021, saw a total of 62 accidents took place on the eway, with 29 commuters losing their lives. In all of 2020, the e-way saw a total of 203 accidents with 81 fatalities. Last year, during lockdown, the e-way was open only for vehicles providing essential goods and services. This year, only commuters with proper an e-pass issued by the police can use the e-way.Sanjay Jadhav, superintendent, of Police, highway police, said, “Several initiatives have been taken on the expressway to reduce the accidents.One of them is taking action on speeding vehicles. At various spots police are deployed and round-the-clock vigilance is kept on the e-way for emergencies. Also, heavy vehicles are told to compulsorily travel in the left lane at a slow speed. Those not following the rules are penalised,” “We mainly focused on speed and seat-belts on the e-way to curb the accidents. Also the response time of our team increased during this period,” he added. Tanmay Pendse, an activist working for the safety of people using the expressway, said, “Due to the strict restrictions imposed in the state and the overall Covid situation the traffic is less on the highway this year. Also the highway police team has helped curb accidents.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/covid-lockdowns-cause-drastic-drop-in-accidents-on-pune-mum-eway-101620139277426.html
05-05-2021||World||India-UK mobility agreement addresses issue of illegal migrants||The migration and mobility partnership (MMP) agreement signed by India and the UK has helped address an irritant in bilateral relations by setting down processes for the return of illegal migrants from Britain, people familiar with developments said on Wednesday. Negotiations on the MMP, crucial for ensuring greater access to the UK for skilled Indian professionals, had been underway for some time and the memorandum of understanding was signed by external affairs minister S Jaishankar and UK home secretary Priti Patel on Tuesday, coinciding with the India-UK Summit. The MMP will facilitate legal movement of students and professionals and enhance bilateral cooperation to combat illegal migration. It also created a new scheme whereby up to 3,000 young Indian professionals can avail employment opportunities in the UK every year for a period of two years. The agreement was a “good step forward” to address an “irritant” in bilateral ties, the people cited above said on condition of anonymity. The British side had been insisting in the past on the return of illegal migrants to India, while the Indian side had said adequate time was needed to comprehensively confirm the identity and nationality of such persons, the people said. “Now, a compromise or a process solution has been found, and this will address certain misunderstandings, such as a perception that the Indian side didn’t want to take back the illegal migrants,” said one of the people cited above. British high commissioner Alex Ellis told a virtual news briefing on Wednesday that the MMP has mechanisms and timelines for the return of illegal migrants and doesn’t set any targets. “You need to have efficient mechanisms...If you look at the MMP, it sets timelines by which you have to achieve some parts of the processes,” he said. The MMP also specifies the documentation that can be used to prove the Indian nationality of the illegal migrants, he said. The British side wants to address the return of illegal migrants “as swiftly as is legally correct and possible to do”, he added. “Our aim is to have a flow of talented people between the two countries and...India is by far the biggest user of work visas, of any country in the world, for the UK. Nearly 50% of all work visas go to Indian nationals,” Ellis said. Referring to the MMP facilitating the entry of up to 3,000 young professionals every year, Ellis said: “India is the first visa national country with whom we have offered that partnership.” Under the agreement, Indian nationals who are undocumented, in distress abroad or are not being given nationality or residence permits have to be taken back.

A warmer world could mean more snowfall, but it could also mean more melt at the side of the icesheet."The calculations showed a 95 percent chance that Antarctica would contribute less than 56 centimetres to sea level rise by 2100.But under a "pessimistic scenario", the study showed, Antarctica could raise global oceans by more than that even if humanity manages to cap warming at 1.5°C.'Irreversible' meltA second study, also published Wednesday in Nature, found that limiting warming to 2C above industrial levels was likely to maintain the current rate of ice melt in Antarctica.However, if current emissions-cutting pledges are not intensified by 2060, the models showed that the continent could contribute half a centimetre to sea levels every year by 2100.Furthermore, the study warned that if emissions continue at their current levels, a tipping point will be reached around 2060 which would lead to Antarctic melt that would be "irreversible on multi-century timescales".The research, led by a team from the University of Massachusetts Amherst, modelled how the ice shelves that keep the Antarctic ice sheet from collapsing into the sea were likely to respond to temperature changes this century.With greater warming, the ice shelves thin and become more fragile, the models showed, risking accelerated melt from the ice sheet, as well as "calving", which is when large chunks of ice break off into the sea, as has happened already in parts of the Arctic."Global warming above 2C increases risk of exceeding a tipping point- where ice shelves thin or collapse, allowing a major acceleration in ice loss- and sea level rise," lead author Robert DeConto told AFP."Once set in motion, the ice retreat is unstoppable, because the buttressing ice shelves don't easily regrow in a warming ocean."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/limiting-global-warming-to-1-5-c-may-halve-rising-sea-levels-101620235659359.html
05-05-2021||World||Britain grants full diplomatic status to EU ambassador to London||Britain has granted full diplomatic status to the European Union's ambassador in London, ending a dispute that has strained relations between the two sides after Brexit.Britain initially refused to grant the same diplomatic status and privileges to EU Ambassador Joao Vale de Almeida as it gives to envoys of other countries, on the basis that the EU is not a nation state.The European Union responded by shutting the British ambassador in Brussels out of meetings. The disagreement was resolved after a meeting between Britain's foreign minister Dominic Raab and Josep Borrell, the bloc’s top diplomat, on the sidelines of a G7 foreign ministers meeting in London."We are pleased to have reached an agreement together, based on goodwill and pragmatism," Raab said in a statement on Wednesday. "The EU Ambassador will have a status consistent with heads of missions of states, including agrément and presentation of the credentials to the Head of State."Under the Vienna Convention governing diplomatic relations, envoys representing countries have certain privileges such as immunity from detention and, in some cases prosecution, as well as tax exemptions.Representatives of international organisations whose status is not covered by the convention tend to have limited and less clearly defined privileges.The European Commission, the 27-member bloc’s executive body, said the EU’s 143 delegations around the world had all been granted a status equivalent to that of diplomatic missions of states.(Reporting by William James and Andrew MacAskill; Editing by Alistair Smout)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/britain-grants-full-diplomatic-status-to-eu-ambassador-to-london-101620235298048.html

While the bilateral was originally supposed to be in person, the detection of Covid-19 infection within the Indian delegation caused that to be cancelled.Canada will send up to 350 ventilators in total, including this consignment of 50, “to help respond to the critical situation across India”, a statement from Global Affairs Canada, the country’s foreign ministry, said.The Canadian Government is also providing support through UNICEF’s response to the pandemic in India with the urgent provision of 1,450 oxygen concentrators. This support is in addition to Canada’s $10 million donation to the Canadian Red Cross Society, which is supporting the Indian Red Cross Society’s procurement of essential supplies and medicines.Marc Garneau, Canada’s Minister of Foreign Affairs, said, “Canada continues to stand in solidarity with the people of India. We must all unite in this hour of need and work together in the global fight against this virus that is devastating lives across the globe.”Those sentiments were echoed by Minister of National Defence Harjit Sajjan, as he said, “The Covid-19 pandemic is a global challenge and has reminded countries around the world that we are better off with each other’s help. That’s why the Canadian Armed Forces will support and transfer supplies to our friends in India to help defeat Covid-19. Throughout this pandemic and into the future, Canada will continue to be there for our allies in the Indo-Pacific region.”The province of Ontario is also sending 3,000 ventilators to India, and another province Saskatchewan has announced it will dispatch 100 ventilators. “Saskatchewan has a close and growing friendship with India, so it is incumbent on us to assist them where we can during this challenging time in their country,” the province’s Premier Scott Moe said.The Federal package was prepared after “identifying the needs and requirements on the ground and how best Canada can assist, these requested medical supplies have been made available to help bring some relief to those affected by Covid-19 in India,” the country’s Minister of Health Patty Hajdu, said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canada-sending-covid-19-relief-supplies-to-india-101620235238135.html

A punitive slowdown on the service has been extended until May 15.TASS said six reports concerning Twitter, each carrying a possible fine of up to 4 million roubles over a failure to remove content, had been lodged with a Moscow court under Russia's Administrative Offences Code.No date for the hearing has been set, TASS said. Roskomnadzor, Twitter and the court did not immediately respond to requests for comment.In April, a court issued three separate fines against Twitter, totalling 8.9 million roubles, over accusations it had failed to delete banned content.Roskomnadzor has said it wants Twitter to delete content that contains child pornography, drug abuse information or calls for minors to commit suicide.Twitter denies allowing its platform to be used to promote illegal behaviour, says it has a zero-tolerance policy for child sexual exploitation, and prohibits the promotion of suicide or self-harm.Russia has in recent months taken steps to exert more control over the operations of foreign social media platforms and tech companies. Russian authorities are suing Google, Facebook and others for allegedly failing to delete posts urging children to take part in illegal protests.The cases were opened after protests nationwide over the jailing in February of Alexei Navalny, a prominent critic of President Vladimir Putin.Separately, Apple was last week fined $12 million for alleged abuse of its dominance in the mobile applications market.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russia-seeks-extra-fines-against-twitter-over-banned-content-reports-101620208437558.html

The money from the winning bid will be donated to Blue Origin’s foundation, Club for the Future, which promotes math and science education.The plans signal progress for Blue Origin as it vies with Elon Musk’s Space Exploration Technologies Corp. and Richard Branson-backed Virgin Galactic Holdings Inc. to create a market for tourism rides into space. While Bezos’s rocket maker has yet to carry people, Bezos hinted on social media after an April test flight that the time for such a milestone was nearing.Details of the first crewed trip are unknown, but Blue Origin eventually plans to carry six astronauts on 11-minute flights that will cross the Karman line, an oft-cited space border at an altitude of 100 kilometers (62 miles). A crew capsule separates during flight, then lands with parachutes a few miles from the reusable New Shepard rocket. The 60-foot New Shepard landed successfully at Blue Origin’s West Texas launch area last month in its 15th test flight.Virgin Galactic has about 600 customers who have paid as much as $250,000 apiece for a future ride to space. The company stopped taking reservations in late 2018 but plans to resume later this year after it ferries Branson to suborbital space on one of its first flights. Executives have said future pricing is likely to be higher, given the company’s assessment of demand.SpaceX is also preparing for paying customers. As soon as September, Musk’s company will fly technology entrepreneur Jared Isaacman and three others on a multiday mission to low-Earth orbit. The trip was designed to raise money and awareness for St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital.Musk’s rocket maker also will fly four men to the International Space Station next year on a private mission for Axiom Space Inc.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/jeff-bezos-s-blue-origin-sets-july-20-for-first-human-spaceflight-mission-101620234408444.html
05-05-2021||World||Meghan Markle wins UK copyright claim over letter to father||A British court on Wednesday upheld Meghan Markle's copyright claim against Associated Newspapers, the publisher of the Mail on Sunday and MailOnline, over its publication of a letter to her father.The ruling by judge Mark Warby means the Duchess of Sussex, as Markle is formally known, has now won every part of her legal claim against the newspaper group, which published a handwritten letter she wrote to her father Thomas Markle.Warby said on Wednesday at a remote hearing lawyers acting for Queen Elizabeth II had assured him the copyright did not belong to the Crown so he was granting "summary judgement" over that remaining aspect of the case, too.In February the High Court issued Meghan with a "summary judgement", meaning she won her privacy and data protection rights claims against Associated Newspapers over the letter's publication without having to go to trial.Warby also ordered the Mail on Sunday to print a front-page statement acknowledging her legal victory.But the judge said at the time her copyright claim needed further scrutiny because the newspaper group suggested Meghan did not fully own the letter's copyright and members of the royal communications team helped her draft it.Meghan's solicitor, Ian Mill QC, said on Wednesday lawyers for the Keeper of the Privy Purse -- the official responsible for the monarch's private funds -- had written "disclaiming any claim to copyright on behalf of the crown".Mill said he also received a letter from lawyers for Jason Knauf, previously communications secretary to the Sussexes, saying he did not write or help draft the letter.The newspaper group's lawyer, Andrew Caldecott, said it was "a matter of regret" that Knauf had not clarified this earlier.Meghan's letter to her estranged father was written a few months after she married Queen Elizabeth II's grandson, Prince Harry, and asked him to stop talking to tabloids and making false claims about her in interviews.Meghan and her husband, the Duke of Sussex, have successfully mounted further legal action over media breaches of their privacy since moving to the United States last year.At the same time the couple have engaged with media on their own terms, giving an explosive interview in March to US chat show host Oprah Winfrey, in which they said unnamed royals had made racist remarks about how dark their son's skin would be.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/meghan-markle-wins-uk-copyright-claim-over-letter-to-father-101620233920501.html

05-05-2021||World||CDC says that Covid-19 cases in US could see sharp decline by July||US US Covid-19 cases could see a sharp decline by July if nationwide vaccination efforts continue to be successful, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.Researchers used scenario modeling techniques to show long-term projections of potential trends in Covid-19 cases, hospitalizations and deaths in data released Wednesday in the agency’s Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report.As expected, a decline in adherence to anti-pandemic measures, such as social distancing and mask wearing, together with increased transmissability of new variants, led to surges in Covid cases, hospitalizations, and deaths. However, high vaccination rates and compliance with public-health prevention measures showed a sharp decline expected by July.In all four scenarios researchers examined, Covid-19 cases were projected to increase through May nationally. Increases in deaths were also predicted this month, peaking at 11,100 weekly across the US, because of the prevalence of a fast-spreading variant initially seen in the UK and a decline in anti-pandemic mandates.The models also considered age-specific vaccinations, and found that higher coverage in older adults helped to reduce hospitalizations and deaths.Researchers warned the findings should not be considered forecasts of the most likely outcomes, yet instead are intended to help with planning and guiding public-health efforts.In a White House briefing on Wednesday CDC Director Rochelle Walensky said the models are a reminder that there is a path out of the pandemic. She said the data that once contained grim predictions now offers reasons to be hopeful for what the summer may bring, she said.‘Wild Card’However, Walensky also warned that although the U.S. is seeing a decrease in Covid-19 cases, hospitalizations and deaths, the variants are a “wild card” that could put states at risk for increasing caseloads, especially if vaccination rates drop and anti-pandemic measures are lifted.“We need to keep vaccinating people but we also need to keep practicing certain prevention interventions to help us get to the predicted good outcomes,” she added.The findings were published a day after President Joe Biden set a target of 70% of U.S. adults receiving at least one dose of a Covid-19 vaccine by July 4, and for 160 million adults to be fully vaccinated by Independence Day.However, data shows that the number of Americans getting their first dose of a vaccine is declining in at least 47 states.Health officials and the White House say the vaccine campaign has moved into a new phase, aimed at people who either haven’t been able to sign up, haven’t made it a priority, or who have hesitations.“We’re going to have to bring the vaccine to people who are less eager,” Biden said during a White House briefing on Tuesday. “We’re going to make it easier than ever to get vaccinated.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/cdc-says-that-covid-19-cases-in-us-could-see-sharp-decline-by-july-101620233589658.html
05-05-2021||World||Israel's president picks Netanyahu opponent Lapid to form government||Israel's president on Wednesday chose Yair Lapid, a centrist politician and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's strongest rival, to try to form a new government, but his path to success was still uncertain.Israel's longest serving leader, Netanyahu, 71, has been fighting to hold onto office through four inconclusive elections since 2019 and corruption allegations that he denies.President Reuven Rivlin, in a televised address announcing his choice of Lapid, said the former finance minister had the pledged support of 56 of parliament's 120 members, still short of a majority."It is clear that parliament member Yair Lapid could form a government that has the confidence of the Knesset, despite there being many difficulties," Rivlin said.In a statement accepting the nomination, Lapid, who heads the Yesh Atid party, said he aimed to establish a government of the left, right and centre "that will reflect the fact that we don't hate one another".But Lapid has ruled out serving in a government with Netanyahu, citing the criminal indictment against the prime minister.The most recent vote on March 23, held while Netanyahu is also on trial on charges of bribery, fraud and breach of trust, yielded no majority for the incumbent or for a loose alliance of rivals from across the political spectrum aiming to topple him.A 28-day mandate to put together a coalition ran out at midnight after Netanyahu failed to agree terms with potential right-wing partners, opening the way for Rivlin to assign the task to another member of parliament.Lapid, 57, also has 28 days to try to form a coalition.Netanyahu, who last lost an election before the turn of the century, was due to make his own address later in the day.POWER SHARINGA power-sharing agreement to end the political stalemate has been widely mooted, in which Lapid would rotate in office with ultranationalist Naftali Bennett, 49, of the Yamina party.Rivlin met the two separately on Wednesday, and each put his own name forward to lead coalition talks, the president said."I have just spoken to Yair Lapid and informed him that I am entrusting him with forming a government, whether this is a government that he will head at the beginning, or a government headed by someone else first in which he will serve as alternate prime minister," Rivlin said in his address.Lapid's party finished second with 17 parliamentary seats to 30 for Netanyahu's Likud in the March election.Netanyahu and his opponents have both courted the support of parties representing Israel's 21% Arab minority, potentially giving them a say over a cabinet for the first time in decades.Five of the Joint Arab List's six legislators threw their support behind Lapid in a letter which the party sent to Rivlin on Wednesday, backing which the president noted in his speech.Failure to break the deadlock would lead to a new election, adding to political turmoil while Israel faces challenges from Iran's nuclear programme and pursues economic recovery after a swift rollout of COVID-19 vaccine.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/israels-president-picks-netanyahu-opponent-lapid-to-form-government-101620232729784.html
05-05-2021||World||Boris Johnson makes last pitch to voters before UK ‘super Thursday’ polls||Boris Johnson made a final push for votes ahead of “Super Thursday” elections, a major test of support for his U.K. premiership and the ruling Conservative Party amid a slew of allegations of ‘sleaze’ and cronyism that have undermined the government for months.After the coronavirus outbreak forced one set of local elections to be pushed back by 12 months, two years’ of polls will be held across Britain on Thursday, including for 143 English councils, the Scottish and Welsh parliaments and the mayor of London. The parliamentary district of Hartlepool, won by the opposition Labour Party since the 1970s, is also up for grabs.“It’s a very tough set of elections,” Johnson told reporters while campaigning in the West Midlands, where the region’s Conservative mayor Andy Street is bidding for a second term. “We’ll be fighting for absolutely every vote.”Johnson’s Tories have been fighting off allegations of “sleaze” -- British political shorthand for scandals of corruption or other shady dealings -- following revelations about the lobbying of ministers by the now insolvent lender Greensill Capital, and amid accusations of cronyism over how health equipment contracts were awarded at the height of the Covid-19 pandemic.In recent weeks the attention has focused on Johnson, who was forced to deny he broke the law over the refurbishment of his apartment in Downing Street. The Tory party faces an inquiry from the Electoral Commission over the affair, while other probes are looking at the role of Johnson and his officials.Poll LeadStill, several recent opinion polls have Johnson’s Tories holding a double-digit lead over Keir Starmer’s Labour Party, bolstered by a significant drop in recent coronavirus cases and a vaccine rollout that has delivered more than 50 million doses.If the polls prove correct, the political focus may shift quickly to Labour and Starmer, especially if the party suffers what would be a humiliating defeat in Hartlepool -- a seat represented by Labour since its inception in 1974.If the Tories take the district, it will only be the third time since World War II that the ruling party has gained a seat from the opposition at a by-election.That would likely increase pressure on Starmer, for whom Thursday’s votes represent his first electoral test as leader as he tries to rebuild the party following its worst drubbing in a general election in nearly 90 years in 2019.Critics say Starmer’s style as a forensic former public prosecutor does not connect with voters, especially pitched against the flamboyant Johnson.On Wednesday, his message was one of managing expectations.“This is the first test and we go into that test fighting for every vote,” Starmer told reporters in Pontefract, northern England on Wednesday. “But I never thought we would climb the mountain we have to climb in just one year -- it is going to take longer than that.”Even if the votes in England go Johnson’s way on Thursday, polls show a very different picture in Scotland. A Scottish National Party majority -- or what would be a pro-independence majority in conjunction with the Greens -- would put the British prime minister under intense pressure to grant another referendum on Scotland breaking away from the U.K., following the first one in 2014.On Wednesday, Johnson gave no ground.“I think that most people in Scotland, most people around the whole of the U.K., feel that this is not the time, as we’re coming forward out of a pandemic together, this is not the time to have a reckless, and I think irresponsible, second referendum,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/boris-johnson-makes-last-pitch-to-voters-before-uk-super-thursday-polls-101620222702115.html
05-05-2021||World||Saudi Arabia, Iran held talks more than once in Iraq: Iraq's president||Iraq has hosted more than one round of talks between regional foes Iran and Saudi Arabia, Iraqi President Barham Salih said on Wednesday.Salih made his remarks during an interview broadcast live online with the Beirut Institute think tank. He gave no more details.Diplomats hope the opening of direct channels between Iran and Saudi Arabia will signal a calming of tensions across the Middle East after years of hostilities that have brought the region close to a full-scale conflict.Baghdad hosted talks between officials from its two neighbours and mutual adversaries on April 9 in the only round of talks to have been previously reported.Asked how many rounds of Saudi-Iranian talks Iraq had hosted, Salih replied: "More than once.""It is ongoing, and it is important and it is significant, and for Iraq to be able to play that convening role between these regional actors is important," he added, although he gave no further details on the talks.Washington and Tehran have engaged in indirect talks in Vienna that seek to revive an international pact reached in 2015 that constrained Iran's nuclear ambitions in return for sanctions relief.Former U.S. President Donald Trump pulled out the deal in 2018 and imposed harsh sanctions on Iran and its regional allies, increasing tension as Iran-backed militias attacked U.S. forces in Iraq and a series of attacks hit oil installations and tankers in the Gulf, where Washington counts Arab states such as Saudi among its close allies.The killing of Iranian general Qassem Soleimani in a U.S. air strike in Baghdad in January 2020 brought the region close to war. Iran responded with limited missile strikes against a U.S. base in Iraq, the first such direct attack, but took no further action.Iraqis hope for a general regional detente that would allow their country to rebuild instead of being used as an arena for U.S., Gulf Arab and Iranian score-settling.Iraq is trying to rein in powerful Iran-backed militias and deal with a resurgent Islamic State - the Sunni hardline Islamist group that took over a third of Iraq in 2014 and was beaten militarily in 2017 by U.S. forces, the Iraqi military, Kurdish fighters and Iran-aligned paramilitaries."The war against ISIS (Islamic State) and terrorism cannot be won by (only) military means," Salih said. "We have succeeded in liberating our land with the help of our friends but terrorism remains."He added that he wished to see a solution to the Iran-U.S. rivalry that has fuelled violence in Iraq."The Middle East has been condemned to a cycle of conflict and instability over the last few decades... It's time to move beyond," Salih said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/saudi-arabia-iran-held-talks-more-than-once-in-iraq-iraq-s-president-101620232675358.html
05-05-2021||World||Concerned at Chinese firms being kept out of India’s 5G trials: China||China on Wednesday expressed concern and regret at Chinese telecommunications companies being kept out of India’s 5G technology and spectrum trials and called on India to “do more to enhance mutual trust” between the two sides. The department of telecommunications on Tuesday gave permission to mobile service operators Bharti Airtel, Reliance JioInfocomm, Vodafone Idea and MTNL and network providers such as state-run C-DOT, Sweden’s Ericsson, Finland’s Nokia and South Korea’s Samsung to conduct trials across the country for six months. Against the backdrop of the year-long military standoff with China along the Line of Actual Control (LAC), Chinese companies such as Huawei and ZTE didn’t find a place in the trials. The Indian side has repeatedly said complete disengagement and de-escalation at friction points along the LAC will be the basis for taking forward relations in other spheres, including business. Responding to the department of telecommunications’ decision not to include Chinese firms in the trials, Chinese embassy spokesperson Wang Xiaojian expressed “concern and regret that Chinese telecommunications companies have not been permitted to conduct 5G trials with Indian telecom service providers”. He said, “Relevant Chinese companies have been operating in India for years, providing mass job opportunities and making contribution to India’s infrastructure construction in telecommunications.” Excluding Chinese telecommunications firms from the trials “will not only harm their legitimate rights and interests, but also hinder the improvement of the Indian business environment, which is not conducive to the innovation and development of related Indian industries”, Wang said. “The Chinese side hopes that India could do more to enhance mutual trust and cooperation between the two countries, and provide an open, fair, just, and non-discriminatory investment and business environment for market entities from all countries, including China, to operate and invest in India,” he added. Since the start of the border standoff in May last year, India banned more than 260 Chinese-origin mobile phone apps and curbed foreign direct investments from China. There have been long-standing security concerns regarding the participation of Chinese firms such as Huawei and ZTE in India’s 5G trials. Former US president Donald Trump had also pressured India not to allow these firms to participate in the trials. India and China agreed to withdraw their forces from the north and south banks of Pangong Lake in February, but the process of disengagement and de-escalation at other friction points on the LAC has been stalled. The Chinese side’s suggestion that the border issue be delinked from other aspects of bilateral ties such as trade and investment has been rebuffed by New Delhi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/concerned-at-chinese-firms-being-kept-out-of-india-s-5g-trials-china-101620232237070.html
05-05-2021||World||US births drop to the lowest level since the 1970s||The years-long U.S. baby drought worsened last year, with births dropping 4% from 2019 to the lowest level since 1979.The provisional data for 2020, at 3.6 million births, marks the sixth annual drop in a row. The decline will likely continue in 2021, when the brunt of the impact from the Covid-19 pandemic will be recorded -- with a nine-month delay.Fears of contracting the virus while pregnant, or while in hospital to give birth, combined with job insecurity and government measures limiting social contact and business activity, dissuaded Americans from having babies, according to surveys by Ovia Health, a women’s health technology company.“There are several factors that go into family planning, and an entire ecosystem of support that enables and empowers parents and parents-to-be,” said Paris Wallace, chief executive of Ovia Health. “In 2020, nearly all of those factors were turned on their head, and many of those support systems came crashing down.”Births fell for women in all age groups between 15 and 40 in 2020, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The declines were steeper in states where Covid-19 hit the hardest, such as California and New York. And the exodus from crowded urban centers exacerbated declines in places such as New York City.Here are some of the other key findings from the national CDC data released Wednesday:A separate report from the CDC helps assess the impact from people moving out of big metropolitan areas.The percentage of births to New York City residents that occurred outside of the city increased for all months from March through November, the report found. Non-Hispanic White residents were 2.5 times more likely to give birth outside of the city in April and May 2020 than in the same period a year earlier.Almost one-third of women decided to stop or delay trying to getting pregnant because of the Covid-19 crisis, according to a survey of users of Ovia Health’s fertility tracker app. The company polled about 20,000 users regularly since the start of the pandemic.“The chief concerns derailing conception plans centered around health,” said CEO Wallace. Still, “one particularly telling statistic for us at Ovia was that nearly a quarter of couples stopped or delayed trying to conceive because of concerns over finances and job security.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-births-drop-to-the-lowest-level-since-the-1970s-101620217184828.html

Jaishankar tweeted he had become aware of “exposure to possible Covid-19 positive cases” and would conduct all his engagements in London virtually, including participation in the G7 meet on Wednesday. Public Health England, which deals with issues such as infectious diseases, asked the entire Indian delegation to self-isolate, according to BBC. A British official confirmed two positive tests among the delegation. British rules require a 10-day self-isolation period. “Was made aware yesterday evening of exposure to possible Covid-19 positive cases. As a measure of abundant caution and also out of consideration for others, I decided to conduct my engagements in the virtual mode. That will be the case with the G7 Meeting today as well,” said a tweet by Jaishankar, who is on his first foreign trip after India was hit by a devastating second wave of infections. Jaishankar subsequently tweeted an image of himself holding a virtual meeting with his Canadian counterpart Marc Garneau. The report of the Indian delegates testing positive immediately triggered a Covid-19 scare at the G7 meeting. There were also questions as to whether members of other delegations had been exposed in any manner. People familiar with developments said on condition of anonymity that all members of the delegation in London had tested negative on Sunday. The Indian side is working with UK health authorities to ascertain the level of exposure and what needs to be done regarding the delegation’s travel plans, the people said. British high commissioner Alex Ellis said in New Delhi that UK authorities have protocols in place for the G7 meeting which will determine how such an incident is handled. “Our approach will be guided by the advice given to us by Public Health England,” he said. While participating in a live virtual event with the theme “Does India have a plan? From survival to revival”, Jaishankar described the second wave of infections as an “all consuming” challenge and contended India’s health system “stands exposed”. Asked if the government took its eye off the ball with regard to the pandemic, he said: “There were repeated advisories going out and public health teams sent out. There was a move to ramp up oxygen production. The reality unfortunately was, as the numbers came down there was an amount of public confidence. This is genuinely not a blame game, but I don’t think anyone in the country can say we kept our guard up all the time.” Jaishankar added, “With the benefit of hindsight, it is easy to say we shouldn’t have allowed gatherings of any kind. But there are times when we need to pull up our socks and put the blame game aside. We are a deeply democratic and political country and in a democracy, you can’t not have elections. Elections are sacrosanct.” India is not a member of the G7 and was invited to the meeting as a guest along with Australia, South Korea, South Africa and the chair of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations. British authorities put in place strict Covid-secure measures for the meeting, which was billed by the UK as a chance to restart in-person diplomacy. There are daily Covid-19 tests throughout the meeting, including self-test kits and an on-site testing facility, strict guidelines on social distancing, and the size of delegations were limited. The delegates are separated by Perspex screens during talks. Those at the top of the external affairs ministry have all been vaccinated and undergo regular tests for Covid-19 every week. However, there have been several cases of Coronavirus infections among junior and middle-ranking officials of the ministry in New Delhi in recent weeks. The G7 foreign ministers meeting is a precursor to the main summit to be held at the rural English resort of Cornwall in June. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has been invited to the summit as a guest by his UK counterpart Boris Johnson. The Indian delegation had not attended any event at the main venue at Lancaster House, and meetings scheduled for Wednesday went ahead as planned. British foreign minister Dominic Raab fist-bumped other G7 members as they arrived at the venue. “We deeply regret that Jaishankar will be unable to attend the meeting today in person,” a senior UK diplomat was quoted as saying by Reuters. “This is exactly why we have put in place strict Covid-19 protocols and daily testing.” Jaishankar met British interior minister Priti Patel on Tuesday and they signed the Migration and Mobility Partnership Agreement to facilitate legal travel. Patel didn’t have to self-isolate because the meeting was held in line with existing rules, and both ministers were wearing masks. Jaishankar held bilateral meetings in London with US secretary of state Antony Blinken, South African foreign minister Naledi Pandor and European Union foreign policy chief Josep Borrell and a trilateral meeting with Australian foreign minister Marise Payne and French foreign minister Jean-Yves Le Drian.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-scare-at-g7-meet-in-london-as-2-members-of-indian-delegation-test-positive-101620229416707.html
05-05-2021||World||US prez undecided on TRIPS waiver at World Trade Organization||US President Joe Biden is yet to make a decision on a proposal before the WTO to temporarily waive intellectual property rights to Covid-19 vaccines as supporters and opponents, newly joined by Republican lawmakers, mount pressure on him in anticipation of a resolution of the issue at the world body’s general council meetings.“We’re going to decide that as we go along. I haven’t made that decision yet,” Biden said of the WTO proposal moved by India and South Africa last October.A group of Democratic lawmakers pressed him hours later, saying it was past time for him to take a call. “Mr President, stop deciding and start acting,” said Lloyd Doggett, one of the 108 Democratic members of congress who have jointly written to the president asking him to put people before pharmaceutical companies, who are opposing the waiver proposal.“Even tomorrow, the administration can act,” he added, referring to the two-day meeting of the general council of the WTO starting on Wednesday in Geneva. “Fight this pandemic by expanding global vaccine manufacturing capacity.” Doggett and some other signatories of the joint letter spoke to reporters on Tuesday, to dial up pressure on the eve of the WTO meet.Also on Tuesday, 12 Republicans urged the Biden administration to continue US opposition to the waiver proposal, which was a decision of the administration of former president Donald Trump.They said in a letter to US trade representative Katherine Tai that the United States should “continue” to oppose the waiver request calling it “extraordinarily broad and unnecessary to accomplish the goal” of ensuring widespread access to Covid-19 vaccines and therapeutics to as many people as possible. This group of Republicans is led by Congressmen Jim Jordan, a staunch Trump loyalist and ally, and Darrell Issa.India and South Africa moved the proposal before the WTO last October, when Trump was still in office, calling for temporarily waiver of the agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) to ensure easy and affordable access globally, and specially to developing countries, to Covid-19 vaccines, therapeutics and related technologies till the pandemic had been curbed.Supporters of the proposal, which include more than 100 members countries at the WTO and large number of Democratic lawmakers and rights groups in the United States, have called it a “moral imperative”, arguing, as noted by a group of senators in a letter to Biden, for the need to “prioritise people over pharmaceutical company profits by reversing the Trump position”.Opponents of the request - the US, the EU, the UK, Japan and Switzerland at the WTO and pharma companies - argue that intellectual property rights are not a barrier to equitable distribution but scaling up production. They have also argued that the waiver threatens the model of on which medicine research and manufacturing is based, and that many of the developing countries that are intended to benefit from the waiver do not have the capability to manufacture them; and there is a national security wrench thrown in as well, the fear of these patents falling into Chinese into Russian hands.Anthony Fauci, chief medical advisor to Biden, has jumped into the debate arguing, the waiver will be challenged in courts and the ensuing legal battle hold up supplies for a long time. “Going back and forth, consuming time and lawyers in a legal argument about waivers - that is not the end game,” he told Financial Times. “People are dying around the world, and we have to get vaccines into their arms in the fastest and most efficient way possible.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-prez-undecided-on-trips-waiver-at-world-trade-organization-101620226476161.html

05-05-2021||World||Suspect held after 2 Asian American women stabbed in San Francisco||Police arrested a man who they said is suspected of stabbing two Asian American women without warning Tuesday afternoon in San Francisco's Mid-Market neighborhood.Officers sent to the scene shortly before 5 p.m. found the wounded women, who were taken to a hospital. There was no immediate word on the condition of the women, who were 65 and 85.Witnesses told KPIX-TV that a man clutching a knife was walking down Market Street when he approached a bus stop, stabbed the women and then walked away.A 54-year-old San Francisco man was arrested on suspicion of committing the attack several hours later, police told the station.Police didn't immediately indicate whether the women were specifically targeted or whether the attack might be a hate crime.Asian Americans have been the targets of unprovoked attacks in the San Francisco Bay Area and elsewhere in the nation in recent months.California prosecutors have filed assault and hate crime charges against a man accused of an attack last week in which he allegedly yelled racial slurs before knocking down Carl Chan, president of the Oakland Chinatown Chamber of Commerce.In separate San Francisco attacks in March, an 83-year-old Vietnamese man was knocked down and broke his neck in the fall, and a 77-year-old woman was similarly attacked. Police arrested a man on charges of assault and elder abuse in both cases.Another 83-year-old San Francisco Bay Area man was pushed down in February, broke a hip and spent weeks in the hospital and in rehabilitation.In New York, a man was arrested last month on hate crimes charges in connection with last month’s attack on a Chinese immigrant in East Harlem.The 61-year-old victim was collecting cans when he was attacked from behind, knocked to the ground and kicked in the head.That attack echoed an earlier assault on a Filipina American woman near Times Square. A parolee who had been convicted of killing his mother two decades ago was arrested.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/suspect-held-after-2-asian-american-women-stabbed-in-san-francisco-101620224365310.html
05-05-2021||World||Saudi lowers oil prices for Asia as India faces second wave of Covid-19||Saudi Arabia lowered prices for oil shipments to customers in its main market of Asia as a surge in coronavirus cases crimps energy demand in India, the world’s third-largest crude importer.The kingdom’s state energy firm, Saudi Aramco, reduced pricing for June shipments to the continent by between 10 and 30 cents per barrel.The key Arab Light grade for Asia was cut to $1.70 a barrel above the benchmark from $1.80 for May. That’s the first reduction in official selling prices for the grade since December, signaling weakness in Asian oil markets.The reductions had been anticipated in the market. Aramco had been expected to lower Arab Light’s premium by 20 cents, according to a Bloomberg survey of seven traders and refiners.Saudi Energy Minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman has urged fellow members of OPEC+ to be cautious as the group eases supply cuts started last year when the pandemic was hammering energy markets. The 23-nation cartel plans to increase daily output by just over 2 million barrels through to July, beginning with 600,000 this month. That would still leave production roughly 5 million barrels a day below pre-pandemic levels.Aramco raised pricing to the US by 20 cents a barrel for all grades. The nation is adding jobs amid economic growth and a push for widespread vaccinations. The company cut pricing for all shipments to Northwestern Europe and the Mediterranean, where efforts to bolster the economy and ease lockdowns have met with mixed results.Brent crude has climbed almost 35% this year, closing in on $70 a barrel as vaccination rollouts enable the US, Europe and some other major economies to reopen. Aramco Chief Executive Officer Amin Nasser said on Tuesday he’s more optimistic about the outlook for oil.Still, the pandemic has rapidly worsened in India since the start of April. The country is now reporting around 400,000 cases every day.Most Middle Eastern coutries set monthly oil prices as a premium or discount to a benchmark. Aramco’s OSPs serve as a bellwether for oil markets and often lead the pricing trend in the region. Abu Dhabi issued its first OSP based on trading in crude futures this month, a step in its efforts to establish its crude as the regional benchmark.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/saudi-lowers-oil-prices-for-asia-as-india-faces-second-wave-of-covid19-101620223233525.html
05-05-2021||World||North Korea says Covid-19 vaccines are 'no panacea', warns of lengthy battle||North Korea's state media warned of the prospect of a lengthy battle against the coronavirus and said vaccines developed by global drugmakers were proving to be "no universal panacea".The country has not officially confirmed any infections, although South Korean officials have said an outbreak there cannot be ruled out, as the North had trade and people-to-people links with China before shutting its border early last year.The Rodong Sinmun, the official newspaper of North Korea's ruling Workers' Party, said on Tuesday the global pandemic was only worsening, despite the development of vaccines."Novel coronavirus vaccines introduced competitively by various countries were once regarded as a glimmer of hope for humanity that could end the fight against this frightening disease," Rodong Sinmun said."But the situations in many countries are clearly proving that the vaccines are never a universal panacea," it said, citing news reports of rising numbers of new cases overseas and safety concerns surrounding some vaccines.It urged people to brace for a protracted pandemic, describing it as an "inevitable reality" that called for efforts to toughen anti-virus measures and foster loyalty to leader Kim Jong Un and his party.North Korea was expected to receive nearly two million doses of AstraZeneca's Covid-19 vaccine by the first half of this year, via the global COVAX sharing programme.But last month Edwin Salvador, the World Health Organization (WHO) representative for North Korea, said the shipment was delayed due to supply shortages, citing the GAVI alliance, according to South Korean media.In a comment to Reuters, Salvador said North Korea was completing technical requirements to receive the vaccines, but did not elaborate.The GAVI alliance, which co-leads COVAX with the WHO, told Reuters that shipments have not been made to North Korea due to its lack of "technical preparedness" and global supply shortages but could be expected later this year."(North Korea) remains eligible for COVAX support. Depending on the supply situation, a Covid-19 vaccine introduction could be envisaged in the second half of 2021," a GAVI official said, adding that concrete dates cannot be defined at this point.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/north-korea-says-covid-19-vaccines-are-no-panacea-warns-of-lengthy-battle-101620220037238.html
05-05-2021||World||Malaysia tightens restrictions on movement in Kuala Lumpur amid Covid-19 surge||Malaysia tightened restrictions on movements in capital Kuala Lumpur to stem the rise in new Covid infections, a day after imposing similar curbs in Selangor, its richest state.The movement control order, or MCO, will stay in force from May 7 to May 20, Defense Minister Ismail Sabri Yaakob said in a statement on Wednesday, adding the protocols already in place for other areas under MCO will apply.Malaysia is facing a surge in Covid infections with the onset of Ramadan -- daily cases topped 3,000 last week for the first time since February -- prompting the government to review movement curbs. The country posted 3,744 new cases on Wednesday, and Selangor topped the list with 1,548 infections followed by Kuala Lumpur at 313. The detection of the Indian Covid-19 variant last week has added to the risk.The country is also struggling with the pace of its vaccination program. Just 2% of Malaysia’s population have completed their vaccination series as of May 4, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That tally trails neighbors Indonesia and Singapore, and puts Malaysia at risk of falling well short of its vaccination goals for the year.At the current weekly pace of inoculations, the number of single shots given by year-end would cover 21% of the population, according to Tamara Henderson, Asean economist for Bloomberg Economics. That compares with the government’s aim to have 80% of its people vaccinated by February 2022.Measures announced on Wednesday include:||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/malaysia-tightens-restrictions-on-movement-in-kuala-lumpur-amid-covid-19-surge-101620220457019.html
05-05-2021||World||Facebook oversight board upholds Trump suspension||Former President Donald Trump won’t return to Facebook — for now.The social network’s quasi-independent Oversight Board voted to uphold his ban from the platform after his account was suspended four months ago for inciting violence that led to the deadly Jan. 6 Capitol riot.While uploading the suspension, the board faulted Facebook for the way it made the decision.“It was not appropriate for Facebook to impose the indeterminate and standardless penalty of indefinite suspension,” it said.The board says Facebook has six months to reexamine the “arbitrary penalty” it imposed on Jan. 7 and decide on another penalty that reflects the “gravity of the violation and the prospect of future harm.”The board says the new penalty must be “clear, necessary and proportionate” and consistent with Facebook’s rules for severe violations.The board says if Facebook decides to restore Trump’s accounts, the company must be able to promptly address further violations.Trump has also been permanently banned from Twitter.THIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE. AP’s earlier story follows below.Since the day after the deadly riot at the Capitol on Jan. 6, former President Donald Trump's social media accounts have been silent — muzzled for inciting violence using the platforms as online megaphones.On Wednesday, his fate on Facebook, the biggest social platform around, will be decided. The company's quasi-independent Oversight Board will announce its ruling around 9 a.m. ET. If it rules in Trump's favor, Facebook has seven days to reinstate the account. If the board upholds Facebook's decision, Trump will remain “indefinitely” suspended.Politicians, free speech experts and activists around the world are watching the decision closely. It has implications not only for Trump but for tech companies, world leaders and people across the political spectrum — many of whom have wildly conflicting views of the proper role for technology companies when it comes to regulating online speech and protecting people from abuse and misinformation.After years of handling Trump’s inflammatory rhetoric with a light touch, Facebook and Instagram took the drastic step of silencing his accounts in January. In announcing the unprecedented move, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg said the risk of allowing Trump to continue using the platform was too great.“The shocking events of the last 24 hours clearly demonstrate that President Donald Trump intends to use his remaining time in office to undermine the peaceful and lawful transition of power to his elected successor, Joe Biden,” Zuckerberg wrote on his Facebook page on Jan. 7.A day before the announcement, Trump unveiled a new blog on his personal website, “From the Desk of Donald J. Trump.” While the page includes a dramatic video claiming, “A BEACON OF FREEDOM ARISES” and hailing “A PLACE TO SPEAK FREELY AND SAFELY,” the page is little more than a display of Trump’s recent statements — available elsewhere on the website — that can be easily shared on Facebook and Twitter, the platforms that banished him after the riot.While Trump aides have spent months teasing his plans to launch his own social media platform, his spokesman Jason Miller said the blog was something separate.“President Trump’s website is a great resource to find his latest statements and highlights from his first term in office, but this is not a new social media platform,” he tweeted. “We’ll have additional information coming on that front in the very near future.”Barred from social media, Trump has embraced other platforms for getting his message out. He does frequent interviews with friendly news outlets and has emailed a flurry of statements to reporters through his official office and political group.Trump has even said he prefers the statements to his old tweets, often describing them as more “elegant.”Facebook created the oversight panel to rule on thorny content on its platforms following widespread criticism of its difficulty responding swiftly and effectively to misinformation, hate speech and nefarious influence campaigns. Its decisions so far — all nine of them — have tended to favor free expression over the restriction of content.In its first rulings, the panel overturned four out of five decisions by the social network to take down questionable material. It ordered Facebook to restore posts by users that the company said broke standards on adult nudity, hate speech, or dangerous individuals.Critics of Facebook, however, worry that the Oversight Board is a mere distraction from the company's deeper problems — ones that can't be addressed in a handful of high-profile cases by a semi-independent body of experts.“Facebook set the rules, are judge, jury and executioner and control their own appeals court and their own Supreme Court. The decisions they make have an impact on our democracies, national security and biosecurity and cannot be left to their own in house theatre of the absurd,” said Imran Ahmed, CEO Center for Countering Digital Hate, a nonprofit critical of Facebook. “Whatever the judgement tomorrow, this whole fiasco shows why we need democratic regulation of Big Tech."Gautam Hans, a technology law and free speech expert and professor at Vanderbilt University, said he finds the Oversight Board structure to be “frustrating and a bit of a sideshow from the larger policy and social questions that we have about these companies."“To some degree, Facebook is trying to create an accountability mechanism that I think undermines efforts to have government regulation and legislation,” Hans said. “If any other company decided, well, we’re just going to outsource our decision-making to some quasi-independent body, that would be thought of as ridiculous.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/facebook-oversight-board-upholds-trump-suspension-101620220639108.html
05-05-2021||World||Election day: What are Scotland, England, Wales voting for?||Voters in England, Scotland and Wales head to the polls on Thursday in a series of different elections, with a vote for the Scottish parliament and one for a seat in Westminster in focus for clues to Britain's future political landscape.Following is a rundown of all the elections which are taking place on Thursday and what they might tell us:SCOTTISH ELECTIONSAll 129 members of the Scottish parliament will be elected on Thursday under a mixed system which allows voters to first vote for an area or constituency member of the Scottish parliament and then another vote for a political party.Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has said if the Scottish National Party wins a majority it will give her a mandate to demand a second referendum on independence, after one in 2014 when Scots voted by 55% to 45% to stay in the United Kingdom.Sturgeon could still call for another referendum if there is a majority of pro-independence parties in the Scottish parliament. The Greens, which back a new referendum, have supported the SNP in government and could provide Sturgeon will the fire-power to argue for another poll. [L4N2MR2UH]Opinion polls are predicting very different results, from the SNP failing to win a majority to other showing the party winning a narrow or larger majority. HARTLEPOOL BY-ELECTIONVoters in the northern English town of Hartlepool will elect a new member of the Westminster parliament after the member of parliament, Mike Hill, resigned over facing an investigation into allegations of sexual harassment.Hartlepool has voted for the main opposition Labour Party since 1974, a pattern the governing Conservative Party is hoping to break by trying to capitalise on the government's COVID-19 vaccination programme and promises of more jobs.A Conservative victory would also suggest that the public are not overly concerned by a series of scandals buffeting Prime Minister Boris Johnson, including one over the financing of the renovation of his flat at No. 11 Downing Street.Labour leader Keir Starmer will also want to hold onto the parliamentary seat after he was elected to take the helm of the party after leftist former leader Jeremy Corbyn failed to win victory in a 2019 national election.It is Starmer's first test as Labour leader and if the seat is won by the Conservatives, he could face questions from leftist members of his party.MAYORSLondon will vote in elections for the mayor of London, a post which has outsized influence over government even though it does not run the City of London financial district.Incumbent Sadiq Khan of Labour, London's first Muslim mayor, is expected to win again on Thursday. Londoners will also elect 25 members of the London Assembly.There are also elections for mayors in different regions and cities across England, with the Conservatives hoping to hold onto the West Midlands post among others.WALESWelsh voters will elect the 60 members of the Welsh parliament, called Senedd Cymru, under a mixed system when they are offered two ballots - one for the constituency and another for a party for the region.Labour has won the biggest share of the vote in every parliamentary election since 1999 and faces its biggest challenge from the Conservatives, which are still behind in the opinion polls.ENGLAND'S LOCAL ELECTIONSElections will be held for 143 English local councils, or more than 5,000 seats. The Conservatives want to increase their numbers of local councils, especially in areas in northern and central England, which voted, often for the first time, for Johnson's party in 2019.There will also be elections for Police and Crime Commissioners.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/election-day-what-are-scotland-england-wales-voting-for-101620219453392.html

Tedros has said repeatedly that the U.N. agency is open to reforms.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/germany-who-to-set-up-global-data-hub-to-fight-pandemics-101620219090433.html
05-05-2021||World||Citizens in several nations keen to get Covid-19 shots but governments fail to cater to demands: Report||Governments of several countries where people have shown extreme willingness to get inoculated if vaccines against the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) are given for free have only achieved limited success in their vaccination drive, the data released by Gallup, an American analytics and advisory company, on Tuesday showed.The study conducted before the vaccination drive against Covid-19 was launched in several countries, listed more than 30 nations where at least more than 70% of its population wanted to get the vaccines but only a handful of those nations are on track to achieve those targets.In Myanmar, 96% of the respondents said that they would take the shots if provided for free. The study also found that if Myanmar does achieve this target, it would achieve the higher end of the herd immunity threshold, which is 90%. But the nation which continues to witness endless violence following the February coup has only been able to fully vaccinate 0.1% of its population, according to a vaccination dashboard compiled by news agency the New York Times.People in many countries also showed willingness to get vaccinated against Covid-19 but only a few of those nations have been able to cater to its citizens’ demand of vaccination. Among the top 10 nations listed below where citizens expressed extreme willingness to get vaccinated, barring Iceland (10% of the target population fully vaccinated) and Denmark (11%), the rest have achieved very less success in vaccinating its citizens.Percentage of people who agreed to get vaccinated if a vaccine to prevent coronavirus was available right now at no costIndia, which ranks 11th in the table, where 82% of the people want to get vaccinated, has been able to administer the vaccine to only 8% of the population with only the first dose of the vaccine.On the other hand, Israel, the United Arab Emirates and the United Kingdom were among the countries where the vaccination rates corroborated to the percentage of people who wanted to get the shots. In Israel, at least 61% people wanted to get vaccinated and the nation has administered 60% of its target population with one dose of the Covid-19 vaccine.The UAE, where 68% of the population wished to get vaccinated, administered the entire population with at least one dose of the vaccine. In the United Kingdom 75% of the population wished to get the vaccine while the British government has been able to vaccinate 49% of the population with at least one dose of the vaccine.Vaccine scepticism could impact the target of achieving herd immunity in most countries, the research conducted by Gallup shows. It surveyed 117 countries and areas found out that despite the pandemic continuing to claim lives across the world and few nations facing a severe second wave of coronavirus disease, nearly three in ten adults refused to be vaccinated. This number translates roughly to 1.3 billion people.The study also pointed out that if people who are keen to take the vaccine against Covid-19, do actually get their shots, only 38 out of the 117 countries surveyed would achieve the lower end of the herd immunity threshold, which is 70%. Herd immunity is achieved when most of the population in an area is immune to a certain disease which then provides immunity to those who are not immune to the disease.Attitudes towards the Covid-19 vaccine vary across nations. The study highlighted that Myanmar would be among the countries to achieve the higher end of the herd immunity threshold, which is 90%, as 96% of the people surveyed in the nation said that they would take the shots if provided for free.Several nations have also expressed severe unwillingness towards getting vaccinated. Russia, whose Sputnik V vaccine is being considered as one of the most effective vaccines against Covid-19 in many nations, has failed to generate enough enthusiasm among Russians as only 61% of the respondents say that they will take the vaccine.Until mid-April, Russia has fully vaccinated at least 5.3% of its target population and has administered one dose to at 8.5% of its target population.A section of citizens of Bulgaria (61%) and Czech Republic (53%) surveyed also disagreed to take the vaccine, which could be a cause of concern, as Czech Republic, which leads the globe in overall deaths per capita from the virus, rushes towards reopening the country. Bulgaria, who as of mid-April reported the second-highest 14-day Covid-19 death rate in the European Union is also reopening at a quicker pace despite rise in number of cases.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/citizens-in-several-nations-keen-to-get-shots-but-govts-fail-to-cater-to-demands-101620216220710.html

Well, we're ready to use them," Girardin told France's National Assembly on Tuesday."Regarding Jersey, I remind you of the delivery of electricity along underwater cables ... Even if it would be regrettable if we had to do it, we'll do it if we have to."With a population of 108,000, Jersey imports 95% of its electricity from France, with diesel generators and gas turbines providing backup, according to energy news agency S&P Global Platts.Jersey's government said that France and the European Union had expressed their unhappiness with the conditions placed on the issuance of fishing licenses.Jersey’s external relations minister, Ian Gorst, said the island had issued permits in accordance with the post-Brexit trade terms, and that they stipulated any new license must reflect how much time a vessel spent in Jersey's waters before Brexit."We are entering a new era and it takes time for all to adjust. Jersey has consistently shown its commitment to finding a smooth transition to the new regime," Horst said in a statement.The rocky island sits just 14 miles (23 km) off the northern French coast and 85 miles (137 km) south of Britain's shores.The French threat is the latest flare up over fishing rights between the two countries.Last month, French trawlermen angered by delays to licences to fish inside British waters blocked lorries carrying UK-landed fish with burning barricades as they arrived in Boulogne-sur-Mer, Europe's largest seafood processing centre.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/france-threatens-to-turn-lights-off-in-jersey-over-brexit-fish-row-101620215044777.html
05-05-2021||World||Ousted Myanmar lawmakers announce 'people's defence force'||A shadow government of ousted Myanmar lawmakers said Wednesday it has set up a "people's defence force" to protect civilians, as the police and military deploy deadly arms against anti-coup protesters.The country has been in turmoil since the military deposed civilian leader Aung San Suu Kyi, triggering a mass uprising of daily protests and a nationwide boycott from civil servants.So far, nearly 770 people have been killed in deadly crackdowns, according to a local monitoring group -- though the junta has a far lower death toll which it blames on "rioters".A group of ousted lawmakers who call themselves the "National Unity Government" (NUG) and are working underground to oppose the junta announced their own "people's defence force" to "stop the use of violence against people".It is intended as a precursor to a "Federal Union Army", the NUG said in a statement -- referring to a long-touted idea of bringing anti-coup dissidents together with Myanmar's ethnic rebel fighters into an army.Some in the anti-coup movement have called for unity among Myanmar's myriad rebel armed groups to defeat the military's well-trained soldiers.A few of the groups have condemned the military coup and the use of violence against unarmed civilians. Some are also providing shelter and even training to dissidents who flee into their territories.But the more than 20 groups -- made up of disparate ethnic minorities agitating for more autonomy -- have long distrusted the ethnic Bamar majority, including lawmakers affiliated with Suu Kyi's government.An official of the Karenni National Progressive Party (KNPP) -- which has said it is sheltering anti-coup dissidents -- expressed scepticism at the NUG announcement."As far as I know, it is the people themselves who walk into the jungle and receive the training from the (ethnic armed organisations)... it is not decided by the NUG," said KNPP vice-chair Khu Oo Reh.He added that while the NUG has spoken with many rebel groups about a militia made up of civilians, "I have no idea what their intentions are."Another group along Myanmar's eastern border, which declined to be named, said the statement was "confusing".Before the NUG's announcement Wednesday, some communities across Myanmar -- especially in townships that have seen a high death toll at the hands of police -- have announced local "defence forces" for their areas.State media reported Tuesday night that five protesters -- including a former MP with Suu Kyi's party -- were killed when they tried to plant a bomb in the southern region of Bago.Bombs have exploded sporadically across the country in recent weeks, especially in Yangon. Authorities have blamed some of the blasts on "instigators".||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/ousted-myanmar-lawmakers-announce-people-s-defence-force-101620211903843.html
05-05-2021||World||Thailand fights to contain Covid-19 surge in Bangkok||Health officials rushed to vaccinate thousands of people in Bangkok's biggest slum on Wednesday as new Covid-19 cases spread through densely populated low-income areas in the capital's central business district.The government of Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-o-cha is facing mounting criticism for its handling of a surge that began in early April.Thailand recorded 2,112 new cases and 15 deaths on Wednesday. The country has been reporting about 2,000 cases a day recently, often with double-digit deaths in the third mass outbreak since the pandemic started.More than half of the 74,900 cases reported by the Centre for COVID-19 Situation Administration, or 46,037, have been confirmed since April 1. A total of 318 people are known to have died from the virus.The CCSA said about 30,000 people were being treated in hospitals and in field hospitals constructed to make up for the lack of enough hospital beds and intensive care units, especially in Bangkok.Thailand had managed to control the spread of the virus by closing its borders to almost all travelers and then imposing lengthy mandatory quarantines. Apart from that, life had largely returned to normal before the latest surge, which began in nightclubs and bars in Bangkok.Health officials warned that caseloads were bound to jump after millions traveled around the country during Songkran national holidays in mid-April, even as authorities were urging people to stay home and take more precautions against the virus.The country has vaccinated only 2% of its 60 million people in a faltering, delayed inoculation program as the government initially chose to use only two vaccines, China's Sinovac and one made by AstraZeneca.Officials say they will begin supplying millions of vaccines in June with the aim of vaccinating 70% of the population in 2021.The current outbreak spread from night entertainment spots to the Klong Toey area, Bangkok's largest slum with about 100,000 people living in a 1 square mile area. There, health workers are trying to vaccinate up to 3,000 people per day, hoping to have at least 50,000 people inoculated within two weeks. They are also testing intensively to try to identify and isolate those who are infected.But that may not be enough, local leaders say.“There are all kinds of people in Klong Toey, from day laborers and taxi drivers to business owners. They travel to work in different areas, not only in Bangkok but also other provinces. We cannot seal the area and cannot stop them from moving around,” Sittichat Angkhasittisiri, chairman of the Klong Toey Block 1-2-3 community, told The Associated Press.On Wednesday, many newly reported cases were in the nearby Lumphini district, which is home to nearly 30,000 people, most of them also living in crowded old houses in narrow alleys squeezed between massive construction projects, canals, factories, expressways and embassies.“We found a confirmed case on April 20. He tried to get a (hospital) bed but could not, so finally he had to isolate himself in his car . . . because he was afraid of spreading it to family members,” Angkhasittisiri said. “After that, more cases were found. “The cluster in Klong Toey has brought added misfortune to some of Bangkok's most vulnerable residents, said Prateep Ungsongtham Hata, founder of Klong Toey-based charity Duang Prateep Foundation.“Many of them are told to stop working when people know they are from Klong Toey. Plus, it is not easy at all when those high risk people have to keep themselves in very small places for two weeks. I am very worried about their mental health,” she said.“If we had gotten vaccines since the beginning of this year, we would not face a situation like this.”The local AstraZeneca producer hopes to start distributing its first batch of locally made vaccines in June — and about 16 million people have registered. Inoculations will prioritize people over 60 or those with pre-existing medical conditions.The tens of thousands of foreigners legally living in Thailand do not know if there will be any way to be vaccinated anytime soon.“The vaccines right now are only reserved for Thai people who are now at a high-risk level or living in the severe outbreak areas. Expats should wait for a clear policy from the government," the newspaper Bangkok Post quoted Rungrueng Kitphati, spokesperson for the Public Health Ministry, as saying. ″There will soon be a surplus of vaccines so it will not be difficult to get them.”Thailand had begun moving to revive its devastated tourism industry in July by allowing vaccinated foreigners to visit tourist resorts such as Phuket. It's unclear if those plans will go ahead.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/thailand-fights-to-contain-covid-19-surge-in-bangkok-101620205784455.html
05-05-2021||World||Covid-19: Australian citizen sues PM Morrison over flight ban from India||A 73-year-old Australian, who is stranded in India since March last year, has filed a lawsuit before a Sydney court against the federal government for banning flights from India and threatening to prosecute those attempting to enter the country with the possibility of a jail term and a penalty, saying the move is “unconstitutional”.The lawyers of Gary Newman, who is stranded in Bengaluru since March last year, have argued in the federal court in Sydney that the ban was “unconstitutional”.The Australian government, for the first time in history, recently imposed a ban on its citizens from returning home, if they have spent time in India up to 14 days before flying back.The government threatened to prosecute them with a possibility of five years of jail term or a penalty of 66,000 Australian dollars (USD 50,899).Michael Bradley and Chris Ward lodged the application before Justice Stephen Burley on Wednesday afternoon.The application firstly said that the Commonwealth was acting outside its powers and secondly, Health Minister Greg Hunt's declaration was in breach of an implied freedom to return home, ABC news reported.Newman is represented by Bradley and Ward who would work as pro bono to overturn the temporary ban. Pro bono generally refers to services that are rendered by a professional for free or at a lower cost for the public good.At a brief directions hearing, Ward said Newman was in Bengaluru and "wishes" to return home, but had been "prevented" from doing so by Hunt's declaration.Burley ordered that the proceedings be expedited and a formal hearing date be determined within the next 24 to 48 hours.On Saturday, Hunt issued a statement on the travel ban for Australians returning from India.The statement said: ''the Government will implement a temporary pause on travellers from India entering Australian territory if the passenger has been in India within 14 days of the person’s time of departure”.The temporary pause, announced after the National Cabinet, was based on advice about the worsening COVID-19 situation in India.The pause came into effect on Monday and will be reviewed on May 15.Hunt said the risk assessment that informed the decision was based on the proportion of overseas travellers in quarantine in Australia who have acquired a COVID-19 infection in India.The move triggered a backlash with several lawmakers, doctors, civil societies and businessmen criticising the government for "abandoning" Australians in India and threatening the travellers with a hefty penalty and a jail term.Prime Minister Scott Morrison, while speaking to reporters, defended the decision and said that the pause “is working” which means it will enable the government to get Australian residents and their immediate families back on repatriation flights.India is struggling with an unprecedented second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic with more than 3,00,000 daily new coronavirus cases being reported in the past one week.According to Indian health ministry data on Wednesday, a record 3,780 fresh COVID-19 fatalities were registered in a single day in India, taking the death toll to 2,26,188, while 3,82,315 new coronavirus infections were recorded.With the fresh cases, the total tally of COVID-19 cases in the country climbed to 2,06,65,148.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-australian-citizen-sues-pm-morrison-over-flight-ban-from-india-101620208131215.html

05-05-2021||World||Covid: 155 mn across the world suffer from food crisis, global hunger rates rise||The world faced its worst hunger problem in at least five years in 2020 on the back of the coronavirus crisis, and the outlook remains grim again this year.Some 155 million people across 55 countries -- more than the population of Russia -- suffered from issues ranging from a food crisis to famine, according to a report with data from more than a dozen agencies. That’s up 20 million from 2019, with economic shocks overtaking extreme weather as the No. 2 cause.The worsening situation highlights how the pandemic has exacerbated food inequalities around the world, on top of extreme weather and political conflicts that are stifling access to key staples. Consumers are now also contending with rising food costs as rampant Chinese demand stretches global crop supplies.“Covid-19 has been exacerbating fragilities,” said Dominique Burgeon, director of emergencies and resilience at the UN’s Food and Agriculture Organization. “Its restrictions, for example, on the movement of goods and people, has resulted in widespread income losses, especially for those people who rely on informal work in urban households.”Conflict and insecurity remain the largest causes of hunger, responsible for almost two-thirds of those facing food crises, according to the report created with help from agencies including the European Commission and United Nations’ World Food Programme. The Democratic Republic of Congo, Yemen and Afghanistan are some of the most-affected nations.The number of people facing hunger primarily from economic shocks, including those related to the pandemic that cut jobs and incomes, jumped nearly 70% last year to 40.5 million.Supply chain disruptions also caused spikes in food prices, while higher inflation or weaker currencies in import-dependent nations made food less affordable, according to the report. Women have been particularly hard hit, as they’ve been more vulnerable to losing jobs.Global hunger is expected to hold above pre-pandemic levels this year, affecting more than 142 million across 40 countries, the report showed. Conflicts remain a problem and economic hardship could intensify due to the coronavirus crisis, the agencies said.Last year, about 28 million people were in an “emergency” state of food insecurity, or worse.“We are extremely concerned,” Burgeon said. “When we look at the early data we have from 2021, we see that this number has already increased.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-155-mn-across-the-world-suffer-from-food-crisis-global-hunger-rates-rise-101620207754991.html
05-05-2021||World||Saudi Arabia considers barring overseas haj pilgrims for second year due to Covid-19: Reports||Saudi Arabia is considering barring overseas pilgrims from the annual haj for the second year running as COVID-19 cases rise globally and worries grow about the emergence of new variants, two sources familiar with the matter said on Wednesday.Such a move would restrict the pilgrimage to Mecca, a once in a lifetime duty for every able-bodied Muslim who can afford it, to Saudi nationals and residents of the kingdom who were vaccinated or have recovered from COVID-19 at least months prior to attending.While discussions about a possible ban have taken place, there has been no final decision on whether to pursue it, they said.Before the pandemic enforced social distancing globally, some 2.5 million pilgrims used to visit the holiest sites of Islam in Mecca and Medina for the week-long haj, and the lesser, year-round umrah pilgrimage, which altogether earned the kingdom about $12 billion a year, according to official data.As part of economic reform plans pursued by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the kingdom was hoping to raise the number of umrah and haj pilgrims to 15 million and 5 million respectively by 2020, and aimed to double the umrah number again to 30 million by 2030. It aims to earn 50 billion riyals ($13.32 billion) of revenues from the haj alone by 2030.Two sources familiar with the matter said authorities have suspended earlier plans to host pilgrims from overseas, and will only allow domestic pilgrims who have been vaccinated or have recovered from COVID-19 at least six months before the pilgrimage.Restrictions will be applied on the age of participants as well, one of the sources said.A second source said the plans were initially to allow some numbers of vaccinated pilgrims from abroad, but confusion over types of vaccines, their efficacy and the emergence of new variants has pushed officials to reconsider.The government media office did not respond to a request for comment.Saudi Arabia, which stakes its reputation on its guardianship of Islam’s holiest sites in Mecca and Medina, barred foreigners from the haj last year due to the pandemic for the first time in the kingdom's modern history, allowing it only to a limited number of Saudi citizens and residents.COVID-19 infections are still rising in 35 countries globally. There have been at least 153,508,000 reported infections and 3,351,000 reported deaths caused by the new coronavirus so far.India leads the world in the daily average number of new deaths reported, accounting for one in every four deaths reported worldwide each day.Crowds of millions of pilgrims from around the world could be a hotbed for virus transmission, and in the past some worshippers have returned to their countries with respiratory and other diseases.In February, the government suspended entry to the kingdom from 20 countries, with the exception of diplomats, Saudi citizens, medical practitioners and their families, to help curb the spread of the new coronavirus.The ban, which is still in place to date, includes people arriving from the United Arab Emirates, Germany, the United States, Britain, South Africa, France, Egypt, Lebanon, India and Pakistan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/saudi-arabia-considers-barring-overseas-haj-pilgrims-for-second-year-due-to-covid-19-reports-101620207741230.html

The curbs are similar to those last imposed at the end of 2020.“Despite of all the exceptional efforts we are making, the Covid-19 situation in our country is critical right now with many daily cases reported last week,” Peggy Vidot, the nation’s health minister, said at a press conference Tuesday.The Indian Ocean archipelago, which has a population of about 98,000, is dependent on tourism for much of its foreign exchange and acted quickly to begin vaccinations in January using a donation of Chinese vaccines from the United Arab Emirates. It has procured other vaccines since.By April 12, 59% of the doses administered were Sinopharm vaccines and the rest were Covishield, a version of AstraZeneca Plc’s shot made under license in India.To date 62.2% of its eligible population is fully vaccinated, according to the Bloomberg Vaccine Tracker. That compares with 55.9% for Israel, the next most vaccinated nation.Officials at the press conference gave little detail on what could be behind the infection surge other than to say people were taking fewer precautions against the virus than before and the surge may be due to celebrations after Easter.The number of active cases in the nation rose to 1,068 on May 3 from 612 on April 28, according to health ministry announcements.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/seychelles-world-s-most-vaccinated-nation-reinforces-curbs-as-covid-cases-rise-101620206992202.html
05-05-2021||World||French journalist says kidnapped by jihadists in Mali, in video||A French journalist, in a video circulating on social media Wednesday, said he had been kidnapped in Mali in early April by a jihadist group with links to Al-Qaeda.The brief video could not be independently verified, although an official at the French foreign ministry confirmed that Olivier Dubois, who worked for several media, including the international TV channel France 24 and Liberation daily, was missing.In the video, which lasts about 20 seconds, Dubois said he was abducted on April 8 in the central region of Gao by the Group to Support Islam and Muslims (GSIM), the biggest jihadist alliance in the Sahel.He is seen seated on the ground, on a green sheet that could be a tent, dressed in a light pink traditional gown, with his beard trimmed.The foreign ministry official said, "We are in contact with his family and the Malian authorities. We are carrying out the usual technical verifications" of the video.Liberation, for which Dubois had been writing regularly since April last year, declined to make any immediate comment.Mali has been struggling to contain an Islamist insurgency which first broke out in the north of the country in 2012 before spreading to the centre and neighbouring Burkina Faso and Niger.Thousands of people have been killed and hundreds of thousands have fled their homes, while the economic impact on one of the world's poorest countries has been devastating.Abductions have been frequent, both of Malians and foreigners.The last French hostage was Sophie Petronin, a 75-year-old aid worker, who was freed in October last year along with Malian politician Soumaila Cisse, who has since died, and Italians Nicola Chiacchio and Pier Luigi Maccalli.There has been consistent speculation that a ransom was paid for the four hostages, something that has never been confirmed by the Malian government, along with the release of 200 prisoners, some of whom were jihadists.In October, Switzerland was informed that the GSIM had killed an evangelical missionary who had been kidnapped in Timbuktu in January 2016.In March, the Swiss foreign ministry said the woman's body had been recovered and formally identified.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/french-journalist-says-kidnapped-by-jihadists-in-mali-in-video-101620205913486.html
05-05-2021||World||Iraq pushes Covid-19 vaccine rollout amid widespread apathy, rumors||Iraq’s vaccine roll-out had been faltering for weeks. Apathy, fear and rumors kept many from getting vaccinated despite a serious surge in coronavirus infections and calls by the government for people to register for shots.It took a populist Shiite cleric’s public endorsement of vaccinations — and images of him getting the shot last week — to turn things around.Hundreds of followers of Muqtada al-Sadr are now heading to clinics to follow his example, underscoring the power of sectarian loyalties in Iraq and deep mistrust of the state.“I was against the idea of being vaccinated. I was afraid, I didn’t believe in it,” said Manhil Alshabli, a 30-year-old Iraqi from the holy city of Najaf. “But all this has changed now.”“Seeing him getting the vaccine has motivated me,” said Alshabli, speaking by phone from Najaf where he and many other al-Sadr loyalists got their shots, Alshabli compared it to soldiers being energized when they see their leader on the front line.Iraq has grappled with a severe second wave of the coronavirus pandemic. New case numbers spiked to over 8,000 per day last month, the highest they have ever been. The surge was driven largely by public apathy toward the virus. Many routinely flout virus-related restrictions, refusing to wear face masks and continuing to hold large public gatherings.Daily rates have decreased in the last week, with 5,068 new cases reported on Monday.Iraq’s Health Ministry has repeatedly tried to reassure Iraqis that the vaccines are not harmful, but this has not convinced many who harbor long-standing distrust of the health care system.Iraq’s centralized system, largely unchanged since the 1970s, has been ground down by decades of war, sanctions and prolonged unrest since the 2003 U.S. invasion. Successive governments have invested little in the sector.Many avoid going to public hospitals altogether. Last month, a massive blaze tore through the coronavirus ward in a Baghdad hospital, killing more than 80 people and injuring dozens. Iraq’s Health Minister Hasan al-Tamimi was suspended for alleged negligence, and resigned Tuesday over the incident.So far, fewer than than 380,000 people have been fully vaccinated in the country of 40 million.Last week, as sluggish vaccination efforts continued, pictures of the black-turbaned al-Sadr, wearing a black mask and getting jabbed in the arm, began circulating on social media.Shortly after, his followers launched a vaccination campaign, calling on supporters to join them and posting photos of themselves carrying his posters while seated at medical centers receiving the vaccine.The Health Ministry has cashed in on the campaign, publishing on its Facebook page the photo of al-Sadr getting the shot, saying his vaccination was meant to encourage all citizens to do the same.Faris Al-Lami, assistant professor of community medicine at the University of Baghdad, said the government is widely viewed as corrupt and that its actions since the start of the pandemic only deepened the public's mistrust.He cited certain early practices, such as using security forces to take patients from their homes as if they were criminals, and holding up the burials of those who died of the virus for several weeks.Al-Lami also pointed to what he said are current problematic policies. For example, he said high-risk patients, such as those with chronic or immunodeficiency diseases, have to wait inside hospitals to get their shots, putting them at high risk of infection. Meanwhile, people with personal connections can get them easily.He said it's a positive development when the vaccination of a political or religious figure encourages people to get their shots. “But the ideology that is based upon blindly following anyone’s decision is a disaster in itself,” he said.Iraq received 336,000 new doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine in late March and Iraqis above the age of 18 are qualified to get the jab. Last month, the first shipment of Pfizer doses arrived in the country, with 49,000 shots.“All the vaccines that arrived in Iraq are safe and effective ... but until this moment, there are some citizens who are afraid of taking the vaccine as a result of malicious rumors,” said Ruba Hassan, a Health Ministry official.The Health Ministry has introduced measures to push Iraqis to get the shots. They include travel restrictions for those unable to produce a vaccination card and dismissals of employees at shops, malls and restaurants. While the measures have led more people to seek out vaccinations, they have also confused and angered a still largely reticent public.Restaurant owners said they were blindsided by the measures, uncertain if it meant they would face closure if they refused them.“There is no clear law to follow,” said Rami Amir, 30, who owns a fast food restaurant in Baghdad. “I don’t want all my staff to be vaccinated because they might have severe side effects or complications,” he said, echoing widespread skepticism.Omer Mohammed, another restaurant owner, said applicants for a new job at his eatery dropped out when he said vaccination cards were a necessary prerequisite.Medical professionals were prioritized to receive the vaccine and were able to pre-register in January when Iraq received its first shipment of 50,000 doses of the Chinese Sinopharm vaccine.When recent medical school graduate Mohammed al-Sudani, 24, went to get vaccinated this month he said the process was “bittersweet.” He showed up with no previous registration for the AstraZeneca vaccine. He didn’t need it. There was barely anyone there.The next week he brought two of his aunts to the same center. There were only two other people in the waiting room.“The nurse came in and asked them to call their relatives and friends to come to raise the number to at least 10 people because the jabs inside the vaccine kits were only valid for 6 hours,” he said.It was a different scene in hospitals that carry Pfizer shots. Tabark Rashad, 27, headed to Baghdad’s al-Kindi hospital last week. The waiting room was crowded with dozens of people, sparking infection concerns.“I went to protect myself against Covid-19, not get it in this room,” she said. “It was chaos.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/iraq-pushes-covid-19-vaccine-rollout-amid-widespread-apathy-rumors-101620206061659.html
05-05-2021||World||Covid-19 in United States: Prez Biden aims to vaccinate 70% of adults by July 4||President Joe Biden set a new vaccination goal to deliver at least one shot to 70% of adult Americans by July Fourth as he tackles the vexing problem of winning over the “doubters” and those unmotivated to get inoculated.Demand for vaccines has dropped off markedly nationwide, with some states leaving more than half their available doses unordered. Aiming to make it easier to get shots, Biden on Tuesday called for states to make vaccines available on a walk-in basis and he will direct many pharmacies to do likewise.His administration for the first time also is moving to shift doses from states with weaker demand to areas with stronger interest in the shots."You do need to get vaccinated,” Biden said from the White House. “Even if your chance of getting seriously ill is low, why take the risk? It could save your life or the lives of somebody you love.”Biden’s goal equates to delivering at least the first shot to 181 million adults and fully vaccinating 160 million. It's a tacit acknowledgment of the declining interest in shots.Already more than 56% of American adults have received at least one dose of a Covid-19 vaccine and nearly 105 million are fully vaccinated. The US is currently administering first doses at a rate of about 965,000 per day — half the rate of three weeks ago, but almost twice as fast as needed to meet Biden's target.“I’d like to get it 100%, but I think realistically we can get to that place between now and July Fourth," Biden said of his new goal.He said the administration would focus on three areas as it tries to ramp up the pace of vaccinations:— Adults who need more convincing to take the vaccine.— Those who have struggled or are in no hurry to obtain a shot.— Adolescents aged 12-15, once federal authorities approve vaccination for that age group.Acknowledging that “the pace of vaccination is slowing,” Biden predicted the inoculation effort is “going to be harder” when it comes to convincing “doubters” of the need to get their shots.He said the most effective argument to those people would be to protect those they love. “This is your choice: It’s life and death.”Biden's push comes as his administration has shifted away from setting a target for the US to reach “herd immunity," instead focusing on delivering as many shots into arms as possible. Officials said Biden's vaccination target would result in a significant reduction in Covid-19 cases heading into the summer.To that end, the Biden administration is shifting the government's focus toward expanding smaller and mobile vaccination clinics to deliver doses to harder-to-reach communities. It is also spending hundreds of millions of dollars to try to boost interest in vaccines through education campaigns and greater access to shots through community organizations that can help bring people to clinics.Biden touted creative efforts to make it “easier and more fun” to get vaccinated, such as grocery stores offering discounts to shoppers who come to get shots and sports leagues that hold promotions to gets shots for their fans.Ahead of the Food and Drug Administration's expected authorization of the Pfizer vaccine for kids aged 12-15, the White House is developing plans to speed vaccinations for that age group. Biden urged states to administer at least one dose to adolescents by July Fourth and work to deliver doses to pediatricians' offices and other trusted locations, with the aim of getting many of them fully vaccinated by the start of the next school year.While younger people are at dramatically lower risk of serious complications from Covid-19, they have made up a larger share of new virus cases as a majority of US adults have been at least partially vaccinated and as higher-risk activities like indoor dining and contact sports have resumed in most of the country.Officials hope that extending vaccinations to teens — who could get the first dose in one location and the second elsewhere, if necessary — will further accelerate the nation’s reduced virus caseload and allow schools to reopen with minimal disruptions this fall.The urgency to expand the pool of those getting the shots is rooted in hopes of stamping out the development of new variants that could emerge from unchecked outbreaks and helping the country further reopen by the symbolic moment of Independence Day, exactly two months away. Though White House officials privately acknowledge the steep challenge, Biden sounded an optimistic note.“The light at the end of the tunnel is actually growing brighter and brighter,” Biden said.Biden's speech comes as the White House announced a shift away from a strict allocation of vaccines by state population. The administration says that when states decline to take all the vaccine they have been allocated, that surplus will shift to states still awaiting doses to meet demand.Governors were informed of the change by the White House on Tuesday morning.This week, Iowa turned down nearly three quarters of the vaccine doses available to the state for next week from the federal government because demand for the shots remains weak. Louisiana, meanwhile, hasn’t drawn down its full vaccine allocation from the federal government for the last few weeks.Data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention shows Louisiana’s coronavirus vaccination rate is well behind most states. About 27% of state residents are fully vaccinated while 32% have received at least one dose of the vaccine, according to the state health department.The White House previously resisted efforts to distribute vaccine by metrics other than population. Biden rebuffed Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer last month when she requested more doses as her state was experiencing a surge in virus cases. White House press secretary Jen Psaki said at the time nearly all states were ordering at or near their population allocations, which is no longer the case.Individual states have made similar shifts internally to account for changing demand. Last week, Washington state changed the way it allocates coronavirus vaccine to its counties. Previously the state doled out supplies to counties proportionate to their populations. But now amounts will be based on requests from health care providers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-in-united-states-prez-biden-aims-to-vaccinate-70-of-adults-by-july-4-101620204218926.html

It was India, Pakistan and Bangladesh, but unfortunately, an unexpected situation came out and I had to postpone the India part to a later stage. But I will absolutely make sure that I'll go to India as well,” the UN General Assembly President said, referring to India’s Covid-19 crisis.Asked whether the UN will be able to host a regular General Assembly session in September, he said: “It would be wrong if we make a decision now for September on how the participation will be. Will it be a hybrid format? Or will we have again 10,000 people at UN Headquarters? What happens to civil society? What happens to the bilaterals? These are all questions we have in our minds.”He said June will be a proper time to discuss with the US, the host country of the UN, and local authorities on the Covid-19 situation and feasibility of holding the UN General Assembly.With New York City aiming to "fully reopen" on July 1, Bozkir said it will “give us a signal on whether we can have a different type of a high-level week than we had last September”, when all meetings were mostly virtual with minimal in-person presence in the UN premises.“The important thing is not to risk any people's health… we must absolutely go along with the mitigation measures, we must listen to what science is saying to us and we must not really open everything without any precaution.“If I were the host country, I wouldn't have made any plans for September as of now – because with this pandemic, unfortunately, we are living day by day or week by week. We suddenly see something happening, like what happens in India. Nobody was expecting this suddenly to happen. It changes all the plans. So, I think it's better to start talking about it, to start discussing it, and then leave it to the science and to the local authorities,” he added.India is struggling with an unprecedented second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic with more than 3,00,000 daily new coronavirus cases being reported in the past one week.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/un-general-assembly-president-postpones-india-trip-due-to-covid19-101620197004711.html

"We need new steps."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/activist-greta-thunberg-says-global-leaders-still-in-denial-over-climate-101620196552094.html

"Genocide is the gravest of international crimes and a formal legal determination should only be reached following a rigorous assessment on the basis of international law."She added that New Zealand in concert with other governments would keep up its calls for China to provide meaningful and unfettered access to the United Nations and other independent observers to ascertain the situation.Nations such as the United States and Canada have declared China’s actions in far western Xinjiang as genocide, but Australia's parliament stopped short of a similar move this year.In a speech in Auckland this week, Chinese ambassador Wu Xi said accusations of forced labour or genocide in Xinjiang were lies and rumours fabricated by anti-China forces without any evidence.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-zealand-calls-out-uyghur-rights-abuse-in-china-doesn-t-label-it-genocide-101620191136498.html
05-05-2021||World||US prez considering political ally as ambassador to India||US President Joe Biden is considering Los Angeles mayor and a former co-chair of his presidential campaign Eric Garcetti as ambassador to India, according to a report.Garcetti, 50, completes two terms as LA mayor in 2022 and cannot seek a third. He had once mulled a presidential run himself and then opted out.Axios news publication reported the possibility of Garcetti being sent to India, citing people familiar with the matter.Biden is expected to start rolling out his nominees for ambassadorships later this month. Presidents tend to pick political and campaign donors and allies, along with career foreign service officers. Ken Juster, who was the last US ambassador to India, was a political appointee for instance.Among other names that have figured in the speculation is former Congressman Joe Crowley, a one-time star of the Democratic party with a lock on the speakership of the House of Representative, to succeed Nancy Pelosi. But he was unexpectedly defeated in 2018 by Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a rising star.Garcetti was co-chair of the Biden campaign, and he was also part of the committee that Biden had appointed to look for his running mate. After the election, Garcetti was named one of the co-chairs of the inauguration committee. He was widely expected to get a cabinet berth and reports have suggested he was being considered for secretary housing.Like all host countries, India would like a US ambassador to be someone with an open line of communications with the White House, which Garcetti is likely to have, according to people familiar with these matters. It’s just more efficient and less time-consuming to not having to go through the usual state department bureaucracy, said someone familiar with these conversations, specially at sensitive times.Biden’s ambassadorial nominee for India will be one of the more high-profile announcements for the administration given the focus the US president has brought on the ties with India, bilaterally and as part of the Quad with Japan and Australia.President Biden and Prime Minister Narendra Modi have spoken four time already in 100 days since the American leader took office. And, they have met virtually as part of the Quad and the summit of 40 world leaders that Biden hosted in April.Last weekend, President Biden announced an assistance package of $100 million containing oxygen and oxygen supplies, personal protective equipment, rapid diagnostic tests, therapeutics such as remdesivir. Five planeloads of these supplies have already reached India, as the White House press secretary Jen Psaki told reporters on Tuesday, summing up the aid thus far. A sixth flight carrying supplies will reach on Wednesday. The United States has also diverted its supplies of raw material for AstraZeneca vaccine to India.After his BA and MA from Columbia University, Garcetti went to Oxford University as a Rhodes Scholar and went on to the London School of Economics. His website as LA mayor says he is also a jazz pianist and photographer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-prez-considering-political-ally-as-ambassador-to-india-101620190401602.html
05-05-2021||World||Scientists find dangerous chemical pollutants in disposable face masks||Scientists at Swansea University have uncovered potentially dangerous chemical pollutants that are released from disposable face masks when submerged in water.The research reveals high levels of pollutants, including lead, antimony, and copper, within the silicon-based and plastic fibres of common disposable face masks.The work is supported by the Institute for Innovative Materials, Processing and Numerical Technologies (IMPACT) and the SPECIFIC Innovation & Knowledge Centre.Project lead Dr Sarper Sarp of Swansea University College of Engineering said: "All of us need to keep wearing masks as they are essential in ending the pandemic. But we also urgently need more research and regulation on mask production, so we can reduce any risks to the environment and human health."Outlined in a recent paper, the tests carried out by the research team used a variety of masks -- from standard plain face masks to novelty and festive masks for children with many currently being sold in UK retail outlets.The rise in single-use masks, and the associated waste, due to the Covid-19 pandemic has been documented as a new cause of pollution. The study aimed to explore this direct link -- with investigations to identify the level of toxic substances present.The findings reveal significant levels of pollutants in all the masks tested -- with micro/nanoparticles and heavy metals released into the water during all tests. Researchers conclude this will have a substantial environmental impact and, in addition, raise the question of the potential damage to public health -- warning that repeated exposure could be hazardous as the substances found have known links to cell death, genotoxicity and cancer formation.To combat this, the team advise further research and subsequent regulations be put in place in the manufacturing and testing process.Dr Sarper Sarp continued: "The production of disposable plastic face masks (DPFs) in China alone has reached approximately 200 million a day, in a global effort to tackle the spread of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus. However, improper and unregulated disposal of these DPFs is a plastic pollution problem we are already facing and will only continue to intensify."There is a concerning amount of evidence that suggests that DPFs waste can potentially have a substantial environmental impact by releasing pollutants simply by exposing them to water. Many of the toxic pollutants found in our research have bio-accumulative properties when released into the environment and our findings show that DPFs could be one of the main sources of these environmental contaminants during and after the Covid-19 pandemic."It is, therefore, imperative that stricter regulations need to be enforced during manufacturing and disposal/recycling of DPFs to minimise the environmental impact."There is also a need to understand the impact of such particle leaching on public health. One of the main concerns with these particles is that they were easily detached from face masks and leached into the water with no agitation, which suggests that these particles are mechanically unstable and readily available to be detached."Therefore, a full investigation is necessary to determine the quantities and potential impacts of these particles leaching into the environment, and the levels being inhaled by users during normal breathing. This is a significant concern, especially for health care professionals, key workers, and children who are required to wear masks for large proportions of the working or school day."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/scientists-find-dangerous-chemical-pollutants-in-disposable-face-masks-101620189597016.html

This was for the first time that a top Indian government official had a meeting with Fauci, who is the top advisor to President Joe Biden on the pandemic.During the meeting, Fauci expressed his solidarity and support with India in this hour of crisis.The meeting came a day after he termed the situation in India “very desperate” and suggested that the government marshal all its resources, including the armed forces, to immediately build makeshift field hospitals, and urged other countries to help with not only materials but also personnel.During his talks with Ambassador Sandhu, the virus strains and variants in India, and the efficacy of vaccines against these came up for discussion.Fauci, who is also the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases at the National Institute of Health, offered American assistance, including in research and development.“Discussed virus variants, vaccines, response mechanisms and joint efforts incl in R & D. Thanked him for his insights and solidarity (sic),” Sandhu said in a tweet.Fauci recalled the severe Covid-19 situation that the US has faced and the various policy responses adopted to tackle it. Strengthening joint research in healthcare, particularly in the context of the pandemic, was also discussed.Earlier in the day, America’s Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas spoke with Sindhu and reiterated the Biden administration’s full support in India’s fight against the Covid-19 pandemic.“Deeply appreciate the strong solidarity and offer of support of” Department of Homeland Security,” the Indian envoy said on Twitter after the phone call.Two Indian-American congressmen Ro Khanna and Raja Krishnamoorthi issued another plea for more US aid to India.“It might not be on the front page anymore but make no mistake: the crisis in India has not ended. Many have stepped up to send help, but nothing can match the resources of our government. We need to mobilise our resources to quell the surge in India and prevent spikes elsewhere,” Khanna said.India is struggling with an unprecedented second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic with more than 3,00,000 daily new coronavirus cases being reported in the past few days.According to Indian health ministry data on Tuesday, India's total tally of Covid-19 cases crossed the 2-crore mark with 3,57,229 infections being reported in a day, while the death toll increased to 2,22,408 with 3,449 new fatalities.The total tally of Covid-19 cases in the country has climbed to 2,02,82,833, it said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/indias-us-envoy-discusses-covid-19-crisis-new-strains-with-dr-fauci-101620189788906.html

Authorities will also go “district by district, house by house” and visit companies hosting overseas workers to contain any spread.The government is bracing for a scenario where 30,000 people could be infected, Dam said, adding that the number is meant for preparation and not a forecast. There had been reports that many places weren’t strictly implementing quarantine rules, which fueled the recent spike in cases, Dam said.“The virus situation currently is very worrisome with multiple risk factors from people entering Vietnam legally, illegally and locals letting the guard down,” Health Minister Nguyen Thanh Long said in the post. Three patients in Vinh Phuc were found to be carrying a virus variant first detected in India, the health ministry had said.Vietnam, which has among the lowest number of infections in Southeast Asia, has ordered movement restrictions after domestic Covid-19 cases flared up for the first time in a month.

There were already children dead, an employee also," emergency worker Leonardo Ecco told journalists.Employee Aline Biazebetti, who was at her home near the daycare center, described the horror of realizing what was happening inside."I heard screams, cries for help. I told my father, 'Something's going on at the daycare.' I went outside and saw my colleagues calling for help: 'Please, call the police, an armed guy came in and is killing the children,'" said Biazebetti, 27."I managed to call the police.

05-05-2021||World||12 Republican lawmakers urge Biden admin to not support India's proposal at WTO||Twelve Republican lawmakers have urged the Biden administration to not support a proposal by India and South Africa before the World Trade Organisation to temporarily waive some Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) rules amid the coronavirus pandemic.If the US gives up intellectual property rights, it will harm innovation and production, and result in fewer people getting vaccinated, the 12 influential Congressmen said in a letter to US Trade Representative Katherine Tai on Tuesday.The letter is in response to the proposal in this regard by 60 developing countries, led by India and South Africa.Click here for full Covid-19 coverage"The United States should continue to oppose the request by India, South Africa, and other nations to waive certain portions of the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) for all members of the World Trade Organisation (WTO)," the letter said.Spearheaded by Congressmen Jim Jordan and Darrell Issa, the lawmakers said the requested waiver is extraordinarily broad and unnecessary to accomplish the goal of giving as many people as possible access to vaccines and treatment for COVID-19.They claimed that Prime Minister Narendra Modi pressed US President Joe Biden to support the waiver during a phone call in early May.Among other signatories to the letter are Steve Chabot, Louie Gohmert, Matt Gaetz, Mike Johnson, Tom Tiffany, Thomas Massie, Dan Bishop, Michelle Fischbach, Scott Fitzgerald and Cliff Bentz."The justification for the waiver rests on an incorrect assumption that IP rights are a significant bottleneck to the widespread availability of COVID-19 vaccines and treatments,” the letter said.Also Read: In phone call with Modi, Biden discusses sending Covid vaccines, other supplies"The waiver's sponsors have presented no convincing evidence to support this assertion. Instead, the sponsors mainly just point out that relevant IP rights exist and speculate that those rights could serve as a barrier to access to COVID-19 vaccines and treatments - not that IP rights have actually blocked or significantly hindered their availability,” it added.If anything, the examples of IP 'disputes' cited by the waiver sponsors generally demonstrate that IP rights have not prevented the involved parties from supplying vaccines and other medicines, the letter said.Respect for intellectual property rights has been a cornerstone of the US trade policy for decades and should not be set aside lightly, the Republican Congressmen said."Although some flexibility may be warranted in emergency situations, the waiver of TRIPS IP protections requested by India, South Africa, and other countries would do little to improve public health during this critical period in the COVID-19 pandemic. The scope of the requested waiver is overbroad and unjustified in light of the economic harm it would cause and the negligible benefits it would provide,” they said in the letter."Existing aspects of TRIPS and global public health initiatives, along with the existing actions of key IP rights holders and innovators, make the waiver unnecessary. While considerable work can still be done to improve access to COVID-19 medicines and other innovations, that work can be done without the drastic step of suspending IP rights, and significant progress has already been made to address the real obstacles hampering the global COVID-19 response,” they said.The lawmakers argued that relevant intellectual property rights have been successfully licensed to expand access to COVID-19 innovations while maintaining IP protections. For example, the Serum Institute of India has secured licenses to produce multiple vaccines, including Astrazeneca and Novavax vaccines.South Africa's Aspen Pharmacare has secured a license to produce the Johnson & Johnson vaccine.Several vaccine makers have licensed direct competitors to increase vaccine manufacturing capacity.Moderna has announced that it would not seek to enforce any of its COVID-related patents against other vaccine makers for the rest of the pandemic and has pledged to license its COVID-19 vaccine patents.Gilead has licensed nine generic pharmaceutical manufacturers (including in India) to produce its COVID-19 therapeutic drug remdesivir for 127 countries, most of which are developing nations.Moreover, TRIPS already allows countries to impose compulsory licenses to access vital IP rights, and no country has availed itself of that capability to date for COVID-19 vaccines or treatments, the lawmakers noted.The proposed waiver is not limited to patents on vaccines or treatments for COVID-19 - the waiver would also gut protections for copyrights, industrial designs (e.g., textile patterns or other ornamental designs), and trade secrets. The waiver’s supporters have only offered vague, unsubstantiated explanations for how waiving IP protections for copyrights or industrial designs would lead to improved vaccine or therapeutics availability, they said.It is also unclear how a waiver of TRIPS obligations would provide more access to trade secrets and proprietary technologies, which are confidential by definition and typically closely guarded, they said."Gifting away our technological leadership and competitive advantage at a time when the US economy remains vulnerable would be irresponsible and send the wrong message to millions of American taxpayers. The damage would extend beyond even the considerable value of COVID-19 vaccines and medicines, also endangering the far greater value of the jobs and economic growth promised by these IP rights and the advanced technologies they represent," the Republican Congressmen said in the letter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/12-republican-lawmakers-urge-biden-admin-to-not-support-india-s-proposal-at-wto-101620173891988.html

The attack took place in the village of Hantoukoura near the border with Niger in Est region, an area hit by rising insecurity as jihadist groups with links to al Qaeda and Islamic State seek to gain control over once peaceful territories.In a statement, Est Governor Saidou Sanou said more than 10 civilians and two members of a civilian defence militia were killed by the unidentified attackers, who also torched a number of shops and ransacked the health centre.But the four sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the death toll stood at around 30, making it one of the deadliest single attacks in Burkina Faso in the past year or more.It was not immediately clear who was responsible for the attack.Jihadist groups have also fuelled religious and ethnic tensions between farming and herding communities in Mali, Burkina Faso and Niger in order to boost recruitment among marginalised communities.The worsening violence in the wider Sahel region has led to one of the world's most acute humanitarian crises, U.N. agencies said last week. Twenty-nine million Sahelians are in need of aid and protection - an all-time high and 5 million more than last year, they said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/around-30-killed-in-attack-on-village-in-eastern-burkina-faso-security-sources-101620173557928.html
05-05-2021||World||US to give Covid-19 shot to low-risk teens as virus rages globally||President Joe Biden wants 70 percent of American adults to have received at least one shot of a Covid-19 vaccine by the July 4 holiday, and has made vaccinating adolescents a key part of the next phase of the country's immunization campaign.But targeting US teens is a controversial move among many experts, who argue it is a serious mistake to use the world's limited supply of doses on a low-risk population while the pandemic surges in countries like India and Brazil.Pfizer and its partner BioNTech said in March their two-dose regimen was shown to be safe and highly effective in a trial of 2,260 12-to-15-year-olds.An emergency use authorization is expected in the coming days, and Biden told White House reporters Tuesday that "if that announcement comes, we are ready to move immediately."The president's address comes as the nation's immunization campaign is stalling after hitting a peak in early April.More than 56 percent of adults have received one or more shots, but as the rate of uptake falls, officials are devising new ways to reach vaccine hold-outs.These will include discounts to shoppers who get vaccinated at grocery stores, promotions for fans at sports stadiums, and more vaccines at rural health clinics, said Biden.The federal government is also working on a program with pharmacies and pediatricians nationwide to reach the country's estimated 17 million 12-to-15-year-olds ahead of school reopening in fall.- 'Terrible error' - Many experts have, however, voiced concern whether now is the right moment to reach this group as the global situation deteriorates.The issue of vaccine disparity has been brought into sharp focus by India, which reported 350,000 new cases Tuesday and recorded nearly 3,500 deaths -- more than anywhere in the world."The overwhelming majority of 15-year-olds, we know are not at high risk of severe complications from COVID," ER doctor Craig Spencer, director of Global Health in Emergency Medicine at Columbia University, told AFP."It is absolutely raging around the world and we're talking about how we're going to vaccinate an incredibly low-risk population, when the overwhelming majority of health care workers around the world have zero protection," he said.Priya Sampathkumar, chair of Infection Prevention & Control at Mayo Clinic in Minnesota, added that beyond being an ethics issue, exporting more vaccines was in America's own best interest."Vaccinating more people in the US is not going to help us if the variants in India, Nepal and South Asia get out of control and hit our shores," she told AFP.The US has pledged to release up to 60 million doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine, but the experts believe much more can be done."I think if you vaccinate 12-to-15-year-olds in the United States before you vaccinate 70 year olds globally, you're making a terrible error," UCSF physician and epidemiologist Vinay Prasad told AFP.Israel's experience had shown that it is possible to achieve a "remarkable reduction" in cases without targeting teens, he added.- Low risk - Sampathkumar explained that the main reason to vaccinate teens is to drive down transmission -- a goal which she agreed with, though with US cases declining, it is a question of timing.Statistics show children are at extremely low risk from severe Covid.In the United States, under-18s have accounted for 277 deaths in total, according to the latest official data, a miniscule fraction of the total of 574,000.There have been a further 36 deaths from multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C), a rare but serious post-viral disease.Still, low risk isn't no risk, and pediatrician Lee Beers, president of the American Academy of Pediatrics, welcomed the arrival of a vaccine for children.She called vaccinating teens "an important tool in our toolbox for safe return to schools," saying it may "increase the comfort for many families and school staff."Figures aggregated by the data company Burbio shows 67.1 percent of US school students are attending schools in-person, while 29.6 percent are in a "hybrid" set-up combining in-person and remote classes, and 3.3 percent are learning virtually.But Jennifer Nuzzo, an epidemiologist at Johns Hopkins, said that the government's own research had shown it is entirely possible to reopen schools safely without vaccines."It's just another barrier that's been falsely erected to stand in the way of returning kids to education," she stressed.Nuzzo added global hotspots should be the priority."It's not good for kids in the long run if we just let this virus spread unchecked across the globe," she said.ia/bfm||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-to-give-covid-19-shot-to-low-risk-teens-as-virus-rages-globally-101620172823607.html
05-05-2021||World||Netanyahu loses mandate to form Israel govt, opening door for rivals||Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's mandate to form a government following an inconclusive election expired on Wednesday, giving his rivals a chance to take power and end the divisive premier's record tenure.Netanyahu, on trial over corruption charges he denies, had a 28-day window to secure a coalition following the March 23 vote, Israel's fourth in less than two years.The 71-year-old's right-wing Likud party won the most seats in the vote, but he and his allies came up short of an absolute majority in the 120-seat Knesset, Israel's parliament.The results delivered by a deeply fractured electorate left Netanyahu with a daunting path towards 61 seats, as voters broadly chose not to reward him for a successful coronavirus vaccination campaign.President Reuven Rivlin's office said in a statement that Netanyahu had "informed (the presidency) that he was unable to form a government and so returned the mandate to the president."In power from 1996 to 1999 and again since 2009, Netanyahu has acquired a reputation as a master political survivor and Israeli media had over the past four weeks feverishly speculated about deals he was hatching to stay in power.But the obstacles that faced Netanyahu the morning after the vote remained largely unchanged.A Netanyahu-led coalition likely would have required tacit cooperation between the conservative Islamic Raam party and the far-right Religious Zionism alliance, whose leaders have hurled incendiary anti-Arab rhetoric during their political careers.Raam's leader Mansour Abbas had said he was open to any arrangement that improved living standards for Israel's 20 percent Arab minority.But Religious Zionism's leader Bezalel Smotrich has repeatedly called Raam "terror supporters" who he refused to work with.Netanyahu also could have made up the numbers by making peace with his estranged former protégé, the religious nationalist Naftali Bennett, and convincing Likud defectors in the New Hope party to return home.New Hope's leader Gideon Saar maintained that his party was committed to ousting Netanyahu.Bennett, a multi-millionaire former tech entrepreneur, said Monday he could have endorsed Netanyahu to preserve right-wing governance but saw no path for the prime minister to clinch a viable coalition.Likud on Wednesday blasted Bennett for what it called "his refusal to form a right-wing government."Bennett has long been viewed as a hardliner and enthusiastic supporter of Jewish settlement expansion on occupied Palestinian territory in the West Bank.But he sought to highlight his business and management credentials as pandemic closures ravaged Israel's economy.Bennett has said his top priority is avoiding a fifth election and that he would work towards a unity government if Netanyahu could not form a coalition.Bennett may end up leading such a unity government, despite his Yamina party only controlling seven seats.'Historic opportunity' Rivlin said he would contact political leaders on Wednesday morning "regarding the continuation of the process of forming a government."He can assign a new 28-day mandate to another lawmaker, with opposition leader Yair Lapid the most likely choice after his centrist Yesh Atid party finished second in the vote.Lapid has confirmed that he offered Bennett the chance to serve first as premier in a rotational coalition, in the interest of ending Netanyahu's tenure."There is an historic opportunity. To break down the barriers at the heart of Israeli society. To unite religious and secular, left and right and center," Lapid said Monday."It's time to choose. Between a unity government or ongoing division."The former television presenter said last week's stampede that killed 45 mainly ultra-Orthodox Jews at a religious festival was a consequence of Israel lacking a "functioning government."He conceded that an ideologically divided coalition forged mainly through shared opposition against Netanyahu "won't be perfect", but would prioritise national interests.Parliament optionsRather than tap another lawmaker to form a government, the president could ask the Knesset to select a name, a move unlikely to break the deadlock that could accelerate Israel's return to the polls.In a widely-criticised manouevre, Netanyahu and his allies have flirted with legislation to create a direct vote for prime minister, hoping he would emerge victorious in a divided field.Likud members made moves to advance such legislation as the prime minister's mandate was expiring on Tuesday, but with little sign of success.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/netanyahu-loses-mandate-to-form-israel-govt-opening-door-for-rivals-101620172829697.html

Commentator and former Test cricket star Michael Slater was among those who pilloried Morrison’s decision, saying it was a “disgrace”.“Blood on your hands PM. How dare you treat us like this,” he had tweeted. Morrison later said the idea he had blood on his hands was “absurd”.“The buck stops here when it comes to these decisions, and I’m going to take decisions that I believe are going to protect Australia from a third wave,” he said. “I’m working to bring them home safely,” he added, indicating that repatriation flights could begin soon after May 15.20 countries set to back vaccine passport effortsThe world’s 20 major economies backed efforts to introduce vaccine passports to boost travel, stressing that a resumption is crucial for a global economic recovery, according to a draft statement seen by Bloomberg.Singapore steps up curbs as infection clusters growSingapore has announced new curbs including a ban on spectators at sporting events amid reports of growing clusters. There was alarm after a cluster at a major hospital grew to 40 Covid-19 infections.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/australia-faces-ire-backtracks-on-ban-101620155150876.html

For the first time, no Left, Congress and Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader attended the ceremony. Bengal Congress president Adhir Chowdhury, whose party could not win a single seat, was at home in Murshidabad district. CPI (M) leader and Left Front chairman Biman Bose too did not attend the meeting. The Left parties too scored a nil in the contest. BJP state president Dilip Ghosh, whose party is now the principal opposition said, “I stayed away in protest against the attack on our supporters across the state.” The BJP won 77 out of 292 seats. Polls at two assembly seats in Murshidabad will be held later as two candidates have died of Covid-19 in mid-April. Banerjee was sworn in by Dhankhar at 10.45 am. The ceremony was followed by a tea session. Other ministers will be sworn in on Thursday by TMC leader Subrata Mukherjee, the protem speaker. Dhankhar, while delivering a speech after the ceremony, referred to the incidents of violence. “For the sake of people’s interest, we have to rise above partisan interest,” he said. In her brief speech, Banerjee appealed to all political parties to maintain peace. “No violence will be tolerated. We will take stern action,” she said. While talking to reporters after the ceremony, Dhankhar indirectly accused the chief minister of not taking any action to stop the violence after poll results were announced on May 2. “Please check the law and find out when the model code of conduct for the elections ended,” he said when he was told that TMC argued that Banerjee could not give orders to government officers as the model code was in force. “It is unfortunate that within 30 minutes of reading out the oath the governor attacked the government,” said TMC secretary general Partha Chatterjee who attended the ceremony. Banerjee entered Nabanna, the state secretariat in Howrah district, at 11.40 am. Top bureaucrats welcomed her with a guard of honour. In view of the sharp spike in coronavirus infections in the state, the guest list at Raj Bhawan was kept short and only a handful of elected TMC candidates and prospective members of the upcoming cabinet accompanied Banerjee. Those who visited Raj Bhawan included Banerjee’s nephew and the party’s youth wing president Abhishek Banerjee and her election strategist Prashant Kishor. Dhankhar was seen interacting with Abhishek Banerjee and Kishor while greeting the guests. The TMC leadership had also invited CPI(M)’s stalwart Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee but the former chief minister, who is indisposed for a long time, could not leave home. National leaders who congratulated Banerjee on Twitter included Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi, Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal, Odisha chief minister Naveen Patnaik, Rajasthan chief minister Ashok Gehlot, NCP president Sharad Pawar, Samajwadi Party leader Akhilesh Yadav, DMK leader M K Stalin, Chhattisgarh chief minister Bhupesh Baghel, Jharkhand chief minister Hemant Soren, RJD leaders Lalu Prasad Yadav and his son Tejashwi Yadav, JKNC vice-president Omar Abdullah and JKPDP president Mehbooba Mufti.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mamata-banerjee-sworn-in-as-bengal-cm-governor-points-at-post-poll-violence-101620238898528.html

In a significant ramp up of supply to the national capital over the past two days, the national carrier has been delivering more than 200 MT liquid oxygen daily to Delhi since Monday amid acute shortage. Among other states Delhi has received the maximum supply till now followed by 174 MT oxygen to Maharashtra, 641 MT to UP, 190 MT to MP, 229MT to Haryana so far, according to the ministry of railways. “Overcoming all hurdles and finding new solutions, Indian Railways is continuing its journey of bringing relief by delivering liquid medical oxygen to various states across the country. So far, Indian Railways has delivered 2067MT (approx.) of LMO in 137 tankers to various states across the country,” the ministry said in a statement on Wednesday morning. 34 Oxygen Express trains have already completed their journey so far and have delivered more than 2067 metric tonnes liquid medical oxygen (LMO) to various states. Till Tuesday evening, 10 oxygen express trains with 37 tankers on board were en route to various states while 58 trains have completed their journey so far. On Monday, Delhi received 205 MT and on Tuesday morning it received 244 MT of liquid medical oxygen, according to the ministry. The move is expected to give a breather to the national capital struggling with acute shortage of oxygen supply since the past few weeks. The Delhi government has demanded 976 MT of medical oxygen to add 1,200 ICU and 15,000 oxygen beds. Several hospitals in Delhi sent out desperate calls to authorities to replenish their oxygen supplies when they dropped precariously, threatening lives as the health infrastructure was crumbling under the pressure of an unprecedented rise in the number of Covid-19 patients requiring oxygen or ICU support. The Central government last week directed states to ensure free movement of vehicles carrying oxygen amid reports of some states diverting the vehicles for local use even as hospitals sent out frantic appeals for emergency supplies. Railways has also said that the decision for allocating oxygen supply to states comes under the Empowered Group 2 (EG2), a group formed by the PMO comprising officials from different ministries and experts. The group has been given the job of mapping the sources of medical oxygen and their production capacity to match the requirement of 12 high-burden states.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/railways-increase-supply-of-oxygen-to-delhi-delivers-707-mt-amid-shortage-101620236258232.html

Thackeray termed the verdict as 'disappointing' and said that the longstanding demand for reservation for Marathas amplifies across the state. Thackeray also spoke on the challenges that the state faces owing to the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic that has spiralled out of control. Maharashtra continues to be the worst-affected state due to the second, more deadlier wave of Covid-19 since February.Here are the top quotes from chief minister Uddhav Thackeray's address to the state of Maharashtra:On coronavirus situation in the state"The Covid-19 cases have already started declining in some districts but they are rising in others. We have to be careful as the third wave of Covid-19 is coming."On Maharashtra's preparedness to fight the pandemic"We have started preparations for the third wave. We have directed to increase oxygen production by 3,000 metric tonnes from the current 1,200 metric tonnes. We have also started 'Mission Oxygen' so that there is no shortage of medical oxygen in the state."On Supreme Court's verdict on Maratha reservation"The verdict on the Maratha reservation is disappointing. We have been fighting for it for the last many years. All the parties unanimously cleared it in the state legislature. It was challenged in the high court and was cleared, after which it was challenged in the Supreme Court. Today the decision by the apex court has shown us a way. The court has said that the right to give reservation is with the Centre and the President."On Centre's role in the Maratha reservation"The Centre has taken stand in matters be it Shah Bano case or the abrogation of Article 370 in Jammu and Kashmir. I request them with folded hands to take a decision."On the next by the Maharashtra government on Maratha reservation"We will send an official letter tomorrow in this regard. We will personally go and meet as well, if it is required. This demand is not just of a community but of the entire Maharashtra.

This is where neutralising antibody cocktails like casirivimab and imdevimab can play a role in the fight against Covid-19 and in the treatment of high risk patients before their condition worsens. This outpatient treatment for Covid-19 will be complementary to the ongoing vaccination drive and support our fight against the pandemic in India,” said V Simpson Emmanuel, managing director, Roche Pharma India. The approval for the antibody cocktail— Casirivimab and Imdevimab— was based on the data that has been filed for the EUA in the United States, and the scientific opinion of the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) in the European Union.Both Casirivimab and Imdevimab are human immunoglobulin G-1 (IgG1) monoclonal antibodies produced by recombinant DNA technology.Monoclonal antibodies are laboratory-made proteins that mimic the immune system’s ability to fight off harmful pathogens such as viruses. Casirivimab and imdevimab are monoclonal antibodies that are specifically directed against the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19, and designed to block the virus’ attachment and entry into human cells.“Thanks to its specific engineering of two neutralising antibodies which bind to different parts of the virus spike, the Casirivimab and imdevimab cocktail remains efficacious against widest spread variants and reduces the risk of losing its neutralisation potency against new emerging variants,” the company said in a statement.The antibody cocktail is to be administered for the treatment of mild to moderate Covid-19 cases in adults and pediatric patients (12 years of age or older, weighing at least 40 kg) who are confirmed to be infected with SARS-COV2, and who are at high risk of developing severe Covid-19 disease.It could significantly help these high-risk patients before their condition worsens. On March 23 2021, Roche announced that a large phase III global trial (n=4,567) in high-risk non-hospitalised Covid-19 patients (”outpatients”) met its primary endpoint, showing that Casirivimab and imdevimab significantly reduced the risk of hospitalisation or death by 70% compared to placebo. Casirivimab and imdevimab also significantly shortened the duration of symptoms by four days.Casirivimab and Imdevimab is approved at a combined dose of 1200 mg (600 mg of each drug) administered by intravenous infusion or subcutaneous route. It has to be stored at 2 °C to 8 °C. This Emergency Use Authorisation will now enable Roche to import the globally manufactured product batches to India and will be marketed as well as distributed in India through a strategic partnership with Cipla Limited.“We are deeply committed to exploring all possible treatment options and being at the forefront in our fight against Covid-19. This partnership with Roche is a significant step in enabling access to promising treatments in furtherance to our purpose of ‘Caring for Life,” said Umang Vohra, MD and Global CEO Cipla.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/roches-antibody-cocktail-for-treating-covid-19-gets-regulatory-approval-in-india-101620221434887.html

On Tuesday, the state had reported 37,190 new cases and 57 deaths. Though the fatality rate is low in the state (below 0.4) statistics show it is steadily climbing.In the letter to the Prime Minister, the CM the said medical oxygen storage in the state should be augmented urgently as there is an increased demand for the life-saving gas. “To augment storage we need 1000 tonnes of imported liquid medical oxygen. The Ministry of External Affairs may be advised to allot the required quantity partly from the current tranche of imports and balance from future imports,” he said.He also asked the PM to provide more oxygen concentrators, ventilators and other equipment on priority basis considering the high volume of cases. The state has so far vaccinated 74 lakh people, almost 20 per cent of its 3.25 crore population. The Union Health Ministry had recently lauded the state’s zero wastage of vaccine while in some states it is between 5 and 18 per cent. Vijayan has also requested the PM to send more vaccines-- about 50 lakh doses of Covishield and 25 lakh Covaxin doses. Currently, the state has a stock of 272.2 metric tonnes of liquid oxygen and 8.97 mt of medical oxygen. In the current scenario, Kerala needs 108 mt of oxygen daily, health ministry statistics show. What is really of concern for the state is that the number of patients who need oxygen is rising alarmingly. In some of the worst-affected districts like Kozhikode and Ernakulam, most government hospitals are filled to capacity. Kerala had managed the first wave of coronavirus infections well; however, the ground situation shows the second wave has put tremendous strain on its overworked and overstretched healthcare infrastructure.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pinarayi-vijayan-writes-to-pm-modi-asks-for-more-oxygen-vaccines-amid-covid-19-spike-101620218794381.html

Each container that is shipped contains about 350 cylinders of 50 litre capacity.“We look at this as a critical or emergency duty and will continue to produce oxygen cylinders for as long as India needs them.

The process of induction of Rafale jets has become tedious during the coronavirus pandemic with the IAF pilots having to undergo complete quarantine in France before being cleared to fly back to India. The IAF is currently using seven Rafales to train the pilots in France.While the Golden Arrows squadron in Ambala has 18 fighters with state of the art weapons and missiles, the remaining planes, perhaps six, will form the second squadron in Hashimara airbase. Sitting on the mouth of Silliguri corridor, Hashimara airbase will add teeth to the entire eastern sector against the Chinese Air Force. The airbase is currently being overhauled to become the second home of Rafale fighters.ALSO READ: Rafale weaponry prompts China, Pak to alter defence postureWhile French manufacturer Dassault will deliver all the 36 Rafales by latter half of the year, the IAF is in a state of preparedness as the disengagement and de-escalation plan with the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) in eastern Ladakh is still not complete as the Chinese army is not willing to restore status quo ante in Gogra-Hot Springs sector along the Line of Actual Control in Ladakh.This is a matter of serious military concern as the Indian Army continues to remain deployed in the area and is monitoring Chinese Army movements.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/three-more-rafale-fighter-jets-take-off-from-france-for-iaf-airbase-101620204182322.html
05-05-2021||India||NHRC asks Centre, states to maintain Covid-19 dashboards||The National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) has asked the Centre and state governments to maintain universally functional Covid-19 dashboards displaying real time availability of isolation beds, oxygenated beds, ICU beds and ventilator support beds so that every person can get the treatment as a basic human right. In a detailed advisory sent on Tuesday evening amid the devastating second wave, the NHRC has also said that there should be universal coverage and non-discriminatory pricing of Covid vaccines in all health facilities in the country, and if feasible, “vaccination should be made free for everyone” irrespective of private or public health establishment. The apex human rights body has stated the vaccination should reach the people who are most vulnerable and at the most risk like destitute, homeless, prisoners, migrant workers, beggars, etc; and the arrangements for people not in possession of Aadhar cards or other documents must be made. It has said the government should plan its Covid-19 response in a way that the country is prepared for another wave in the future. “Planning must be done for increasing the number of beds, especially ICU beds, and strict measures must be adopted throughout the year to maintain adequate stocks of resources, including RT-PCR testing requirements, essential medicines, vaccines, oxygen, ICU equipment etc., in all the clinical establishments,” according to the advisory, seen by HT. Also Read | Kerala CM Vijayan writes to PM Modi seeking oxygen, vaccines, ventilatorsThe Commission has acted on ground reports related to human rights violation, particularly people being denied basic right to access healthcare. Asserting that India is now facing a public health emergency of unprecedented proportion, the NHRC said the acute shortage of critical care beds, oxygen supplies, essential medicines, emergency transport and other facilities is resulting in high mortality and putting a huge burden on the hospitals and healthcare professionals, beyond their capacity so much so that the healthcare infrastructure of the country appears to be on the verge of a breakdown. Apart from asking states and Centre to ensure seamless supply of oxygen, NHRC has said every Covid-19 patient, whether his report is positive or not, must get treatment free of cost in public health facility. If there are no beds in private hospitals, it is the obligation of health department (of respective states) to provide care to the patient. It said, “no patient or family should be left to cater on their own”. For private hospitals charging exorbitant amounts from patients, the NHRC has said the government should deploy officials to audit adherence of private hospitals for ensuring regulation of rates for Covid patients. “Bills of higher amount, say more than [Rs] 1.5 lakh, may be randomly checked/audited, and all hospitals must provide a detailed itemised bill to the patients or their caregivers,” NHRC advisory says. It has also asked the government to cap the prices of Covid-19 treatment resources such as essential medicines, oxygen cylinders, ambulance services, etc., so that patients/families are not exploited. “A Grievance Redressal Mechanism must be established by the Centre and state governments in this regard,” it said. Similarly, it has asked for action on hoarders/black-marketers, adding that people complaining against such acts should not be harassed by the administration. The human rights body has asked authorities to improve the management of crematoriums and burial grounds to reduce waiting time for cremations/burials by adding more such facilities. Use of electric crematoriums should be promoted by the stakeholders. It has recommended building an App for cremations and burials. Significantly, NHRC has said that exact reporting of Covid cases or related deaths should be encouraged to portray the correct picture and magnitude of the problem.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nhrc-asks-centre-states-to-maintain-covid-19-dashboards-101620212373682.html

I request that the ministry of external affairs may be advised to allot the required quantity partly from the current tranche of imports and balance from future imports. Allotment of 500 metric tonnes (MT) of LMO from the nearest steel plant to Kerala may also be advised” Vijayan wrote in the letter.Also Read| 'Good to see': PM Modi retweets Pinarayi Vijayan on reducing vaccine wastagePointing out that Kerala has one of the highest numbers of active cases of the Covid-19 disease across India, he also requested PM Modi for the urgent allotment of ventilators, pressure swing adsorption (PSA) plants, oxygen concentrators and tankers.The state is also facing an acute shortage of vaccine doses and the chief minister requested that at least five million doses of Covishield and 2.5 million doses of Covaxin be given.The Centre should take into account the number of beneficiaries awaiting the second dose as well as those registered for the first dose while determining further allotment of doses to other states, Vijayan wrote in the letter.Also Read| Strict curbs in Kerala from Tuesday: What’s allowed, what’s notOver 7.57 million beneficiaries have been administered vaccine doses in Kerala so far of which 6,105,329 have received the first dose while 1,466,846 have received both doses. Earlier on Wednesday, PM Modi had praised the state government’s efforts in reducing vaccine wastage.Kerala on Tuesday added 37,190 new Covid-19 disease cases and 57 more deaths, taking the caseload and death toll to 1,701,979 and 5,507 respectively. The active cases in the state are at 356,872 and recoveries are nearing 1.34 million. Chief minister Vijayan said on Tuesday the daily cases in Kerala are likely to go up further and the virus is yet to peak.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-kerala-cm-vijayan-writes-to-pm-modi-seeking-oxygen-vaccines-ventilators-101620211802945.html

A British official confirmed two positive tests among the Indian delegation. British rules require a 10-day self-isolation period.“Was made aware yesterday evening of exposure to possible Covid positive cases. As a measure of abundant caution and also out of consideration for others, I decided to conduct my engagements in the virtual mode. That will be the case with the G7 Meeting today as well,” said a tweet by Jaishankar, who is on his first foreign trip after India was hit by a devastating second wave of infections.Also Watch | ‘What you call aid, we describe as friendship’: S Jaishankar on Covid crisisThe reports of the Indian delegation members testing positive immediately triggered Covid-19 scare at the G7 meeting. There were also questions as to whether members of other delegations had been exposed in any manner.India is not a member of the G7 and was invited to the meeting as a guest along with Australia, South Korea, South Africa and the chair of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations.British authorities had put in place strict Covid-secure measures for the meeting, which was billed by the UK as a chance to restart in-person diplomacy. There are daily Covid-19 tests throughout the meeting, including self-test kits and an on-site testing facility, strict guidelines on social distancing, and the size of delegations were limited. The delegates are separated by perspex screens during talks.Those at the top of the external affairs ministry have all been vaccinated and undergo regular tests for Covid-19 every week. However, there have been several cases of Coronavirus infections among junior and middle-ranking officials of the ministry in New Delhi in recent weeks.The G7 foreign ministers meeting is a precursor to the main summit to be held at the rural English resort of Cornwall in June. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has been invited to the summit as a guest by his UK counterpart Boris Johnson.The Indian delegation had not attended any event at the main venue at Lancaster House, and meetings scheduled for Wednesday went ahead as planned. British foreign minister Dominic Raab greeted and fist-bumped other G7 members as they arrived at the venue.“We deeply regret that Jaishankar will be unable to attend the meeting today in person,” a senior UK diplomat was quoted as saying by Reuters. “This is exactly why we have put in place strict Covid protocols and daily testing.”Jaishankar met British interior minister Priti Patel on Tuesday and they signed the Migration and Mobility Partnership Agreement to facilitate legal travel. Patel didn’t have to self-isolate because the meeting was held in line with existing rules, and both ministers were wearing masks.Jaishankar held bilateral meetings in London with US secretary of state Antony Blinken, South African foreign minister Naledi Pandor and European Union foreign policy chief Josep Borrell and a trilateral meeting with Australian foreign minister Marise Payne and French foreign minister Jean-Yves Le Drian.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/2-indian-delegation-members-at-g7-meeting-in-london-test-positive-for-covid19-101620211349480.html

05-05-2021||India||MHA asks states, UTs to ensure there are no fires in hospitals||The ministry of home affairs has asked all the states and Union Territories to ensure that no fire incident occurs in any of the health facilities (particularly Covid-19 dedicated facilities) both in the government and private sector. The ministry has taken cognizance of occurrence of fire incidents, caused by short-circuiting, in hospitals and nursing homes in the last few days. In his letter to the states/UTs, Union home secretary Ajay Kumar Bhalla said that in the context of recent fire incidents and the impending summer season, either because of high temperature, lack of maintenance or high load on the internal wirings within the facilities, short circuiting takes place, leading to fire incidents and consequential loss of life and essential infrastructure. The communication added that care should be taken to put in place a plan of action to ensure that no fire incident occurs in these facilities. A fire was reported from a hospital in Vikaspuri on Tuesday in which 26 Covid-19 patients were rescued. Another fire was reported from Virar, Mumbai, on April 23 at Vijay Vallabh hospital in which 15 patients died. On April 25, three patients died in a Surat hospital fire. The MHA has asked the states/UTs to conduct a detailed review with officials from the health, power and fire departments, and prepare a detailed plan of action to ensure that fire safety measures are in place in all hospitals and health facilities. Also Read | MHA seeks report on post-poll violence in BengalBhalla also pointed out to the recently issued advisory of the Director General (Fire Services, Civil Defence and Home Guards) on fire safety in hospitals and nursing homes. The communication highlighted that a large number of Covid-19 cases are under treatment in Covid-dedicated health facilities across the country. “In most of the cases, oxygen supported beds, ICU beds, and ventilators are critical interventions, and therefore, it is important to ensure that there is uninterrupted power supply on regular 24x7 basis, in all the hospitals and medical facilities,” said Press Information Bureau in a statement. It added – “…saving every life is a priority, and it is critical to ensure that required support is provided to all health facilities managing Covid-19 by taking requisite actions in advance to avert any incident, which could hamper effective health care delivery to patients.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mha-asks-states-uts-to-ensure-there-are-no-fires-in-hospitals-101620206782814.html
05-05-2021||India||Modify vaccination plan, HC to C’garh on order linking jabs to financial status||The Chhattisgarh high court has asked the state government to modify its vaccination rollout plan for the 18-44 age group that linked the Covid-19 jabs to the financial status of the beneficiaries, ruling that the government’s April 30 order that decided the state would first administer the vaccines to the “antyodaya group” (poorest of the poor) and then people from the “Below poverty line” wasn’t correct or sustainable.“Prima facie, sub-classification with reference to the ‘financial status’ alone as now ordered is not correct or sustainable,” the two-judge bench of the high court said, suggesting that the government consider quotas to ensure that no section is deprived at any point.“We are of the view that the State Government shall fix a reasonable ratio of allotment of vaccines to the ‘Antyodaya Group’, the persons belonging to the ‘Below Poverty Line’ and the persons belonging to the ‘Above Poverty Line’, with reference to all the relevant aspects including the vulnerability, chance to spread the disease and the number of eligible persons in the group,” the bench of Chief Justice PR Ramachandra Menon and Justice Parth Prateem Sahu said in its order on Wednesday.Janata Congress ( Jogi) chief, Amit Jogi and two others had petitioned the high court against the state government order, arguing that the sub-classification on the basis of a person’s financial status is beyond the constitutional mandate and violation of the law of equality and the equal opportunity before the law and discriminates against citizens with reference to their right to life.Jogi said since the vaccination was the only life-saving measure against Covid-19, its denial to some groups and fixing a priority with reference to the ‘financial status’ is absolutely illegal, illogical and violative of the constitutional provisions and the central government’s vaccination policy.Chhattisgarh advocate general Satish Chandra Verma tried to defend the state’s decision, pointing that since only a limited quantity of vaccines was available for the third phase of vaccination, a sub-classification was felt necessary.The high court, however, did not agree with Jogi’s contention that the government should go by the first-come-first-served principle. This, the judges said, wouldn’t be appropriate for the poor and people living in rural areas. “There are several reasons behind this, such as lack of education, poverty, lack of any smartphones to affect registration in portals, the remoteness of the area where they are living, the lack of access and conveyance, the limited infrastructure available in the place of their living and also the internet connectivity.”The bench said the poor, who may not be able to book their slots online, would be placed at a disadvantage since they would have to go to the nearest centres to make their booking. “But by the time they reach there, the portal may be closed or the bookings/registration may be stopped having obtained saturation, virtually making it detrimental to the right and interest of the children of the lesser God. This being the position, if any steps are taken by the State Government to have the benefit extended to such people as well, the object cannot be doubted.”The court has asked the state government to formulate a scheme for the poor and set up ‘help desks’ providing spot registration and administering vaccines to them, without compromising the right of the other segments who are entitled to have equal treatment with regard to the right to life. The court directed the state government to discuss its suggestion by secretary-level officers and fix the ratio to administer the vaccines in the third phase of vaccination (for the age group of above 18 and below 45 years) in an equitable manner.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hc-blocks-chhattisgarh-govt-s-vaccine-order-that-linked-jabs-to-financial-status-101620206067170.html

05-05-2021||India||Covid-19 forecasters warn India deaths may double in coming weeks||The coronavirus wave that plunged India into the world’s biggest health crisis has the potential to worsen in the coming weeks, with some research models projecting that the death toll could more than double from current levels.A team at the Indian Institute of Science in Bangalore used a mathematical model to predict about 404,000 deaths will occur by June 11 if current trends continue. A model from the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington forecast 1,018,879 deaths by the end of July.While coronavirus cases can be hard to predict, particularly in a sprawling nation like India, the forecasts reflect the urgent need for India to step up public health measures like testing and social distancing. Even if the worst estimates are avoided, India could suffer the world’s biggest Covid-19 death toll. The U.S currently has the largest number of fatalities at around 578,000.India reported a record 3,780 deaths on Wednesday for an overall toll of 226,188, along with 382,315 new cases, taking its outbreak past 20.6 million infections. In recent weeks, the scenes on the ground, with long lines outside crematoriums and hospitals turning away ambulances, have painted a picture of a nation overwhelmed by the crisis.“The next four to six weeks are going to be very, very difficult for India,” said Ashish Jha, the dean of Brown University School of Public Health. “The challenge is going to be to do things now that will make sure it is four weeks, not six or eight, and that we minimize how bad things will get. But in no way is India anywhere near out of the woods.”A spokesperson for the health ministry couldn’t immediately be reached. The ministry said on Monday that in about a dozen states, including Delhi, Chhattisgarh and Maharashtra, there are early signs that the number of daily new infections are starting to plateau.The Indian rupee has declined about 1% this quarter in Asia’s worst performance as investors turned cautious ahead of an unscheduled speech by India’s central bank governor Wednesday. The benchmark S&P BSE Sensex Index is down about 2% as foreign funds sold about $1.7 billion of the nation’s stocks.Economic ImpactA prolonged crisis has the potential to dent the popularity of Prime Minister Narendra Modi as well as slow or reverse India’s recovery from last year’s economic recession. Bloomberg Economics lowered its growth projection for the year ending March 2022 to 10.7% from 12.6%, and even these numbers are flattered by a low base as activity ground to a halt due to a strict lockdown last year.India’s central bank, meanwhile, has announced new loan-relief measures for small businesses and promised to inject 500 billion rupees ($6.8 billion) of liquidity to support the economy.For public health researchers, a key concern is the relative dearth of coronavirus testing, which many scientists believe is causing a sharp undercounting of cases.“It could honestly get a lot worse, which is hard to imagine given how staggering the impacts have already been when you see 400,000 new cases each day and you know that that’s probably an underestimation,” said Jennifer Nuzzo, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security in Baltimore, Maryland.The main metric that officials are watching is the test positivity rate, which is the percentage of people with positive test results. The overall positivity rate is 20% in India now, and in some parts of the country it tops 40%, a shockingly high number that indicates as many as three-fourths of infections are being missed, said Jha.The World Health Organization considers anything above 5% too high, saying that governments should implement social distancing measures until positivity rates are below that level for at least two weeks.“Despite scaling up testing considerably, it’s still not enough to capture all the infected people,” said Soumya Swaminathan, chief scientist at the World Health Organization, speaking on Bloomberg TV. “So the numbers, while very high, are likely an underestimate of the true numbers of infections,” she said. “It’s a grim situation.”Social DistancingThe goal is to run enough tests that a large number of infected people aren’t going undiagnosed. If only the sickest patients are tested, many people with milder disease or no symptoms at all may continue to unwittingly spread the disease.“There are reports of tests being considerably delayed and of patients delaying having to go to hospital as much as they can, given the stresses on the health system,” said Gautam Menon, a professor of physics and biology at Ashoka University, who also works on modeling outbreaks. “We don’t know enough about Covid-19 spread away from the major cities, in the rural heartland of India, although reports from there suggest that the situation is dire.”The U.S. government, as part of a package of supplies for India, pledged last week to send one million rapid tests to India. There are several other things that could be done quickly to try to help staunch the outbreak. High on the list is wearing masks, a crucial element for disease control, said Catherine Blish, an infectious disease specialist and global health expert at Stanford Medicine in California.Major cities in India already require people to wear masks, but such rules can be harder to implement in crowded slums and rural areas. Several states have introduced lockdowns, although Modi has resisted a national effort after one imposed by him last year fueled a humanitarian crisis with migrant workers fleeing the cities on foot and in some cases bringing the virus with them.LockdownsThe Indian Institute of Science has estimated that with a 15-day lockdown deaths could be lower at 300,000, falling to 285,000 with a 30-day lockdown. IMHE estimates a lower death toll of around 940,000 by the end of July with universal mask wearing.Vaccines will be the big way to remove risks, although it will take time to get there, public health experts say.It takes several weeks for immunity to build after someone has been vaccinated. The process is even longer with those that require two shots, stretching the process out to six weeks to two months.“The vaccines are working,” said Kim Mulholland, an Australian pediatrician and leader of the infection and immunity group at the Murdoch Children’s Research Institute in Melbourne. “They just haven’t got the capacity.”Ultimately, cases will come down, it’s just a matter of when, said Michael Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota, and an adviser to U.S. President Joe Biden. Scientists still don’t have a good understanding of why Covid-19 comes in sudden, roller-coaster-like changes, he said.“It will eventually burn itself through the population,” Osterholm said. “Within several weeks to a month and a half, you will see this peak come back down, and it’s likely to come down quickly.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid19-forecasters-warn-india-deaths-may-double-in-coming-weeks-101620204376282.html
05-05-2021||India||Augmenting oxygen supply from all sources: Centre tells Gujarat high court||The central government has told the Gujarat high court that it is augmenting oxygen supply for Covid-19 patients from all available sources within India and also importing it from other countries through "diplomatic channels as well as the personal intervention of the political executive".In a report on the supply of medical oxygen submitted before the high court on Monday, the Centre said a total allocation of 8,410 metric tonnes of medical oxygen has been made for 22 high burden states and union territories based on their demand, the Centre told the high court on Tuesday.The states should also make an effort to manage their oxygen demand through rational usage of this "scarce and critical resource" by continuous and close monitoring of hospitals and stringent audit of the oxygen usage, it said. A division bench of Chief Justice Vikram Nath and Justice B D Karia had sought the Centre's response while hearing a PIL taken up suo motu (on its own) on the Covid-19 situation.The Union government said it is "augmenting oxygen supply from all available sources within India and also importing oxygen from other countries using not only the diplomatic channels but also personal intervention of the political executive."The process is going on at the national level and is also being undertaken at an international level, it stated. Any deviation by any judicial order based upon fact, situation and considerations existing in one state will "completely frustrate the whole exercise and shall have a cascading effect", the Centre said."It is submitted that while this exercise is primarily in the nature of managing the supply side of medical oxygen, it is imperative that there are simultaneous efforts to manage the demand side by all the states by focusing on rational usage of this scarce and critical resource in the present circumstances through continuous and close monitoring of all hospitals as well as stringent measures of oxygen usage audit," the Centre said.It said the supply of liquid medical oxygen (LMO) by the steel sector increased from 1,000 MT per day in the first week of April 2021 to around 2,600 MT on April 21. From April 28 onwards, Gujarat was allocated 975 MT oxygen, it said. Based on the projected requirements of these critically affected states, 4,880 MT, 5,619 MT and 6,593 MT were mapped for the supply of medical oxygen to 12 states with a high number of Covid-19 cases, to meet their projected demand as of April 20, April 25, and April 30, respectively, and duly approved, it said.The initial demand for 15 states was revised to 5,619 MT from 4,880 MT as of April 20, with the requirement of Gujarat being at 1,000 MT, it said.Against its production capacity of 847 MT as of April 28, Gujarat required 1,000 MT LMO, and was allocated 975 MT, out of which the state received 902 MT, the central government said. "No stone is left unturned to ensure quickest possible transit of medical oxygen," it said, adding that the defence aircraft and Indian navy ships are being used for the purpose.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/augmenting-oxygen-supply-from-all-sources-centre-tells-gujarat-high-court-101620204333984.html
05-05-2021||India||Jammu and Kashmir police say top Lashkar commander killed in Sopore last night||Jammu and Kashmir Police has identified one of the two terrorists killed Wednesday night in Sopore as a top Lashkar commander, involved in the killing of two councillors in March this year. The other one has been identified as a local who joined terrorist ranks very recently. The duo was killed in an operation launched on Tuesday afternoon.Police said Hamas alias Asrar was a Pakistani citizen, who was affiliated with the Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) and active in areas such as Zaingeeer, Warpora, Hatlangoo, Brath, Darpora, Bomai, Zaloora and Nathipora.“He was active since 2018, being in the list of top 60 militants released by the JKP [police] recently, and was instrumental in misleading the youth... to join terrorist organisations,” said Kashmir inspector general (IG) Vijay Kumar.LeT is an Islamist jihadist group based in Pakistan. It was founded in 1987 by Hafiz Sayeed, one of India’s most wanted terrorists. LeT has been accused of attacking military and civilian targets in India, most notably the 2001 Indian Parliament attack and the 2008 Mumbai attacks. It is designated as a terrorist organisation by India, UN and the United States.Kumar said Hamas was involved in multiple terror related offences which include grenade throwing on security establishments and the recent killing of two councillors Peer Riyaaz and Peer Shamsuddin along with a special protection officer (SPO) Shafaat Ahmed on March 29.Six cases were registered against the Pakistan based terrorist, he added.The other militant killed in the encounter was identified as Waseem Nazir Lone of Hathlangoo, Sopore. Police said Lone was involved in stone pelting and worked as an over ground worker for the terror group before he went missing and joined Lashkar a few days ago.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jammu-and-kashmir-police-say-top-lashkar-commander-killed-in-sopore-last-night-101620204322494.html
05-05-2021||India||EC was split over move to seek gag order on media||There were disagreements within the Election Commission of India (EC) over its move to seek a gag on media reportage of the Madras high court’s oral observations on April 26 blaming the poll body singularly for the second Covid-19 wave in the country, people aware of the matter said. One of the persons said disagreements also included over moving the Supreme Court against the remarks. The disagreements surfaced days after the Supreme Court on Monday called “far-fetched” an EC plea before the Madras high court for restraining media from reporting oral observations of the judges. The judges also said officials of the poll body should probably be tried on murder charges for allowing political parties to hold massive rallies without following Covid-19 norms.The EC opted to seek a gag order even as the differing opinions emerged at the poll body’s meetings, the persons said and added the decision was not unanimous. The poll body comprises chief election commissioner Sushil Chandra and commissioner Rajiv Kumar. The post of the second election commissioner has been vacant since Sunil Arora retired in April.In a statement on Wednesday, the EC maintained the commission always has appropriate deliberations before any decisions are taken while expressing its commitment to free media. “In the context of involvement of media, the Commission wishes to clarify that it stands sincerely committed to its faith in free media. The Commission, as a whole and each one of its members, recognises the positive role played by media in the conduct of all elections in the past and present and in strengthening electoral democracy in the country,” it said. The EC said it was unanimous that before the Supreme Court there should not be any prayer for restriction on media reporting.Also Read | SC nixes Maratha reservation, no review of 50% ceiling on quotaA gag on the media was not part of the EC’s prayer before the Supreme Court, where the poll body said judges should use “temperate language” and not blame it for something which was not within their domain. The EC argued it does not take over the governance during the election and issues directions and guidelines that the states are bound to follow. The Supreme Court asked the EC to take the observations by the high court in the right spirit. It told EC that the high courts were also a constitutional body and that the Supreme Court will not demoralise their judges by issuing any kind of restraint on their process of judicial determination.The Supreme Court reserved its order on the EC’s appeal against the observations and indicated that a judgment will be delivered this week.The EC has faced criticism for conducting an eight-phase long election in West Bengal amid the pandemic and refusing to club the last three phases despite a surge in infections.In the statement, the EC said it recognises the media’s role in ensuring transparency in the poll processes. “The Commission very specially recognises media’s role in enhancing effectiveness of election management and in reinforcing transparency from the very beginning of election process till the end, including transparent coverage during all processes, campaigning and from polling station level to counting. EC’s approach on the collaboration with media is that of a natural ally and remains unchanged.”The Supreme Court on Monday also said it was not in the favour of putting fetters on judges’ remarks or their media reportage. It said high courts must get “complete freedom” to decide issues before them, and that the “media is a very important and powerful watchdog of the judicial processes”.The high court on April 26 made the remarks against EC during a hearing of a writ petition seeking a direction for safety measures and fairness during vote counting in Tamil Nadu’s Karur constituency.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ecwas-split-over-move-to-seek-gag-order-on-media-101620204082494.html
05-05-2021||India||Chhattisgarh HC directs state government to modify vaccination distribution plan||Chhattisgarh high court has set aside the state government’s decision to first vaccinate poor people of the state in the third phase of Covid inoculation drive by ruling that a division according to financial status alone was unconstitutional. The court said other groups were entitled to equal treatment with regard to the right to life. However, it asked the government to extend special facilities to the underprivileged to ensure they are not pushed out of the vaccination queue by people with resources.“But such a step has necessarily to be in conformity with the constitutional mandate and in tune with the guidelines issued by the Central Government at the national level. Prima facie, sub-classification with reference to the ‘financial status’ alone as now ordered, is not correct or sustainable,” the court order stated. Chhattisgarh government’s order on April 30 created a priority list for the third phase of Covid vaccination with the members of the Antyodaya Group (poorest among the poor) at the top, followed by persons below the poverty line (BPL group), who in turn preceded those above it. The government reasoned that due to limited availability, vaccines will be administered in the state following this sub categorisation of all beneficiaries in the age group of 18 to 45 years.The order was challenged in the high court by Janata Congress (Jogi) chief, Amit Jogi and two other petitioners, who argued that the sub-classification was beyond the constitutional mandate and amounted to a violation of the law of equality and was discriminatory since all citizens had equal right to life.“In so far as the vaccination is the only life saving measure against Covid-19 and since the ‘right to life’ is common to any citizen, denial of vaccine to some groups, fixing a priority with reference to the ‘financial status’ is absolutely illegal, illogical and violative of the constitutional provisions and also the vaccination policy of the Central government,” the petitioners had pleaded. Chhattisgarh advocate general Satish Chandra Verma defended the state saying sub-classification was necessary since the members of the Antyodaya group were more vulnerable and less resourceful, therefore meriting special treatment.The HC agreed with Verma’s contention in so much that poverty, lack of education, access, smart phones and other resources were likely to make it very difficult for the poor to get their due in vaccine and it therefore asked the state to institute special facilities like ‘help desks’, ‘spot registrations’ to vaccinate them without compromising the other segments’ right to equal treatment with regard to the right to life.“ ...We are of the view that the State Government shall fix a reasonable ratio of allotment of vaccines to the Antyodaya group, ... the BPL group and the persons... above poverty line, with reference to all the relevant aspects including the vulnerability, chance to spread the disease and the number of eligible persons in the group,” the court order said. It directed the state government to fix the ratio of vaccine in the light of the order for equitable distribution in the third phase.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/chhattisgarh-hc-directs-state-government-to-modify-vaccination-distribution-plan-101620203902474.html
05-05-2021||India||Every life is priority, ensure 24x7 power at all hospitals: Centre to states||In the aftermath of the back-to-back fire incidents at Covid-19 hospitals, the ministry of home affairs on Wednesday wrote to all chief secretaries of states and union territories asking them for a plan of action to ensure that no fire incident occurs in any of the health facilities, particularly in Covid-dedicated facilities. Not of government facilities, private facilities should also be checked thoroughly, the ministry said.Incidents of a short circuit are taking place, either because of the high temperature or the lack of maintenance or because of the high load on internal wirings within the facilities, the ministry wrote.There should be a detailed review of all health facilities by the officials of the health, fire and power departments. "The States & UTs have also been requested to issue directions to the concerned officials at various levels, that health facility should be visited by field-level officials, to examine internal wirings and availability of functional safety equipment as per fire safety guidelines, within these facilities, and necessary remedial action be taken immediately in case any deficiencies are found," the PIB press release said.Emphasising that saving every life is a priority, the Centre said that a large number of Covid-19 cases are under treatment in Covid-dedicated facilities. Most of them are at ICU beds, oxygen-supported beds and are under ventilation. "It is important to ensure that there is the uninterrupted power supply on a regular 24x7 basis, in all the hospitals and medical facilities," the Centre said.On late Tuesday night, a fire broke out at UK Nursing Home in Delhi's Vikaspuri. There were 26 patients and all of them were admitted to the hospital for Covid-19 treatment. No injuries were reported.At least 15 Covid-19were killed in April after a fire broke out at the second floor ICU of Vijay Vallabh Hospital in Thane's Virar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/every-life-is-priority-ensure-24x7-power-at-all-hospitals-centre-to-states-101620203505469.html
05-05-2021||India||India accounts for 46% of world's new Covid-19 cases, quarter of deaths||India accounted for 46% of the new Covid-19 cases recorded worldwide last week and one in four of deaths, the World Health Organization (WHO) said on Wednesday.The surge of the coronavirus in India, including of a highly infectious new variant first identified there, has seen hospitals runs out of beds and oxygen, and morgues and crematoriums overflowing. Many people have died in ambulances and car parks waiting for a bed or oxygen.Worldwide, 5.7 million new cases were reported last week and more than 93,000 deaths, the WHO said in its weekly epidemiological report. India reported nearly 2.6 million new cases, a 20% increase on the previous week, and 23,231 deaths.The figures are based on official tallies, so India's proportion could be even larger if, as many experts believe, a large number of cases and deaths are not being recorded there as the system becomes overwhelmed. India accounts for almost 18% of the world's population.There are signs that India's outbreak is spreading to its neighbours. Nepal recorded a 137% increase in cases to 31,088 last week, while Sri Lanka's Covid-19 outbreak was also growing, the WHO said.On Tuesday India became the second country to record 20 million infections, after the United States. India's coronavirus deaths rose by a record 3,780 during the last 24 hours, with daily infections rising by 382,315 on Wednesday, health ministry data showed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-accounts-for-46-of-world-s-new-covid-19-cases-quarter-of-deaths-101620201317349.html

"Reducing vaccine wastage is important in strengthening the fight against Covid-19," the PM tweeted.In his message, he chose to retweet Kerala chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan's message where Vijayan wrote Kerala has received 73,38,806 doses of vaccine from the Centre. "We've provided 74,26,164 doses, even making use of the extra dose available as wastage factor in each vial. Our health workers, especially nurses have been super efficient and deserve our wholehearted appreciation!" Vijayan said.Vaccine wastage is one of the issues being closely monitored by the Centre as vaccine stocks are depleting fast. According to the ministry's data, till 8am on Wednesday, Meghalaya, Nagaland, Bihar, Punjab, Dadra and Nagar Haveli, Haryana, Manipur, Assam, Tamil Nadu, Lakshadweep reported wastage between 4.01 per cent to 9.76 per cent. Kerala has a low vaccine wastage percentage.In a meeting held with chief ministers earlier, PM Modi had advised using vaccines as and when they come, to avoid vaccine wastage. Vaccine hesitance was also a reason blamed for vaccine wastage, as if a vial is opened and not enough beneficiaries turn up, it may lead to wastage. On Wednesday, the Centre gave a state-wise outline of the number of doses still available with the states and the UTs. More than 94.47 lakh Covid-19 vaccine doses are there with the states at present and 36 lakh doses will be reaching them in the next three days, the ministry said,||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/good-to-see-pm-modi-retweets-pinarayi-vijayan-on-reducing-vaccine-wastage-101620200268057.html

The Cabinet’s approval was “ex-post facto”, meaning the programme announced last month is already under implementation. The allocation of additional foodgrain free of cost to approximately 798 million beneficiaries stands at 5 kg per person per month. It would entail an estimated food subsidy of ₹25,332.92 crore, an official statement said. According to official data, the Food Corporation of India currently has 77 million tonnes of foodgrains, 3.6 times more than the required emergency reserve for this time of the year. Also Read | Pandemic rages, but farmers defy odds with winter harvestNearly 810 million qualify for subsidised foodgrains under the food security law, under which beneficiaries get 5kg of wheat or rice covers per person per month. The Act applies to 67% of the population (75% in rural areas and 50% in urban pockets). The Centre will “bear full expenditure” of over ₹26,000 crore for the additional foodgrain allocation to the beneficiaries as part of Central assistance to states, an official said. Record Covid-19 infections and a crippled healthcare system have already left migrant workers jobless and hit the income of the poor due to lockdown-like restrictions in many states, as authorities battle the pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cabinet-approves-pmgkay-food-aid-scheme-101620200602434.html
05-05-2021||India||Will meet Adar Poonawalla on Covid vaccines once he returns from London, says Maharashtra minister||The Maharashtra government has had no communication with Serum Institute of India CEO Adar Poonwalla on vaccine procurement after Adar's interview to a British media house where he claimed he was under immense pressure from some of the most powerful people in the country for vaccines. "When he returns (from London), we will have a meeting with him," Rajesh Tope told news agency PTI.Earlier, Tope said as Poonawalla hails from Pune and as his operation is based out of Pune, he should think about Maharashtra and give priority to his home state in allocating Covishield.As India started the third phase of the vaccination drive from May 1, which also includes people between the age group of 18 and 44 years, demand for vaccines doubled. The Centre provided Y category security to Poonawalla after his company wrote to the home ministry complaining of threats to Poonawalla.Adar Poonawalla must disclose who are threatening him, say Maharashtra leaders“I’m staying here (London) for an extended time because I don't want to go back to that situation. Everything falls on my shoulders but I can't do it alone...I don’t want to be in a situation where you are just trying to do your job, and just because you can’t supply the needs of X, Y or Z you really don’t want to guess what they are going to do,” Poonawalla told the British newspaper.Assuring that the work is going on in full swing at Serum, Poonawalla said he would soon come back to the country.According to PTI reports, The world's largest vaccine maker is looking to invest 240 million pounds in the UK to expand its vaccine business as part of the 1-billion pound India-UK Enhanced Trade Partnership. Serum is also conducting phase one trials of a nasal vaccine against coronavirus in the UK.Reacting to his complaints, the Maharashtra government and the state Congress earlier said Adar Poonawalla must complain to the state police regarding the threats he said he received.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/will-have-meeting-with-adar-poonawalla-on-covid-vaccines-once-he-returns-says-maharashtra-minister-101620199136820.html

Apart from her struggles of being constantly in personal protection equipment kit (PPE), Gupta has helplessly seen patients dying that left her traumatised. “...a few weeks ago, a 22-year-old man was admitted as an emergency case. His oxygen levels were drastically dropping...as doctors, we always need to feel hopeful and give hope to the patient’s family. Deep down, I knew that he could not be saved but we never gave up. We provided him with all the essentials, yet could not save him,” said Gupta. “When I had to break the news, I was shaking and had to mentally prepare myself to talk to his mother, who was very hopeful. I broke down as I told his mother and locked myself up in my chamber...” Gupta said she felt helpless over her failure.Also Read | Pune doctor resumes treating Covid-19 patients day after virus takes father awayPPEs have added to the woes of health care workers as the mercury continues to rise over the 40-degree C mark at many places in the country. “The PPE kit is extremely warm due to which I have had breakouts around my nose and mouth. ...the first time I had my period in a PPE kit...I could feel blood seeping through my PPE kit, as we usually have one kit assigned for one doctor a day...”Gupta said she felt extremely distracted, conscious, and uneasy. “I could smell the stinky blood and could feel it sticking against my legs because of the sweat. After my 14-hour long shift, I ran home, feeling miserable...”Damini Grover, a counseling psychologist, said consequences of such traumatic experiences are real. She added they can lead to long term issues like hyperactivity, post-traumatic stress disorder, depression, emotional imbalance, frequent panic attacks or depression. Grover said most doctors might always work with the feeling of guilt and doubt as the second wave of the pandemic has gone out of hand. She added considering doctors as humans is extremely important as they are witnessing so many deaths everyday. “The prolonged impact of the trauma the doctors are facing right now will deeply impact their personality and their personal lives,” said Grover. Subin Varghese, the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) supervisor at New Delhi’s Max Smart Super Speciality Hospital, said at the beginning of this year, the control in the rise of the infections made people careless. “I saw people not wearing masks or wearing them incorrectly, and similarly both the central and the state government did not plan...”Varghese said it is distressing to see patients die due to the lack of oxygen cylinders or ICU beds. “There are times you know that if I had an oxygen cylinder or a bed, I would have been able to save the patient, and that makes me feel hopeless... When you have six patients and one of them suddenly shows extreme symptoms, you put in all the resources available to save that life, but when that patient dies, what do you do?” Varghese said as healthcare workers, they do not have the time to mourn a patient’s death. “It is because you have five more patients to look after. I focus all my energy to save those five. My workplace has been very supportive by giving extra compensation for each shift to every worker but the misery of deaths and suffering I have been seeing for over a year now has made me numb...”Varghese said there are days when he is unable to sleep thinking about the people who could not be saved.Nikita Dhawan, who started her internship in April 2020 and has since been working in Covid wards in Dehradun, said seeing people die helplessly was very difficult to cope with. She has often suffered anxiety and even thought of giving up.“...there were days when we had to lock the hospital gates from inside as there was no capacity left to accommodate people. I could see people outside the gate, holding onto the hope that their loved one could be saved, and at that point, I used to feel hollow. I felt guilty for not being able to help,” said Dhawan. “But when you are on duty, you need to be numb. I have felt the loss of every patient, particularly a 15-year-old boy...I was in shock and felt a void. I could not stop crying while preparing his death certificate the next day. It was traumatising.”Shishupal Singh, the nursing in charge at Gurugram’s Fortis Memorial Research Institute, said they have to be positive and continuously motivate the patients. “There are times when the patients get emotional and miss their families [and we arrange] video calls... It is definitely tough to see the patients go through so much pain. But when I brief my team in the morning, I always make it a point to mention how the soldiers of our country are protecting us from the outer threat. Similarly, we have to protect our country from this virus.”Singh said there are times when his staff feels demotivated or anxious. “During such times, we stand as a team. We video call others, try to crack jokes, and play online games like Ludo to keep ourselves relaxed and positive.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mental-health-issues-another-challenge-overworked-healthcare-workers-face-101620198624758.html

It added it was only after this denial by the Centre that the contempt notice was issued.The Supreme Court noted that the Centre's formula on allocation of oxygen has to be more scientific; it is too general at present. It asked the SG till the time a better formula can be evolved, Centre should inform how it will cater to Delhi.The Delhi high court on Tuesday issued a show-cause notice to the Centre, asking it to explain why the court should not initiate contempt proceedings against it.The notice, the high court said, was also over the “non-compliance” of the Supreme Court’s order from May 2, directing the central government to rectify the issue of shortage of medical oxygen in Delhi’s hospitals on or before the midnight of May 3. "You can put your head in sand like ostrich, we will not," the high court said."The Supreme Court has passed an order directing the Centre to ensure the supply. The Centre has submitted to us that a compliance affidavit is being filed before the Supreme Court tomorrow. We fail to understand what good a compliance affidavit will do when the required oxygen is not being brought to Delhi? Even the allocated oxygen has not been delivered on a single day," the high court said.The high court further said that the central government has submitted that the Supreme Court has not directed it to supply 700 metric tonnes (MT) oxygen to Delhi. "We disagree with the Centre. The Supreme Court has clearly directed the Centre to provide 700 MT oxygen to Delhi per day," it added.The Delhi high court said that the assurance that the central government gave to the apex court has "certainly not being fulfilled and we are personally seeing day after day hospitals and nursing homes running to us for emergency supply of oxygen."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-moves-supreme-court-challenging-delhi-hc-s-show-cause-notice-of-contempt-against-them-over-deficit-in-oxygen-supply-to-capital-101620194469063.html

The state reported 891 deaths; 240,956 people were tested.The state government in order to contain the Covid-19 virus has imposed a strict lockdown in six districts where the cases are increasing. In this lockdown, everything, except medical facilities, will remain closed and people can only venture out for medical emergencies.Health minister Rajesh Tope said, “If we compare today’s situation to that of two weeks ago, we have witnessed a decline in the number of cases. We have been able to bring down the numbers in 15 districts, but the cases continue to rise in 21 districts. Our main target is to bring down these numbers.”The state government has imposed a stricter curfew in six districts—Baramati, Sangli, Satara, Ahmednagar, Kolhapur and Beed – which have been witnessing an increase in Covid-19 cases.Tope justified stricter lockdown saying it was needed to bring down the cases. “There is definitely a lockdown in place, but this will be stricter,” said Tope. Due to the spike, these districts have been facing a shortage of hospital beds, ventilators as well as medicines like Remdesivir. Currently, the state needs approximately 40,000 oxygen concentrators, of which 20,000 will be provided to the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/maharashtra-records-over-51k-covid-cases-state-reports-891-deaths-101620194361862.html

05-05-2021||India||No need for RT-PCR test for healthy individuals travelling inter-state: ICMR||Indian Medical Council of Research released a new set of guidelines for testing against the Coronavirus disease (Covid-19) amid the exponential growth in the infection rate. Under the fresh guidelines, the apex body suggested the removal of mandatory RT-PCR test for health people travelling in the country."The need of RT-PCR test [for] healthy individuals undertaking inter-state domestic travel may be completely removed," said ICMR in the advisory. All asymptomatic domestic travellers must follow Covid-19 appropriate behaviours, it added.The RT-PCR tests are considered more reliable than the rapid antigen tests and until now, people travelling in the country were required to produce negative RT-PCR report to cross the borders.ICMR also advised skipping the RT-PCR test if a Covid-19 patient has completed 10 days of quarantine and did not report fever in the last three days. "RT PCR test must not be repeated in any individual who has tested positive once either by RAT or RT PCR," it also said.The changed guidelines come as hospitals are inundated with Covid-19 patients and have pushed the health care system to crumble. The recent explosion in cases has led to a shortage of beds, ventilators and oxygen cylinders. There is almost a waiting of 7-days if a person is trying to get the Covid-19 test done at their home.In new guidelines, ICMR also talked about reducing RT-PCR tests to take the load off the existing laboratories. While ICMR is counting on more reliable new-generation Rapid Antigen Test (RAT) kits, if the tests end up being as inaccurate as the previous generation of RATs, they could artificially lower Covid-19 case numbers, and potentially create undiagnosed superspreaders.India's total virus caseload since the start of the pandemic surged past 20 million with more than 350,000 new cases reported on Wednesday and 3,780 more deaths.But the number of new infections has dipped from a peak of 402,000 last week, raising hopes that the worst of the devastating wave may have passed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-need-for-rt-pcr-test-for-healthy-individuals-travelling-inter-state-icmr-101620192609789.html
05-05-2021||India||Supreme Court strikes down Maratha reservation in jobs, education||The Supreme Court on Wednesday struck down the Maharashtra law that held the Maratha community as socially and economically backward, thereby ending the Maratha reservation in public education and employment. In doing so, the Supreme Court also quashed the Maratha reservation in so far it breaches the 50% ceiling of reservation. The top court, while nixing the Socially and Educationally Backward Classes (SEBC) Act, 2018, said that it violates equality as under Article 14 of the Constitution.The five-judge Supreme Court bench, comprising Justices Ashok Bhushan, L Nageswara Rao, S Abdul Nazeer, Hemant Gupta, and Ravindra Bhat, pronounced the verdict on Wednesday at 10:30am. The bench had earlier on March 26 reserved judgment in the case after a back-to-back hearing for 10 days.On Wednesday, the top court was hearing petitions challenging an earlier Bombay high court order which upheld the Maratha quota in 2019 and had ruled that the 50% cap on total reservations imposed by the Supreme Court could be exceeded in exceptional circumstances. Justice Ashok Bhushan said, "Neither the Gaikwad nor the submissions have made out any situation for exceeding the 50% reservation ceiling for Marathas. Therefore, we find there are no extraordinary circumstances for exceeding the ceiling. The Act for granting reservation has not made any circumstance for granting reservation to the Maratha community."Thereafter, the Supreme Court bench struck down the amendment which held that the Marathas are socially and economically backward classes, while adding that the classes which are already held to be so will be as per Article 342A of the Constitution.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/supreme-court-strikes-down-maratha-reservation-in-jobs-education-101620191908607.html
05-05-2021||India||Busting the myths on Covid-19 medication||As the country reels under the second wave of coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic, there is a lot of discussion around the drugs and treatments that work and those that don't against the virus. Speaking to Hindustan Times, Dr Lancelot Pinto, a pulmonologist and epidemiologist at Hinduja Hospital in Mumbai, cleared the air on Covid-19 medication.The virus, which has killed 226,188 people and infected more than 20 million people in the country, continues to ravage the lives of millions, resulting in the collapse of the healthcare system. As thousands of Covid-19 patients gasp for breath due to shortage of oxygen cylinders, many others run from pillar to post for antiviral medications such as remdesivir or favipiravir.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageHere is what Dr Pinto, one of India's leading experts on Covid-19 treatment protocols, has to say about various Covid-19 medications:Paracetamol- Patients should use paracetamol for fever and body ache but not round-the-clock as fever is a monitoring parameter of a person's heath. Doctors recommend patients do not consume more than 2-3 gm per day.Antivirals- The antivirals that have been tried for Covid-19 are lopinavir-ritonavir, remdesivir and favipiravir. Till date, the only antiviral drug that may have a role in the treatment of Covid-19 is remdesivir. None of the other drugs has been proven to be useful. A small clinical trial which tested favipiravir found the drug to not be effective for the primary end-point for which the trial was designed. Despite this, it has been widely sold and used across the country, exposing patients to all the adverse effects, while potentially offering no benefit at all. To the best of my knowledge, no other major nation across the world is presently using the drug. Interferons, which have antiviral effects, have been tried for Covid-19 too. SOLIDARITY, a large WHO-funded trial did not find interferon to be useful. The RECOVERY trial found that when used with corticosteroids, interferon may have a beneficial role.Antibiotics- Antibiotics are antibacterial. They have no role in the treatment of the manifestations of Sars-CoV-2 infection (a viral infection). However, if there is a suspicion of a superadded secondary bacterial infection (uncommon in non-hospital settings, and in the first 2 weeks of the disease), they can be used. The routine use of drugs such as azithromycin and doxycycline should be strongly discouraged.Ivermectin- Ivermectin is an anti-parasitic drug that was found to neutralise Sars-CoV-2 in the lab. This leads to hope that it may have a role in humans. However, no trial has found such an effect. A recently published systematic review suggested that it may have a role, but most of the included studies were not of a high research standard. Its routine use should also be discouraged.Remdesivir- Remdesivir does not save lives. Multiple studies have onsistently proven this. It may horten the duration of ymptoms in individuals who ave disease that is severe enough for them to warrant hospitalisation, and if they have signs of lung involvement. It may be more effective when given early in the viremic phase (in the first week of illness) than in the late immune phase. However, hospitalising individuals who are not sick enough to be hospitalised otherwise only to receive remdesivir should be discouraged, as it is not necessary, and will worsen the availability of hospital beds for those who truly need them.Plasma- PLACID (ICMR Indian trial), RECOVERY and Platina were large trials that conclusively proved that convalescent plasma was not effective. However, small trials have suggested that when used very early in the disease among high-risk individuals, with high titers of antibodies in the infused plasma, it may have a protective role. The widespread pleas for plasma when the patient is moderately or severely ill are unlikely to help the patient in any waySteroids- The RECOVERY trial proved that steroids, when used in patients with low oxygen levels, saved lives. However, their use in individuals with low oxygen levels is key. Early use of steroids, when oxygen levels are normal, can cause clinical worsening and be counterproductive. They should not be used routinely to bring down fever unless there is a concomitant evidence of clinical worsening or drop in oxygen levels. They are the only drugs which save lives, but when used with abundant caution.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/busting-the-myths-on-covid-19-medication-101620185954146.html

As many as 160,494,188 Covid-19 vaccines have been administered in the country so far.India's coronavirus caseload topped the 20-million mark on Tuesday, with the health system continuing to crumble under the weight of new cases and hospitals reporting a shortage of ICU beds and medical oxygen. The Indian Premier League (IPL), a lucrative cricket competition involving some of the sport's biggest global stars, was finally suspended in view of the crisis after several players tested positive for Covid-19 even inside their designated "bio-bubbles". Although the number of new infections has come down from a peak of 402,000 last week, raising hopes that the worst of the devastating wave may have passed, many suspect the fewer number of cases might be a result of reduced testing. According to research, the deaths from Covid-19 in India may even double from current levels in the coming months.Meanwhile, India is not the only country in the renewed warpath of the deadlier coronavirus wave. Fierce new Covid-19 waves are enveloping other developing countries, from Laos to Thailand, across the world. The increase is mainly because of more contagious virus variants, though complacency and lack of resources to contain the spread have also been cited as reasons.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-records-382-315-new-covid-19-cases-tally-crosses-20-66-million-101620183919899.html

The family’s pleas fell on deaf ears. They tried to convince the resident almost the entire night, and prompted a group of men, including four Muslims, to help cremate the body in an open ground away from Karimganj town. The locals argued the area is densely populated and the cremation could lead to infections in the area. Health department officials also unsuccessfully tried to convince the residents.The group, which included Nizamuddin, Kabir Ahmed, Salim, and Ali, came forward to help around 3.00am on Tuesday and cremated the body with the help of the health department, which provided the Personal Protection Equipment (PPE) kits for the last rites.Dey’s family was handed over the body after a declaration that the cremation will be done with adherence to Covid-19 protocols.

Assam waits for the next chief ministerMrinmoy Dey, a family member of Mrinal Kanti Dey, said they were in a situation they will never forget. “I can understand the emotions of the locals, but their knowledge was poor. It is impossible that the virus can spread through the smoke. But at that moment, we were few people and there were hundreds.”Sujan Deb Roy, the founder of the Karimganj unit of NGO Robin Hood Army, said they were shocked to see the behaviour of people. “They did not realise that the same thing can happen to them any day. Unfortunately, all of them were Hindu people and it was their duty to support a Hindu man’s last rites. Instead, some Muslim brothers came to support us. I am proud of them.”Kabir Ahmed, who was among those who helped with the cremation, said it is the holy month of Ramzan and they were performing some rituals at midnight when they received a call, and someone said that local people are not allowing somebody’s last rites. “We rushed to the place. We asked the family members and the NGO if we can be a part of this process because it is our duty as a responsible members of society. We are thankful that they allowed us to be a part of it.”Additional deputy commissioner (health), Karimganj, Hivare Nisarg Gautam said cremations of Covid-19 positive have happened earlier at the crematorium. “But that day some local people suddenly stopped our officials saying that the smoke coming out of cremations of Covid infected bodies can spread the virus. We tried to convince them, but they became aggressive and finally, we had to shift the process somewhere else. With the help of some social workers and our officials, it was done outside the town.” He said they were discussing this matter with higher officials.  Hundreds, including some carrying weapons, gathered at a crematorium in the neighbouring Silchar last year and warned a family of a person, who had died of Covid-19, against conducting the last rites.Dilip Kumar Paul, the local lawmaker, and health department officials rushed to the crematorium to convince the locals. Silchar Medical College Principal Babul Bezbaruah even explained how the virus spreads and said it cannot spread through the dead bodies released from hospitals as they are wrapped in three layers of plastic and also sanitised. Over 80 dead bodies were then allowed to be cremated at the Silchar crematorium as per protocols.Government guidelines mandate separate arrangements for cremations of people who die of Covid-19. Mourners and others attending cremations have to wear PPE kits and bodies have to be covered in three layers of plastic.Over 100 people have so far died of Covid-19 at the Silchar Medical College and NGOs were involved in the cremations last year. But this year, the Disaster Management Authority and in some cases, families are allowed to conduct the last rites.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/muslims-come-to-help-after-locals-prevent-last-rites-of-covid-victim-in-assam-101620188121418.html

It highlighted stories viral on social media of hapless citizens begging for an oxygen cylinder to save the life of their near and dear ones, both at the end of the district administration and the police administration. The bench also observed the rampant hoarding of oxygen cylinders and harassment of citizens who are desperately in need of them."The news was also viralled that five patients had died in ICU of a new trauma centre of Medical College, Meerut on Sunday last. Similarly, news were also being viralled that one Sun Hospital, Gomti Nagar, Lucknow and another private hospital at Meerut had taken their hands off the admitted Covid patients only for the reason that oxygen supply was not made even after demand. We find these news items showing a quite contrary picture to one claimed by the Government that there was sufficient supply of oxygen," it pointed out.The current state of affairs about the management of an online portal created by the government today casts a shadow upon Covid-19 hospital management, the high court said.(With inputs from ANI)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/criminal-act-no-less-than-genocide-allahabad-high-court-on-deaths-of-covid-19-patients-due-to-non-supply-of-oxygen-101620182352780.html

He was known for his speeches full of wit and wisdom, lampooning rigid beliefs and systems in society.Born on 27th April 1918, he celebrated his 103rd birthday two weeks back. Often addressed as ‘chiriyude pithavu’ in Malayalam (father of wit and wisdom) for his sense of humour and sarcasm, he always stood for secular values of the country.When Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan called on him last year, the priest offered him tea. But the CM politely refused it saying he just had it. “Nobody ever dared to call on me after being drunk,” Chrysostom said and all burst into laughter in appreciation of his wit. In his speeches and writings, he always questioned rigid beliefs in his unique style and exhorted believers to live a happy and contented life instead of complaining. CM Pinarayi Vijayan has offered condolence calling his death a big loss to the countryIn 2018, the country bestowed him with the third highest civilian honour, the Padma Bhushan. In 2017, the church announced a programme called Navodaya movement for welfare and mainstreaming of the transgender community to mark his 100th birthday.One of the oldest bishops of the country, he was ordained as a priest in 1944 and became a bishop in 1953. He became the Metropolitan of the Marthoma Church in 1999 and remained there till his retirement in 2010 due to age-related ailments. Chrysostom was close to some of the tallest leaders of the country including former President K R Narayanan and prime minister A B Vajpayee.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/one-of-india-s-oldest-religious-leaders-mar-chrysostom-dies-at-103-101620181160882.html
05-05-2021||India||'No need for RT-PCR tests if...': ICMR issues new testing guidelines for Covid-19||Though the Centre repeatedly asked states and Union territories to increase the proportion of RT-PCR tests to at least 70 per cent of all Covid-19 tests being conducted, the Indian Council of Medical Research, in its new testing guideline issued on Tuesday, has talked about reducing RT-PCR tests to take the load off the existing laboratories.ICMR has recommended no RT-PCR tests if> An individual has tested positive by rapid antigen test.> An individual has tested positive once by RT-PCR test.> One has completed 10 days home isolation period with no fever for the last three days.> At the time of hospital discharge.> A healthy individual is undertaking interstate domestic travel. While this is a requirement imposed by states, ICMR said this can completely be removed to reduce the load on laboratories.Also Read: ICMR’s guidelines push antigen tests amid surgeAt a national level, India can test close to 15 lakh tests in its 2,506 molecular testing laboratories, including RT-PCR, TrueNat, CBNAAT and other platforms. But with a sudden surge in the number of RT-PCR tests and many staff testing positive and thus being relieved from duties, the laboratories are overburdened. It is taking over 72 hours to process one RT-PCR test now. Given this situation, the ICMR is recommending bringing back the focus on Rapid Antigen Testing for mass detection. RAT may be allowed at all available government and private healthcare facilities, in cities, towns, villages, at offices, schools, colleges, community centres and other vacant spaces. Drive through RAT facilities may also be created, the ICMR said.Who should take RT-PCR tests then?According to ICMR, individuals with symptoms identified negative by rapid antigen testing should be linked with RT-PCR test facility.Writing vaccine status mandatoryThe ICMR has made it mandatory to enter the information of vaccination status in the testing form for RAT or RT-PCR. This information is of critical importance, the ICMR said. This comes in the wake of people testing positive after one or both doses of the vaccines.Suspect case of Covid-19While getting tested first was recommended before, in the current upsurge of Covid-19 cases, the ICMR says, any individual presenting with fever (with or without cough), headache, sore throat, breathlessness, body ache, the recent loss of taste or smell, fatigue and diarrhea should be considered as a suspect case of Covid-19 unless proven otherwise by confirmation of another etiology.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-need-for-rt-pcr-tests-if-icmr-issues-new-testing-guidelines-for-covid1-101620178785589.html

A spokesperson from Transnet said the cause of a chief engineer's death aboard the ship was heart attack and not Covid-19.The 14 were among the entire crew that was tested after the ship arrived in Durban on Sunday. They are now all in isolation as authorities start a track and trace initiative for all those who might have been in contact with them."The vessel is currently on quarantine. No one is allowed to leave or enter the vessel, and the company responsible for anyone who worked on board is to track and trace all employees who interacted with the subject vessel,” Transnet said on Tuesday.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageA senior port official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told a news portal that at least 200 port employees had been working on the vessel since Sunday evening, manually offloading about 3,000 tonnes of rice."The rice came in 50kg bags. We are a bit concerned because a lot of people have boarded that vessel since Sunday,” the source said.Transnet said the ship with Filipino crew had sailed directly from India, where they had been tested for Covid-19 and cleared as per requirements."Upon arrival at the Port of Durban, as a standard precautionary measure, all crew members were tested and 14 of the crew tested positive for Covid-19. The entire vessel is currently in quarantine at the Port of Durban, as per Covid-19 regulations," Transnet said.All operations with the vessel have been suspended.The authority said it remained vigilant to ensure that all vessels calling at the port have been cleared."TNPA is responsible for ensuring that all vessels calling the port have been cleared by relevant state organs, namely, port health, migration, MRCC and customs before entering or leaving the port,” it said.News of the incident caused widespread concern on social media about fears that the new B.1.617 variant that was causing thousands of deaths in India daily had reached South African shores.Health Minister Zweli Mkhize has assured the public that plans are in place to test all arrivals into the country, reminding them that there were no direct flights from India.Mkhize did express concern though that those arriving from India via other countries could pose a challenge.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/14-on-cargo-ship-from-india-test-positive-for-covid-19-in-south-africa-101620175873811.html

The vaccine tracker tool will allow users to find the nearest vaccine centre locations and their hours of operation as shared by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MoHFW).The tracker tool will also aggregate and display walk-in options (for 45 years and above) along with a link to register on the Cowin portal and schedule vaccination appointments.Facebook said in a post on its platform, "Partnering with the Government of India, Facebook will begin rolling out its Vaccine Finder tool on the Facebook mobile app in India available in 17 languages to help people identify places nearby to get the vaccine."The company said that it is also will be joining hands with NGOs and agencies -- namely, United Way, Swasth, Hemkunt Foundation, I Am Gurgaon, Project Mumbai and US-India Strategic Partnership Forum (USISPF) -- to deploy the funds announced to help build up a stock of critical medical supplies with over 5,000 oxygen concentrators and other life-saving equipment like ventilators, BiPAP machines.As per Mashable, Facebook also said that the Covid-19 Information Center and in Feed will also have information on how to seek emergency care and how to manage mild Covid-19 symptoms at home, and this will be provided by UNICEF India.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/facebook-launches-in-app-vaccine-finder-tool-in-india-101620172837174.html
05-05-2021||India||Renowned infectious diseases expert Dr Rajendra Kapila, 81, dies of Covid-19||Ghaziabad: Renowned infectious disease specialist and Rutgers University professor Dr Rajendra Kapila passed away in Delhi on April 28 after having tested positive for Covid-19 on April 8. He was 81.Dr Kapila worked extensively on HIV-AIDS, trained many people in the field and practised at the Rutgers University for 50 years.He had returned to India with wife Dr Deepti Saxena-Kapila in the last week of March and stayed in Ghaziabad. He was supposed to fly back to US by second week of April but was admitted to Delhi’s Shanti Mukund Hospital where he died.“For the last one year I have been working at a Covid-19 lab in New Jersey and had ensured a safe environment at home,” said Dr Deepti, who specialises in microbiology. “It is ironic that we came to India for two weeks and he contracted it here.”She said Dr Kapila had got both doses of the Pfizer vaccine in the US.In a memorial message sent out by Rutgers University faculty, Dr. Marc Klapholz , professor and chair of the department of medicine, said, “A genuine giant in the field of infectious diseases, Dr. Kapila was recognized world-wide and sought out for his legendary knowledge and extraordinary clinical acumen in diagnosing and treating the most complex infectious diseases. Dr. Kapila made countless contributions to the field of infectious diseases, including some of the earliest observations about AIDS (1983) and continued to publish throughout his long career.”Dr Ishwar Gilada, consultant for HIV and infectious diseases, and president of the AIDS Society of India (ASI) had trained under Dr Kapila in 1987.“He was a gem of a gentleman and was well known in the US. He cared for all his pupils and would always accept ASI invitations for meetings,” said Dr Gilada, who is based out of Mumbai.Dr Ruby Bansal, an HIV specialist and head of the preventive health programme at Yashoda Super Speciality Hospital at Kaushambi, described Dr Kapila as one who was passionate about teaching.“Whenever Dr Kapila visited India, he would deliver lectures to fellow doctors at major private hospitals in the city and never said ‘no’ to an opportunity to teach,” said Dr Bansal.Dr Kapila completed his MBBS from Maulana Azad Medical College, University of Delhi, and in 1964, achieved his MD from College of Medical Sciences, Guru Teg Bahadur Hospital, University of Delhi.As per his profile on the Rutgers University website, he was an intern, resident and fellow at the Martland Hospital in Newark, New Jersey. He was also the assistant chief of medicine for the US Army in Okinawa, Japan, during the Vietnam conflict. He was a founding member of the New Jersey Infectious Disease Society, and has also received the Excellence in Teaching Award from UMDNJ. Dr. Kapila was the Chair of the Infection Control Committee there.“Dr Kapila’s death is a great loss for the medical fraternity as his studies in the field of infectious diseases, be it HIV or fungi or even coronavirus, was par excellence. When coronavirus outbreak began, he devoted his time in its research,” said Dr Bansal.Robert A Schwartz,member of US Presidential Advisory Council on HIV/AIDS and professor and head of dermatology at Rutgers University condoled the demise of Dr Kapila on Twitter, saying, “Condolences to the family of Rajendra Kapila, the @RutgersU professor, @CityofNewarkNJ physician, and @USArmy veteran who advocated for the finest healthcare attainable for all. He will be remembered for his unmatched sagacity and conduct exemplarily of the @AOA_society motto.

05-05-2021||India||Covid-19: What you need to know today||When India crossed a million reported Covid-19 cases on July 16, 2020, I headlined my next column “A Million and a Manifesto”, putting forth suggestions on how to manage the pandemic (back then, testing was the big challenge). With India crossing the 20 million reported cases mark on Monday (May 3), here are some suggestions on how the country’s struggling vaccine drive (currently the big challenge) can be accelerated and universalised. There’s little to be achieved by discussing what India got wrong (most things, actually) in its vaccine strategy, but here’s what the people in charge of India’s vaccine strategy can do to make things better.The first and immediate task is to enhance supplies — by authorising (after due process) more vaccines for emergency use, exploring voluntary licensing (although manufacturing may pose a bigger challenge than many experts advocating compulsory or voluntary licensing believe), working with local manufacturers to increase capacity, and placing vaccine orders well (preferably months) in advance with both local and foreign companies.The second is to possess and provide complete clarity on the timing and volume of supplies so that the states and private hospitals know how many vaccines they will have at hand, and when. Ideally, this should be linked to the vaccine registration website so that people seeking shots know this too. In the interests of transparency, the website should display the number of vaccine doses available in each district, and if none is available, the earliest when they will be.The third is to focus on achieving the primary target. As I have explained before in this column, this is 375 million. That’s the number of people who need to be administered at least one dose of the vaccine for the result to make itself felt on the trajectory of the pandemic. That translates into 40% of the eligible population (those over the age of 18 years). If this means mandatorily extending the gap between doses to 12 weeks to those administered Covishield, the Serum Institute of India’s locally manufactured version of the AstraZeneca/Oxford vaccine, so be it. Research shows that this can be done without any risk and that, in fact, such a hiatus enhances the vaccine’s efficacy. The sooner India hits that number, the better its chances of flattening the infection curve, and staving off a third wave of the pandemic. One expert I spoke to said the results will start becoming evident even at 235 million people (India is currently at 129 million, of which 100 million have been administered only one dose of the vaccine).The fourth is to remove vaccine hesitancy. This is evident even in some parts of urban India; and it is a big problem in rural India. The closer India gets to universal vaccination, the higher its chances of not witnessing recurring waves of Covid over the next several years. A combination of incentives and punitive measures (preventing those who have not been vaccinated from traveling by rail or air, for instance; or making them ineligible for government jobs and bank loans) may be required.The fifth is to work with vaccine makers to expedite vaccinations for those under the age of 18. India has around 450 million people under the age of 18. That’s more than the population of the US, the UK, and France combined. There’s no way India can beat back Covid-19 unless this segment of the population is also protected against the disease.The sixth is to create a unit in government that can estimate demand for Covid vaccines in years to come. It is becoming clear that the first generation of vaccines will provide protection for a limited time — six months to a year at the lower bound, and a year-and-a-half at the higher. This means the country will need billions of doses of vaccines every year till a single-shot vaccine is developed (it’s just a matter of time before one is). And once the annual demand estimation is complete, India’s vaccine drive managers can loop back and focus on the first and the second tasks again.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid19-what-you-need-to-know-today-101620162780567.html
05-05-2021||India||1 year of Covid and the way forward||India is currently in the grip of a second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic, far worse than the first wave. As more states go under complete or partial lockdowns, economic activity is bound to take a hit. In our report, State of Working India 2021: One Year of Covid-19, we analysed data from 2020 to investigate how the pandemic impacted vulnerable households, whether the policy measures enacted thus far were effective, and what more can be done.Employment recovery has stagnated below pre-pandemic levels and poverty has increasedStatistics from Consumer Pyramids Household Survey of the Centre for Monitoring the Indian Economy (CMIE-CPHS) suggest that India’s first national lockdown, one of the most stringent in the world, resulted in a loss of employment for around 100 million workers during the months of April and May 2020.As lockdown restrictions eased in subsequent months, the employment rate recovered but is still not back to its pre-pandemic value. The employment rate was 94% of its pre-pandemic level by December 2020 for men and only 76% for women.This week, the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy has released employment data for January to April of 2021. These data show that employment recovery has stagnated with the employment rate remaining at 93% of its pre-pandemic value for men and 73% for women.The job loss and fall in earnings (more on this later) caused a large increase in poverty. We calculate income poverty using the recommended National Floor Minimum Wage (Anoop Satpathy committee) of Rs.375 per day as a threshold. Compared to the pre-pandemic period, the number of individuals below this poverty line increased by 230 million. In proportional terms, the poverty rate has increased by 16% in rural areas and 20% in urban areas.10% decline in mobility was associated with a 7.5% decline in incomeJob losses were higher for states with a higher average Covid-19 case load. Figure 1 shows a state-level job loss representation index, or the ratio of the state’s share in jobs lost between 2019 and 2020 to its share in India’s workforce. Delhi, Maharashtra, Kerala, Tamil Nadu and Uttar Pradesh, contributed disproportionately to job losses. These are also the states with a high share of Covid-19 cases.Mobility restrictions as well as voluntary reductions, due to fear of infection, led to income losses. Google Mobility data at the state-level put together with CMIE data on household incomes allows us to calculate the impact of decreased mobility on incomes. Delhi, for example, experienced a 50% decline in mobility on average between March and October 2020 and this was accompanied by a 39% loss in income. On average, we find that a 10% decline in mobility was associated with a 7.5% decline in income. This number is useful to keep in mind as states impose or contemplate imposing additional lockdowns.The pandemic’s economic impact was regressive in natureThe loss of work during the lockdown and after resulted in reduction of earnings for many and the complete evisceration of incomes for some, specifically, the poorest. The bottom 20% of households earned nothing in the months of April and May 2020. On the other hand, the top 10% suffered the least during the lockdown, and only lost about 20% of their February income during the lockdown months pointing towards the clearly regressive economic impact that the pandemic has had.Quality of jobs and incomes also deterioratedAs workers struggled to find work, many took recourse to less desirable fallback activities. Only 47% of salaried workers have been able to remain salaried over the course of the year. We reported similar trends in earlier months in these pages. Nearly 30% of formal salaried workers had to resort to self-employment and a further 10% have moved into daily wage work. This is unlike anything seen in normal times. Between 2018 and 2019, 80% of permanent salaried workers remained in the same employment arrangement.As a result of job losses and informalisation, incomes fell for all types of workers — salaried, casual and self-employed.This in turn increased food insecurity and indebtedness. Over 90% of respondents in a random survey carried out in Karnataka and Rajasthan reported having borrowed money sometime between April and August. The mean loan amount was Rs.26,300 and the majority borrowed from informal sources.The report also examines the reach and efficacy of government relief measures. As reported earlier in these pages, we find that even though PDS had a much wider reach than Jan Dhan accounts, the efficacy of the Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Yojana was similar for both, and around 40% of eligible households were excluded from the support.As India confronts the second wave and what is possibly its worst humanitarian crisis in recent years, urgent policy measures are needed to support an already beleaguered population.The extra PDS entitlements under PMGKY need to be extended till the end of the year. We recommend cash transfers of Rs.5,000 for three months to as many vulnerable households as can be reached with the existing digital infrastructure, including but not limited to Jan Dhan accounts. MGNREGS has played a vital role and its allocation needs to be expanded. A pilot urban employment programme analogous to it can be launched in the worst hit districts, possibly focused on women workers. And a Covid hardship allowance of ₹30,000 ( ₹5,000 per month for six months) should be announced for 2.5 million Anganwadi and ASHA workers who have been at the frontlines of the grassroots fight against the virus.These measures are important because the crisis has caused nutritional and educational deficits, as well as increased inequities in the labour market with the scarring effect of job loss on women and young workers. It is likely that many of these deficits will be faced disproportionately by the most vulnerable and poorest households.Rosa Abraham is a Senior Research Fellow at Centre for Sustainable Employment, Azim Premji University.

She said the lockdown imposed to check the second Covid-19 wave has made it impossible for them to look for another house and to shift at such short notice.“Last year, too, I was short on rent money and had to ask for help from acquaintances. The house owner is ready to waive the rent of three months which adds up to ₹30,000 but where will I go,” she said.Rotawan’s father does odd jobs and the family does not have any particular regular source of income. Rotawan’s mother had died long before the 26/11 attacks. Rotawan gave her final exams two days ago. Rotawan said they have nowhere to go and will be forced to live on a street or in front of chief minister Uddhav Thackeray’s house if they are forced to vacate their house.HC had last August ordered the government to decide on Rotawan’s plea for allotment of a house on compassionate grounds. Rotawan also sought HC directions to the government to fund her education. In October, the family sent documents to the office of the chief secretary following the HC order. They have since been waiting to hear from the state.In a tweet, Rotawan’s lawyer, Utsav Bains, urged minister Aaditya Thackeray to help the family. Bains said the family is facing a difficult situation due to the apathy of the Maharashtra government. “Despite a Bombay high court order directing it to consider her request on compassionate grounds, it is yet to make a decision. It is very unfortunate to see a terror attack eyewitness suffer so much due to government indifference. We will move the Bombay high court again,” said Bains.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/2611-mumbai-attacks-key-witness-to-be-rendered-homeless-101620157578656.html
05-05-2021||India||Karnataka HC suggests judicial probe into 24 deaths at Covid-19 hospitals||Bengaluru: Taking suo motu cognizance of the 24 deaths at two Covid-19 hospitals in a span of 24 hours allegedly due to shortage of oxygen, the Karnataka high court on Tuesday suggested a judicial probe by a retired judge into the matter. The court also put the Union government on notice, seeking an urgent response as to how they intend to fix the oxygen demand-supply gap.On Monday, 24 patients died in Chamarajanagar district, about 175km from Bengaluru, after a district government hospital reportedly ran out of oxygen. Terming the incident as “serious”, a division bench of Chief justice Abhay Oka and justice Aravind Kumar said: “Around 24 people died. Advocate general (Prabhuling Navdagi who was representing state government), we suggest there should be a judicial probe into the incident by a retired judge of the high court.” The court’s recommendation came even as Navdagi said the government had ordered an inquiry by an IAS officer into the incident and sought a report by Wednesday evening. The bench made the suggestion after it received two letters describing the poor facilities for Covid-19 patients across the state. After Navdagi informed the bench that Chamarajanagar hospital had made a requisition for 300 cylinders of oxygen, the bench said: “Is it not a fact that requisition was made for 300 cylinders, and it was not supplied? We are putting you (State) to notice that a retired judicial officer has to be appointed for conducting an inquiry in the incident.”During the hearing, advocate Clifton Rozario, a city based lawyer, told the bench that there was a shortage of oxygen in the city. “Yesterday (Monday), MEDAX hospital sent out an SOS on Twitter for supply of oxygen. Around 10 hospitals in Bengaluru sent SOS yesterday,” he said. The Centre’s counsel M N Kumar informed the high court that the allocation of oxygen was increased to 865 metric tonnes from 802 metric tonnes. The bench, however, put the Union government on notice, seeking an urgent response on how they intend to resolve the crisis. “What is your explanation? The requirement of the state is 1,467 metric tonnes and you have increased it only to 865 (metric tonnes). Mr Kumar, are you not aware that people have died in the state due to non-availability of oxygen,” the bench asked. “... we are putting you on notice. We want an answer from you whether you (Centre) will increase the cap on supply of oxygen to 1,700 metric tonnes. Let your officers know that there is an incident of people dying due to lack of oxygen. The state of Karnataka is recording the highest number of cases every day,” the bench said.After Kumar told the court that steps will be taken by the Centre considering the requirement of other states, the bench said: “Is there any other city in the country which is getting 20,000 Covid-19 cases every day?”. The bench added that the supply of oxygen has to be increased. “As of today (Tuesday), there is a shortfall of 900 metric tonnes per day of oxygen,” it said.The city on Tuesday reported 20,870 cases and 132 deaths, taking the overall tally to 301,712 and 6,845, respectively.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/karnataka-hc-suggests-judicial-probe-into-24-deaths-at-covid-19-hospitals-101620155478534.html
05-05-2021||India||Vaccination slows down as demand outpaces supply||The Covid-19 vaccination drive has slowed down across the country over the past week — amid lockdowns and surging cases — as demand has spiked and the focus has shifted to starting the inoculation drive for those in the 18- 44 age group, according to several district and state health officials.Because of a shortage of vaccines, states such as Bihar, Madhya Pradesh, Uttarakhand and Tamil Nadu are unclear on when they can start the vaccination for those below 45 years of age, and states such as Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand expect to start that exercise (referred to as Phase 3 of India’s vaccination drive) later this week.In Maharashtra, where a drive-in vaccination centre started on Tuesday in the Dadar area of the capital Mumbai, vaccination has slowed down, according to government data. Since May 1, the state has inoculated 304,574 beneficiaries, including some in the 18-44 age group, as compared to 242,000 vaccinations per day in the last 15 days of April. On April 26, the state inoculated a record 534,228 people in a day.“On Monday, we were left with only 25,000 to 30,000 doses from the Centre for people 45 years and above, and most vaccination centres had to be shut. Maharashtra has a capacity to vaccinate 800,000 beneficiaries a day. This afternoon, we have got around 900,000 doses of Covishield from the Centre, which will now be distributed across districts to resume the drive again,” said state health minister Rajesh Tope on Tuesday.The Bihar government on Monday placed an order for 1.18 million doses of Covishield and 412,000 doses of Covaxin before starting inoculation for roughly 55 million people between 18 and 44 years of age, an official said.The Centre has set a purchase rate of Rs.315 per dose for Covishield and Rs.420 per dose for Covaxin for states and Union territories. The vaccines are available for Rs.150 per dose to the Centre. “We are pursuing with the Serum Institute for the immediate dispatch of the vaccines, and it has assured us that the shipment will move on Wednesday,” said a Bihar government official who asked not to be named.Jharkhand, too, is yet to start vaccination for the 18-44 age group even as the state has gone slower on vaccination for people above 45 because it is getting fewer doses from the Centre. Jharkhand has an inoculation target of 15.7 million people who are below 45.Assam health minister Himanta Biswa Sarma on Tuesday said the state will start a symbolic drive for the 18-44 age group from Wednesday now that it has received 150,000 doses of Covaxin from Bharat Biotech.Both Haryana and Punjab reported a drop in vaccination in the past few days as compared to the last fortnight of April due to supply constraints.According to government data from Rajasthan, vaccination slowed from 297,000 doses on April 20 to 225,000 doses on May 3, including people in 18-44 age group whose vaccination started from May 1.States such as Tamil Nadu and Kerala are yet to start vaccination for people below 45.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/vaccination-slows-down-as-demand-outpaces-supply-101620154327018.html
05-05-2021||India||Setback for BJP in key areas in UP panchayat elections||The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Tuesday suffered setbacks in its bastions of Ayodhya, Varanasi, Lucknow and Gorakhpur, and the Samajwadi Party inched ahead of the ruling party in the Uttar Pradesh rural body polls, the last major electoral exercise ahead of next year’s assembly elections.The BJP, which came to power in UP with a landslide in 2017, also lost panchayat seats in western Uttar Pradesh, where anti-incumbency and the ongoing farmer protests against three central agrarian laws dented the party’s fortunes.Trends and results available for 3,050 district panchayat wards on Tuesday evening showed SP at 760 wards, BJP at 719, Bahujan Samaj Party at 381 and Congress at 76. Independents and smaller parties secured victories or led in 1,114 wards.“The ruling BJP is a sinking ship. The results of the panchayat elections clearly show that BJP will face defeat in the 2022 assembly elections,” said SP chief Akhilesh Yadav.BJP state unit spokesperson Harish Chandra Srivastava said his party will secure victory on maximum wards due to the welfare schemes of the government.Independent candidates, majority of them rebels from various political parties, are likely to play a crucial role in the election of the district panchayat chairmen to be held later this month.The four-phase rural body elections, which began on April 16 and ended April 29, courted controversy because they were held amid a devastating surge in coronavirus infections and allegedly led to the deaths of at least 700 poll staff, a charge denied by the state government. The Allahabad high court even asked the state election commission (SEC) why action shouldn’t be taken for failing to stop rampant violations of Covid norms during campaigning. The counting of votes began Sunday morning at more than 825 centres across 75 districts. Over 869,000 posts were up for grabs, of which at least 732,000 were in gram panchayat wards, 58,176 in gram panchayats, 75,852 in block panchayats and 3,050 in district panchayats. A senior SEC official said counting of votes was likely to continue late into the night on Tuesday and refused to specify on how many seats counting was underway.Panchayat elections are not contested on party symbols but all parties have officially released names of the candidates backed by them. SEC has said results won’t be declared on party lines. In Varanasi, SP won 15 of 40 wards, BJP seven, BSP seven and Congress five wards so far. In Ayodhya, while SP won 24 of 40 wards, BJP won six and BSP won five wards. In Lucknow, SP won 10 of 25 wards, BJP won three and BSP secured five wards. The Congress failed to win any ward in the two regions. In Gorakhpur, SP won 19 of 68 wards, BJP won 20, BSP secured two and Congress won one ward so far.In 2015, SP had won majority of the wards followed by the BSP. The BJP had not contested in most of the wards.“The results are disappointing,” BJP’s district spokesperson Diwakar Singh told PTI.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/spmakes-gains-bjp-jolted-in-up-panchayat-polls-101620154099505.html
05-05-2021||India||‘Monumental loss’: Tributes pour in for J&K ex-Governor||The 1982 Asian Games is widely recognised as marking the emergence of the television boom in India. Politically, it was also one of the factors that made Jagmohan Malhotra, then serving his second term as Delhi’s Lieutenant Governor.Jagmohan -- he mostly went by one name -- was already a name and a face by then. In the mid-1970s, he was a controversial head of the Delhi Development Authority, and between 1975 and 1977, set out to improve the city’s looks under Sanjay Gandhi’s patronage.Controversy was a constant in the life of Jagmohan, who died in Delhi late on May 3.He was twice governor of Jammu & Kashmir, once for five years, and the second time, controversially, for five months. He remained as disliked by J&K’s mainstream politicians as he was admired by the Kashmiri Pandits, who believe he saved them by helping their escape from the Valley when calls went out for their extermination. Indeed, on Tuesday, tributes poured in from Jammu.All three Kashmir-based former chief ministers of the erstwhile state, Farooq Abdullah, Omar Abdullah and Mehbooba Mufti, maintained a stoic silence. But the J&K administration has announced a three-day mourning from May 4 to 6 as a mark of respect to Jagmohan, who joined the BJP after his second, short stint as J&K governor (which came under the VP Singh government). It is believed that the government’s stand on J&K didn’t match his own; and even the Congress, with which he was associated for a decade-and-half, working closely with Indira, Sanjay and Rajiv Gandhi, didn’t approve of his muscular approach .Prime Minister Narendra Modi termed Jagmohan‘s death a “monumental loss for the nation”.Ajay Chrungoo, the leader of Panun Kashmir, a frontal organisation of Kashmiri Pandits, said, “At that time, he was the only person who elicited hope among Hindus displaced from Kashmir because of Pakistan-sponsored terrorism...”Vijai Kapoor, former LG of Delhi, said: “His two major contributions are large green spaces, which Delhi has today and large scale planned development.”Congress leader Ajay Maken remembered him as a “fierce administrator” and a “kind soul”.(Inputs from HTC in Delhi)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/monumental-loss-tributes-pour-in-for-j-k-exguv-101620153918387.html
05-05-2021||India||SOPs for Char Dham yatra out amid Covid-19 spike||Days after the Uttarakhand government postponed the annual Char Dham yatra, the Char Dham Management Board on Tuesday announced that only priests and so-called traditional right holders will be permitted inside the four shrines of Kedarnath, Badrinath, Gangotri and Yamunotri.Issuing a set of standard operating procedures (SOPs) in view of the surge of Covid-19, the government said the four shrines would open for daily prayers from 7am to 7pm after the opening of their respective portals. Officials had earlier said that the portals of the Yamunotri shrine would be opened on May 14 and that of Gangotri on May 15. Portals of Kedarnath and Badrinath shrines will be opened on May 17 and 18.“Only the priests and related traditional right holders will be allowed inside the shrines for daily puja while following all the Covid-19 guidelines like wearing masks, maintaining social distance and thermal screening,” the guidelines read.It is mandatory to carry negative Covid-19 reports while heading to any of these temples.The guidelines issued on Tuesday also stated that “those showing any kind of symptoms for Covid-19 won’t be allowed inside the temples.” Traditional right holders are members of the local priest community who have been associated with the management of Char Dham shrines for centuries. The SOP also prohibited touching of idols, bells or any kind of religious literature kept inside the temple.Burnt by its experience with the Mahakumbh, the state government last week postponed the pilgrimage, scheduled to start on May 14.The SOPs will come into force when the portals of these shrines open.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sops-for-char-dham-out-amid-covid-spike-101620153858419.html

A C-17 can carry a payload of almost 77 tonne. The fleet was used extensively to move soldiers, tanks and infantry combat vehicles to Ladakh last year to counter China’s military build-up in the sensitive sector. “The C-17s helped us mount a swift response to the Chinese actions. And now they have become the face of the IAF’s contribution to the national Covid response,” said a second official.The C-17 is the only aircraft currently being used to ferry containers from abroad.“Till date (May 4), the IAF has brought in 54 cryogenic oxygen containers and 900 oxygen cylinders from Singapore, Dubai, Bangkok, Frankfurt and Brize Norton in the United Kingdom, clocking over 140 hours of flying,” said IAF spokesperson Wing Commander Ashish Moghe. A C-17 on Tuesday transported a 37-tonne cargo of empty oxygen cylinders from Brize Norton to Chennai.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/after-key-role-in-ladakh-c-17s-leading-iaf-s-covid-relief-work-101620153799898.html

Without assistance from the United States, new vaccine-resistant mutations could arise across the globe, threatening international public health and the United States’ national security and economic prosperity,” four Democrats who head powerful congressional committees said in a joint letter to US Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Health Secretary Xavier Becerra.The signatories are Carolyn Maloney, chairperson of one of the most powerful of House committees, the oversight committee; James Clyburn, chair of the House select subcommittee on the Covid-19 crisis; Raja Krishnamoorthi, the Indian American chair of the House subcommittee on economic and consumer policy; and Stephen Lynch, chair of the House subcommittee on national security.AstraZeneca’s Covid-19 vaccine, which is made and retailed in India as Covishield, is not approved for use in the US. More than 52% of eligible Americans — 147.5 million — have received at least one does of a vaccine approved in the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/us-lawmakers-urge-biden-to-ship-astrazeneca-vaccines-to-india-101620153740216.html
05-05-2021||India||Top Central government officials attend session on boosting image, perception||Around 300 top officials of the central government participated in a workshop titled Effective Communications, conducted by Abhishek Singh, the CEO of MyGov, a government platform for citizen engagement, aimed at helping them “create a positive image of the government”, manage “perception through effectively highlighting positive stories and achievements”, and making the government “be seen to be sensitive, bold, quick, responsive, hard-working etc”, according to a presentation made at the event.The 90-minute-long virtual workshop, where Information & Broadcasting minister Prakash Javadekar also spoke to the participants, comes against the backdrop of a surging second wave of Covid-19 infections and a faltering vaccination drive, with the Union government coming in for criticism for its handling of both. HT learns that the meeting, attended by several secretaries of the government, saw the minister emphasising the need to focus on positive news.The minister’s office did not respond to HT. This is the first time such a workshop was held.HT has reviewed a copy of the presentation and spoke to some of the officers who attended the workshop. Singh declined to comment. While much of the presentation deals with examples related to Covid-19, one slide also gave the example of how MyGov and the government sent out the right message about the three reformist farm laws.According to one officer who attended the workshop and spoke on condition of anonymity, the attendees, which included the joint secretary (media) of each department, were told that the traditional means of communication via Press Information Bureau (PIB) press releases “no longer worked’’. They were told to instead post photographs and videos that gained more impressions. As a case in point, Singh’s presentation dealt with the story that was widely reported on Monday about the Delhi high court asking the government why oxygen concentrators that had been received as aid from foreign countries were lying at airports. To illustrate their point, they showed how in response to a TV channel’s tweet showing the concentrators, the government and department of Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs responded with the factual position.“In today’s times, anything critical needs to be noted in minutes. If we wait for some news to break on TV or Print, we will lose the narrative then and there,” said the presentation. “Your role is important as you have access to the minister/ ministry and timely inputs can help ensure that the narrative is positive,’’ it added.A second officer who attended the meeting and also spoke on condition of anonymity said they were asked to find influencers who would tweet about getting the vaccine and look for interesting persons to connect with on sites such as LinkedIn. The presentation noted that the theme vaccine registration was the top social media hashtag some time back, with 70% engagement and mentions being neutral, 20% being negative and only 5% being positive. This, they were told, was an opportunity for the government’s officers to reach out to. “Some of the key themes they encouraged people to highlight were data about recoveries and amplifying any kind of positive stories that each department could get,’’ he said.The presentation also highlighted the best and worst ways of engaging on social media platforms , pointing out that speed of response, use of infographics, and clear messaging were the key.Former head of Press Information Bureau, Neelam Kapur, said, "I don't think communications can make up for action. Having worked in the health sector, I can see how an opportunity was lost in communicating the right message be it about masks or crowds. Messaging needed to be worked out much earlier."Image consultant Dilip Cherian, who works with governments on various campaigns, said, "Harnessing influencers is like using posh peddlers to push shoddy product. It ends up giving influencers a bad name. Worse, a burst of false positivity, becomes like a sudden boil on your nose when you've just worn fancy new clothes."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/officials-attend-session-on-boosting-image-perception-101620153678959.html
05-05-2021||India||‘On the way’: Centre to states awaiting Covid-19 supplies||As questions continued to swirl on Tuesday regarding allocation of oxygen-related equipment and supplies provided by other countries to back India’s Covid-19 response, the government said it had framed a standard operating procedure (SOP) for distribution of aid to states with higher number of active cases.Medical infrastructure of 38 institutions across 31 states, stretched thin because of an unprecedented surge in Coronavirus infections, was strengthened using supplies from around the world, the Centre said. The supplies have either reached the state or are on their way, it added.Officials in at least five of these 31 states listed in a statement issued by the Press Information Bureau (PIB) – Assam, Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Uttarakhand and West Bengal – said they were yet to receive any of the foreign aid.It also emerged from the PIB’s statement that the SOP for distributing foreign aid materials was framed by the Union health ministry on May 2, whereas supplies procured from abroad under commercial contracts began entering the country on April 25 and aid from other countries started arriving from April 27.According to an official count, India has already received 1,656 oxygen concentrators, 965 ventilators, 1,782 oxygen cylinders, 17 large cylinders, 20 large oxygen concentrators, 150 bedside monitors, 480 BiPAPs, 20 high flow humidifying oxygen therapy devices, nine oxygen generation plants, 136,000 doses of Remdesivir, 200000 packs of Favipiravir and other supplies.The PIB statement said a total of almost 400,000 items across 24 categories had been distributed to the 38 institutions in different states. The major categories of equipment sent to the states included BiPAP machines, oxygen concentrators, cylinders, oxygen plants, pulse oximeters, drugs such as Favipiravir and Remdesivir, and personal protective equipment. The statement did not give specific break-ups of what each state had received.The government of Delhi, where several hospitals have witnessed repeated shortages of oxygen, said it hadn’t received any communication from the Centre about foreign aid. “We have not got anything from them as such. They are directly reaching out to hospitals instead of the state governments...,” said a government spokesperson.Four hospitals in Delhi received large oxygen generation plants from France as grants, and at least two – installed at the privately run BLK Hospital and Narayana Super Specialty Hospital – had started functioning. These plants are capable of producing 22 cubic metres of oxygen an hour, and provide about 20% additional oxygen back-up a day.Officials in Maharashtra’s health department said the state hasn’t received any of the foreign aid. “We have been getting medical materials regularly from the Centre. We received a stock of Remdesivir injections about a week ago, but it was not from the relief materials from other countries,” said an official from the public health department.“Uttarakhand has not received any foreign Covid-19 aid. And we are not aware of the Centre sending any of the supplies it has received from other countries to the state,” said JC Pandey, the state health department’s spokesman. State health minister Rajesh Tope said, “We would like to request the Central government to allocate maximum possible stocks to Maharashtra from the donations received from other countries.West Bengal’s health secretary NS Nigam too said no foreign aid had reached the state. “As of now, nothing. But there are indications that we may get some supplies, such as RT-PCR test kits soon,” he said.NITI Aayog CEO Amitabh Kant, who heads a committee overseeing the distribution of foreign aid, dismissed media reports about delays in allocation of supplies. “There is a government-to-government approval. Allocations are done by the health ministry. Private donations are all tracked and every donor will know where the goods are going,” he said.A senior central government official, requesting anonymity, said: “The entire process is absolutely transparent, and is in addition to the support that the Central government is providing to states to manage the pandemic. The supplies are being closely monitored on a daily basis, and are directed to areas wherever there is a need for augmentation.”But as questions have persisted about the allocation of relief materials, some countries have begun specifying where their supplies should go. For instance, France specified that eight oxygen generation plants provided by it should be distributed among hospitals in Delhi, Haryana and Telangana.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/on-the-way-centre-to-states-awaiting-covid-19-supplies-101620153619490.html
05-05-2021||India||UK, India vow enhanced trade ties, adopt 10-year road map||India and the UK on Tuesday launched an Enhanced Trade Partnership that envisages facilitating market access in specific sectors, and unveiled plans to finalise an interim trade deal by mid-2022 as a precursor to a free trade agreement.At a virtual summit between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his UK counterpart Boris Johnson, the two sides also set a target for doubling bilateral trade by 2030 and adopted the Roadmap 2030 to elevate ties to a comprehensive strategic partnership over the next decade.The Enhanced Trade Partnership, part of the UK’s efforts to ramp up trade ties with countries around the world following its exit from the European Union (EU), will see Britain open up its fisheries sector to more Indian players, facilitate more opportunities for nurses, recognise Indian seafarers’ certificates and enter into a joint dialogue on a social security agreement.In return, India lifted restrictions to enable British fruit producers to export their produce to the country and improved access for medical devices through the acceptance of the “UK Certificates of Free Sale”. The two sides will also work towards reciprocal opening up of legal services.“Had a productive Virtual Summit with my friend UK PM Boris Johnson. We adopted an ambitious Roadmap 2030 for elevating India-UK ties to a Comprehensive Strategic Partnership,” PM Modi tweeted.These actions are likely to generate some 25,000 new direct and indirect jobs in India, Sandeep Chakravorty, joint secretary (Europe West) in the external affairs ministry, told a news briefing.The virtual summit was held after Johnson cancelled a state visit to New Delhi twice because of the Covid-19 situation – first in January to focus on an outbreak in the UK and in April due to the second wave of infections in India. Ahead of the summit, Johnson announced a trade and investment package with India worth £1 billion, including a £240-million investment by the Serum Institute of India (SII) in the UK.Johnson informed Modi about SII’s investment and manufacture of vaccines in the UK, especially research on nasal vaccines, Chakravorty said. He noted SII is a multinational company that has a presence in the Netherlands and plans to manufacture vaccines in other countries.Following the launch of the Enhanced Trade Partnership, the two sides agreed to frame a roadmap for pre-free trade agreement (FTA) talks by end of this year, finalise an interim trade deal by early or mid-2022, and conclude talks for an FTA “at an early date”, Chakravorty said. Chakravorty described the launch of Roadmap 2030 as a “big deliverable” of the summit that is in line with the vision of the two leaders to elevate India-UK ties into a comprehensive strategic partnership.The roadmap lists several activities and initiatives to be pursued by the two sides in five key areas – trade and economy, defence and security, climate action, health and people-to-people contacts – over the next decade.The two countries also signed eight agreements, including a memorandum of understanding (MoU) on a migration and mobility partnership that will facilitate legal movement of students and professionals and strengthen cooperation in combating illegal migration. The MoU creates a new scheme under which up to 3,000 young Indian professionals can every year avail of employment opportunities in the UK for two years without being subject to a labour market test.The other agreements covered emerging technologies, digital infrastructure and data policies, cooperation in telecommunications and ICT, customs cooperation, and cooperation on medical products regulation.Modi and Johnson agreed to advance defence ties to a new level, with focus on maritime and industrial collaboration. They agreed to new cooperation on maritime domain awareness, including new agreements on maritime information-sharing. The UK was invited to join India’s naval information fusion centre and an exercise programme that includes tri-lateral exercises. India and the UK are also working to conclude a Logistics Memorandum of Understanding between their armed forces. They will build on existing collaboration on India’s future combat air engine requirement by working together on the indigenous development of the Light Combat Aircraft Mark 2.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/uk-india-vow-enhanced-trade-ties-adopt-10-year-road-map-101620153499427.html

The problem is we cannot collect throat or nasal swab samples from animals. So, most probably, we will put in place a method to collect scat samples. CCMB is devising that method and guidelines,” a senior forest official familiar with the matter said requesting anonymity.The official added that all wildlife wardens have been asked to be alert.“On April 24, the Hyderabad zoo gave samples of the eight lions -- collected from the nose, throat and respiratory tract under anaesthesia -- to CCMB after they showed signs of respiratory distress associated with Covid-19. Based on detailed tests and reports on Tuesday, it has now been confirmed that eight lions have tested positive for Sars-CoV-2 virus, which causes Covid-19,” the ministry said in a statement on Tuesday.The statement further said that an analysis of the samples confirmed that the infection was not caused by any Covid-19 variant of concern (VOC). It did not specify if genome sequencing had been carried out.According to the ministry, the eight lions have been isolated and all the lions are recovering after responding well to treatment. They are “behaving normally and eating well”, the ministry’s statement said.The ministry pointed out that the Central Zoo Authority has taken several pre-emptive measures, including sending guidelines and advisories to the zoos -- ranging from prevention to sample collection to detection in suspected cases to safety protocols for animal keepers -- in light of the surge in Covid-19 cases in recent weeks.According to the United States Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and Prevention, there is currently no evidence that animals play a significant role in spreading the coronavirus disease to humans. It said in an advisory on its website that more studies are needed to understand if and how different animals could be affected by Sars-CoV-2, and that Covid-19 can spread from people to animals in some situations, especially during close contact.“We know that Covid-19 can infect animals like cats. Last year, a tiger was infected in the Bronx Zoo (New York), possibly by interactions with an infected keeper. Infections rates in India are very high right now, and this makes the probability of spillover from humans to animals high. The best way to control this is to break the chain; test keepers and zoo staff regularly,” said Uma Ramakrishnan, an associate professor at Bengaluru’s National Centre for Biological Sciences.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/zoos-national-parks-shut-as-four-lions-test-positive-for-covid19-101620126257378.html

Pointing out that many crew members have tested positive for Covid-19, ICPA said the flying crew has been risking its life during this pandemic.“If Air India fails to set up vaccination camps on a Pan-India basis for the flying crew above the age of 18 years on priority, we will “STOP WORK (sic),” the letter warned.They said those on desk jobs or could opt for working from home can get vaccinated, but not the flying crew, leaving them vulnerable.The letter read, ‘It is disheartening to witness the top management make a mockery of pilots discharging their duties in a risky environment. We were hoping that Air India would not let down the crew and their families who stand by the nation during this pandemic. We feel let down by the self-serving approach of the management, which sees no injustice in organising vaccine camps at few bases but excludes pilots.”ICPA pilots said that it is due to their unwavering support that Vande Bharat Mission (VBM) and relief operations have continued to run smoothly even in the face of a resurgence of even deadlier strains of Covid-19, only to get a discriminatory pay cut in return.The association said it is not in the position to risk lives of pilots flying without vaccination as there is no healthcare support or insurance, and a “massive opportunistic” pay cut.“Our finances are already spread thin covering our bedridden colleagues and provisioning for families lest we inadvertently infect them with the deadly virus that is an ever-present occupational hazard for us,” the letter concluded.Also Read | Covid-19: Air India to resume flights to UK from SaturdayIn an email response, the airline spokesperson’s said, “Air India is aware of an official communique from one of its unions sent to the Management.This is an entirely internal issue which is meant to be sorted out within the organisation. While we appreciate your keen interest on each and every issue related to Air India, we will not like to make any comment on an issue that, in any case, has no reason to be discussed in the external public domain.” The airline’s Boeing pilots, Indian Pilots Guild (IPG), were the first to write to the airline management on April 28. They had stated that it was disappointing to see the “inadequate” efforts been made to protect pilots’ well-being.The IPG letter read, ‘Despite the second wave choking the nation’s medical resources, not a single pilot has refused any flight sighting risk of infection as a reason. Several of our colleagues are being hospitalised at an alarming rate and are in critical need of oxygen...it is in the nature of our duty to be at risk of exposure to the virus. At the very least our company should leave no stone unturned to keep us safe.’ IPG too had warned the management to keep the aircrew on top priority, and that they would have to make decision in the interests of their pilots and their familiesThe airline however replied to the pilots on April 30, assuring them to conduct the vaccination drive from May 1. The letter accessed by the paper read, ‘..The Operations Department, in coordination with the Medical Department, will initiate the process of vaccinating all Operations staff. This includes Operations Ground staff, Dispatchers, Crew, both Cockpit and Cabin, above the age of 18 years. The logistics of venues and processes are being worked upon across the country as of now and the same will be communicated as soon as they are finalised..’||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-covid-vaccine-for-flying-crew-we-will-stop-work-ai-pilots-to-management-101620123677243.html
05-05-2021||India||Restore MPLADS so that MPs can use it for Covid management: BSP MP to PM||Bahujan Samaj Party leader and Member of Parliament from Amroha, UP, Kunwar Danish Ali has asked Prime Minister Narendra Modi to immediately restore the Member of Parliament Local Area Development Scheme (MPLADS) so that lawmakers can utilise it to provide immediate medical relief to people in their respective constituencies amid the second wave of Covid-19. MPLADS, which has been suspended for the past two years by the government which wanted to utilise them for Covid management and healthcare facilities, is a scheme under which each MP can suggest to the district collector works to the tune of ₹5 crore per annum in their constituency.In a letter to the PM on Monday, Ali said that the situation in his constituency [arising out of the pandemic] was “serious and prompt action was needed to resolve the crisis”. “The disease has spread from village to village in my constituency. But there is a huge shortage of medicines, beds, oxygen and other medical facilities necessary to deal with this disease. There is hardly any medical support to save precious lives… The district administration is expressing its helplessness in providing relief to my people” he said.Also Read | SC dismisses plea for return of MPLAD funds donated to PM CARESAli, who had donated a month’s salary to PM CARES fund last year, said that no notable medical facility had been provided in his constituency. “Because of this, the people of my constituency are facing great difficulties in this crisis of pandemic and are witnessing untimely death due to non-availability of basic medical infrastructure,” he wrote.Calling for decentralisation of healthcare provisions, he said that handing over MPLADS funds to public representatives who know their areas well would be an important step in enabling them to provide relief to the people of their respective constituencies.“As the situation created by Covid is catastrophic, I request you to immediately release the MPLADS funds to all the MPs that have been withheld for two years so that I and all other MPs could try to save the lives by setting up oxygen plants and provide relief to the victims in our parliamentary constituencies” he wrote.Reacting to Ali’s letter, BJP national spokesperson Gopal Agarwal said that government is committed to effective utilisation of all the funds. “The release of the MPLADS fund was suspended with an intent to use it for provision of healthcare services and that is how it is being utilised at the moment,” he said.Hindustan Times also tried to reach out to Rao Inderjit, minister of state for programme implementation, who also holds the independent charge of piloting the MPLAD scheme, and he responded a day later.Rao Inderjit responded on Wednesday that the budgetary outlay of MPLAD scheme for the last two years was allocated under finance ministry and these funds were already distributed among district authorities for health management.“MPs can thereby re-prioritise their earlier recommended works under the same,” he said in his letter to Ali.He added that expenditure for the completion of these recommended works is supposed to be met from these funds that have been made available with the district authorities. “This was done in pursuance of the decision of the Union cabinet taken on 6th April last year.” Inderjit wrote.He also confirmed that there was no proposal of the government to immediately release any pending instalments of MPLADS as in March this yea.Meanwhile, the district magistrate of Amroha, Ali’s constituency, claimed that the medical facilities there were at par with those of any other district. Umesh Mishra said 450 beds had been added for Covid-19 patients and there was no paucity of oxygen. He also shared that legislators gave their MLA fund for installation of oxygen plants and three of them have been installed by diverting corporate social responsibility funds. Amroha district has a population of over 1.8 million and has 1,133 villages in six blocks and 601 gram panchayats.

The only way to stop the spread of Corona now is a full lockdown- with the protection of NYAY for the vulnerable sections. GOI’s inaction is killing many innocent people,” Gandhi posted on Twitter.NYAY was the financial support scheme for the poor proposed by the Congress in its 2019 Lok Sabha election manifesto.He added: “I just want to make it clear that a lockdown is now the only option because of a complete lack of strategy by GOI. They allowed, rather, they actively helped the virus reach this stage where there’s no other way to stop it.”Gandhi’s suggestion came days after Prime Minister Narendra Modi told states to use the lockdown only as the last resort.In another tweet, the Congress leader maintained that the money allocated for the Central Vista project could be utilised to vaccinate 45 crore Indians.“Rs.13,450 crores for Central Vista. Or, for fully vaccinating 45 crore Indians. Or, for 1 crore oxygen cylinders. Or, to give 2 crore families NYAY of ₹6,000.

05-05-2021||India||ICMR’s guidelines push antigen tests amid surge||The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) on Tuesday issued a fresh Covid-19 testing advisory that recommends using more rapid antigen tests (RAT) in the wake of exponential surge in cases that has overwhelmed the country’s health care delivery system, and caused huge backlogs in the gold-standard RT-PCR tests. While ICMR is counting on more reliable new-generation RAT kits, if the tests end up being as inaccurate as the previous generation of RATs, they could artificially lower Covid-19 case numbers, and potentially create undiagnosed superspreaders.“The best public health action is to help people know about their status at the earliest, even if somebody is asymptomatic; and laboratories performing reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests are functioning to their full capacity. So, why should one wait for two to three days to get their confirmatory test result to come back?” asked Dr Samiran Panda, head, epidemiology and communicable disease, ICMR.To be sure, ICMR’s decision seems to be driven by two factors: new-generation RATs that are more accurate; and the fact that their use has always been recommended when time is a constraint (and in the current context, it is). If time is not a constraint, the use of RT-PCR tests is recommended because RATs tend to have a high proportion of false negatives, identifying infected people as uninfected. During the first wave, many states depended on RATs when they were constrained by testing capacity (not time), which is not recommended.“The companies try to come up with modified kits that are of higher sensitivity and specificity. The current RAT kits that have been evaluated by us, these have been tested to see how they perform in symptomatic individuals and asymptomatic individuals. And we found out that newer kits have improved sensitivity and specificity which means better performance than the earlier ones,” Dr Panda added.Much depends on the reliability of the tests, an expert said. “If they are so confident about the RAT kits that they have tested then they should have first published the data that’s peer-reviewed, as it would build confidence in people. It should be quality data and out in public domain,” said Jugal Kishore, head, community medicine, Safdarjung Hopsital.Indeed, if the new tests are not accurate, then it could end up identifying a lot of infected people as uninfected, resulting in more infections from those who come in contact with them; it could also make local administrations complacent and overall Covid-19 numbers unrepresentative by showing fewer cases than there really are.So far, ICMR has approved 36 RAT kits. It has also advised setting up of dedicated 24x7 RAT booths at multiple locations in cities towns and villages. States have also been asked to set up drive-through RAT testing facilities. The idea of the new protocol, different from the previous one which emphasised at least 70% of testing in any region to be RT-PCR (a message consistently reinforced by the health ministry and the PM) is to break the chain of transmission through early diagnosis, Dr Panda said.There are close to 2,500 RT-PCR testing labs with a testing capacity of about 1.5 million tests a day. Given the surging second wave of Covid-19, the country’s daily testing is in excess of 1.5 million, which means all labs are testing to their capacity.The advisory has done away with the need for RT-PCR test in healthy individuals undertaking inter-state domestic travel, to reduce the load on labs.It also said that RT-PCR tests must not be repeated in any individual who has tested positive once either by RAT or RT-PCR||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/icmr-comes-up-with-guidebook-to-counsel-covid-patients-healthcare-workers-101620102255793.html
05-05-2021||Today's||Of India-Pakistan ties and third-party mediation||In the midst of the mismanagement of Covid-19 by the central government, and India’s decision to accept foreign aid after 17 years, a development that has slipped under the radar is the choice to accept third-party mediation qua Pakistan — a first post-1972.In a recent off-the-record interaction with journalists, Pakistani army chief General QJ Bajwa apparently opined that India’s national security adviser Ajit Doval and Pakistan’s Inter Services Intelligence (ISI) chief Lieutenant General Faiz Hameed had ostensibly held confabulations in the United Arab Emirates (UAE), leading up to the February 25 ceasefire. What was, however, glossed over was the exact role of the UAE in midwifing this interaction?That role was revealed earlier by the UAE’s ambassador to the United States (US), Yousef Al Otaiba. He avowed that the UAE is indeed mediating between India and Pakistan to help them reach a “healthy and functional relationship”. He further went on to state that India and Pakistan may not become the best of friends but at least “we” want to get it to a level where it is functional and operational and “they” (India and Pakistan) are speaking to each other and there are lines of communication and that’s “our” goal.Notwithstanding the dripping condescension of a marriage counsellor trying to patch up a rather prickly relationship, Otaiba’s revelations may perhaps be inaugurating a new chapter in the Indo-Pakistani dynamic — direct and overt mediation by a third country.The India-Pakistan relationship, or the absence of it, has gone through many hoops of overt mediation and backchannel dialogue in the past seven decades. Between January 1, 1948, when India took Jammu & Kashmir (J&K) to the United Nations (UN) and the Simla Agreement on July 2, 1972, whereby both nations agreed to settle all outstanding disputes bilaterally, there were a series of attempts to mediate both under the auspices of the UN and bilaterally by the great powers. Various UN resolutions, efforts by Adlai Stevenson in 1953 and the Soviet Union-brokered Tashkent agreement after the Indo-Pakistan war in 1965 all bear eloquent testimony to these failed and some partly successful efforts.However, post-Simla, India has stoutly resisted any attempt by any other nation to intervene or mediate overtly in the Indo-Pakistani imbroglio.Undoubtedly, there have been various discreet attempts after that too. Both the United States (US) and even the Soviet Union reached out to India and Pakistan respectively to lower heightened tensions in the wake of Operation Brass Tacks in 1986-1987. There was the Robert Gates Mission in 1990 when ratcheting up of tensions between India and Pakistan over the unrest in Kashmir and Pakistan’s nuclear sabre-rattling impelled the then US deputy national security adviser to make a dash to the subcontinent. On July 4, 1999, Nawaz Sharif made an emergency sprint to Washington DC to get President Bill Clinton to intervene in the Kargil War but Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee resolutely refused to join him in DC and stayed put in Delhi, making it clear that Pakistani withdrawal was the first step.During Operation Parakram in 2001 again, presumably, at the behest of the US, Lieutenant General Kapil Vij was relieved of the command of the Ambala-based 2nd Strike Core because American satellites picked up the forward deployment of his armoured assets almost to strike positions. During the second peak of Operation Parakram, post the Kaluchak terrorist outrage, US deputy secretary of state Richard Armitage and defence secretary Donald Rumsfeld played peacemaker between India and Pakistan.Similarly, during the 26/11 terrorist outrage in 2008 and the air raid on Balakot in 2019, there was an enormous amount of backchannel manoeuvring by many friendly nations, described by various actors in their accounts, most recently by one of Donald Trump’s many national security advisers, John Bolton.Then, there were the backchannel bilateral conversations. One of the less documented but perhaps the most productive dialogue was between RK Mishra and Pakistan’s former foreign secretary Niaz Naik in 1998 and 1999. The parleys suffered because of the Kargil conflict. However, the most sustained backchannel between the two countries was between ambassador Satinder Lambah and his Pakistani counterpart Tariq Aziz during the tenure of the United Progressive Alliance. Lambah is circumspect even today about what transpired during this process.It is also widely speculated that there was another backchannel active from 2018 onwards between a former deputy director-general of the ISI and a now-retired senior officer of the cabinet secretariat that dovetailed into more high-level interactions at an institutional level between India and Pakistan. The common thread that runs through all these attempts from 1972 onwards was that they were quiet and discreet parleys aimed at influencing key decision-makers in both countries — either to act or not act in a particular manner, during or in the aftermath of a crisis. The backchannels were also purely bilateral affairs unlike the Oslo process between Israel and the Palestinian Liberation Organisation (PLO) that was actively midwifed by the foreign ministry of Norway. Presuming that both India and Pakistan do believe that such third-party mediation would help in arriving at a modus vivendi between the two nuclear-armed neighbours, there is an obvious question — does the UAE have the heft to guarantee that the arrangements arrived at are adhered too, which, from India’s perspective, is primarily the cessation of all cross-border terrorism by Pakistan? If India and Pakistan are now wanting to cross the Rubicon of third-party mediation, should they not find an arbitrator with greater heft?Manish Tewari is a Member of Parliament, former Union minister, and a lawyerThe views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/of-india-pakistan-ties-and-third-party-mediation-101620236858359.html
05-05-2021||Today's||The MSME sector needs help. First, smoothen financial flows||According to the 2020-21 annual report of the ministry of micro, small and medium enterprises, India’s 63 million micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) contributed to 30% of the GDP. MSMEs also employ more than 100 million workers. These numbers underline the importance of MSMEs in generating jobs — especially when the pandemic has affected the sector significantly.One of the challenges facing MSMEs in India is related to finance. CRISIL’s small and medium enterprises (SME) tracker shows that the problem has been getting worse, given the fact that the gap between the available and required working capital has been widening since 2015.The sector’s finance-related problems are due to three main factors — the absence of viable credit providers, absence of credit products and schemes such as micro-insurance that help enterprises tide over episodic downturns, and delayed payments leading to a persistent crunch in working capital. The research undertaken by the finance taskforce at the Global Alliance for Mass Entrepreneurship has looked at the problems of delayed payments.To measure the extent of the problem, we used the Prowess IQ database which includes over 51,000 companies and is the largest available dynamic corporate sector database in India. We categorised enterprises following the existing definitions of annual revenue of less than ₹5, 50 and 250 crore, respectively. About 12,000 companies met the criteria of having reported their annual revenue and sales.The MSME Act of 2006 mandates that payments be completed in 45 days. Our calculations show that in 2019 the average number of days it takes for enterprises to receive cash for the credit sale are 176, 112 and 81 days for micro, small and medium enterprises, respectively. The problem of delayed payments increases as firm size decreases. The outstanding receivables beyond 45 days, among these 12,000 enterprises, were: ₹90 lakh for enterprises in the micro category, ₹7 crores for those which fell in the small category and ₹34 crore for those in the medium category. The actual extent of the problem is much bigger as not all MSMEs are included in the Prowess database. Even if one were to assume that 10% of India’s MSMEs were facing the problem of delayed payments, extrapolation would give a sum of ₹15 lakh crore. A recent report calculates that unlocking this amount as working capital is equal to an increase in the GDP by 0.42%.The quantum and duration of delay are the two key factors that determine whether a transaction will yield its originally promised profit margin. Delayed payments entail four kinds of costs for firms — costs in retrieving payments in the form of personnel, time and effort; interest forgone beyond the prescribed period; business forgone due to working capital crunch; and losses due to non-reconciliation. The first two cost-heads squeeze earnings, while the latter two erode capital.Given that in the present scenario of the pandemic, small enterprises are bogged down by both demand- and supply-side challenges, concerted efforts at easing cash flow and faster payment cycles are a much-needed policy intervention to ensure their survival.While the government has taken steps such as setting up the online Receivables Discounting System (TReDS) and MSME Samadhan, they have not been very effective. Since its launch, Samadhan has registered a little over 75,000 cases. Only about 10,000 MSMEs and over 1,300 buyers are registered on TReDS. The Udhyam portal which automates the eligibility of enterprise to raise invoices on TReDS has itself seen only about 2.6 million registrations. Given these particularities, and limited applicability of solutions the way ahead seems to be more than just a technocratic fix. Power asymmetries between enterprises of different sizes, corporations and public sector units need to be neutralised towards making it viable for micro and small suppliers of products and services to do business. Easing the cash flow woes of small businesses is vital not just for their growth but their survival.Kinjal Sampat leads research, monitoring and evaluation at the Global Alliance for Mass EntrepreneurshipThe views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/the-msme-sector-needs-help-first-smoothen-financial-flows-101620235598300.html
05-05-2021||Today's||Lessons for India from the Ebola epidemic||The West African Ebola epidemic, which infected 28,616 and killed 11,310 in Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea between 2014 and 2016, may seem at first like a localised, regional public health emergency compared to the global Covid-19 pandemic. Yet, at a time when the second wave is crushing India, at both the micro- and macro-level, there are lessons to be learnt from the Ebola crisis.First, like Ebola, Covid-19 must be treated as a caregiver’s disease. In his book, Fevers, Feuds and Diamonds: Ebola and the Ravages of History, globally renowned infectious diseases doctor and anthropologist Paul Farmer, who was involved on the ground in Ebola treatment in West Africa, makes the crucial point that thousands contracted Ebola while caring for the sick and dead. Recognising Covid-19 as a caregiver’s disease is important not only to validate the efforts (and vulnerabilities) of doctors, nurses and paramedical caregivers but also to recognise small, everyday acts of caregiving in the home, hospital, clinic and cremation grounds.Beyond vaccination, the Indian State must develop a concrete plan to address the challenge of frontline workers burning out. The risk of an acute shortage of key frontline workers in future is extremely real. We must further ask, are acts of caregiving in cremation grounds, graveyards and mortuaries — most often by those who belong to lower caste and class backgrounds — even recognised by the State? Are there any forms of insurance the government has created for these invisible frontline workers (and their families) who perform caregiving’s very last gesture? Caregivers must be treated as seriously as the afflicted, for viruses such as Ebola and Sars-CoV-2 blur the boundaries between caregivers and patients.Second, efforts directed at the containment of the virus must be prefigured by capacity-building to care for the afflicted. Announcing lockdowns and enforcing these only through coercion is not a solution in itself.Also Read | WHO sees Ebola risk as ‘very high’ for Guinea’s neighboursAs Farmer discusses in the case of Ebola, public health and biomedicine are foremostly part of the State’s social contract. Without ensuring safe and effective caregiving is in place, the policy of containment has its limits. Such a “control-over-care paradigm”, as Ebola has shown us all too well, not only endangers the lives of the afflicted but also leads to resentment against the State that may take the form of mistrust, resisting contact-tracing, vaccination and containment.Third, on the face of it, the current crisis in India is the result of severe burdens on secondary- and tertiary-care hospitals, and the State’s failure to address their basic needs — oxygen, beds, equipment, medicines and vaccines. This mirrors the Ebola crisis in West Africa’s clinical desert, which lacked the basic staff, material, space and systems of care. Independent Ebola treatment units in West Africa were set up through community mobilisation and sustained over two years in the absence of secondary or tertiary medicine.The Indian State, too, must develop forms of care that de-centre tertiary hospitals whose limits are being exposed in horrifying scenes of people dying outside hospitals, in parking lots, streets and pavements — not so much because of Sars-CoV-2 but the absence of basic medical infrastructure. A focus on community care facilities such as oxygen-hubs, portable prefabricated health units and testing-treatment wards at the meso-level prevent overburdening hospitals and ensure triage before tertiary systems collapse.Fourth, we can’t neglect the social determinants of health in a viral pandemic. In India’s current second wave, infections and the failure of medical systems are impacting the middle- and upper-middle classes. This is different from the first wave in 2020, in which the first to be debilitated were migrant workers, informal labourers, the poor and the social and economically disadvantaged. We must ask ourselves — why did the State, media, citizens (including netizens) and medical systems fail to recognise and respond to the full-blown crisis of the intervening period? What does the present moment reveal about how our notions of crisis and care are determined by class and caste? A serious commitment to public health cannot start after the most vulnerable have suffered.Fifth, viruses always track weaknesses in society and invade their cracks and fissures. As Farmer said in an interview, “There is a confusion at the beginning of epidemics that a novel pathogen is going to be some sort of ‘great leveller’. This is almost never the case.” To understand and stymie the movement of viruses, we must understand our social systems more effectively and sensitively.Also Read | NHRC asks Centre, states to maintain Covid-19 dashboardsIn the case of Ebola, Farmer traces historical reasons such as colonialism and post-colonial civil wars, ethnic strife and exploitative structural adjustment programmes resulting in West Africa’s “clinical desert”. In the Indian context, the State’s longitudinal lack of attention to health is exacerbated by divisions of caste, class, gender and ethnicity, which have summarily prevented public health from taking shape as a social or governmental priority.It is common for the responsibility of ailing health systems to be shifted onto the afflicted. Alongside scientists and virologists, whose efforts are important, the Indian government must involve social scientists, community volunteers and those who routinely track society at a granular level, in its disaster preparedness. Not just Ebola, the record of global pandemics such as AIDS too reveal the need to identify vulnerable groups to address their distinctive needs, and remedy existing chasms of care.Learning from Ebola, we must remind ourselves that a good system that responds to viral threats is not an emergency system but an everyday system that responds to emergencies.Nikhil Pandhi is a doctoral candidate in medical and cultural anthropology at Princeton University.

05-05-2021||Today's||Decoding women’s representation in the 2021 state elections||Reports, anecdotal accounts, and now the results suggest that women played a crucial role in shaping the electoral outcomes in the four states and one Union Territory that went to the polls this year. In West Bengal, they may have cemented the All India Trinamool Congress’s (TMC) victory by massively voting for Mamata Banerjee’s candidates. These elections also took place in five states where the gender gap in participation and voting had closed way before these elections. In West Bengal and Tamil Nadu, it closed in 2011. In Puducherry, women have been outvoting men since 1985 and in Kerala and Assam, there was never a gap between men and women in the first place. How did these five states and their main parties fare in terms of women representation in this election and in the past? The quick answer to that question is not so well. Overall, women constituted only 10.4% of all candidates, and only 8.5% of all members of the legislative assembly (MLAs). West Bengal is the only state where the ratio of women MLA is superior to that of women candidates, thanks to the TMC’s decision to field 48 women out of its 288 candidates (16.7%). This is more than any other parties across the five states, but much less than the 41% of women candidates it fielded in the 2019 general elections. See Chart 1: Share of women candidates and MLAs If we exclude local parties and independent candidates, the ratio of women candidates among major parties increases to 13.5%. The credit is mostly due to state-based parties, who gave 14.4% of their tickets to women candidates, against 11% for the national parties. But even among them, there are important variations. In Tamil Nadu, there is a marked difference between the two Dravidian parties. The Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) fielded 11 women (5.9%) against 17 for the All India Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK) (8.9%). Only 12 women were elected in an assembly of 234 — six from the DMK, three from the AIADMK, two from the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and 1 one from the Congress. Small parties such as the Amma Makkal Munnetra Kazhagam or the Desiya Murpokku Dravida Kazhagam have done comparatively better, with 9.7% and 11.7% of women candidates, respectively. In West Bengal, 33 of the 40 women elected ran on a TMC ticket, and seven on a BJP ticket. 19 women legislators have been elected.

Three women were elected on a BJP ticket, against two on a Congress ticket and one on an Assam Gana Parishad (AGP) ticket. In Kerala, 10 of the 11 women MLAs are communists — eight from the Communist Party of India (Marxist) or CPI (M) and two from the Communist Party of India (CPI). The only other woman elected, KK Rema, was elected on a local party ticket, which was a part of the United Democratic Front (UDF). In Puducherry, the lone woman MLA, ChandiraPriyanga, was elected on an All India NR Congress ticket. The BJP’s women nominations were highest in Tamil Nadu (15%) and in Kerala (13.9%). Two of the three BJP women candidates were elected in Tamil Nadu while none of the 16 BJP women it fielded in Kerala (out of 115 candidates) were elected. In Bengal, 38 women ran on a BJP ticket (13.1%) and only 7 did in Assam (7.5%). See Chart 2: State-wise party-wise representation of women 19 of the 40 women elected in West Bengal have been elected for the first time while four and 14 of them are serving a second and a third term respectively. In the four other states, the majority of women elected are first-time MLAs. 30 of the 70 women elected across these five states ran for the first time. 30 of the 48 women who ran as incumbent MLAs were re-elected, which is a high strike rate (63%), practically at the same level as their male counterparts (65%). Of the 21 TMC incumbent women MLAs, only four were not re-elected. An examination of trends over time shows that West Bengal is the only state where women representation has consistently increased since the late 1990s. Women representation in Tamil Nadu and Assam has gone down. Kerala registers one of the lowest rate of women representation in its state assembly in India. This year’s improvement, from 5.7% to 7.9%, is nominal. There are only three more women in the assembly than in 2016. See Chart 3: Share of women MLAs in states since 1991 What lessons can be drawn from these descriptive statistics? We see first that parties and governments that cater to women’s interests, notably through general social and welfare policies, tend to be rewarded with the support of women voters. But the progressiveness that can be seen in governance does not necessarily translate into inclusion in the domain of politics. Far from it. Communists have historically marginalised women within their ranks, even though this year, the CPI (M) in Kerala broke with that tradition, by nominating 13% of women candidates. The DMK remains a male-dominated universe in which few women are given career opportunities. The AIADMK used to do better when it was led by Jayalalithaa. But her demise and the subsequent eviction of VK Sasikala by the party establishment has led to a male take-over of the party. Also Read | PM Modi expresses concern over law and order situation in Bengal: DhankharIn Assam, women were better represented under the Congress governments of Tarun Gogoi. The Asom Gana Parishad and other state-based parties never created much space for women representation within its ranks, nor has the BJP today. The question of women representation is yet another indicator of the divorce that exists between electoral politics, a domain that remains dominated by men, and governance, where considerations of gender equity are possible. One should not deduct however that the latter would not gain from an improvement of the former. Under Mamata Banerjee, the Trinamool is leading the way in terms of women inclusion in politics. Genuine women inclusion translates into more women taking part in political activities, campaigning and mobilisation, and to more women attending rallies and campaign events. The contrast in the gender composition of the BJP and TMC’s attendance was particularly striking. One can only hope that other parties will follow the lead.

05-05-2021||Today's||Scientifically Speaking | The King of Dinosaurs||Children love dinosaurs, of which the most revered is Tyrannosaurus rex. This is for good reason. With its gigantic gait and bone-crushing teeth, T. rex invokes a sense of fear and awe. As the king of dinosaurs, it was an apex predator — the largest strictly meat-eating land animal that is known to have ever existed. T. rex roamed across North America for over two million years until a huge asteroid hit the earth 66 million years ago. I must confess that like other children, I went through an extended dinosaur phase in my childhood. Back then, T. rex was depicted as a dull-coloured dinosaur with lizard-like scales. At the time, this image of dinosaurs was also etched into the public psyche by Hollywood movies such as Jurassic Park. However, scientific evidence accumulated over the past few years indicates much of what we knew back then might be incorrect. All tyrannosaurs, including T. rex, belong to a class of two-legged meat-eating dinosaurs known as theropods. From some remarkable fossils found in China over the past three decades, we know much more about theropods. These exquisite fossils have details of soft tissue, and so they provide a unique window in dinosaur life and evolution. Quite stunningly, we have strong evidence that theropods had feathers. Also Read | Centre notifies revised eco zone around Thane flamingo sanctuaryIn a landmark article published in Nature in 2004, Xu Xing of the Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology and Paleoanthropology in Beijing and his colleagues described an early tyrannosaur the size of a dog that lived in the early Cretaceous period nearly 130 million years. They named it Dilong paradoxus, and noted that it had fluffy primitive feathers called protofeathers. Eight years later, in another blockbuster article in Nature, Xing and his team highlighted the discovery of fossilised remains of a tyrannosaur, which they named Yutyrannus huali. It was an incredible discovery of a gigantic dinosaur with feathers — one that must rank as one of the greatest scientific discoveries of the previous decade. As a class of dinosaurs, tyrannosaurs weren’t always behemoths. Paleontologists now believe tyrannosaurs started small, but over millions of years gave rise to fearsome predators such as T. rex. T. rex became extinct at the end of the Cretaceous. But when someone says all dinosaurs are extinct, it rankles me. You see, not all dinosaurs are dead. As I type, flying dinosaurs known as birds chirp away outside my window. Yes, modern birds are descended from theropods. And not just that; they are theropods themselves, in the same way that we are apes. I urge you to remember that the feathered chicken is a distant relative of the mighty T. rex.That said, extinct theropods such as tyrannosaurs didn’t use their feathers for flying. Their downy feathers were likely for show or insulation. But early feathers of theropods did give way to the more complex ones that birds use today.Since then, scientists have made discoveries that indicate that feathers, hair, and scales all originated in a single ancestral reptile that lived around 300 million years ago. Birds tend to mature quickly. Previously, paleontologists that studied tyrannosaurs thought they grew slowly and lived long. The consensus now seems to be that even in the manner of growth, they were like modern birds. Tyrannosaurs matured within three decades. As Steve Brusatte writes in his excellent book, The Rise and Fall of the Dinosaurs, T. rex was “the James Dean of dinosaurs: it lived fast and died young.” At the peak of its growth, a juvenile probably put on over two kilograms of weight a day.Also Read | Xi vows focus on emission cuts, end energy-inefficient projectsResearchers have also been looking at modern birds to guess what colour the feathers of dinosaurs might have been. Feathers of birds (and other theropods) contain coloured sacs called melanosomes. By comparing the kinds of melanosomes in living birds with those in fossil specimens of an extinct theropod called Sinosauropteryx, they concluded in an article in Nature that it was covered in reddish-brown feathers. Who said dinosaurs had to be dull and grey?We know about dinosaurs from their fossils. But can we extrapolate from fossils just how many T. rex ever existed?Charles Marshall at University of California at Berkeley and his team attempted to answer this question in an article published in Science on April 16. They used the concept that there are few very large modern animals compared to small ones. Marshall and his team plugged in numbers for the likely size and weight of T. rex and came up with a range that varied from around 1,300 to 328,000 adults in North America at one time (with a likely number being 20,000). That’s around 3,800 in an area the size of California. How does the number of T. rex relate to fossils we have found? If every plant or animal that ever lived had been fossilised, the earth would be covered in mountains of fossils. Clearly, that’s not the case. But just how rare are they?Since T. rex were on the planet for about two million years, that gives us an estimate of around 2.5 billion of them in total. Given that we have found only a few dozen complete fossilised skeletons of this predator, we can confidently say that T. rex fossils are exceedingly rare.Anirban Mahapatra, a microbiologist by training, is the author of COVID-19: Separating Fact From Fiction.

05-05-2021||Editorials||Remembering those who have fallen||Over the past year, close to 230,000 Indians have died due to Covid-19. On Tuesday, 3,790 Indians died as the second wave of the pandemic continues to wreak devastation across homes, villages, towns and cities in the country. But it is increasingly clear that official figures do not capture the scale of the tragedy that is underway. Reportage from hospitals, mortuaries, burial grounds, crematoriums, and local communities indicate that the death count is higher than these figures. This is indeed different from the first wave. India was, then, unfairly, criticised by some for undercounting deaths — but this was untrue because, as many others pointed out, it is difficult to hide deaths when it assumes a certain scale in India. Dense social and information networks bring out the truth. And precisely because of that, in the second wave, it appears that deaths on the ground and in official figures don’t align.This may be due to a range of reasons — a deliberate effort by official authorities to downplay the number of deaths (for every death reflects poorly on the Indian State); or because of a restrictive criteria of how to categorise Covid-19 deaths when it is often attributed to co-morbidities; or the fact that many of those who pass away at home due to Covid, but may or may not have got an official test done, are not reported as Covid deaths; or because of families themselves being opaque because of the fear that those who have died due to Covid-19 won’t be accorded dignity in death.Irrespective of the reasons, it is critical to be transparent about India’s fatalities. This data is crucial to understand the nature of this wave and to be able to save other lives. It is also important to remember those who have fallen, and do justice to their memory, by being honest about why they died.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/remembering-those-who-have-fallen-101620236378138.html
