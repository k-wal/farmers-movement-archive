People are concerned about the pandemic, which has impacted almost everyone. While the government has been taking steps to help people, the ministers, MPs [members of parliament], and MLAs [members of legislative assembly] are not seen helping people and showing empathy,” said a party functionary, requesting anonymity.Also Read | Samajwadi Party says it won UP panchayat polls, will target assembly polls nextThe functionary said the elected representatives have been cautioned that before embarking on “image and perception” change, they will need to have proof of the work carried out.The BJP swept to power in Uttar Pradesh in 2017 by winning 320 seats in a 403-member House. Its government has been criticised for the poor management of healthcare services in the state, which has registered 13,798 Covid-19 deaths until Wednesday, as per the government data.Social media platforms have been flooded with videos of people struggling for oxygen. The Allahabad High Court on Tuesday said the deaths of Covid-19 patients due to lack of oxygen is a criminal act and “no less than genocide”.BJP functionaries from the state, who spoke to HT on condition of anonymity, said the panchayat elections are an indication of the dip in the government’s popularity and the mounting anger over the lapses in providing essential healthcare facilities and oxygen.“Though the panchayat elections are not fought on the party tickets, everyone knows which party has lent support to which candidate. And while we were expecting better results, the pandemic seems to have impacted people’s choices. I will not say that the results are a direct outcome of the second wave; there were some lapses even last year,” said a state party functionary, requesting anonymity.Also Read | 412,262 fresh Covid-19 cases take India’s tally to over 21 millionThe BJP faced losses even in its strongholds such as Ayodhya, Varanasi, Lucknow, and Gorakhpur. In Varanasi, the Samajwadi Party (SP) won 15 of the 40 wards, BJP and the BSP won seven each, and the Congress five. In Ayodhya, SP was the biggest gainer with 24 of the 40 wards. The BJP won six and BSP five wards. In Gorakhpur, the BJP, with 20 of the 68 wards, got just one more than the SP’s 19.The state government has maintained it has made arrangements to augment hospital beds. Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath inaugurated the Atal Bihari Vajpayee COVID-19 Hospital set up by Defence Research and Development Organisation in Lucknow on Wednesday.BJP functionaries, however, admit that the resources are stretched. “We have people knocking on our doors for help. The scale of the pandemic was not expected, but the lack of oxygen, even in hospitals has compounded the problems. People are angry,” said a legislator, who did not wish to be named. The legislator said he has been receiving distress calls from the rural areas as well, where infrastructure is woefully inadequate.Sandeep Shastri, vice-chancellor, Jagran Lakecity University, said there has been an element of drift in the BJP government’s performance since the 2019 general elections. “Ever since the second wave, there has been a serious discussion on the inability of the government to handle the crisis and the consequent effort to try and place blinkers on the crisis. There is a trend of being in a denial mode,” he said. On the impact that the government’s response will have on the upcoming elections, he said, “Local body elections are a by-product of particularly local specificities. But the Panchayat election trends reflect that there is disappointment among the voters.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/bjp-in-damage-control-mode-after-uttar-pradesh-rural-polls-setback-101620277969647.html
06-05-2021||News||India’s farm sector to sustain momentum, but that’s not enough||India’s farm sector is forecast to maintain its remarkable expansion in 2021-22 on the back of robust output and prices despite the coronavirus pandemic. But that’s not enough to offset renewed pressure on growth in the gross domestic product (GDP) due to the shocks from a devastating second wave of Covid-19 infections, analysts say.A prime reason for the farm sector’s resilience has been ample rains in the past two years. The India Meteorological Department on April 16 forecast that rainfall during the June-to-September monsoon season during 2021 will be 98%. In the past two decades, India has had normal rainfall for three straight years only twice. Rainfall between 94-106% is considered “normal”.The monsoon is critical for summer crops because 60% of India’s net-sown area does not have access to irrigation and nearly half of Indians depend on a farm-based income.In 2020, when a harsh Covid-19 lockdown stoked a countrywide recession, the agriculture sector showed resilience to register positive growth. It grew 3.4% in the June 2020 quarter, when the rest of the economy shrunk -24.4%.All-India growth returned to positive territory in the December 2020 quarter, shows the latest available data, expanding 0.4%. Agriculture grew at 3.9% in the same quarter.Millions of farmers have worked hard to keep agricultural operations going throughout the pandemic, aided by an exemption of the farm sector from Covid-related restrictions.The pandemic has hit urban centres and smaller towns harder, relatively sparing farming activities in the countryside, another reason why the farm sector has outpaced other spheres of the economy.Nearly half (48%) of all Covid-19 cases reported in India in March were from urban areas, home to just 14% of the population, with cities having the largest proportion of new infections since June 2020, according to an April 8 analysis by the HT.“Ground-level indicators point to a robust farm sector. A normal monsoon will continue to see an expansion of the agriculture sector, aside from good encouraging prices and acreage trends,” said Abhishek Agrawal of Comtrade, an agricultural trading firm.“In this kind of a situation, will agriculture be the sector to rescue the Indian economy? I will share some projections,” said a senior agriculture ministry official, requesting not to be quoted. Fertiliser demand, the official said, is expected to be 10% higher than usual in the oncoming summer or Kharif season. “We expect fertiliser demand to soar to 35 million tonnes from the usual 32 million tonnes,” the official said.The government is anticipating higher demand for seeds, pesticides as well as farm equipment.“A good agriculture year would mean at least 3-4% positive growth,” said RS Mani, a former faculty with the Tamil Nadu Agriculture University.Better performance of the agriculture sector may bode well for the country’s more than 150 million farmers, yet that’s not enough – neither for farm incomes nor for the overall economy.The GDP per worker in agriculture is one-third of the economy-wide GDP per worker. This means productivity in agriculture is too low to lift the overall economy.The pandemic weighs heavily on other sectors of the economy. The second pandemic wave pummelled the labour market in April, erasing at least 7.35 million jobs, according to the latest data from the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy.The number of employees, both salaried and non-salaried, fell from 398.14 million in March to 390.79 million in April, the third straight month of job losses.Agriculture employs half of all Indians but contributes a mere 15-16% to the country’s overall GDP. That simply means it employs too many people but contributes too little to incomes. Agriculture typically tends to move from one seasonal crisis to another.Despite the farm sector being heavily subsidized, a landmark ICRIER-OECD (Indian Council for Research on International Economic Relations-Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development) study in 2018 led by economist Ashok Gulati found that farmers suffered “negative market price support”.Put simply, total prices farmers got during 2006-16 stood at minus 14%, meaning on average they paid more prices than they received. In other words, farming is a loss-making activity.“The only feasible path to prosperity of farmers, therefore, is the creation of attractive job opportunities in industry and services,” writes economist Arvind Panagariya in his latest assessment of the Indian economy titled “India Unlimited”.Yet, projections of sustained momentum in the farm economy come as good news because it will protect a large chunk of the economy from the worst impact of the pandemic that is sure to put pressure on growth, Mani said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/indias-farm-sector-to-sustain-momentum-but-that-s-not-enough-101620276529795.html
06-05-2021||Gurugram||Fire at supermarket in DLF Phase-4||A fire broke out at a supermarket in DLF Phase-4 on Thursday afternoon. No injury or casualty was reported, said officials. IS Kashyap, assistant divisional fire officer, said, “Around 3.50pm, we received a call regarding a fire at supermarket named Supermart 1 in a six-storey building in DLF Phase-4. Seven fire tenders were rushed to the spot to douse the fire, which was controlled after two hours.” He said that no casualty was reported from the building as due to the lockdown, there was no one present in offices in the building. “Prima facie, it seems that the fire started due to a short circuit in the supermarket, but the detailed reason will be known later once a report is filed,” the official said. In the past month, around four different incidents of fire have been reported from different parts of the district. In April, fire outbreaks were reported from Sadar Bazaar and Nathupur in the district.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/fire-at-supermarket-in-dlf-phase4-101620325555611.html
06-05-2021||Gurugram||Ambulance strike called off, but operators remain unhappy with hiked rates||Ambulance operators in the city called off their strike on Thursday after the district administration hiked the fares for private ambulances, officials said. However, the administration did not hike the fares as demanded by the operators, due to which they have threatened to go on strike from Friday if the rates are not revised again.The deputy commissioner of Gurugram, Yash Garg, said that as per the hiked rates, fixed charges of ₹500, ₹750 and ₹1,000 have been set for distances up to three kilometres, between three and seven kilometres, and farther than seven kilometres, respectively. An additional charge of ₹25 per kilometre may be levied if the distance increases, he said.Officials clarified that the distance is calculated at the time of booking and that charges cannot be levied as per the next higher slab.According to Garg, now that the charges have been fixed, operators and drivers found demanding more will face strict action, with the cancellation of their registration as well as licences on the cards.However, as per the rate list submitted by the Private Ambulance Association (PAA) to the district administration, a copy of which is with HT, the operators are demanding ₹3,500 for small vehicles for a distance up to 15 kilometres, with ₹16 per additional kilometre, while for larger vehicles, they are demanding ₹5,000 and ₹35, respectively. For advanced cardiac life support ambulances (ACLS), the association is demanding ₹5,500 for distances up to 15 kilometres, with ₹50 per additional kilometre, besides the charges for doctors and staff.Vipin Kumar, the former president of the PAA, said, “If the district administration agrees to our rates, then we will ply ambulances. Else, we will protest and sit on strike from Friday. We will not agree to run on losses. Why should we?”The association comprises 39 operators, who have 250 ambulances in the district.Salina Macknight, the vice-president of PAA, said that the kilometres should be calculated from point to point and waiting charges for freezer ambulances should be set at ₹500 per hour. “For ACLS ambulances, the waiting charges should be ₹1,000 per hour. Oxygen charges would be extra and if anyone wants a doctor, then their charges would also be additional,” she said.The association had been on a strike since Tuesday evening and on Wednesday, met officials in Chandigarh, who agreed to revise the fares, following which Prabhjot Singh, mission director, National Health Mission (NHM), Haryana, in an order, stated that it is necessary to fix the rate of hiring charges of ambulances to be used by people for transporting the patients and directed the deputy commissioner to act on it. “All deputy commissioners are to call a meeting with owners of private ambulances and union to decide rates. It is decided by higher authorities that rates decided by deputy commissioners will prevail,” he had said.Yash Garg, the deputy commissioner, said that they had received the order and that the final rate list was sent. “We are trying to resolve the issue so that people do not suffer and can get timely help,” he said.The district administration, in its order on Thursday, noted that private ambulance drivers/service providers are charging exorbitant rates from the citizens for transporting the patients within or outside the state. Due to this, an additional financial burden is being borne by citizens during the crisis of Covid-19, which is a matter of serious concern, it stated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/ambulance-strike-called-off-but-operators-remain-unhappy-with-hiked-rates-101620325554968.html
06-05-2021||Gurugram||Khattar directs admin to ramp up Covid measures||Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar on Thursday directed the district administration to ramp up Covid-19 management preparation with the cases expected to spike over the next few days, as the state has predicted that the peak of the current wave might occur by May 15. In Gurugram alone, the active case count is likely to touch 40,000, the highest in the state. “Regular auditing of oxygen, availability of beds and medicines in the hospitals should be done so that the future and present strategies regarding demand and supply can be made in advance. A district level monitoring team for monitoring oxygen supply and demand in every hospital across the state should be constituted at the earliest,” said Khattar in a statement issued by the state administration. On Thursday, Khattar held a review meeting on Covid-19 preparedness with districts on strategies to control the transmission. “CM has assured that oxygen supply will be resolved, and uninterrupted supply will be ensured,” said Yash Garg, deputy commissioner. According to the CM, the state’s oxygen quota is 257 metric tonnes (MT), and a request has been made to the central government to further enhance this quota to 300 MT. He directed deputy commissioners to ensure that the unloading of the tankers should be done within the shortest time so that the oxygen supply chain in the hospitals remains intact. Khattar also directed to shift the step-down patients to Covid care centres to provide timely treatment to critical patients. Special screening camps have to be held in rural areas following the prevalence of infection in villages. Currently, the state’s positivity rate of 37% is the second-highest in the country. Even the weekly average positivity rate of Gurugram is around 28%, which makes it the fifth worst-hit district in the country. On Thursday, the district reported at least 3737 cases, taking the active case count to 39,682. The death tally reached 550 with the confirmation of 13 deaths. At the state level, at least 14,840 new cases and 117 deaths were reported. The active case count stands at 115,842 and it is likely to reach up to 140,000 as per the projections made by the Central government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/khattar-directs-admin-to-ramp-up-covid-measures-101620325553372.html
06-05-2021||Gurugram||142 cops tested positive over past week||As many as 142 police personnel tested positive for Covid-19 in the last week while on duty, officials said on Thursday, taking the total number of affected police personnel to 500 in the last month and a half.KK Rao, the commissioner of police, said that the personnel deployed in Covid-19 duties are not going home to ensure their families are protected. “The families that have been infected are being taken care of and all facilities have been provided in the isolation centre, which is in Police Lines in the city and Manesar,” he said.Officials said that of the 142 who tested positive — that includes two assistant commissioners of police — only 10 have recovered. Most of the personnel who tested positive were deployed at markets, oxygen refilling stations and on patrol duty. Rao said, “The officials who required immediate medical help were admitted (to hospitals) and others are isolated at homes and isolation centres. We have already converted two barracks into a quarantine ward for the police personnel.”There are nearly 6,500 police personnel in the city, most of whom are deployed in containment zones. Personnel have been directed to immediately report any symptoms to ensure they are tested and isolated, said officials. So far over 1,200 police personnel have tested positive for the coronavirus disease since the outbreak in March 2020.Rao on Thursday conducted a ground inspection at 70 checkpoints and arranged food and beverages for the personnel. He also directed that tents be set up for officials to rest, amid soaring temperatures and the threat of Covid-19. “I interacted with the teams and have asked them to inform me if anything is needed. Our prime concern is their health as they have exposure to the public and require regular monitoring,” said Rao.Each team has been given a thermometer to regularly check their temperature and doctors on call are booked for consultations. Rao said that all family members of police personnel have been asked to contact the department for their needs. “The lockdown poses great burdens on front-line police personnel, given capacity constraints and the social context of enforcement. To ensure social distancing and to keep oneself safe is very difficult,” he said.Rao said that the police have received 1,052 calls on their Covid-19 helpline and have helped save the lives of 20 Covid-19 patients. Also, 164,734 people have been penalised since April 1 for not wearing face masks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/142-cops-tested-positive-over-past-week-101620325495775.html
06-05-2021||Gurugram||Cops sought to maintain order at vaccination sites||As many citizens continue to face challenges in availing of their second vaccine shot at government health centres due to long queues and lack of social distancing norms, the health department has written to the police department for handling the crowd at vaccination centres.“A letter has been written to the police department seeking at least two police personnel for every vaccination centre to manage the crowd. If required, we will ask the police to increase the deployment,” said Dr Virender Yadav, chief medical officer.Since private hospitals are no longer administering doses, people who were supposed to take their second shots have been diverted to government health centres. Notably, with the inoculation of at least 6,347 residents on Thursday, the district crossed the 500,000 mark of administering doses in the district.The government centres have limited staff and are inoculating vaccine beneficiaries between 18 and 44 years as well as those above 45 years.Sunny Sarid, a resident of Sushant Lok 1, after noticing a rush at health centres, decided to wait for the next two to three weeks to take his second shot. “Standing in the crowd of 200 people is like exposing yourself to coronavirus infection. I took the first shot in Medanta Hospital, but now, the hospital is no longer vaccinating people. To take the second dose, we visited two government vaccination centres which had a crowd of more than 200 people, with none of them following social distancing norms,” said Sarid.Chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar in a review meeting held on Thursday directed that the vaccination sites should be set up either in big halls or in open so that it should be ensured that the risk of infection spread is lessened and also that the Covid-19 protocol and norms are followed at the sites. Khattar said that soon, Haryana would be getting 350,000 vaccine doses.To streamline the process, the district health department will hold vaccinations at 37 health centres on May 7, with nearly 300 doses to be given at each site to people aged 18 to 44, based on online reservations. At 31 centres, people above 45 years can get their second dose by direct walk-in, according to the district health department.“At least 70% of the dose will be reserved for walk-in vaccine beneficiaries and 30% through online appointment for people above 45 years of age,” according to the details shared by the district health department.“Out of the 31 health centres, at least four in Mullahera, Manesar, Bhondsi and Badshahpur will give a second dose of Covaxin, while the remaining will give Covishield,” said Yadav.On Thursday, at least 2,751 people aged 18 to 44 took the jab, of which only 210 received the shot in private hospitals. For those above 45 requiring the second dose, the health department inoculated at least 3,090 people, while private hospitals gave vaccine shots to 101.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/cops-sought-to-maintain-order-at-vaccination-sites-101620325495188.html
06-05-2021||Gurugram||350 beds to be ready by next week, more may be added when oxygen supply increases: Admin||Officials of the district administration said that 350 beds to treat critically ill Covid-19 patients, equipped with ventilator support, will be made operations in a week and that more such beds may be set up once the oxygen supply to the district increases.Yash Garg, the deputy commissioner for Gurugram district, said, “There are three facilities, which will be almost up and running within a week. First, the Municipal Corporation of Manesar, in collaboration with Indian Air Force, is working to convert 150 rooms into a hospital, the second is a 100-bed facility that is being built at Tau Devi Lal Stadium, and the third is another 100-bed facility that is being built by Hero in Sector 27. All these three will be functional within a week.”As of 8pm on Thursday, eight oxygen beds were available in one of 43 hospitals, as per the district’s Covid-19 web portal. No intensive care unit (ICU) beds or ventilator beds were available, as per the portal. The city has 1,522 oxygen beds, 550 ICU beds and 198 ventilator beds. On Thursday, Gurugram reported 3,737 fresh Covid-19 cases, taking the tally of active cases to 39,682. Deaths of 13 positive patients were also reported from the district. Of the total active cases, 2,452 patients are hospitalised and 172 are at district Covid care centres. Over 37,000 positive patients are in home isolation in the district.For the past few weeks, Gurugram has been reporting over 3,000 cases daily. Officials said that of these cases, around 10% require hospitalisation.Dr Jai Prakash Sharma, Integrated Disease Surveillance Programme’s district surveillance officer for Gurugram, said, “The trend that we have witnessed since the start of the pandemic is that 90% patients recover in home isolation itself and only 10% require hospitalisation, but still, work is being done to ensure enough beds are available for patients in case of another wave.”Besides the three facilities proposed to start operations in the next week, more beds are being set up at a women’s college in Sector 14. However, this would be pressed into service later after sufficient infrastructure is made available, said officials.The deputy commissioner said that the primary constraint in increasing the number of beds is the low supply of medical oxygen. At present, Gurugram is allotted a quota of 40 metric tonnes (MT) of oxygen supply per day, whereas the demand is for 60 MT of oxygen per day.“If the oxygen supply improves faster, then within the next seven days, we should be able to start the function of these 350 beds. Most of these will be for moderate cases, as severe cases will require proper hospitalisation. Our oxygen supply is increasing gradually since the chief minister himself took charge of the district. We should be getting more supply from the state over the next four days, after which the functioning of these extra beds should be even more smooth,” Garg said.To address the shortfall in oxygen supply, the state is airlifting cryogenic oxygen containers to Rourkela, which will help increase the supply to the district as well.Meanwhile, with projections being made that Haryana will see the peak of the second wave of Covid-19 by May 15, the district administration has also started preparing for the spike. The deputy commissioner said that various measures, including setting up of Covid care facilities by resident welfare associations (RWAs) and starting helplines for patients, among others, are being done.“Within two days, we will be launching a portal from which patients in home isolation can apply for direct delivery of oxygen. We have also empowered the RWAs to set up small isolation centres within their communities for which we are procuring oxygen concentrators and cylinders. We are also trying to establish a treatment protocol for home isolation patients to ensure that their condition does not escalate, and they do not have to go to the hospitals. Some cases will be reported, but the maximum can be controlled,” Garg said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/350-beds-to-be-ready-by-next-week-more-may-be-added-when-oxygen-supply-increases-admin-101620325494566.html
06-05-2021||Gurugram||Admin to provide oxygen cylinders to RWAs for setting up Covid care centres||To offset the pressure on hospitals that are burdened with the rising number of seriously ill Covid-19 patients, the district administration has decided to provide oxygen cylinders and concentrators to residents’ welfare associations (RWAs) that are setting up Covid care centres within their condominiums.Officials said that they are reaching out to various stakeholders so that oxygen cylinders and concentrators can be made available to city residents through the RWAs. The city is getting around 45 metric tonnes (MT) of medical oxygen at present, against a demand of 60 MT, said officials.Yash Garg, the deputy commissioner of Gurugram, said that while they have streamlined the oxygen supply to hospitals to a great extent, the next step was to reduce pressure on the hospital system and this would be done by helping the RWAs set up small Covid care centres. “We will rationalise the oxygen supply and around 150 cylinders will be given to RWAs daily, which are taking care of Covid-19 patients. We are also looking to source oxygen concentrators soon, which shall be given to these RWAs so that the patients can be treated at home or Covid care centres locally. This will reduce pressure on hospitals,” said Garg.Dharmender Jha, president, Rosewood City RWA, Block D, said, “The decision of the district administration to help the RWAs by providing concentrators and oxygen cylinders would help the patients isolated at home. We would set up a small Covid care facility that can cater to patients who need oxygen support.” The district administration also launched a token system on Thursday for the distribution of oxygen to Covid-19 patients in home isolation, said Garg. Earlier in the day, the state government on Thursday also asked the deputy commissioners to create a system for providing oxygen supply to all Covid-19 patients and especially those with co-morbidities, who need oxygen at home.In a related development, the district administration on Thursday also notified rates for essential items, particularly edibles, to ensure there is no black marketing of daily use items. On Wednesday, the Faridabad administration had also notified rates of essential commodities to prevent hoarding.Deputy commissioner Garg said that directions have been issued to shopkeepers that they should not sell essential commodities more than the maximum retail price. He also directed wholesalers and retailers to display the rate list prominently. “If any shopkeeper is overcharging, then the customers can lodge a complaint and action would be initiated,” he said.Earlier on Wednesday, Yashpal Yadav, the deputy commissioner of Faridabad, had notified the rates of edibles and essential commodities. “We will not tolerate any hoarding or overcharging of food and other essential items. Action would be taken against such violators,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/admin-to-provide-oxygen-cylinders-to-rwas-for-setting-up-covid-care-centres-101620325494014.html
06-05-2021||Gurugram||Tokens to help those in home isolation get oxygen refill||In a major relief to Covid-19 patients who are in home isolation and need oxygen support, the Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) on Thursday launched a token system to help individuals get oxygen easily, without standing in long queues. The corporation set up three counters for this purpose at the MCG office in Sector 34, the old MCG office near Sadar Bazar and Sector 42, where residents can avail of tokens.Gurugram on Thursday received 45 metric tonnes of medical oxygen from the plants in Panipat, Bhiwadi and Faridabad, said officials.Officials said they decided to set up the token system and fix oxygen allocation for hospitals after complaints of irregularities in the system. Haryana chief minister on Sunday had also directed the administration to streamline the oxygen distribution system.Jitender Yadav, administrator, Haryana Shahari Vikas Pradhikaran (HSVP), Gurugram, who took over the additional charge of MCG on Thursday, said that 90 tokens have been demarcated to be issued to city residents for getting their oxygen cylinders refilled from Star Gas in Manesar. “Initially, these centres will issue 30 tokens each, but the number would be increased depending on the availability of oxygen. We will also make this facility available online, but the number of tokens will depend on the availability of gas,” said Yadav.To get a token, people will have to submit an RT-PCR test report, Aadhaar card details, address proof and a doctor’s prescription. “The token system will ensure that people will not have to stand in long queues,” said Yadav.Another step taken by the MCG to streamline oxygen distribution on Thursday was to rationalise the distribution of oxygen to large hospitals and assign distributors to two major oxygen refilling plants. “We have a list of 80 hospitals, out of which around 40 have been asked to get oxygen from their previous distributors through Kalinga and SR oxygen filling plants. Twenty hospitals have been asked to send their vehicles to the Max Air plant. This alignment of hospitals had a positive impact on Thursday and things will improve further,” said Yadav.The job of filling gas for individual cylinders and smaller hospitals has been assigned to Star Special Gases at Sector 7 in Manesar, said officials.In another move to resolve the problems being faced by city residents due to the spread of Covid-19, the corporation also set up a control room that will operate round the clock. This call centre will work in three shifts of eight hours each, with three employees managing the work during each shift. The corporation can be contacted at 9821395170 and 9821395171.“This call centre will hear the issues being raised by city residents as well as elected representatives and raise it with the departments concerned to get it resolved,” said Yadav, who was given the additional charge of MCG on Thursday after the Vinay Pratap Singh, the MCG commissioner, tested positive for Covid-19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/tokens-to-help-those-in-home-isolation-get-oxygen-refill-101620325493340.html

06-05-2021||Lucknow||Poor show in Ayodhya, Kashi, Mathura in panchayat poll big setback for BJP||The panchayat election results have come as a setback for Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which has failed to perform as per the expectations against its archrival Samajwadi Party at most places in Uttar Pradesh.What has left its leaders worried is party’s performance in Ayodhya, the religious town, which has been at the centerstage of politics ever since the BJP came to power in Uttar Pradesh in 2017. Not only in Ayodhya the BJP has also lost to its rivals, the Samajwadi Party and the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP), in Varanasi and Mathura, respectively.Both Varanasi and Mathura are high-profile religious destinations of the state with much political significance.Varanasi’s loss is also significant as Prime Minister Narendra Modi represents this historic city in Lok Sabha, feel many.In Ayodhya, where construction of Ram Mandir is going on, the BJP managed to win only in eight wards out of 40. The Samajwadi Party bagged 24 seats of the Zila Panchayat member.The BSP and others have been able to win in four wards each while the Congress scored zero. Various reasons are being attributed to BJP’s poor performance in Ayodhya where the party won all five assembly seats in 2017 election.“Local BJP leaders are distraught. All these years they have been completely sidelined. Even in panchayat elections which are completely localised, local workers were ignored. Even recommendation of candidates by party MLAs were ignored by the state leadership,” said a senior functionary of the party in Ayodhya. “Local BJP leaders are helpless. They do not have any say in any issue,” he added.The Covid-19 pandemic has also contributed to the BJP’s loss in panchayat polls in Ayodhya and in other places, insists political observer. “Most of the deaths in Covid are due to failure of the system. Acute shortage of beds in government and private hospitals, treatment in private hospitals turning out of reach of common man and black marketing of lifesaving drugs also contributed to the BJP’s debacle not only in Ayodhya but in other parts of the state,” said a senior VHP leader of Ayodhya. “Even I was not able to arrange a single Oxygen cylinder for anyone. Now, how am I going to face people whose genuine request for an Oxygen cylinder or a bed in hospital I could not fulfill,” said an RSS functionary of Ayodhya. “The mismanagement in pandemic and ignoring local party leaders and workers will also have its repercussion in forthcoming assembly elections in the state which are scheduled after early next year,” said Awadesh Kumar Singh, president, Sri Saryu Vikas Samiti, Ayodhya.Singh, who is associated with the RSS, had filed a writ in Lucknow high court against acquiring of land in Manja Barhata, Ayodhya, for installing statue of Lord Ram. Farmers of the region are opposing the project.It may be pointed out that at Deepotsav celebrations in 2017, chief minister Yogi Adityanath had announced to install 251 feet statue of lord Ram in Ayodhya. Kashi results also not hearteningIn Varanasi, the multi-crore Kashi Vishwanath corridor project and PM Modi’s representation of the historic city in Parliament did not help the BJP in panchayat polls.Out of 40 sets of Zila Panchayat members, the BJP could win on only seven while Samajwadi Party bagged 15 seats.While the Congress won five, the BSP four, the Apna Dal (Sonelal) two, the Suheldev Bharatiya Samaj Party (SBSP) one, six seats went to Independents.Out of eight assembly seats, BJP won six and one each went to its ally Apna Dal (Sonelal) and the SBSP. However, SBSP is no more the BJP’s ally. “Selection of candidates has been a prominent reason behind BJP’s poor performance in panchayat polls in Varanasi,” said Anupam Shukla, social activist. “A local party worker having connect at the grass root level, who may or may not have been very active in party organisation, should have been given the ticket,” Shukla added.“But such workers were ignored. As panchayat polls are completely local elections based on local politics, including caste and muscle power, selection of proper candidates is important to win the election,” he asserted. Poor management in pandemic is also a reason for party’s poor performance on semi-rural seats, he pointed out. BSP show in Mathura Mathura, famous for Lord Krishna’s temple complex, is another religious destination where BJP’s rival outperformed it in the panchayat polls. The city is in news now-a-days due to the litigation in district court over the temple complex issue which shares its boundary with a mosque. Here, BJP was able to win only in eight wards out of 33. The BSP outperformed all other parties by winning in 13 wards. While candidates supported by the Rashtriya Lok Dal won in eight wards. Out of five assembly constituencies in Mathura district, the BJP won in four in 2017 assembly polls.BJP leader and Bollywood actor Hema Malini represents Mathura in Lok Sabha. “Like in previous panchayat elections, the BSP has retained its stronghold in this local election also. As compared to last election, BJP’s performance has improved. But being a ruling party in the state, its performance should have been better,” said local layer Vijay Pal Singh. Now, these Zila Panchayat members will vote for Zila Panchayat chairman.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/poor-show-in-ayodhya-kashi-mathura-in-panchayat-poll-big-setback-for-bjp-101620324173239.html

The group uses all available resources to help patients and their attendants and tries to instill confidence among them to fight the disease. The youths have formed WhatsApp groups to share information about needy patients, availability of resources and man force for delivering necessary items to them. The group pools resources and takes help from local leaders, corporators and eminent citizens to help patients soon after receiving a distress call. Zeeshan Rehmani, the founder member of the group, said he and some of his friends were shocked at a large number of deaths all of a sudden. It was not hard to realise that second wave of Covid-19 was extremely dangerous. Soon there were reports of patients dying without receiving necessary basic help for treatment. Many of the patients were from poor families and were unable to arrange for medicines etc. With the objective of helping poor patients and their attendants, a group was formed over 20 days back. Many youths from different localities of the old city volunteered to join. A Whatsapp group was created with the name of Covid-19 help in which members were added. Volunteers share information about poor patients in their localities, their condition and needs through Whatsapp groups. Most of the time patients are short of oxygen, medicines, transport and even money and attendants. However, with a large number of patients and meager resources, those in critical condition or lacking money are helped on priority basis. “Some oxygen cylinders were donated by people who got them for treatment of their kin earlier while some cylinders were taken from welders on rent. Those in immediate need are given empty cylinders and sometimes poor attendants are also helped in taking the cylinder to plant to get them filled,” Zeeshan shared. Another member of the group Mohd Usman said besides oxygen cylinders, medicines, transport and other necessary facilities were being arranged by the group which has over 100 members in different localities. “We have pooled resources and sought help from others to help patients. Our motive is to reach out to patients who are financially weak and have no kin to attend them”, Usman said. The group has till now helped a large number of patients residing across old city and even reaches out to people in narrow lanes and bylanes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/young-group-reaching-out-to-needy-patients-in-sangam-city-101620322973137.html

After fighting for life for two days, the teenager had succumbed to the injuries on May 1, following which a murder case was registered against unidentified accused.“During the probe, we started zeroing in on drug addicts involved in snatchings and thefts, and found that the trio was active in the area. Therefore, police remained on the lookout and arrested the accused on Thursday,” said additional deputy commissioner of police (ADCP, City 2) Jaskiranjit Singh Teja.A total of four mobile phones, a motorcycle and a sharp edged weapon were recovered from their possession. “All accused are aged between 18 and 20, and are school dropouts. They were under the influence of drugs and desperate for money, so they did not hesitate to stab the boy for a quick buck,” the ADCP said.Harvinder is already facing trial in four cases of theft, assault, trespass and murder. Gurmeet Singh is also booked in two cases, while Tej Ram has one FIR lodged against him. The recovered motorcycle was stolen on the intervening night of April 24 and 25, the police official said.All accused are facing charges of murder since the teenager died on May 1.

06-05-2021||Chandigarh||Covid killing more people in Ludhiana city’s peripheral areas||The deadly second wave of Covid-19 has wiped away more lives in the townships on the outskirts of Ludhiana city if the case fatality ratio (CFR) is any indication. While the city currently has a CFR of 2.2%, indicating two deaths among every 100 cases, the death rate is higher in its peripheral areas, where nearly five out of every 100 infected people have died (4.8%) – far ahead of the state average of 2.4%.The lack of testing is being seen as one of the reasons for the higher fatality rate across the rural and urban blocks of Raikot, Samrala, Jagraon, Khanna and Payal. Despite awareness drives and numerous initiatives, residents here remain averse to getting tested on priority and often reach the hospital only after complications begin to surface, say experts.As of May 5, Ludhiana city has recorded 57,044 Covid cases since the pandemic broke out in March last year and 1,265 people here have died. On the other hand, out of the 4,277 residents testing positive in the peripheral areas, 205 have succumbed to the virus.Khanna leads the toll at 59, followed by Raikot with 48 deaths, while 43 people have died in Jagraon. The number of deaths in Payal and Samrala is 36 and 19, respectively.“We are witnessing the same reluctance for tests among the residents as seen during the first wave of pandemic. Instead of coming out for RT-PCR tests, even symptomatic people are relying on self-medication. Stigma attached to the virus could be one reason for this,” said Dr Bishav Mohan, senior cardiologist at DMCH and a member of the Covid task force of the state government.“More and more patients are arriving at the hospital only after their condition severely deteriorates. This is not only leading to more casualties, but also fast transmission of the virus,” said Dr Mohan, who, along with deputy commissioner Varinder Kumar Sharma, recently conducted a survey of the Covid pockets in Galib Kalan, Sidhwan Bet, Jagraon, Macchiwara and Samrala block following high prevalence of cases there.Civil surgeon Dr Kiran Gill Ahluwalia said the health department was working on conducting surveys in villages to detect symptomatic patients. “These teams will work in coordination with the village sarpanches, so that patients can be identified and isolated. We also plan to intensify testing and focus on enhancing vaccination in rural areas,” she added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/covid-killing-more-people-in-ludhiana-city-s-peripheral-areas-101620321233744.html
06-05-2021||Delhi||Delhi hospital sees increase in deadly fungal infection among Covid-19 patients||A city hospital has reported an increase in the number of cases of a rare fungal infection triggered by the Coronavirus disease (Covid-19) as the cases of the viral infection has increased exponentially in the city. Six patients with the rare infection mucormycosis were admitted to Sir Ganga Ram hospital over the last two days. In December last year, the hospital had seen 10 cases of the fungal infection in patients with Covid-19 or those who had recently recovered from it in a period of fifteen days. If not detected early, the infection – Mucormycosis also known as black fungus – can kill half the patients. Others might lose eye-sight or have to get their jaw bones removed if the infection spreads. It is an opportunistic infection that happens in mostly immune-compromised Covid-19 patients such as those with diabetes, kidney disease, or those who have had transplants. “We are again seeing an increase in the number of the dangerous fungal infection triggered by Covid-19. Last year, this deadly infection had caused high mortality with other suffering from loss of eye sight, removal of nose, and jaw bone,” said Dr Manish Munjal, senior ENT surgeon at the hospital. Doctors say that use of steroids in the treatment of Covid-19 patients might weaken the immune system of the already sick patients resulting in the black fungus. “Use of steroids in treatment of Covid-19 infection in addition to the fact that many Covid-19 patients have diabetes as co- morbidity could be one of the reasons for this rise in black fungus infection again,” said Dr Ajay Swaroop, Chairman, Department of ENT at the hospital. “Early clinical suspicion on symptoms such as nose obstruction, swelling in the eyes or cheeks and black crusts in the nose should immediately prompt a biopsy and start of antifungal therapy as early as possible,” Dr Munjal added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-hospital-sees-increase-in-deadly-fungal-infection-among-covid-19-patients-101620320873994.html

An upset Mohd Shahid, who also lived in the locality, was calling for help as his father was sinking for want of oxygen. Achhe Khan, 65, had tested positive for Covid-19 and his oxygen level was falling fast. Having failed to arrange for an oxygen cylinder, his family had lost all hope. Suddenly, Shahid thought of Hamza and sent out an SOS.Immediately, Hamza informed Zeeshan Rehmani about the condition of Achhe Khan, who posted a message in a newly formed WhatsApp group. Within half an hour, Mohd Usman, another group member, arranged for an empty oxygen cylinder and even helped Achhe Khan’s relatives in getting it filled. A few hours later, Achhe Khan’s oxygen saturation level rose to acceptable limits.Rehmani, Usman and Hamza are just some of the members of a WhatsApp youth group, ‘Covid-19 help’ that swung into action that night and helped save the life of Achhe Khan. The group has over 100 members living in different localities of the city.Meanwhile, Sayed Mohammad, Anas, Ali Usmani, Guddu and many others have a similar story of how these young do-gooders helped them at a time when help was required the most. These are just some of the people who have been helped by this group with medicines, oxygen cylinders, transport etc.This group of youths has come forward to help Covid-19 patients and others, especially in the Old City area, at a time when even near relatives are reluctant to attend to patients. Members use available resources to help patients and their attendants and try to instil confidence among them to fight the disease. Till date, the group has helped around 100 patients residing across the Old City and has even reached out to people living in narrow lanes and by-lanes to provide assistance.Through the WhatsApp group information is shared about needy patients, the availability of resources and the manpower needed for delivering the necessary items to them. Soon after receiving a distress call, the group pools resources and takes the help of local leaders, corporators and eminent citizens for providing help to patients. Zeeshan Rehmani, the founder member of the group, said that he was shocked at the sudden surge in the number of deaths. Soon, reports began pouring in of people dying for want of basic help in getting treatment. Many were from poor families and unable to arrange for medicines, etc. “It was then that the idea of forming a WhatsApp group came to mind and along with my friends, I formed the ‘Covid-19 Help’,” Rehmani said. He formed the group some 20 days back and many youths from different localities of the Old City volunteered to join the group and assist in providing help to the needy. Volunteers in the group keep information about poor patients in their localities and share information about their condition and their needs through WhatsApp groups. Mostly, patients are short of oxygen, medicines, transport and even money and attendants. However, with a large number of patients and few resources, those in critical condition or lacking money are helped on a priority and are given immediate help. “Some oxygen cylinders were donated by people who had them, while some cylinders were taken from welders on rent. Those in immediate need are given empty cylinders and sometimes poor attendants are also helped in taking the cylinder to the plant to get them filled,” Zeeshan said. Another member of the group, Mohd Usman, said that besides oxygen cylinders, medicines and transport, other necessities in saving lives are being arranged by the group. “We have pooled resources and sought help from others to help the needy. Our motive is to reach out to patients who are financially weak and have few or no kin to attend to them,” Usman said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/succour-through-whatsapp-youth-group-aids-needy-with-o2-medicines-101620319852898.html

06-05-2021||Ranchi||Double challenge: Providing livelihood to migrants and protecting villages from Covid-19||With large scale inflow of migrant workers in wake of lockdown or restriction imposed by many states in the country, Jharkhand is in for double challenge --providing livelihood to the returnees and protecting villages from Covid spread, officials said.In a bid to provide livelihood to the migrant workers according to their choice, state rural development department has started a survey through Jharkhand State Livelihood Promotion Society (JSLPS) like the skill mapping drive of previous year. In this survey, surveyors are also seeking migrants’ choice of work so that they could be engaged accordingly.State rural development department director Aditya Ranjan said, “We started the survey about a week ago. Our objective is to map skill of the workers and understand their wish for work so that they could be provided jobs accordingly. Hordes of schemes are being run by rural development department and JSLPS. We will try to induct them under these schemes.”He said, “After mapping of their skills, we will also offer them further opportunity to sharpen their skill under skill mission. Many people would also get job under it.”Ranjan said they had also conducted similar kind of skill mapping drive last year and they have a detailed data of it. “We will merge the current and previous year’s data to identify how many fresh migrants moved out from state for jobs,” he said. The department is also working to engage people in MGNREGA works. State urban development department officials said they were expecting large number of people would also get jobs under Mukhyamantri SHRAMIK (Shahri Rozgar Manjuri for Kamgar) Yojana (MSY), a 100-day job guarantee scheme for urban unskilled workers.Skills of 5.30 lakh migrant workers had been mapped last year and a database of them had also been prepared so that they could be provided jobs according to their skill set.Jamesh Herenj, member of Right to Food Campaign (RFC), alleged that skill mapping would hardly help in providing job. “The government also carried out skill mapping drive last year. It now has a figure of how many people are skilled in how many works. However, the government could not create jobs according to their skills in past one year,” he said. Apart from livelihood, the Jharkhand government is also concerned about protecting villages from the spread of Coronavirus in backdrop of migrant workers returning home.Chief minister Hemant Soren on Wednesday directed officials to speed up the Covid vigilance in rural areas, as large number of migrant workers are returning home. Even though state government has made mandatory of one-week institutional quarantine for migrant returnees, it doesn’t have any figure how many migrants have returned to Jharkhand till now.Lakhs of migrant workers have returned to Jharkhand since first week of April this year after cases of Covid-19 started to soar in the country. But, state control room for migrant workers could contact mere 6,720 workers stranded outside Jharkhand.An official of the control room said, “Trains and other means of transportation have not been suspended this time. Therefore, many people have returned without consulting us. So, we cannot provide you the figure how many people returned to Jharkhand till now.”He said they have received 2,554 calls since first week of April, while 6,720 people were contacted, who are stuck outside and want to return.The government, in its order for migrant workers on Wednesday, has observed that there was an exponential increase in Covid-19 cases in the state during the last fortnight. It was anticipated that the large-scale inflow of migrants back to their respective villages might pose a considerable threat in spread of the disease in rural areas, it said. A senior official of state health department, who requested not to be quoted, said, “The recent government order is for the migrant workers, who are returning now. Identifying the workers who have already arrived is not an easy task. However, we are trying to cover them in special test drive. A mega Covid test drive was conducted across Jharkhand on Thursday.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ranchi-news/double-challenge-providing-livelihood-to-migrants-and-protecting-villages-from-covid19-101620317572813.html

The former Bihar chief minister, who was convicted in multiple fodder scam cases and incarcerated since December 23, 2017, was released from jail last week after completing bail procedures and had stayed for few days at AIIMS, New Delhi, where he had been undergoing medical treatment for several ailments . A few days back, he shifted to his eldest daughter’s residence in the national capital. Sources said Prasad, along with younger son and Bihar’s leader of the opposition, Tejashwi Prasad Yadav, also in New Delhi, would hold the meeting virtually. “The RJD chief would be taking feedback from party legislators about the Covid situation in the state and initiatives taken by the MLAs to help people after resurgence of Covid cases in the last few weeks. Political matters would also be discussed,” said Sanjay Yadav, a close aide of Tejashwi. The RJD president, after coming out of jail, has already become active on his Twitter account, taking potshots at the Nitish Kumar government over the alleged poor health services in the state and rising Covid cases. “In Bihar, there is not only scarcity of beds, vaccine, oxygen, injections but also of medicines for simple fever. Our chief minister will not say anything on it,” said Lalu in one of his tweets on Thursday. Party leaders said the RJD chief’s release from jail has already galvanised the party workers. “We are excited about the meeting called by Laluji. Whatever instructions he gives, we will follow,” said senior party leader Shyam Rajak.In the 2020 assembly polls, the RJD-led grand alliance had bagged 110 seats while the NDA got a simple majority in the 243-member House.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/lalu-back-in-action-to-hold-virtual-meeting-with-party-mlas-on-may-9-101620317452708.html

Patna witnessed an explosion in cases with 3,665 people testing positive, the highest so far in a day, and reported 29 deaths during this period, taking the total death tally to 891. Gaya with 752 cases, Muzaffarpur (736), Nalanda (535) and West Champaran (533) were among the other leading contributors. With the state capital being the hot bed, the Employees State Insurance Corporation (ESIC) hospital at Bihta was set to add another 100 beds from Friday after promise of help from the Army. The hospital has been struggling with logistics issues in the management of Covid-19 patients, with 15 of its 40 doctors having tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. “The army personnel have assured us of providing 50 doctors and around 20 paramedics from Friday to support us add another 100 beds at our hospital. With this, the total number of beds available for management of Covid-19 will go up to 250,” said Dr Manmohan Mishra, medical superintendent of the ESIC hospital on the outskirts of Patna. Depending on manpower support from the state government and the army, the number of beds may later be scaled up to 200, allowing a total of 350 patients at our hospital, he said. The 500-bed ESIC hospital is grossly underutilised, operating as it was with 150 beds when all major hospitals in Patna are displaying house full board due to heavy spike in cases in what is being referred to as the second wave of the pandemic. The ESIC currently has no manpower support to run an intensive care unit (ICU) with ventilator support, important for the management of Covid-19 patients. “We have just one senior resident from the department of anaesthesiology and one from the department of medicine. They are just not enough to manage ICU. Besides, of the 40 doctors, almost 20 are from the non-clinical disciplines like anatomy, physiology, biochemistry, pathology, etc. They, too, have been deployed as consultants to oversee the junior and senior residents deployed at our hospital,” said Dr Mishra. Besides, 15 of our 40 doctors at the hospital have tested positive for Covid-19, forcing them to be under home isolation, he added. The ESIC hospital has received some support from the state government, which has deputed around 40 doctors and 113 paramedics. Earlier, the Bihar government had on April 13 sought assistance from the army to fully operationalise the ESIC hospital. The next day, a two-member team from the defence ministry had met Pratyaya Amrit, Bihar’s principal secretary, health, to assess the requirement to fully operationalise the ESIC hospital for treatment of Covid-19 patients. The defence team had then agreed in principle to extend help to the state government by providing 50 doctors to fully operationalise the 500-bed ESI hospital. The Defence Research Development Organisation (DRDO) had stepped in to manage the 500-bed hospital during the first wave of the pandemic last year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/patna-reels-with-3-665-new-cases-and-29-deaths-army-docs-to-step-in-to-support-esic-hospital-for-covid-patients-101620317393343.html
06-05-2021||Other||HC seeks govt affidavit on Covid crisis, oxygen gap||PATNAThe Patna High Court on Thursday asked Bihar’s chief secretary to file a detailed affidavit with regard to lack of infrastructure in hospitals, men and equipment, testing, availability of medicines and oxygen, disposal of bio waste and black marketing in a tabular form by Friday, when it will hear the matter again. The court was particularly concerned about oxygen availability and sough to know why the state was unable to lift the quantity allocated by the Centre and what was being done to ensure that full allocation was lifted. Appearing for the Bihar government, senior counsel Vikas Singh said that against the demand of 300 metric tonnes (MTs) of oxygen, the state had been allocated 210 MTs, but so far the state was able to lift 154 MTs only due to lack of tankers for transportation of liquid medical oxygen (LMO). “We are engaging private parties for transportation of oxygen. Jharkhand has also given six tankers and the Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) three. We are also trying other means to augment supply. Once we are able to lift the allocated quota, we will seek more from the Centre. Transportation is a problem, which the government is trying to sort out. The state is also generating around 40 MTs of oxygen,” he said. Additional solicitor general (ASG) KN Singh, however, informed the court that the Centre had so far provided 13 tankers to the state government for transportation, though it was the state’s responsibility to lift the allocated supply. “Tankers used for other purposes have also been deployed for transportation of oxygen. Besides, the state also uses its own tankers,” he said. The bench of chief justice Sanjay Karol and Justice Sanjay Kumar made it clear they were interested in results. “We are not here to govern. We are not the government. We are here only to see that governance is done. We are conscious of our duties. At this point of time, we don’t want to form any opinion. We have sought a detailed affidavit from the chief secretary and want the state to coordinate for transportation of oxygen,” it said. As soon as the hearing began at 11 am, the new bench headed by the chief justice said the state was not able to transport even the allocated quota of oxygen and sought a detailed reply in the afternoon regarding present requirement as well as projected future requirement, besides status of tankers deployed for transportation.. “As far as oxygen is concerned, what we have gathered from the previous proceedings is that the stand the state has taken is at a variance . While the state put the allocated quota from the Centre at 194 MTs initially, it was later revised to 164 MTs. The state has not been able to transport even that much. The figures supplied with regard to oxygen quota from various companies earlier also don’t match,” the bench said. The bench also wanted to know if there was blackmarketing and hoarding and who was taking action against them. “We have to save every human life, because if we fail to do that, we will be failing in our constitutional duty,” the bench said. On Tuesday, the bench of Justice Chakradhari Sharan Singh and Justice Mohit Kumar Shah had made strong observations against the inept handling of the Covid crisis and went to the extent of saying that “All of us feel ashamed for what we have done”, but refrained from passing any order, which was reserved for May 6. However, on Thursday, the bench was changed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/hc-seeks-govt-affidavit-on-covid-crisis-oxygen-gap-101620317392800.html

However, the slots on Co-WIN app used to be filled within seconds. So, my friend and I decided to get help from social media groups and create slot alerts on the government’s Co-WIN website. Finally, today I got an appointment at Aundh Hospital for vaccination to be done on May 7,” said the 34-year-old techie. Though the vaccination drive for 18-plus group started from May 1, shortage of vaccines led to opening of only two vaccination centres and limited appointments. Even as centres have been increased to six, many are unable to book appointments due to heavy rush of beneficiaries. Hence, many have switched to social media alerts. For example, a group has been formed on Telegram mobile app named “U45 Pune” in which alerts of slot openings are given. Also the link to book the schedule is provided for beneficiaries to click and book slot. Another website “www.vaccinateme.in” has been started by Healthifyme organisation. Applicants can get state and district wise slot details and book appointment to get the jab. Kedar Dandage, who needed to book vax slot for his 19-year-old son, said, “I have been refreshing the Co-WIN app for last 5 but with no avail. Then we set mobile alerts through one of the website, which gives us an alert about slot opening. However, on the Co-WIN website, search for a Centre and slots are booked in seconds. The government should increase vaccination centers as it will lead to more slots.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/18plus-beneficiaries-develop-online-alerts-to-get-vax-slot-faster-101620316852714.html

The civic body plans to install bigger chimneys to replace the existing ones to mitigate the crisis as part of its environment-friendly mission of smoke reduction. Pune mayor Muralidhar Mohol has taken up the issue with PMC administration after environmentalist Vishwambhar Choudhury made an appeal to enhance the breathing capacities of chimneys by carrying out necessary scrubbing of pipes and recommended installation of bigger and new chimneys as the existing ones are one decade old. Dr Choudhury had shared a Facebook post about the smoke emanating from crematorium chimney affecting the environment. Shrinivas Kandul, PMC electric department head and incharge of crematoriums said, “The 13 electric crematoriums in the city are facing overload since the past one year and their maintenance is long due causing regular breakdowns.

Bhosale was arrested at 8pm on Wednesday. “We arrested him from Pune. He had made some sexual comments about Shivaji Maharaj on Twitter. The others booked in the case have made posts on various social media platforms about political leaders and have made caste-based comments to incite divisive feelings,” said senior inspector Dagdu Hake of the cyber-police station in Pune. The group of booked people, however, are not working together as they all have made comments and posted content about various topics, as per the police. “This does not seem to be a collective effort.

The saffron party had set a target of winning over 200 seats.Taking to Twitter, the former governor of two northeastern states -- Tripura and Meghalaya -- said, "I have been asked by the party's topmost leadership to come to Delhi ASAP.

Restaurateurs are facing several hurdles including a struggle to get e-passes for staff, and a drop in orders due to apprehension among customers. “The major challenges are availability of passes for staff movement to deliver and come to work,” says Amit Bagga, co-founder of Daryaganj. Echoing similar sentiments, Kazem Samandari, founder L’Opera, shares, “Is the second wave going to be a short-term phenomenon, what type of restrictions will be enforced, what will be the mood of the population, etc? These are some questions everyone is asking.”On the delivery front, the eateries have been receiving a mixed response from customers. ““Our home deliveries, which were 15% of sales till last month, are slightly lower, but we expect them to increase now,” says Bagga. Same is the situation for burger delivery joint, Burgerama as co-founder Kabir Bose opines that the entire restaurant industry has been through a hard year and the second wave has delivered another huge blow to the recovery, and adds that there has been a small drop down in the sales. Another co-founder of the brand, Vivek Prakash says, “We have seen a slight dip in number of orders but we are sure now that Navratras are over this will bounce back”. However, co-founder, Viraaj Badhwar, says, “There is of courses a general sense of fear with how bad the situation is but we take great pride in being able to add just a little bit of joy to our customers lives during these hard times.”Restaurateurs have also noticed a change in order preferences. Mayur Gupta, chef and founder, Curry and Co, says, “Orders for main course dishes have gone down, but chaats and rolls are still doing well.” And, as Samandari observes, “In these times...you will concentrate on absolute essentials... We do understand this and will accompany our customers during these challenging times.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/restaurateurs-challenges-struggle-for-e-passes-orders-101620309654678.html

This is harmful to the aquatic fauna and the nature surrounding the lake,” said Dr Raj Kumar Jadhav, director, Rajiv Gandhi Zoological Park and Wildlife Research centre. This man-made lake was constructed during the Peshwa era and is situated in south of Pune. It is a combination of two lakes, with the first acting as the sedimentation tank, from where water flows into the Katraj lake. “Dams on both the lakes have gates at the bottom, which are used to release excess water into the Ambil odha (stream),” Dr Jadhav explained. “These days the water quality of Katraj lake is severely degraded due to polluted water from surrounding areas directly entering the lake. The lake is silted and covered by vegetation,” said Dr Hemant Ghate, retired professor of Zoology, Savitribai Phule Pune University. Ghate added, “The biological quality of water has changed so much that we have lost native species of fish like Puntieus Deccaniensis, which was first found in Katraj Lake in the 1970s. This was a small fish, two inches long, but now the fish is gone. This is because of the hyacinth which is exponentially growing due to the untreated sewage in the lake. Sewage provides phosphate and nitrogen for the hyacinth to grow.” On April 2, deputy chief minister and Pune district’s guardian minister, Ajit Pawar, directed the municipal officials to remove the hyacinth and desilt the lakes. A 2019 study by Renu Arora and Prof Milind Gidde, department of environmental education and research, Bharati Vidyapeeth (deemed university), had stated that the lake needs proper management and a treatment process. “Removal of weeds by a natural process is important. The diversion of the drainage line is important. There is a need to place aerators in the lake that may help to control the fish death rates, because they are at an extinct level. If some precautions are taken, the aquatic life of the lake will survive,” the study stated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/hyacinth-in-katraj-lake-persists-greens-fear-aquatic-life-will-go-extinct-101620309472203.html

It is necessary to raise the issue with the Union health ministry and other officials concerned."He said the state government is setting up Pressure Swing Adsorption (PSA) medical oxygen plants to increase production of the life-saving gas used in treatment of serious coronavirus patients."Maharashtra is currently consuming 1,750 MT of (medical) oxygen, he said.The only ray of hope for the state is installation of 28 PSA plants. The state has given orders for 150 PSA plants which will commence in the coming days, he said.Tope said liquid medical oxygen is among the key tools needed to deal with the pandemic.If oxygen supply is not resumed, we will face serious shortage. We will have to get more oxygen from the Centre in this period (till PSA plants start functioning), he said.PSA is a technology that is used to separate gas species from a mixture of gases under pressure.A fortnight ago, 22 Covid-19 patients died in a civic hospital in Nashik after oxygen supply to them was disrupted due to a leakage in the storage tank.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/centre-reduced-maharashtra-s-oxygen-supply-by-50-mt-claims-health-minister-tope-101620308276416.html

And a few good Samaritans in the city are trying to provide them some relief in the course of their work, albeit with necessary safety precautions.“I’ve kept a crate of small packaged drinking water at the main gate of our house. So whenever there’s a delivery boy at the door, I ensure they take one along. That’s the least I can do,” says Suhani Gulati, a resident of Punjabi Bagh.Some others have taken the traditional route to quench thirst of delivery men in this scorching heat. One such individual, Prateek Sachdeva from Pitam Pura, says, “We’ve stopped stepping out and as we’ve a joint family, some or the other member is receiving deliveries every other day. So, my mother has kept an earthen pot of water for the riders. Earlier we used to keep old plastic bottles but have now replaced them with takeaway paper glasses for safety.”For some, giving out tips is their way to help riders. “Since our delivery agents are working so hard, I try to tip them extra by paying the round-off amount. This way, I’m able to avoid monetary exchange and he gets to earn little extra,” shares Kritika Daksh Mehra, a resident of Saket.And not just consumers, but some restaurateurs too, are making effort for comfort of delivery personnel. Mayur Gupta, who owns an eatery in south Delhi, has placed tables and chairs for riders. “Many delivery boys have to wait for their order, so they can sit for a bit,” he says.Such efforts are being duly acknowledged as well. Kapil Chauhan, a delivery boy with a food aggregator, feels the pandemic has made customers respect their job. “Ab hume frontline worker jaisa feel aata hai. Kaafi ‘thanks’ bolte hai log, jo pehle thoda missing lagta tha,” he says. His sentiments are echoed by another delivery agent, Sukham Singh, who shares, “Pichle saal tak bura lagta tha, log hume hi Covid samajhte they, seedha sanitiser spray karne chale aate they.

"Lockdown has helped in reducing the number of deaths, according to the models by IISc Professor Sashikumaar Ganesan. So, I recommend that the lockdown be extended by at least two weeks," Babu opined. He added that there will be an increase in fatalities at least 10 to 14 days from the date of cases being reported. On the measures to be taken in view of surge in infections, he said triage could be a game changer in the fight against Covid. According to Babu, there should be more screening and triage centres with oxygen supply all over Bengaluru where the Covid cases are high. "These (Triaging centres) should be set up every five kilometres. By doing this kind of enhanced triage by using existing manpower, we can tide over the crisis," he claimed. While daily infections and active cases in the state are rising alarmingly, the fatalities too are spiralling. On Wednesday alone, there were 346 deaths taking the total deaths so far to 16,884. Bengaluru was the main contributor of Covid cases in Karnataka with 23,106 infections and 161 fatalities on a single day taking the total infections and deaths to 8,63,380 and 7,006 cumulatively. The city had 3.13 lakh active cases as on Wednesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/lockdown-must-be-extended-for-2-more-weeks-in-karnataka-says-expert-101620307963619.html

The arrested was identified as Sandeep Jagdish Pardeshi (40) of Warje Malwadi. Pardeshi used to visit the house of a business owner couple to teach their four-year-old daughter. A complaint was lodged by a 31-year-old woman who owns the business with her husband, according to the police. “The couple had found him through online search. He had started working for them on February 15 and was going to their house between 6pm and 7pm every day ever since,” said sub-inspector Ravindra Muddal of Hinjewadi police station. The complainant and her husband were hosting an 18-year-old girl from their native place in Patna, Bihar. “She had come to spend vacation time with them. The man used to call her to the bathroom under the guise of giving him talcum powder and then sexually harass her,” said PSI Muddal. The teenager had not told her hosts what Pardeshi was doing until May 4 when she revealed the events of the past days. “The complainant, in whose house the girl was living, asked the teacher to not come on May 5 and spoke with the girl. On May 6, they decided to catch him in the act,” said PSI Muddal. On May 6, the man allegedly went inside the bathroom and kept the door ajar. He then asked the teenager to bring him talcum powder while stripping his pants, according to the complainant. However, instead of the teenager, the 31-year-old complainant opened the bathroom door to find him in a compromising position, according to her complaint. Pardeshi allegedly ran away from the house and was arrested by the police later on Thursday. A case under Section 354 of Indian Penal Code was registered at Hinjewadi police station.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/dance-tutor-arrested-for-sexual-harassment-of-teenager-in-pune-101620301072292.html

Which is why we are seeing instances of hoarding and black marketing. Our moral fabric has been dismembered to a great extent," a bench of Justices Vipin Sanghi and Rekha Palli said.The observation came in response to a suggestion by a lawyer that medical professionals who have retired, medical students or nursing students can be tapped to provide assistance in the prevailing situation when there is shortage of personnel also not just medicines, equipment and beds.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/moral-fabric-dismembered-hc-on-hoarding-black-marketing-amid-covid-19-surge-101620291332625.html

06-05-2021||Kolkata||Newly elected MLAs of West Bengal sworn in||The swearing-in ceremony for the newly elected legislators in West Bengal got underway on Thursday morning, with pro-tem speaker Subrata Mukherjee administering the oath of office and secrecy to the MLAs.Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee attended the ceremony for a short while before leaving for the state secretariat.The entire programme was held following Covid-19 protocols, an official said.At least 143 MLAs -- most of them from the assembly constituencies of Kolkata, North- and South-24 Parganas, Purba and Paschim Medinipur, Howrah, Hooghly and Jhargram -- are set to take oath on Thursday.Seventy-four of them would be sworn-in during the first half of the day, and the rest in the second half.So far, senior TMC leaders including Partha Chatterjee, Shashi Panja, Madan Mitra, Sovandeb Chattopadhyay and Nirmal Majhi have taken oath in the state assembly.No BJP representative, however, took part on Thursday.The oath-taking ceremony will continue till Saturday.The TMC has swept the just-concluded West Bengal assembly elections, bagging 213 seats, while its bitter rival, the BJP, managed to pocket 77 constituencies.One seat has gone to the ISF, which contested under the symbol of Rashtriya Secular Majlis Party, and another to an Independent member.Elections in Jangipur and Samsherganj were countermanded following the death of two candidates.By-poll to Khardaha assembly seat, where late TMC nominee Kajal Sinha won by a margin of over 18,000 votes, would also be held later, an election official said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/newly-elected-mlas-of-west-bengal-sworn-in-101620287541239.html
06-05-2021||Delhi||Gargi College students help differently abled, underprivileged women||Even the pandemic hasn’t been able to douse the spirit of students of Delhi University’s Gargi College, who have always gone an extra mile for women empowerment. Paving a way to uplift the marginalised sections of the society through their acts of compassion, around 90 girls of Gargi College are imparting digital vocational training in making masks, pouches, bags and the likes from discarded cloth waste as part of Enactus’ Project Rachna, to empower the rural women.Supporting the rural women in such tough times, these students have managed to successfully reduce 341 kgs of cloth waste and contribute to the financial independence of 36 women. “The creative team teaches the rural women to make products like folders, masks, pouches, scrunchies from cloth by recycling and upcycling the raw materials. Another team markets and sells their products through various digital platforms and distributes the proceeds among the women, to uplift their social status,” says Adya Sukhija, a first year student of BA (Hons) Business Economics.Not one to get bogged down by the challenges of the lockdown, the students are giving their best to benefit the rural women by using technology. Charu Arora, a second year student pursuing BCom (Hons) says, “We have conducted a few online sessions and are working on introducing new product ideas for the rural women. Some students have even shot some DIY videos and sent to the women to continue teaching them during these difficult times. Apart from this, we are providing help by marketing the products made by them. And recently, using money through a grant, we provided an LED TV to some women who have partial auditory impairment, to help them make the products through the visual media.”Adding value to the lives of the underprivileged and the differently-abled women, these self motivated youngsters have been contributing to the cause whole heartedly. “For me, the motivation to support the cause comes from the positive difference it generates. When I see the women create something beautiful out of someone else’s cloth waste, it feels like an achievement. To give an object which is perceived as a discard, a beautiful form, and a new shelf life is moving. Seeing the professional growth of these women makes me realise the importance of being independent myself,” Avineet Kaur, a final year student of BCom (Hons). And Sanjana, a final year student pursuing BCom (Hons), adds: “When I went to train these women, they were so enthusiastic that despite their household work they took out time and worked hard to finish making the products and achieve targets on time. Their consistency and loyalty towards their work has taught me a lot about life and discipline.”In the presently rocky market place, due to the havoc of pandemic waves, the students are aiming to secure the future of these rural women. “Due to Covid-19, their community has lost pre-existing market, and are struggling to boost their sales. Therefore, our vision is to upgrade the virtual demand of the products made by them,” says Nitya Maniktala, a second year student of Political Science (Hons). And Shunyam Gupta, a second year student of BCom (Hons) adds, “Once the lockdown ends and the situation becomes better, we will resume setting up seasonal stalls at corporates and markets across Delhi like in Greater Kailash and Dilli Haat. The women working under this project have become adept at making eco-friendly products such as folders, diaries, sling bags, rugs etc which sell really well!”And the women who have benefitted from this project are grateful to the students for their efforts. “The money we have earned has not only helped us in making ends meet but also enabled us to buy gifts for our children. Seeing them happy makes me satisfied as well,” says one of the rual women, on condition of anonymity.Author tweets @FizzyBuddhaFollow more stories on Facebook and Twitter||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/campuscalling-gargi-college-students-help-differently-abled-underprivileged-women-101620287514753.html

06-05-2021||Kolkata||Bengal to use quacks as first line of defence against Covid-19||The West Bengal government will use the state’s 275,000 quacks as the first line of defence against the second wave of Covid-19, which has registered a 5- 8 times jump in rural Bengal over last year’s peak. The state health department will soon issue dos and don’ts for their handling of Covid-19 patients.“We can use this workforce. We can name them ‘Swasthya Suraksha Bondhu’ instead of calling them quacks,” chief minister Mamata Banerjee said referring to the unqualified rural healthcare workers who are often consulted by villagers for minor ailments in absence of qualified doctors.Daily count of Covid-19 cases in Bengal has shot up more than 20 times since March 27, when the eight phase state assembly elections took off. Number of positive cases in rural Bengal too have gone up significantly, triggering concerns.“Even when the state was witnessing the peak of the first wave in October 2020, the cases in rural Bengal were under control. But now, cases have shot up almost 5 - 8 times in the districts which have more than 50% rural population,” said a senior official of the state health department.On October 22, 2020, West Bengal reported 4,157 cases- the highest daily spike in the first surge. On that day, districts like Birbhum, Murshidabad, Hooghly and Nadia reported 82, 110, 225 and 194 cases respectively.On Wednesday, when West Bengal reported 18,102 cases and 103 deaths, the same districts reported 722, 500, 986 and 869 cases respectively, a rise of 5 – 8 times.These are among the districts that produce the maximum paddy in the state and have more than 60% rural population.“We have been utilizing our ASHA workers in the fight against Covid. Now we have planned to use the quacks as they are spread in almost all villages and blocks. It is a huge work force which we want to rope in because villagers visit them regularly for treatment. The state health department is coming up with a guideline in the form of dos and don’ts for this purpose,” said the official.They could also be given crash course training by the block and sub-divisional hospitals, if necessary, on how to handle Covid-19 patients and what to do if they come across patients whose condition was critical.The decision was taken in a meeting held by chief minister Mamata Banerjee with the chief secretary, home secretary, health secretary and district officials to take stock of the Covid-19 scenario in the state on Wednesday.An NGO working on capacity building of quacks said they can be utilised with proper training in areas with dearth of registered doctors."This is a welcome move as these rural informal health care workers are the first point of contact for more than 70% villagers. We have been working on their capacity building since 2007 and have found that they are very efficient and sincere and can be utilised with proper training in rural areas, where there is a dearth of registered doctors. We have trained some of them in three districts when the first Covid wave broke out in 2020," said Dr Partha Sarathi Mukherjee, a public health researcher and the secretary of Liver Foundation, West Bengal.The state had earlier used ASHA workers to identify patients with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARI) and Influenza like Illness (ILI) in a door-to-door campaign and also to spread awareness against Covid-19.Joydeb Halder, a quack practising in one of the islands in the Sunderbans welcomed the government’s decision and said: "The number of patients with fever and cough and cold has increased over the past few months. I don't allow anyone to enter my chamber. I hear from them about their symptoms and give them medicines. Also I tell them to visit the nearest hospital in Gosaba if the fever and cough and cold don’t go away even after taking medicines.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/bengal-to-use-quacks-as-first-line-of-defence-against-covid-19-101620285651026.html

06-05-2021||Chandigarh||AJL case: Special judge censures senior advocate for personal remarks||A special judge handling money laundering cases at the Panchkula district courts has expressed displeasure over remarks made by senior advocate RS Cheema, stating that he tried to “overawe” the judicial process. Cheema, a criminal lawyer and former advocate general of Punjab, represents Associated Journal Limited (AJL), the publisher of National Herald newspaper, in the illegal plot allotment case that also involves former Haryana chief minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda. Also read: Chaudhary Ajit Singh, former Union minister, dies of Covid-19The proceedings being carried out concern money laundering allegations being probe by the enforcement directorate. The hearings are taking place virtually, and it was on May 3, when the reported incident took place as special judge Dr Sushil Kumar Garg was discussing the next date for hearing for filing a supplementary challan. The order states that Cheema pleaded for the next hearing to take place in July in view of Covid surge and his age, and made “uncalled-for personal remarks” against Garg, stating: “Aap is matter mai itna personal interest kyun dikha rahe ho (Why are you taking such personal interest in the case), by fixing such short date in May itself?”‘Attempt to overawe judicial process’According to the order, the judge said that such type of aspersions are “not expected” of a counsel of his stature and such an attempt to “overawe the judicial process” is “not appreciable”. Garg also cited the Supreme Court directions on conducting proceedings in all criminal cases and complaints against former and sitting MPs and MLAs on urgent basis. “The accused and their respective counsels were duty bound to respect the mandate of law and the proceedings conducted in accordance therewith. Needless to say, the undersigned and the court officials were also risking their lives in the wake of the threat of the pandemic to discharge the duties entrusted by law,” the order said.Later, the court adjourned the matter for July 5, but recorded: “This goes without saying that the court highly values the peaceful and cordial relations between the Bench and the Bar. There is no intent to belittle the effort of any party or the learned counsels representing them, but at the same the law casts a duty upon the presiding officer to uphold the majesty of law to further the cause of justice on which our Constitution lays so much emphasis.”The money laundering probe was initiated after the CBI registered a corruption case in 2016 for the alleged offences committed by Hooda when he was the CM in 2005.

06-05-2021||Pune||State, Centre should sit together, find solution on Maratha quota: BJP MP||BJP MP Sambhajiraje Chhatrapati said on Wednesday that the Maharashtra government and Centre should decide the way forward after the Supreme Court earlier in the day declared reservation for the Maratha community in the state as unconstitutional. Talking to reporters here, he said both the previous BJP government and the present MVA government had put forth the case for Maratha quota strongly before the court, and appealed people to maintain calm. "The previous BJP-led government enacted the law and the High Court also validated it. The present state government also put forth its side in the court aggressively," Sambhajiraje said. "But despite all these efforts, the SC gave this verdict, which is unfortunate for the Maratha community but we have to accept and respect it," he said. The BJP MP, however, asked how other states could violate the 50 per cent cap on reservation. "The state and the Centre should decide the way forward over the issue. All the experts should sit together and study why other states can get quota (over 50 per cent) and not Maharashtra," he said. The state government should immediately offer increased seats to the Maratha community in educational institutes for which it would not need the court's permission, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/state-centre-should-sit-together-find-solution-on-maratha-quota-bjp-mp-101620275805487.html

The Centre has allocated Bihar a daily quota of 214 metric tonnes of medical oxygen, but it was able to lift only 167 metric tonnes because of logistic issues.Dr Sanjeev Kumar, nodal officer for Covid-19 at the hospital said the oxygen demand was never so high even during August last year, when Covid-19 cases had spiked during the first wave of the pandemic. “This clearly points to the increased requirement of oxygen among Covid-19 patients during the second wave,” he said.At the peak of the first wave, Bihar registered 4,071 cases on August 11 which is little more than 25% of the 15,853 cases registered on May 1 this year during the second wave of the pandemic.The AIIMS has so far admitted over 5,000 Covid patients since March 22 last year, when it reported the first case at its institute. 90 days later on July 10, it was declared a dedicated Covid-19 hospital. It had resumed full OPD and general services only on February 15 this year.Of the total 538,677 Covid-19 cases reported in Bihar so far, the state has 113,479 active cases as on Tuesday. It has also recorded 2,987 Covid deaths till now.

06-05-2021||Bangalore||Karnataka to provide Covid-19 test results within seven hours: Deputy CM||Providing results of Covid-19 tests within 7 hours is being done in KC General Hospital in Malleshwaram and this will be expanded to the entire state, deputy chief minister and state Covid-19 ministerial task force head, Dr CN Ashwatha Narayana, said on Wednesday.Speaking to reporters after reviewing the Covid situation in Malleshwaram, he said, providing reports of Covid tests and Bengaluru Urban (BU) code number generation will be made to happen within 7 hours.As per the procedure, once the laboratories upload the positive test result on the ICMR portal, it should generate the Bengaluru Urban (BU) code number."Earlier it used to take 72 hours to get results after the reach of samples to the laboratory. Now, this has been reduced to 7 hours. This enables early detection of the infection and to start treatment before the infection advances," Narayana explained.He further said that measures will be taken to do the blood tests of those who are in home isolation, adding that blood tests will help to know the condition of the infected patient and to find out the inflammatory markers.Stating that oxygen produced in the state will be completely utilised within the state itself, he informed that currently, there is a supply of 850 MTs of oxygen to the state and if the demand for oxygen increases further, arrangements will be done to get it from other states or from other countries.On antiviral drug Remdesivir, he said: "It will be useful only in the primary stage of the infection. But, when the infection is more this antiviral is of no use.""About 30-40% of the infected are getting admitted to hospitals even though they do not require, because of anxiety. So steps will be taken to reduce the anxiety of the patients. Hospitals are told to keep enough stock of consumables like masks, PPE kits, oximeters, medicines, etc."With regard to a query about the situation in Ramanagara, he said, that an oxygen storage facility and an oxygen generation plant of 1000 liters/minute would be set up in the district hospital. "Also, a discussion is in progress about establishing oxygen generation plants in four other taluk hospitals of the district with the aid of CSR funds. This would resolve the dependency of hospitals on oxygen suppliers and manufacturers."As of now, the number of active cases in the district is around 3000. Generally, 10% of this, i.e. about 300 patients need hospitalisation, whereas the district is equipped to handle 30% of the existing number of cases, Narayana, who is also the district in-charge minister, clarified.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/karnataka-to-provide-covid-19-test-results-within-seven-hours-deputy-cm-101620272576274.html

His daughter browsed social media and contacted a 23-year-old, who along with his friends offered to cremate Agarwal’s infected body with dignity.Abhishek and his friends - Karunesh Pathak, Sunny Sahu, Shashank Shukla, Ramesh Tripathi and Raghav Kumar wore personal protection equipment (PPE) kits and took the body to the cremation ground where they performed Agarwal’s last rites.“Had they not been here, the last rites of my father would not have been performed. At a time when relatives are running away from a corona patient, they are risking their lives to help others. I have no words to express my gratitude,” said Mahesh’s daughter Kanta Agarwal (52).Abhishek is one among several others in the city who are helping out the needy during the unprecedented crisis with free food, medicines, oxygen cylinders, ambulance service when the rising number of Covid-19 cases in the second wave of the disease has paralysed health infrastructure causing deaths and despondence.Abhishek said instances of ill-treatment of patients dying of the coronavirus made him take up the responsibility to give dignity to the dead.“I was really sad when I heard that in Jaunpur, an elderly man was forced to carry the body of his wife on a bicycle for hours because villagers did not allow the funeral fearing coronavirus.” He says he called his friends that day and told them that he would cremate those abandoned by their relatives or community due to fear of Covid infection.“I asked my friends if they would like to join me, and all agreed. We collected some money, purchased PPE kits, face shields, gloves, masks, head covers, shoe covers, and sanitisers. We floated our number on social media and got going. Till now we have cremated 12 such bodies,” he said.Abhishek and his team can be reached on 8887987566. He says he and his friends don’t charge a penny for cremations. “I just want to remind everyone that every dead body deserves dignity. As human beings, we cannot let a virus dictate terms to such an extent that we start disrespecting dead people,” he said.Uttar Pradesh on Wednesday recorded the biggest single-day jump of 357 Covid-19 deaths including 38 from Lucknow, taking the toll to 14,151.

06-05-2021||Delhi||Anatomy of Capital oxygen crisis: 5 things Delhi govt didn’t get right||Amid a raging fourth wave of the Covid-19 cases, Delhi, in the past 15 days, has been hit by an unprecedented medical oxygen crisis. While several Covid-19 patients have died waiting for beds with oxygen support, the family members of at least 32 say they died inside hospitals due to oxygen shortage.The Delhi government says it continues to face oxygen shortage because of inadequate allocation and supply by the central government, but the crisis also seems to have been caused by its own failings, such as the inability to manage logistics or the absence of an allocation plan to hospitals.There is a demand-supply imbalance. There is a demand-supply imbalance. “We need 976 MT of oxygen, but it was only yesterday that we started getting more than 500 MT. On April 19 and 20, when the oxygen crisis first began to unfold in the city, Delhi used to receive only 241 to 355 MT every day,” said a government spokesperson.Communications sent by the Delhi government to the Centre, as seen by HT, showed that the city administration projected a demand for 700 MT per day till April 28, and revised its demand to 976 MT based on its bed augmentation plan on April 29. The Centre, however, began to increase Delhi’s quota of oxygen on a piecemeal basis from April 21, when it first raised it from 378 MT to 480 MT; then on April 30 to 490 MT; and then on May 1 to 590 MT.But the crisis is not one of demand-supply alone. From supply chain management to distribution within Delhi to better preparation to robust information exchange with citizens, experts said there were several steps the Delhi government should have taken to manage the crisis better.SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENTOfficials and company representatives said that the biggest problem--the lack of cryogenic tankers--became worse because Delhi started looking for tankers only from mid-April.“By then, most of the tankers available with transporters in north India were booked by states such as Madhya Pradesh, Punjab, Uttar Pradesh and Haryana. Other states had predicted that there would be a clamour to grab tankers as the demand for oxygen first grew, and then spiked suddenly. Delhi kept its focus on demanding extra allocation from the Centre without giving much thought about the transportation bit,” said KK Yadav, a transporter in Faridabad, who was approached by the Delhi government between April 17 and 19.Besides, the Delhi government’s announcement of procuring 18 cryogenic tankers from Bangkok was also a non-starter due to “technical and administrative issues”. A government spokesperson said it has now sourced seven tankers from the Central government, apart from procuring around five on its own. “Some industrialists and other states have also helped in providing tankers, but it is not enough. The high court has said it is the Central government’s responsibility to ensure oxygen reaches Delhi’s borders.”A senior government official said a big challenge is to reduce the turnaround time of containers because at least 100MT was being sourced from over 1,500km away . “It is only over the past two days that Oxygen express has been pressed to full service for Delhi to reduce the turnaround time. The Centre should have done it from a week before,” said the official.A central government official, however, said the railways were ready with rakes for several days but the Delhi administration could not arrange for tankers to lift the oxygen.DISTRIBUTION NETWORK INSIDE DELHIDelhi had no daily hospital-wise allocation plan for oxygen until a week ago. Earlier, the hospitals had contracts with oxygen suppliers. But, this arrangement went haywire with the sudden surge in demand for oxygen. On April 22, the government decided it will start giving daily schedules of allocation to every hospital. But, it was a rudimentary plan which did not work well.It was only on April 29, when the crisis was at its peak, that the Delhi government issued an order prescribing quantities of oxygen to be used by each hospital in Delhi. This order also came after the directions of the high court.On the basis of this, now Delhi government increases and decreases the oxygen supply to different hospitals depending on the total quantum received in the city on any day.And while hospitals started sending SOS to the government from April 18, it was only on April 22 that the administration set up a helpline number, with a senior IAS officer in-charge of it, to coordinate with all medical facilities and address their demands and grievances.CITIZEN FACILITATIONDelhi does not have a verified central helpline number for people to meet their oxygen requirement, or get admitted to hospitals. It has not spread awareness about phone number or addresses of the 14 oxygen cylinder refillers in the city, and most people are managing their individual demands through crowdsourcing on social media or by word of mouth.The Delhi government said that work on a centralised system was going on, but did not give a timeline of when it will be operational.On April 28, when scores of people were waiting outside refillers for 6-10 hours for oxygen, the Delhi government issued an order clarifying that people will get to refill their cylinders in Delhi only with their own ID card, the patient’s ID card, and a doctor’s prescription for medical oxygen.Uma Tyagi, whose 48-year old husband died of Covid-19, said her son and daughter waited outside two separate refillers for eight hours to get one cylinder. “My son was turned away because he did not have the documents. Nobody told us what papers were required. My daughter somehow managed one, but my husband died hours after that cylinder got over,” she said.The state health department has now asked all district magistrates to deploy teams round-the-clock at refilling plants or retail establishments to check documents and to ensure adherence to Covid-19 appropriate behaviour.PSA PLANTST Jacob John, former head of clinical virology at Christian Medical College, Vellore, said even if the central government failed to install PSA oxygen plants within the past one year, nothing stopped the Delhi government from being proactive and getting things done on its own during the entire run of the pandemic. The Delhi government has 11 hospitals under it, and the Centre is installing PSA oxygen plants in seven of them.“The internationally required number of beds per 100,000 population is 300, India has only 50. So, we were anyway working at one-sixth efficiency of health care management. When a crisis comes, even the one-sixth becomes one-60th. About 20% of air is oxygen, the raw material is everywhere. It is only a matter of converting it into medical oxygen by using huge plants,” John said.On April 27, the Delhi government announced that the city will import 21 PSA plants from France, but that remains on paper till now, which is why the Delhi government is now looking to DRDO for more such plants. In a letter to the Union health ministry, the Delhi government on Sunday sought 50 oxygen generators to Delhi instead of just four, as per the existing plan.LATE CALL FOR HELPDr Amit Singh, associate professor at Centre for Infectious Disease at Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore, said Delhi could have planned better during January-February, when cases had plummeted after the third wave. Even during the fourth wave, the administration’s response to the crisis was delayed on almost all aspects -- putting in curbs, going into lockdown, seeking the Centre’s help, and planning for augmentation of beds and oxygen.To be sure, several states in India are guilty of the same lapses.“We could have planned better considering all other countries had a second wave. When it comes to planning about beds, oxygen etc., it all depends on predictions of how much the intensity of the second wave is likely to be. Because of lockdown during the first wave, we did not see as many fatalities, so we should have prepared for a fivefold increase in intensity, and calculated the percentage of people who need ventilator and oxygen support,” said Dr Singh.“The lockdown should have been earlier (when the positivity rate was going up), but that can only be done if you envisage through data that there is going to be a huge wave,” he added.Talking to reporters, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Wednesday said the Delhi government will continue the lockdown based on the situation of the Covid-19 cases in Delhi. “Right now, the citizens of Delhi themselves want this lockdown to continue to stop the spread of this virus... We are continuously monitoring the oxygen situation. Yesterday, we received 43 SOS calls regarding oxygen. I know that there were some unfortunate incidents but right now, we are working round the clock to ensure that no fatality in Delhi happens due to lack of oxygen,” he said.“But our only hope is that the central government will provide Delhi with its full quota of oxygen. During this tough time, we have also received massive support from the Supreme Court and the high court. I am hopeful that in the coming days the situation will improve,” Kejriwal said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/anatomy-of-capital-oxygen-crisis-5-things-delhi-govt-didn-t-get-right-101620260846250.html

In the wake of the increasing Covid-19 cases detected among the controllers, the controllers’ guild has written to the Airports Authority of India (AAI), requesting it to suspend breath analyser tests that enhance the risk of infection.According to officials in Delhi ATC, as many as 85 of the total 402 air traffic controllers are either Covid-positive or are in quarantine.“While at least 55-60 controllers used to work in a shift earlier, the strength has now reduced to 35-40 controllers. In order to deal with any crisis, we do have at least 10-12 controllers as back up at all times. The situation is somewhat under control as the air traffic movements per day have fallen to around 700 from 1,000,” said an official who asked not to be named.The letter from the controllers’ guild read that the machine used for the breath analyser test did not have the potential to transmit the virus but the environment in which the test is conducted needs to be given due consideration. “The BA test is conducted in a small closed room for air traffic controllers (ATCOs), while undergoing BA test, mask is removed and exhalation is done in BA test machine. This process can release droplets inside room, which may affect subsequent officer undergoing BA test,” read the letter dated April 25.JB Singh, general manager, corporate communications, AAI, declined to respond on the request made by the guild to do away with BA tests.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/exempt-delhi-atc-staff-from-breath-tests-says-controllers-guild-101620260497568.html

06-05-2021||Delhi||Delhi govt seeks cylinder donations to create common oxygen pool in all district||Each of the 11 districts in Delhi will now have a common oxygen pool of 20 cylinders to start with, while those wanting to donate cylinders can do so at the Raj Ghat depot of the Delhi Transport Corporation (DTC), senior Delhi government officials said on Wednesday. The move is aimed at giving easy access to oxygen to the 50,000-odd Covid patients undergoing treatment in home isolation.The government, through an order, allocated 11 DTC bus depots to create a pool of oxygen cylinders in each district. Each of these depots will be linked to the district magistrate (DM) of that zone, the order said.Delhi, according to government officials, currently needs 976 MT oxygen per day. The allocation to the capital is only 590 MT, which the Supreme Court has ordered, must be increased to 700 MT.Hospitals,meanwhile, continue to send out appeals for uninterrupted flow of oxygen to save critical patients.“NGOs, religious organisations and individuals are doing a lot on their own. We request them to donate it (cyclinders) to the Delhi government... To donate, citizens can call on the helpline -- 23270718,” a senior government official said about the facility at the Raj Ghat depot. He asked not to be named.The district magistrates concerned will be responsible for the judicious distribution of cylinders among Covid patients in home isolation as well as hospitals having an urgent requirement of oxygen, stated the order.“Also, DMs have been authorised to create a buffer stock of 10% cylinders to meet any SOS calls, till the pool is expanded to fulfil the requirement of all individuals. The common pool will be boosted in a phase-wise manner through procurement, donations as well as those seized during searches of hoarders and black marketeers. The oxygen filled cylinders will be provided to Covid patients in home isolation and hospitals in return of empty ones,” the government order said.Two DTC depots are providing buses to carry medical oxygen cylinders to hospitals in emergency situations, said a DTC official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-govt-seeks-cylinder-donations-to-create-common-oxygen-pool-in-all-district-101620258596274.html
06-05-2021||Delhi||Supply eases but no respite for small hospitals in Delhi||With Delhi receiving 555 MT of medical oxygen on Tuesday – a significant improvement from the average 445 MT per day recorded between May 1 and 3 – the oxygen crisis in the city eased a bit with bigger hospitals saying they are receiving more quantities of oxygen per delivery, which led to fewer alarm calls. Smaller hospitals, which mostly depend on cylinders, however, continue to struggle.The quantity of oxygen received by Delhi still remains lower than 700 MT, which the Supreme Court has asked the central government to earmark for Capital, in the light of the unprecedented surge in Covid-19 cases that has left the health care system overburdened.“Delhi on Tuesday received 555 MT oxygen – the highest so far. It has come as a relief in a severe crisis situation even though our requirement at this point is 976 MT... But there has been a lot of ad-hoc arrangements from oxygen plants,” said Raghav Chadha, vice chairperson of the Delhi Jal Board, who is monitoring the day-to-day oxygen supply process in the capital.Dr DS Rana, chairperson of Sir Ganga Ram hospital, said the hospital was receiving two or three large refills every day. “Oxygen situation is much better than before, we do not have to raise alarm every two to three hours like before. If the government gets as much oxygen as needed, the situation is likely to improve,” Rana said.The hospital was sent a 10 MT tanker, but could not use the oxygen as the connector port of the tanker was not compatible with the one in the hospital. The hospital, however, has sufficient oxygen for now.“The situation has improved. This is directly related to the amount of oxygen that Delhi gets. On the days that Delhi received a little higher amount of oxygen, we weren’t on the edge,” said Dr Sumit Ray, medical superintendent of Holy Family hospital.Smaller hospitals continued to struggle as they had to queue up at the 14 designated refilling stations for replenishing their oxygen cylinders.“I think the oxygen situation is better today, but we face a challenge because of our filling station. The government keeps changing our vendor and our current vendor has no system in place. I have been personally waiting in the queue since 3pm, and I do not know when I will get a refill because the station now says that their stock is over,” said Dr CM Bhagat, medical director the Bhagat Chandra Hospital, Dwarka.Chadha expressed hope that the Centre will develop more systematic ways to ensure oxygen supply to Delhi.“Also, it should not be like Delhi ends up receiving a decent amount of oxygen as a reaction to the high court pulling up the central government,” he said.On May 1, 2 and 3, Delhi received 454 MT, 447 MT and 433 MT oxygen respectively – an average of 445 MT per day, with the entire process under the scrutiny of both the Supreme Court and the Delhi high court. Between April 21 and 30, Delhi received 353 MT oxygen per day on average.While the Centre has failed to ensure the supply of 700 metric tonnes (MT) quota of medical oxygen to the national capital, the Delhi government has been unable to arrange for cryogenic tankers to pick up supplies – both of which continue to remain key hurdles as hospitals send out desperate appeals for uninterrupted flow to save critically ill patients.“We received 48 oxygen-related SOS calls on Tuesday. All of them were resolved. We supplied 36.40 MT oxygen from out SOS oxygen reserves. These hospitals collectively have 4,036 occupied oxygen beds,” said Chadha.Government records showed, of the 48 distress calls, 20 were addressed with cylinders, 13 with liquid medical oxygen, and 15 pertained to streamlining supply and distribution.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/supply-eases-but-no-respite-for-small-hospitals-in-delhi-101620258312650.html
06-05-2021||Delhi||3 arrested for passing off fire extinguishers as oxygen cylinders||Police searched a scrap godown in outer Delhi’s Alipur, and arrested three men for passing off empty fire extinguishers as oxygen cylinders, and selling them at exorbitant rates. Police said they seized 532 empty fire extinguishers -- painted black and fitted with nozzles to make them look like oxygen cylinders -- from the godown.“Liquid oxygen is filled in a cylinder at a pressure of 300 bars (1 bar = 100,000 Pa). Oxygen cylinders are made of tough metal, and are tested as per the protocol before they are deemed fit for use and refilling. But fire extinguishers do not need that much pressure. If a fire extinguisher is used for refilling oxygen, it may burst because of the high pressure and cause danger to human lives,” said Delhi Fire Services (DSF) chief Atul Garg.Apart from the empty fire extinguishers, 26 oxygen cylinder nozzles, two electric grinder machines used for removing the red paint of fire extinguishers, three silver spray paint cans, and other items, were also seized||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/3-arrested-for-passing-off-fire-extinguishers-as-oxygen-cylinders-101620257876179.html
06-05-2021||Delhi||Water supply to be affected for 3 days in various parts of Delhi||Water supply will remain affected in various parts of the national capital for the next three days as a result of Haryana releasing less raw water into the Yamuna, the Delhi Jal Board said on Wednesday.The DJB said in a statement that the supply from Wazirabad, Chandrawal and Okhla water treatment plants was hit due to a reduction in the release of raw water into the river, which has consequently pulled down the water level at Wazirabad pond. At present, the level at Wazirabad pond is 667.2 feet against a normal of 674.5 feet.“Water supply in parts of central Delhi, north Delhi, south Delhi, west Delhi and Cantonment areas will remain affected in the morning and evening for the next three days. The situation is likely to persist till the pond level improves to normal,” DJB’s statement read.On average, the DJB supplies 900 MGD (million gallons daily) water, with demand peaking at 1,100 MGD in summer months.DJB vice-chairman Raghav Chadha on Saturday said the depleting water levels in the Yamuna is leading to a shortage of drinking water in several parts of Delhi, and may also affect hospitals in the city in the coming days. He urged Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar to release more raw water into the Yamuna so that sufficient drinking water is available in the national capital.The water from Wazirabad pond is drawn for treatment at Wazirabad, Okhla and Chandrawal treatment plants. The Wazirabad and Chandrawal water treatment plants are supplying 228 MGD of drinking water currently.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/water-supply-to-be-affected-for-3-days-in-various-parts-of-delhi-101620257619345.html
06-05-2021||Delhi||AAP demands 187 cryogenic tankers for Delhi||The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) on Wednesday urged the Union government to regulate the distribution of cryogenic tankers across the country – the way in which it regulates the supply of medical oxygen – and said that Delhi should be provided 187 tankers to meet its daily medical oxygen requirement.“India has 1,631 cryogenic tankers to transport total production of around 8,500 MT oxygen across the country. This the central government has told the Delhi high court. By our calculation, 1,631 tankers are capable of catering to transportation of 23,000 MT oxygen. So, there is no dearth of tankers in the country, but evidently a factor of mismanagement. Delhi is not an industrial state. Even the high court has noted that. So we don’t have sufficient tankers. But several other states which have the tankers are learnt to have reserved it for themselves,” Raghav Chadha, AAP’s national spokesperson said.Chadha, who is also a Delhi MLA, further said, “Cryogenic tankers are now national assets. Central government regulating supply of oxygen in the country without regulating the distribution of tankers does not make sense. Tankers should also be distributed among states proportionally in accordance to their oxygen needs at a given point of time. We request the central government to regulate distribution of cryogenic tankers across the country and allot 187 tankers to Delhi.” The Delhi government, which asked for 700 metric tonne (MT) per day, now says its requirement has gone up to 976 MT.Piyush Goyal, additional secretary in the home ministry, told the Supreme Court on Wednesday that the shortage of containers is the key problem and “production of oxygen is not a problem”, during a hearing on review petition by the Centre.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/aap-demands-187-cryogenic-tankers-101620257212290.html
06-05-2021||Delhi||Antivirals, oxygen biggest draw in Delhi's Covid black market||A flourishing black market of medicines and medical devices has come up ever since the ongoing Covid-19 wave has overburdened the health care system, leading to desperate calls for hospital beds, oxygen, antiviral injections, and devices such as oxygen concentrators, flowmeters, and pulse oximeters.In the last three weeks, the police have busted at least 75 cases and arrested more than 90 people who were either hoarding these items or selling them at exorbitant rates.An HT analysis of these cases shows that remdesivir is still the most sought-after medicine across the city, and it is being sold at anywhere between Rs.25,000-50,000 for a single vial while the original price is between Rs.899-3,490 depending on the brand. Investigating officials, who have arrested people for hoarding and selling the medicine, said that the relatives of many Covid patients are ready to pay any amount for it because it is hailed on social media as a “magic cure”.The demand for this antiviral drug is such that there have been at least three cases of nurses stealing it from hospitals to sell it at high prices.“On Tuesday, we arrested a contractual nurse from a prominent hospital in south Delhi. She had stolen the remdesivir injection vial from the hospital, forged the records to show that she had given it to patients, and later passed it on to her contacts to sell it. She does not have a record but was lured by greed. She and her gang were selling the medicine for ₹70,000 each,” said a senior police officer privy to the investigation. He added that they found enough buyers even at that price.The cases also show that most of the people arrested so far for such crimes are those connected to hospitals -- a doctor, security guards, nurses, lab technicians -- or are medical salespersons, chemists, and drivers who work for private ambulance and cab services. In their interrogation report, the motive, as mentioned by the police is usually the same -- “earn quick money.”One investigating officer, who asked not to be named, said that, barring a few, most of them do not have a previous criminal record but “wanted to earn quick money”.After remdesivir, other sought-after items sold in the black market for profit are oxygen cylinders, concentrators, and flowmeters.The cases show that both filled and empty cylinders are in high demand. Police have seized at least 220 cylinders, 225 concentrators, and 82 oxygen flow regulators.A police officer from the New Delhi district, who busted a case recently, said: “Oxygen concentrators are expensive. Not everyone can hoard in bulk, and sell it later. So, some people are trying to make profits quickly by selling small oxygen canisters. We arrested a medical supplier who was selling oxygen canisters for Rs.5,100 when the price of the canister as mentioned on the can was only Rs.400. That man had recently sold an oxygen concentrator for around Rs.1,25,000, more than twice its price.”At a time when several fraudsters have been found luring relatives of Covid-19 patients, police are calling numbers circulating in WhatsApp groups, or posing as decoy customers outside hospitals. In one such operation, a team from the New Friends Colony police station arrested two men on the road outside the Escorts and Holy Family hospitals.“The price of a 10-litre oxygen cylinder is around ₹6,000. These two men had bought a cylinder from their contact in Haryana for Rs.25,000, and planned to sell it for Rs.63,000. They were looking for needy people when we arrested them,” said an inspector who was part of the operation.And it isn’t just medicines or medical items. Ambulance drivers, too, have been caught overcharging people to transport Covid-19 patients or bodies. On Wednesday, police shared two cases in which a driver had charged ₹6,000 for a 5km ride to transport a Covid-19 patient between Deep Chand Bandhu hospital and Fortis Hospital, Shalimar Bagh.In another case, an ambulance driver charged Rs.20,000 for a 10km ride from Jaitpur to AIIMS. Police said these were ambulance cabs, and not those with life support systems.Deputy commissioner of police Chinmoy Biswal, who is also the police’s spokesperson, said in all police districts, teams have been assigned tasks to trace people who are taking advantage of the pandemic by hoarding items, selling them at higher prices, or cheating the people desperately looking for medical help.“Our teams are sending decoys and calling such people offering to sell medicines. Our teams are also posted outside hospitals. We will book them under stringent sections. We have registered at least 75 cases against at least 91 people. We are proactive, and will act sternly,” Biswal said.He said people can complain on the police helpline 011- 23469900||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/antivirals-oxygen-biggest-draw-in-delhi-s-covid-black-market-101620256467499.html
06-05-2021||Delhi||Delhiwale: When the grief is raw||She is young and living through intense grief in this season of collective loss. Protiti Bhattacharyya, 22, a history student in the University of Hyderabad, kindly agrees to share a glimpse of her current life. Connecting on WhatsApp video from her house in Delhi’s West Kidwai Nagar, she is sitting on the chair that belonged to her father.You lost your father and grandmother last month.Baba had Covid and had been on the ventilator for a few days. The news of his death came in the way of a solemn phone call from the doctor, one of his colleagues from the same hospital he worked in. Ma has respiratory issues and so does my elder sister who lives in Noida, so I saw it as my responsibility to do the needful. I only cried once, when I had to recognise him at the morgue. Thampu (grandmother), who had the symptoms but had tested negative, died in her sleep a few days later at home, which meant that this was a very intimate death as compared to how baba left. I went to the same cremation ground that I’d gone to for my father. While the staff hadn’t been too cooperative the last time (maybe because I was alone and more importantly, an unaccompanied woman), they were extremely empathetic the second time. I felt like I was a regular, familiar in the most grotesque of settings.How are you coping?I have people who have constantly checked up on me, friends who’ve sent me jars of peanut butter and tacos. All I want is to bury my head in someone’s chest and sob. Ma is diagnosed with Covid as well, which has made all of this tougher.How are your days?I’m addicted to my morning walk accompanied by my colony dogs and the morning phone call with my boyfriend. Sticking to yoga has helped me breathe better. I made bhindi ki subzi yesterday. Getting back to (online) classes has helped with structuring days better and also to take my mind off things. My professors, classmates, friends and didi have been my pillars of strength. Heartbreak does not cut it any more, my heart is severed and shattered in so many pieces that I don’t think I’ll ever be whole again.What are your hopes from the coming months?I hope we are all able to lead more meaningful lives, and I never want to take life and my time with someone for granted ever again.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhiwale-when-the-grief-is-raw-101620250820792.html
06-05-2021||Delhi||Delhi HC wants an oxygen distribution blueprint||The Delhi high court on Wednesday said it appears that the Delhi government was not taking enough steps to create a buffer stock of liquid medical oxygen (LMO) in the city, and asked the administration to take the help of IIT-Delhi and Delhi Technological University (DTU) to prepare a blueprint for its storage and distribution in the city.Wednesday’s observation and direction by the bench of justices Vipin Sanghi and Rekha Palli came after a lawyer, appearing for one of the petitioners -- in pleas by lawyer-petitioner Rakesh Malhotra and several hospitals seeking directions for better facilities and the continuous supply of oxygen -- said that large static cryogenic tanks for storing LMO were available, and could be installed to create a buffer of the life-saving medical essential.“We direct GNCTD (Government of the National Capital Territory of Delhi) to explore the possibility to get these tankers and create storage, this obligation is passed to both UOI (Union of India) and GNCTD. The Delhi government should consider taking help of IIT Delhi, Delhi Technological University (DTU) to prepare a blueprint of the supply and distribution infrastructure, LMOs and oxygen cylinders,” the bench said.“GNCTD needs to provide the necessary areas where tanks need to be installed and also for purpose of transport and infrastructure LMO and cylinder,” the bench said, adding that it was the obligation of both the Centre and the Delhi government to get the job done according to the Supreme Court’s directions of April 30.On April 30, the apex court directed the Centre to collaborate with all states to prepare a buffer stock of oxygen to be used for emergency purposes to ensure supply lines continue to function even in unforeseen circumstances.After this, on Tuesday, the high court directed the Union government to collaborate with the Delhi government to set up a buffer stock of 100 MT of LMO in Delhi, or for supply to the Capital and neighbouring areas. It said that steps for the creation of the buffer stock should be taken in three days.The lawyer who on Wednesday raised the issue of the cryogenic tanks, Aditya N Prasad, said that smaller tankers can pick up oxygen from the larger tanks and distribute it in the city. This, he said, would enable Delhi to not fall upon other states or the Centre for tankers to transport oxygen once buffer stock was created. He suggested that the tanks could be installed with the help of the army.The court noted that it was for the Delhi government to explore all the possibilities for creating storage facilities for oxygen, and asked it to identify the necessary areas where such tanks can be installed.Senior advocate Rahul Mehra, appearing for the Delhi government, told the court that in the last few days they have not got sufficient oxygen supply to make any storage possible, but hopefully things would become better in the coming days with the SC’s order of Wednesday directing the Centre to supply 700 MT oxygen every day. “We will work with the Centre, and we should be able to get it done,” he said.The Centre’s counsel, additional solicitor general (ASG) Chetan Sharma, told the court that the armed forces are already facilitating the transportation of the tankers, and their resources are stretched. He also said that it has been decided in principal not to set up field hospitals and bring the army in civil administration.To this, the court said, “Fair enough.” It asked the Centre to explore the possibility of using the civil and engineering wings of the army for assistance.The court also sought to know the rationale of a Delhi government order directing small nursing homes to treat patients only on the ground and first floors, and not on the top floors.Mehra said that this was a general direction for the fire safety norms.He claimed that in the garb of the pandemic, the nursing homes have been flouting norms and admitting more patients than their capacity.The court expressed surprise over the timing of the order. “Prior to the pandemic, they were taking patients and treating them on the top floor. You don’t ask them even as to how the operations are going on. This is a sword hanging on their (nursing homes) heads... At this time we are concerned only and only about patients,” the bench said.The bench also said that the foreign aid, particularly medical equipment, was meant for people suffering from Covid-19, and not meant to be kept in boxes at some institution to become “junk”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-hc-wants-an-oxygen-distribution-blueprint-101620249929483.html

06-05-2021||Chandigarh||Don’t take curbs lightly, Punjab likely to hit Covid peak next week, says Dr KK Talwar||Amid the raging second Covid-19 wave that has led to an unprecedented surge in fresh cases and fatalities, the spotlight is back on Punjab’s crumbling health infrastructure that looks grossly inadequate to take care of critically-ill patients. With people scrambling for oxygen and ICU beds and vaccination drive in disarray due to stocks running dry in many districts, Hindustan Times spoke to former PGI director KK Talwar, who heads the government’s expert group on Covid, about the current scenario and the way forward. Q: When are we expecting the state to hit the Covid peak? A: The situation is grim but I won’t say things are going out of hands like we are witnessing in many other states. If we follow this regulatory lockdown strictly for next 7-10 days, we can see the curve flattening. Next week is going to be crucial as the state is likely to hit the peak during this period. Q: There are concerns over increasing deaths in home isolation in villages. Why CFR is more in rural areas this time?A: The only reason behind high CFR is the reluctance for testing and taking Covid restrictions lightly. Initially, our testing rate was very poor in villages. High death rate can be attributed to the fact that the people are coming to the health facilities in the last stage of the infection. The key is to manage the virus in the initial 10 days. We have now changed some home isolation rules. Q: What is this new strategy for home isolation?A: We will be focusing more on home isolation patients and our experts would reach out to them thrice a day. Helplines have also been started at the sub-division level for such patients. We have also decided that in case the patient feels some problem in home isolation, he would be immediately shifted to a nearby health facility. Specials tab will be kept on patients with comorbidities. Q: Do you think continuous movement due to farmer agitation has made things worse in the hinterland? Have experts ever raised concern over such protests? A: I can only say that every gathering is a cause of concern for the spread, be it a farmer agitation, any other religious activity or even a marriage or a dinner party. I can’t comment why this movement has not stopped. That is not my domain. Q: Punjab’s vaccination drive appears to have hit hurdles. Initially people were reluctant and now the delay in supply for 18-plus age category has further affected it. In sharp comparison, our neighbour Haryana is far ahead of us? A: The shift in strategy for the availability of the vaccine by the central government has hit our drive. We expect supplies to get better in the coming days. For 18-plus category, 30 lakh doses are likely to arrive in the second fortnight of this month. Every state has its own share of challenges when such big drives are launched. Q: There have been allegations from different quarters that Punjab failed to tackle the crisis. What have been state’s challenges? A: Let me tell you, Punjab has done much better with the kind of health infrastructure we had a year ago. Our testing has been remarkably high, with focus on tracking the virus. In April, we were testing around 40,000 samples a day, now we are testing 60,000. That is also the reason in an increase in caseload as we are detecting more. And let’s not forget, Punjab is providing treatment to patients from other states also. A chunk of patients are coming to Punjab for treatment. We have been keeping a close eye on mutations and Punjab was the first state to raise alarm over UK variant and give evidence that this variant was affecting young people. Q: There are reports about the exponential rise in patients needing O2 in past few days? Do you apprehend a crisis in the making? A: Oxygen is a key component in Covid management. So, when the caseload goes up, the demand for O2 also increases. The chief Minister has been raising concern over it time and again. Authorities are also trying to get the allotment in best possible short time. At the expert level, we have taken some steps for the best management of the stock available with us.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/dont-take-curbs-lightly-punjab-likely-to-hit-covid-peak-next-week-says-dr-kk-talwar-101620246099567.html
06-05-2021||Chandigarh||NIA court grants bail to 8 accused in comrade Sandhu murder case||The special National Investigation Agency (NIA) court at Mohali has granted bail to eight accused arrested in connection with the killing of Shaurya Chakra awardee comrade Balwinder Singh Sandhu as charge-sheet was not presented against them within the stipulated 180 days. Sandhu, who was conferred with the bravery award for fighting terrorism in Punjab, was gunned down by two bike-borne men at his home in Bhikhiwind town of Tarn Taran district on October 16, 2020. Seven of the accused—identified as Chand Kumar aka Bhatia (32), Rajbir Singh aka Raja (29), Rakesh Kumar aka (29), Manpreet Singh aka Manni (23), Jobanjeet Singh aka Joban (22), Kirpal Singh (28) and Sunny (23)—were granted bail on Tuesday while the eighth accused, Ravinder Singh alias Gian (26), was given the bail on April 30. The counsel of the accused, Jaspal Singh Manjpur said, “Raja, Kirpal and Gian have other cases pending against them while the other five will be released soon as their surety bonds have been furnished.” Gian, who is an accused in Nabha jailbreak episode, was termed as the key accused in the case by Tarn Taran police. The NIA has also submitted in the court that five of the eight accused—Raja, Manni, Joban, Kirpal and Sunny—“have not been arrayed as accused in the final report under section 173 of the CrPC and closure report has been filed against them”. Manjhpur said, “I had argued in the court that if the closure report was filed why these accused were not released.” All the eight accused, who have got the bail, were arrested by the Punjab Police. In total 23 accused were arrested for Sandhu’s killing. A case under Sections 120B (conspiracy), 201 (disappearance of evidence), 212 (harbouring offender) and 302 (murder) of the IPC and Sections 25 (1B) and 27 of the Arms Act, and Sections of the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA) was registered against the accused at Bhikhiwind police station in Tarn Taran. Earlier, Tarn Taran police had got an extension from 90 days to 180 days for filing a charge sheet against the accused. The NIA had taken over the case from Tarn Taran police on January 26. Earlier, on April 27, the NIA had filed a charge sheet against eight other accused, allegedly connected to Pakistan-based proscribed terrorist organisation Khalistan Liberation Force (KLF), for killing Sandhu. Gangster Sukhmeet Pal Singh alias Sukh Bhikhariwal was among these eight accused.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/nia-court-grants-bail-to-8-accused-in-comrade-sandhu-murder-case-101620245739571.html
06-05-2021||Chandigarh||Centre okays museum dedicated to Guru Nanak in Sultanpur Lodhi||The Centre has granted ‘in principle’ approval to Punjab government for setting up a museum named ‘Pind Babe Nanak Da’ at Sultanpur Lodhi. The Punjab government has floated tenders to hire a consultancy firm for the design of the museum. The museum will be a replica of Rai-Bhoi-Di-Talwandi, the village where Guru Nanak Dev was born (now in Pakistan). Former IAS officer, Shiv Dullar Singh Dhillon who is supervising the project, confirmed the development, adding once the design is finalised, the cost and deadline for the project will be evaluated. “We have yet to receive the final bids as the tendering process is still open,” said Dhillon, adding the approval from the Centre came in April. “The sub-divisional magistrate of Sultanpur Lodhi has been directed to start the land acquisition process for the museum,” an official said. Sultanpur Lodhi SDM Charumita said 40 acres were identified in Macchijova and Taraf Hazi villages for acquisition and negotiations with the owners were underway. The Punjab government set up a seven-member committee in August 2020 to finalise a concept note on setting up a ‘Pind Babe Nanak Da’ heritage museum at Sultanpur Lodhi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/centre-okays-museum-dedicated-to-guru-nanak-in-sultanpur-lodhi-101620245261086.html

06-05-2021||Chandigarh||Himachal’s Covid fatality rate surpasses national average||With the deadly second wave of the coronavirus pandemic raging across the nation, Himachal Pradesh’s fatality rate has surpassed the national average even as shortage of oxygen cylinders continues to plague the state government. The hill state’s Covid fatality rate has increased to 1.5% against the national average of 1.1%. So far, 1,647 people in the state have died due to complications caused by the virus. Of the total fatalities, 1,057 (64.1%) were male and 590 (35.9%) female. As many as 1,062 victims (64.5%) had comorbidities — 50% (532) had diabetes mellitus, 44.8% (476) had hypertension, 10.7%(113) had chronic kidney disease, 8% (87) had chronic obstructive pulmonary disease — while 585 (35.5%) of the Covid victims were non comorbid. The mean age of deceased people was 63.2%.The state’s recovery rate is also low as compared to the national and global average. At 78.1%, Himachal’s recovery rate is below the national average of 81.9% and global average of 85.4%. Chief minister Jai Ram Thakur on Wednesday convened a meeting with the Opposition to discuss the Covid situation in the state. At present, the state is facing a shortage of empty oxygen cylinders and has a limited stock of Remdesivir. Around 2,000 Remdesivir injections are available at the health headquarters in Shimla while only 750 are in stock in different hospitals. All-party meetingThe meeting was attended by leader of opposition Mukesh Agnihotri, senior Congress leader Asha Kumari , Vidhan Sabha speaker Vipin Singh Parmar and lone Communist Party of India legislator Rakesh Singha. Thakur apprised the opposition of all the steps being taken by the government but admitted the government is yet to receive the oxygen cylinders it had demanded from the Centre. “The state’s current oxygen production capacity is 53 MT, which includes 15 MT state quota from INOX, Solan. Himachal has urged the Union government to increase the state quota to 30 MT,” said Thakur. At present, oxygen cylinders can be replenished at nine places while Pressure Swing Adsorption (PSA) Medical Oxygen Generation Plants have been commissioned at Deen Dayal Upadhyay Hospital, Shimla; zonal hospital, Dharamshala and Shri Lal Bahadur Shastri Government Medical College, Ner Chowk, the CM said, adding that an additional six oxygen plants will come up at the civil hospital, Palampur, zonal hospital, Mandi, civil hospitals in Rohru and Khaneri in Shimla district, Dr YS Parmar Government Medical College, Nahan and regional hospital, Solan. Limited stock of Remdesivir: Oppn “We questioned the government over the availability of Remdesivir injections in the state, the stock is very limited,” senior Congress legislator Asha Kumari, said adding that oxygen from Chamba had to be brought to Mandi for refilling, which was a nine-hour one-way commute. Agnihotri expressed concern over the sharp spike in Covid cases, fatalities and the delay in getting Covid test reports. “People in Shimla are not getting their reports for five to six days. By the time report arrives, the patients’ condition worsens or he transmits the virus,” he said. Senior Congress leader Col (Dr) Dhani Ram Shandil highlighted the need to deploy additional ambulances for transportation of Covid patients. Singha said all critically ill Covid patients should be shifted from home isolation to hospitals and asked the state to augment beds at Tanda Medical College. In the all-party meeting, it was decided that all legislators will donate a month’s salary of towards the chief minister’s Covid fund.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/himachals-covid-fatality-rate-surpasses-national-average-101620244899480.html

Samba district was also brought under lockdown from Wednesday evening.Around 49,000 people above 45 years of age and 5,982 in the age group of 18-44 were vaccinated in J&K on Wednesday, the officials said. Over 25 lakh people have been vaccinated in the UT so far. 24x7 oxygen war room started in Jammu The industries and commerce department on Wednesday established a 24x7 oxygen war room (control room) at Udhyog Bhawan, Rail Head Complex, Jammu, to monitor and manage the supply and distribution of oxygen within the Jammu division.Madhur Anand has been nominated as the nodal officer for the control room and the public can contact him on phone numbers 9469593931 and 9469593933 in case of emergency.The war room will be in constant touch with the consumers and suppliers of oxygen and will take immediate necessary steps, whenever needed.The order issued by Anu Malhotra, director, industries and commerce department, however, did not mention if NGOs and volunteer groups are permitted to fill oxygen cylinders.Routine surgeries deferred in Jammu division hospitals The J&K administration on Wednesday ordered to defer routine/elective surgeries at all government and private health institutions of Jammu division for their optimal utilisation amid the surge in Covid-19 cases.Issued by divisional commissioner Raghav Langer, the order, however, said emergency services and critical care required for co-morbid and dialysis patients, and maternal and child health services would continue as usual.“In view of the prevailing situation of Covid-19 pandemic in Jammu division demands optimal utilisation of available resources so that the existing infrastructure/healthcare facilities are not overburdened, the elective/routine surgeries are required to be deferred,” the order read.Langar said the main focus of the healthcare system at this juncture was the management of virus cases. “All elective/routine surgeries shall be deferred in government as well as private health institutions in the division; unless there are pressing medical reasons and the benefits of such procedure outweigh the risk related to Covid situation and its fallout,” the order said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/jk-sees-record-single-day-rise-of-4-716-cases-52-deaths-101620244784116.html
06-05-2021||Other||Covid surge: ICU beds filling fast at major Srinagar hospitals||With the continued surge in Covid-19 cases in Jammu and Kashmir, the tertiary-care hospitals in Srinagar are fast running out of dedicated intensive care unit (ICU) beds.For the past one week, four districts — Srinagar, Budgam, Baramulla and Kupwara — that are experiencing major spike in virus cases and deaths, have been under lockdown, which is likely to be extended if the situation does not improve.“The lockdown may be extended with stricter curbs for some days as the cases are still rising, especially in Srinagar,” a senior government official said.On Tuesday, the UT witnessed the highest number of positive cases since the pandemic outbreak in March 2020, with Srinagar recording the most (1,311) cases, followed by Jammu with 598 cases.“Beds are filling fast at SMHS and Chest Diseases hospitals, which come under the Government Medical College (GMC), Srinagar. There is a medical emergency-like situation,” said GMC nodal officer Dr Salim Khan.Another senior GMC doctor, Salim Iqbal said that the UT is seeing over 4,000 daily cases, and this figure is more than that of some nations. “This is quite disturbing, and I pray that we all adhere to preventive measures before we see a disastrous situation.”Notwithstanding the ground situation, the J&K administration’s daily Covid bulletin paints a rosy picture of bed occupancy at its dedicated hospitals.As per the bulletin, till Tuesday evening, of total 116 ICU beds, 77 were vacant in Kashmir, while in Jammu, of 234 ICU beds, 103 were unoccupied. Of the 3,591 isolation beds in J&K, 1,565 were still vacant, the bulletin stated.However, doctors say they are struggling with ICU bed availability. “Our Covid hospital at indoor stadium is now full. We have even spared a whole ward in the hospital for sick patients,” said a senior medico at Government Medical College, Baramulla, which does not have a single high-flow oxygen bed despite patients’ attendants having flagged the issue several times.With this, the attendants are seeking help on the social media.“My mother is admitted at SMHS. I’m in need of oxygen cylinder flow meter. Kindly do the needful,” wrote an attendant on Twitter. There are similar SoS messages on the social media. Even former J&K chief minister Omar Abdullah highlighted such messages on his Twitter account.Srinagar deputy commissioner Ajaz Asad, however, has asked people not to decide the treatment plan for patients themselves.“Someone called me at 12.45am yesterday requesting for ICU bed. I woke up the medical superintendent of the hospital. He woke up the doctor who replied: Patient is stable on high-flow oxygen and doesn’t require a ventilator. Please don’t decide the treatment yourself. Let’s go by advice of doctors strictly,” the DC tweeted.At Sher-i-Kashmir Institute of Medical Sciences (SKIMS), which is one of the biggest hospitals treating Covid patients in the valley, 284 patients are admitted, while the tertiary care facility had earmarked only 260 beds for patients. “If there is no shortage of beds, then why are people highlighting issues on social media? Either people are lying or government officials are,” said Adil Ahmad, a social activist.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/covid-surge-icu-beds-filling-fast-at-major-srinagar-hospitals-101620244779808.html

In a statement, former minister Daljit Singh Cheema said media reports had exposed the state government’s claims. He said it was shocking to know that except for five districts of Patiala, Faridkot, Amritsar, Jalandhar and Ludhiana, no government hospital in the state provides level-3 care to critically ill patients. The SAD leader asked the CM to get the ventilators lying unused in the state installed. “Medical staff should be recruited on emergency basis to run the ventilators,” he said. Amarinder failed to manage Covid crisis: BJP Punjab BJP president Ashwani Sharma said the Capt Amarinder Singh government has failed to measure up to the grave situation that has gripped the state. “The CM seems more worried about his chair in the face of loud dissidence in the party than to focus on managing Covid crisis in the state,” Sharma said. The CM has been hiding his failures by blaming the Centre, even as the Union government has provided assistance of more than worth ₹1,000 crore to the state to fight the pandemic, the BJP leader said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/state-govt-s-medical-infra-upgrade-claim-falls-flat-sad-101620244479429.html

In a letter to her, Manpreet said he is writing on the GST issue when the country is in the middle of battling the new Covid wave, which is more devastating in many ways than the one before. “There has been no meeting of the GST Council for the last six months even though Council’s own rules drafted in terms of Article 279A of the Constitution provide holding at least one meeting every quarter,” he wrote on Tuesday. His four-page letter was released on social media by Congress leader Jairam Ramesh. The Congress leader said the GST revenues constitute nearly 50% of the tax revenues of the states, while this percentage for the Centre is nearly half of that. “States have a voting share of 75% in the GST Council. However, failure to hold any constructive consultation with states for so long in such critical times makes me wonder whether Centre has usurped all the powers of states putting the spirit of cooperative federalism – that formed the very foundation of achieving consensus on the epic reform – on the backburner,” he charged. Badal said some issues that require urgent discussion in the context of Covid are whether GST should be exempted on hand sanitizers, face masks, gloves, PPE kits, temperature check equipment, oximeters, ventilators and the like and cut in interest rates under GST law. “How do we provide relief to sectors most impacted by Covid such as MSMEs, aviation, hotels, entertainment, commercial realty, retail? Whether an amnesty scheme is needed to condone delays in payment of taxes during Covid period?” he asked. He also said that with oversight given a go-by, the harassment of taxpayers had taken an entirely new dimension with officers resorting to threats of arrest, provisional attachment of productive assets and freezing of bank accounts with any establishment norms.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/manpreet-seeks-gst-council-meeting-101620244180250.html

The DGP, while disclosing data from May 2-4, said Punjab Police had registered around 560 FIRs against those found flouting the guidelines, including owners of prominent hotels, marriage palaces, restaurants, shops etc. The DGP said besides issuing fines, police have taken over 66,000 face mask violators to undergo RT-PCR testing under the drive to enforce Covid-19 appropriate behaviour. Since the special drive was started from March 19, 2021, the Punjab Police have persuaded over 6.9 lakh people to undergo Covid-19 testing, besides penalising over 1 lakh people across the state for not wearing face masks, he added. A spokesperson said Tarn Taran Police have booked owners of restaurant Arabian Kebab and Master Burger for defying night curfew timings, besides booking a petrol pump owner, when most of his employees were found without a mask. The DGP exhorted the public to comply with restrictions, which were similar to those laid down in 15 other states.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/629-arrested-for-covid-norm-violations-in-three-days-in-punjab-101620244179133.html
06-05-2021||Chandigarh||Montek panel to study impact of 2nd Covid wave before submitting report to Punjab govt||An expert panel headed by former deputy chairman of Planning Commission Montek Singh Ahluwalia, which was to suggest Punjab’s post-Covid revival strategy by March 31, has decided to study the second wave of the coronavirus pandemic and its impact on the state before submitting its final report. The panel, which includes leading experts on economy, agriculture and industry, has informed the state government that it would submit the report by June-end. “We are in the middle of a second Covid-19 wave. It will be more useful if we see what is happening and the impact it is having on the state and then submit our report rather than giving a report at this point,” Ahluwalia told HT, expressing concern over the infection spread. Another committee member, who did not want to be named, also endorsed Ahluwalia’s view, stating that the second wave has been more devastating in terms of the virus spread and loss of lives and has also hit various segments of industry before these could fully recover from the setback suffered last year. The 22-member committee, which was set up by the Amarinder Singh government in April last year and submitted its interim report in three months, was to give its final report on December 31, 2020, but was later allowed time till March 31. The state assembly elections are just eight months away.Punjab has been seen a sharp surge in Covid-19 cases during the second wave, reporting its highest single-day count in infections and fatalities on Tuesday with 7,601 persons testing positive and 173 deaths. In the past one month alone, more than 1.48 lakh fresh cases and 2,562 deaths have been recorded, forcing an alarmed state government to shut down all shops selling non-essential goods, malls, cinema halls, educational institutions, etc till May 15. The “soft lockdown” has started the exodus of migrant workers, particularly those working in unorganised sector, from Ludhiana, Amritsar and major cities even as the industry was limping back to normalcy after the coronavirus-induced curfew and restrictions for months last year. These restrictions would take a toll on hospitality, transport, tourism, real estate and automobile sectors, besides micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs), according to industry watchers. The expert panels’ interim report had drawn sharp reactions with regard to the recommendations made on agriculture, which the state government turned down subsequently. The report titled “Medium and Long Term Post-Covid Economic Strategy for Punjab – A Multi-Sectoral Approach to Building Resilience and Recovery” had advocated opening up of agriculture markets beyond state-run mandis where were “restrictive” and had “high license fees”, and other agriculture reforms similar to those incorporated by the central government in the three farms laws that are being opposed by farmers in the state. Besides new rules and amendments related to levy of market fees, commission fees, licensing for agriculture marketing to make the state competitive, the committee had also suggested leasing of agriculture land for a bigger role for private sector and disapproved of the free power policy for its financial and environmental consequences.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/montek-panel-to-study-impact-of-2nd-covid-wave-before-submitting-report-to-punjab-govt-101620243939438.html
06-05-2021||Chandigarh||89% intensive care beds in Punjab’s govt hospitals full||Amid the unprecedented surge in Covid-19 infections in the state, the second wave of the virus has pushed the state’s health care infrastructure near to its saturation point. Covid patients, especially those needing oxygen and ventilator support (Level-3), across the state are scurrying for beds. The state health department has reserved 2,400 intensive care unit (ICU) beds (with or without ventilators), for critical patients in government and private hospitals of the state.”Of the 2,400 beds, 826 ICU beds are in government hospitals, including GMC Amritsar, GMC Patiala and GMC Faridkot, of which 733 (89%) are occupied,” said Dr Rajesh Bhaskar, state nodal officer for Covid-19, adding that they are planning to increase the Level-3 beds in the state. The occupancy varies from facility to facility as 92% ICU beds at Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH), Amritsar, are occupied while Rajindra Hospital in Patiala has overrun its capacity and authorities there were treating critical patients more than the dedicated beds at their disposal. There are 12 ICU beds at the Punjab Institute of Medical Sciences (PIMS), Jalandhar, of which only three were available. Sixteen ICU beds at the government hospitals in Ludhiana, in addition to 14 ventilators supplied by the government to Christian Medical College and Hospital (CMC), all are occupied. 92% occupancy at GMCH Amritsar Government Medical College and Hospital, Amritsar, is the only government-run hospital in the Majha region comprising four districts Amritsar, Tarn Taran, Gurdaspur and Pathankot, offering treatment to critical Covid patients requiring intensive care (Level-3). Of the 250 Level-3 beds reserved for the Covid-19 patients at the facility, 229 (92%) were occupied (till 4 pm on Wednesday) with patients coming from at least 10 districts of Punjab. The hospital has 87 ventilators reserved for Covid-19 patients, of which 40 were occupied. As per the health officials, two ventilators at Gurdaspur government hospital and three at Tarn Taran are lying non-operational due to staff shortage. Amritsar GMCH medical superintendent Dr KD Singh said, “At present, 92% of ICU beds are occupied as the demand for oxygen beds has drastically increased in the recent days amid oxygen shortage. We have proposed to increase 50 more ICU beds in the hospital, keeping in view the rising caseload in the region. Beds can be increased but meeting oxygen requirement is a big task.” In all, Amritsar district has 526 Level-3 beds (government and private) reserved for the Covid-19 patients but people prefer a government facility as private hospitals’ charges are high. Three-fold jump in critical patients at Faridkot hospital in a week At Guru Gobind Singh Medical College, Faridkot, the number of critical patients saw a three-fold jump in the last one week, and now it has 73% of the beds occupied. Of the 272 Level-3 beds, the hospital has 200 critical Covid-19 patients from Bathinda, Mansa, Muktsar, Moga, Ferozepur, Fazilka and Faridkot districts. There were only 65 critical patients undergoing treatment at the hospital till last week, officials said. The hospital has 82 ventilators reserved for the Covid patients. Dr Shilekh Mittal, medical superintendent GGSMCH, said the number of patients has witnessed a sudden increase in the last one week and most of them are critical. “Right now, out of 272 Level-3 beds, 200 are occupied. Even patients from outside the south Malwa region are undergoing treatment at the hospital,” he added. At the recently started 10 bed Level-3 Covid care facility at All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), 50% beds are occupied. In Bathinda, AIIMS is the only government institute equipped with ventilators. Patiala hospital has overrun its capacity The Government Rajindra Hospital 200 ICU beds and is providing medical assistance to 228 critical Covid patients by making temporary arrangements. Hospital’s medical superintendent Dr HS Rekhi said of total Level-3 beds, 150 are dedicated for Covid patients and all of them are occupied. “All the beds in Covid ICUs are occupied as we are receiving critical patients from other districts and states,” said Dr Rekhi. The Patiala district also has eight Level-3 beds at the military hospital, of which six are occupied.

06-05-2021||Mumbai||Maratha quota scrapped: We are not averse to need-based reservation, says lawyer||“We are not against Maratha or any other community for that matter. We are opposed to the very idea of caste-based reservation,” said Sanjeet Rammilan Shukla, lawyer and activist who has played an important role in the successful challenge to Maharashtra government’s decision to provide 16% reservation for Maratha community in public employment and education. “We are not averse to need-based reservation for economically backward sections of the society, for the ground reality is that majority of those in actual need of social support are still out of the mainstream because even education is beyond their reach,” he clarified.The 36-year-old represents a non-profit organisation, Youth for Equality Foundation, a body of educated like-minded professionals opposed to the idea of caste-based reservation. The organisation, having pan-India presence, was formed in 2006, immediately after the Mandal Commission controversy after the reservation in public employment and education nearly doubled, from 26% to 50%.In 2014, advocate Shukla petitioned the Bombay high court (HC) as a representative of the non-profit organisation when the state government came up with June 25, 2014 decision to provide reservation to the Maratha community. He fought the legal battle with other petitioners, resulting in the HC staying the decision on November 14, 2014.He again approached the HC after the then BJP-led government in Maharashtra came out with a new legislation to ride over the HC stay order and introduce the same decision to extend the benefit of reservation to Maratha community. This time, HC held the reservation law constitutionally valid, prompting petitioners like the lawyer-activist to move the Supreme Court.Shukla said that in the earlier round the state government had relied on the Narayan Rane committee report on social status of Maratha community in Maharashtra to provide the reservation. In the second round, it was the report of justice (retired) MG Gaikwad committee which provided the much-needed support to the second legislation. With regards to the legal battle before the Supreme Court, he said, “Apart from the legal aspects of breach of limit of 50% reservation in Maharashtra, we also pointed out that sample survey data placed before the Gaikwad Committee was not only grossly inadequate — barely 10% of what Range Committee took in to consideration — but was also obtained with the aid of tweaked format of the sample survey questionnaire required to be used for social surveys.” Besides, he said, the petitioners also pointed out that Maratha community was appropriately represented in public employment, and therefore there was no need to provide reservation to the community.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maratha-quota-scrapped-we-are-not-averse-to-need-based-reservation-says-lawyer-101620243638484.html
06-05-2021||Mumbai||SC strikes down Maratha quota: MVA’s setback, Opposition’s advantage||The striking down of the quota for the Maratha community in Maharashtra could be a major setback for the Uddhav Thackeray-led Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi government. Opposition Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which has blamed the MVA government for failing to secure the reservation provided by the former government, could use the unrest in the community against the ruling coalition, say political experts. Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray will be writing a letter to President Ram Nath Kovind and Prime Minister Narendra Modi requesting them to take a decision on Maratha reservation. “I am requesting the Prime Minister and President to take a decision on Maratha reservation as the Supreme Court has also acknowledged that it comes under their authority. Tomorrow, I will be writing a letter to them on the same and also ready to meet them, if required,” Thackeray said in his address on social media platforms on Wednesday evening. Taking serious cognizance of the issue, the chief minister decided to address the state especially the Maratha community and requested them to exercise peace and restraint as the state is in the midst of a pandemic and the state is fighting in their support. He asked them not to get provoked as some forces may try to take advantage of the situation. “The SC verdict is disappointing as it has said that the state doesn’t have powers to give reservation… But it has also shown us a way by saying that the Centre and President has powers to grant reservation to a community. I am sure that the PM or the Centre will not disrespect this demand as it is not of just a community but of entire Maharashtra,” he pointed out. The community Marathas, who make up nearly 30-32% of the state population, including Kunbi-Marathas, who come under the other backward class (OBC), are a strong force in the state both politically and socially. The community has a strong presence in agriculture, rural economy, cooperative sector (sugar, bank and milk cooperative units) as well as state bureaucracy. The community has a decisive influence on nearly 75 of the 288 constituencies. The Marathas traditionally rallied with the Congress-NCP, but that changed in the 2014 Assembly polls. The BJP and Sena dominated the western and central Maharashtra (which has strong presence of Marathas) even though they contested separately. It is assumed that in 2019 Assembly elections, the community helped the NCP bounce back as the party won a majority of its 56 assembly seats in western Maharashtra and adjoining areas that are politically dominated by Marathas. The party could also capitalise on ‘Maratha community pride’ after Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar, currently the most prominent Maratha politician, was targeted by the then BJP-led state government and its leaders. The Congress too has been dominated by Maratha community leaders for decades. The community strongly supported the party. The Shiv Sena has a mix voter base, including the Marathas. Following the Kopardi rape incident (see box), the Maratha mobilisation took place and the reservation issue was put forth strongly by the community. Subsequently, the community stages over 50 marches, first silent and later violent ones, to get quota for the community. Towards the 2019 Assembly polls, many Maratha leaders from Congress-NCP switched to greener pastures of the BJP. However, the NCP-Congress turned the tables in 2019 by winning over 30 from the 58 Assembly seats in Western Maharashtra. The three parties now face the risk of losing some of this support base, if they fail to find a solution to retain the quota granted by Fadnavis government to the community. The blame game State minister Ashok Chavan, who heads the cabinet sub-committee on Maratha reservation, said that then chief minister Devendra Fadnavis misled the people on quota issues by passing it without due right. He said that Solicitor General of India had clearly told the SC that the state’s right to provide quota had not been taken away. “While setting the reservation aside, the apex court has opined that the states have no right to pass such law for reservation in the wake of the 102th constitutional amendment and the powers have been given to the Centre. The Socially and Educationally Backward Classes (SEBC) Act, 2018, was enacted in state legislature in November 2018 by then Fadnavis government, after the 102th Constitutional amendment in August that year. The state BJP leaders have been trying to put blame on us, but they have misguided the people of Maharashtra by keeping a faultline in the constitution of the Act,” Chavan said. Chavan said as the powers to give reservation to any community lie with the Centre, the MVA will send the proposal to National Commission for Backward Classes to give reservation to Marathas in “exceptional and extraordinary circumstances”. Fadnavis and other BJP leaders held the MVA government responsible for quashing of the reservation. Fadnavis said the state government under Uddhav Thackeray could not even effectively plead the case in the Apex court. “The Maratha quota law was enacted by our government taking Uddhav Thackeray into confidence as the Shiv Sena was part of our government then. When it was challenged in the Bombay high court and the Supreme Court, our government effectively pleaded the case. As a result, the high court upheld the reservation, while the SC had denied a stay on it. Later, during the MVA government regime, the case was referred to another bench where it was stayed. The Solicitor General of India had clearly told the SC that states’ right to provide quota had not been taken away,” Fadnavis said. Fadnavis said the MVA government failed to convince the court about the sanctity of the Gaikwad report and as a result of it the reservation was struck down, when reservations in other states were intact. Political repercussions Political analysts and observers said the BJP will use it to its advantage to corner the MVA politically. Pratap Asbe, a political analyst, said, “The Bill and subsequent law were passed during their government, but still they will make the argument emotional to fire up the Maratha youths. Whether there is any major election or not, the unrest will be engineered. We have seen what happens when a community as powerful as Marathas comes on the streets.” Another analyst Surendra Jondhale said that although the BJP enjoys support of many Maratha leaders, unlike before 2014, it needs to be seen if the Maratha youths come under their influence. “The BJP will attempt to mobilise the Marathas and make an issue out of it. Fadnavis has played an ambiguous role in the quota issue. Interestingly, [BJP MP] Sambhaji Maharaj has taken a stand that both governments pursued the matter and he accepted the verdict. The response of Maratha youths to the BJP will be important now,” Jondhale, who was a former professor of political science at the Mumbai University. According to a Congress leader, the SC verdict may have long-standing political repercussions. “The BJP has been painting a picture that they had given the reservation to the community, but the three-party government could not safeguard it. It is now very difficult to regain it by filing a review petition and next to impossible to include them in other backward classes. The conclusion is the reservation was struck down, when the parties with strong Maratha base are at helm of affairs. The effect may be felt in the upcoming local body elections,” said a senior Congress leader requesting anonymity. Political analyst Hemant Desai said that the three ruling parties may have to face a setback if they do not handle the issue smartly. “All three ruling parties enjoy political support of the community and may not afford to lose it. Poor people in the community are upset with their leaders for the suppression for years,” he said. Balasaheb Sarate Patil, a Maratha leader involved in the legal battle, said the BJP may not get advantage of the decision. “The Act which has been quashed was enacted by the Fadnavis government and even the Gaikwad commission report was submitted during his government. So the BJP cannot just blame the ruling parties,” he said. Political analyst Prakash Bal said, “The political impact depends on how the perception is created by both the sides. The reservation given to the Marathas was never tenable and this was said by Justice PB Sawant who was member of the bench that delivered the Indra Sawhney case judgment. The politics of allegations and counter allegations will continue and is likely to be utilised as an election issue in the future.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/sc-strikes-down-maratha-quota-mva-s-setback-opposition-s-advantage-101620243579577.html

06-05-2021||Other||SC notice to Sodhi family over Punjab’s plea for land compensation||Gagandeep@htlive.comJalandhar The Supreme Court has issued notice to Punjab sports minister Rana Gurmit Singh Sodhi and others in a land acquisition matter in which the state public works department (PWD), in December 2020, had filed a recovery suit against Sodhi and family. The Punjab government had sought review of the SC order of 2019, granting relief to the Sodhi family. On May 3, the SC bench of justice Uday Umesh Lalit and justice Dinesh Maheshwari heard the review petition and issued the notice. HT has been following the matter closely. In 2014, the Sodhi family received a compensation of ₹1.8 crore against land acquired by the state government for a road project, after they had moved court. In 2015, a Ferozepur court said, on a plea from Sodhi, that they were entitled to re-determine the compensation of the acquired land in 2012, as per the new land acquisition Act, which came into force in 2014. In 2017, the Punjab and Haryana high court upheld the district court order, which was subsequently upheld by the Supreme Court in 2019. The SC order states that there was a delay of 544 days in filing the review petition. The order adds the application seeking condonation of delay states inter alia that the land in question were subject matter of acquisition initiated in 1962, which attained finality, and compensation was paid to claimants. “Issue notice on the application for condonation of delay as well as on the review petitions, returnable on July 16, 2021, and let these review petitions be listed in open court,” the order added. In December 2020, the PWD had filed a recovery suit against minister Sodhi, alias Guru Gurmeet Singh, and his family members — brother Guru Hardeep Singh and nephews, Prabhjot Singh and Jasdeep Singh — in a Guru Har Sahai court for allegedly pocketing double compensation for the land in question. One Joginder Singh was also named in the plea. The department has also made Guru Har Sahai SDM a respondent. The land at Mohanki Attar village had been acquired for the Ferozepur-Fazilka-Guru Har Sahai road. The family received ₹1.8 crore compensation in 2013 for the land after re-acquisition in 2012, which, as per record, had also been acquired in 1962 for ₹7,384. The land comprised 55 kanal and 6 marla belonging to Sodhi and 38 kanal of his nephew Jasdeep Sodhi (son of Hardeep Singh). In March 2020, a Punjab government sub-committee found that the Sodhi family had got double compensation. In February 2021, the Punjab and Haryana high court had also stayed the disbursement of re-determined compensation. The court was hearing a letter patents appeal (LPA) filed by Punjab government challenging the single bench order in the contempt petition filed by the minister’s brother Guru Hardeep Singh in 2018. Hardeep had pleaded for implementation of the order of the Ferozepur additional district and sessions court to give re-determined compensation to the family under the new land acquisition law.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/scnotice-to-sodhi-family-over-punjab-s-plea-for-land-compensation-101620243519963.html
06-05-2021||Mumbai||Maratha quota scrapped: Fight for merit prevails, say students, parents||The Supreme Court’s (SC) decision to quash reservations for students from Maratha community in educational institutes has been hailed by students seeking admissions to professional courses and their parents. Dr Uday Dhoble, one of the petitioners in the case that was heard in the Apex court, said, “Along with other parents of medical aspirants, we had filed a case challenging the government rule of reservations exceeding 50%. We have nothing against the Marathas. Our contention was that if more than 50% seats are reserved, open category students will be forced to be admitted in private and deemed universities. The biggest impact of the reservations was on medical students.”“It’s a winning moment for all of us in open category. Finally merit prevails. The fight that we at Team Mumbai began at the Bombay high court (HC) in December of 2018 finally succeeded at the Supreme Court (SC) today. We are not against any caste or religion, but are against reservation going beyond 50%. Let everyone get it on economic grounds within the stipulated 50%,” said education activist and parent Sudha Shenoy, who is a part of Save Merit, Save Nation group. Shenoy is a part of a group of medical aspirants and parents protesting the 12% reservation of seats for Maratha category students. Those seeking admission to other professional courses, too, have been against the Maratha reservations. They had filed public interest litigations challenging the Maratha reservation in HC and SC. In September last year, SC had stayed all recruitment and admissions in education institutes under the socially and economically backward classes (SEBC) quota for the 2020-21 academic year, with exception to postgraduate medical admissions. On September 21, Maharastra government had filed a petition in the Apex court to vacate the stay on admissions. The court, however, had adjourned the hearing by four weeks. On November 24, the state released a government resolution clarifying that all admissions, for that time being, would be conducted without the inclusion of the quota, until there’s clarity from SC on the matter. In line with SC’s interim stay on the Maratha quota in jobs and education, the state education department had stayed the admission process for first-year junior college (FYJC) in September 2020. Admissions under the Socially and Educationally Backward Class (SEBC) quota were conducted in the first round, but the remaining rounds took place without the reservation after the state government decided to do so. The overall demand for seats under the quota was low as only 20% seats had takers. This confusion over SEBC quota had led to an unprecedented delay last year in admissions to junior colleges as well as professional courses such as medical, law, management, architecture and engineering. With SC now quashing the reservations and providing clarity, students hope that the admission process is streamlined this year. “Now that there’s no confusion over the quota, the state common entrance test (CET) cell can conduct the admission process as per schedule,” said a law aspirant on the condition of anonymity. However, CET cell officials said they will wait for directions from the state government before they can act on the reservations issue. “We are aware of the SC decision. However, CET cell is an executing body. We will wait for directions from the state government on how to hold admissions and what reservations to apply,” said CD Joshi, commissioner, CET Cell.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maratha-quota-scrapped-fight-for-merit-prevails-say-students-parents-101620243518367.html
06-05-2021||Chandigarh||Cabinet meeting: Capt rules out complete lockdown, announces phased opening of shops||Chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh again ruled out a complete lockdown in the state and announced phased opening of shops after some of his cabinet colleagues said there was resentment among traders over selective closure of shops amid the Covid-19 outbreak. The CM said restrictions currently in place in Punjab were more stringent than the lockdown conditions in many other states. The CM compared the Punjab restrictions with the curbs in place in Delhi, Maharashtra, Karnataka and Kerala, among others, and pointed out that it was not necessary to impose a total lockdown. Chairing a virtual cabinet meeting, Amarinder announced a series of relaxations, including phased opening of shops and various incentives for the housing sector, such as three-month extension in permission period for construction of plots/projects for allotments, whether private or allotted, by the state urban development authorities. Earlier, cabinet ministers Manpreet Singh Badal, Tripat Bajwa and Bharat Bhushan Ashu said the shopkeepers, especially in urban areas, were upset about the selective shop shutdown as part of the restrictions imposed in the state. The CM said the objective of the closure had been to prevent crowding but phased opening could be worked out by district administrations. Amarinder also ordered limiting of the number of teachers in government schools to 50%, with the rest taking online classes from home. He directed the state food department to prepare five lakh additional food packets for distribution among Covid patients, besides announcing additional 10kg atta (wheat flour) for 1.41 crore smart ration card beneficiaries. The food aid is in addition to the 1 lakh food kits, containing 10kg of atta, 2kg chana and 2kg sugar already sanctioned for the underprivileged Covid patients. The CM said to meet the urgent needs of the people at the local level, the sarpanches have been authorised to spend up to ₹5,000 per day, subject to a maximum of ₹50,000, out of the panchayat funds for providing emergency relief by way of food and medicines to the poor. All urban local bodies have also been empowered to provide emergency relief, including food and medicines, to the poor and needy from the municipal fund. Taking cognisance of the problems resulting from the restrictions, the CM asked the social welfare department to release social security, pension amounts to ensure that the people do not suffer amid the current crisis. Relief for housing sector, shopkeepers For the housing sector, the CM directed all urban development authorities not to charge non-construction charges, extension fee and licence renewal fee for the period April 1 to July 31. Further, the urban development authorities have been asked to waive the interest to be charged on any delayed instalment, which was otherwise due between April 1 and July 31, provided that it is paid in equated monthly instalments after August 1. Mohali has 25% positivity rate Health secretary Hussan Lal informed the cabinet that 14 districts had positivity over 10% and six over 11%. Mohali tops the list with 25% positivity rate. The situation was grim with 70% of L2 beds (oxygen support) and over 80% L3 (ventilator support) beds in government and private hospitals occupied, the health secretary said, adding that with 10-30 patients needing a ventilator every day, things were not good. The cabinet approved one-time relaxation in the Punjab Village Common Lands (Regulation) Rules, 1964, for transfer of 5 acres of panchayat land in Mohali to the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) for the establishment of the National Institute of Virology for North Zone. The Institute has been sanctioned by the central government on a proposal by the Punjab government. The cabinet authorised the Mohali DC to complete formalities for transfer of the land in village Mullanpur Garibdas in Kharar block of Mohali district. Chief Secretary Vini Mahajan said construction for the institute would start by the end of this year. BoxThrust sector status for O2 production unitsThe cabinet announced thrust sector status for all oxygen product units, while appointing a nodal officer to coordinate with the customs department for quick clearance of foreign aid. The CM said with the way things were going currently, the situation was likely to worsen in the coming days, with nobody knowing how many more waves of Covid would hit the country and the state. The status will apply to oxygen production units with minimum capacity of 700 cylinders per day equivalent to 5 MT, oxygen cylinder manufacturers/fabricators, oxygen concentrator manufacturing units. Oxygen refilling units will not be covered by the special status. With this decision, the units (both old and new) will become eligible for 100% exemption from the change of land use (CLU)/external development charges (EDC), property tax, electricity duty, stamp duty and investment subsidy, by way of reimbursement of GST up to 125% of fixed capital investment made in the land and machinery. The cabinet was apprised that the daily oxygen allocation to Punjab stands at 195 MT and only 140 MT was actually being supplied on a daily basis, with shortage of tankers hampering lifting of oxygen, especially from Bokaro.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/cabinet-meeting-capt-rules-out-complete-lockdown-announces-phased-opening-of-shops-101620243458990.html
06-05-2021||Mumbai||SC scraps Maratha quota: What’s next for Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi govt||Various Maratha outfit leaders met virtually late Wednesday evening to decide over the future course of action even as Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray in a webcast on Wednesday assured the community that the state would fight for their reservation which was struck down by the Supreme Court earlier in the day. Thackeray said that the state was dealing with the pandemic crisis, and “some forces may try to take advantage of the situation” but that they should not get provoked and resume their agitation. “The Supreme Court verdict is disappointing as it has said that the state doesn’t have powers to give reservation… But it has also shown us a way by saying that the Centre and President has powers to grant reservation to a community. I am sure that the PM or the Centre will not disrespect this demand as it is not of just a community but of the entire Maharashtra,” Thackeray said. The Maratha agitation for reservation in government jobs and education has been a long-standing demand of the community and goes back to the 1980s. It culminated in the Socially and Educationally Backward Classes (SEBC) Act 2018 which introduced 16% reservation for the community. The law was challenged in the Bombay HC, which brought down the reservation to 12% and 13% for education and jobs, respectively. Leaders of the Maratha community held a discussion on the basis on which the law was scrapped by the Supreme Court on Wednesday evening, which was attended by legal experts as well. On Thursday, a virtual meeting of state coordinators of Maratha Kranti Morcha, an apex body of various organisations of the Maratha community, has been called to discuss the next line of action. “We are evaluating the points based on which SEBC act was struck down. It has come to light that no point-to-point arguments were held in the apex court over findings of Maharashtra State Commission for Backward Classes (MSCBC) report but while giving its verdict the apex court rejected some of the findings of the report. We have decided to call a meeting to discuss the matter in detail and decide the next course of action on Thursday evening, said Virendra Pawar, a leader from Maratha Mahasangh. Mansing Pawar, one of the organisers of Maratha Kranti Morcha, said there were two options: increase the ceiling of reservation quota which the Central government can do, or the state government incorporate Marathas in OBC category. “The Central government will have to think of making an amendment to increase reservation quota from 50% and above to grant reservation to the Maratha community. The other option is that the state government can make Maratha community part of OBC category to grant reservation,” he said. “If the state government is unable to provide us reservation benefits then they should incorporate Maratha community in the OBC category to get us reservation benefits. We have yet to discuss the option declared by the state government of approaching NCBC,” Pawar added.Bharatiya Janata Party Rajya Sabha Member of Parliament Sambhajiraje Chhatrapati, a descendant of Chhatrapati Shivaji, a 17th century Maratha king, said that the state government was now left with the only option of announcing a supernumerary quota for the community. “I feel that the supernumerary quota method is the only option left before the state government. I would not like to blame any particular government, be it past or present. The erstwhile Devendra Fadnavis led BJP government had tried hard and passed the reservation law, the present Thackeray government too tried its best but failed to convince the Supreme Court,” he said. The state said that it would approach the National Commission on Backward Classes, with a 2018 report submitted by the Maharashtra State Backward Class Commission, which attested to the need for reservation for the Maratha community. “As directed by the Supreme Court, we will approach the National Commission on Backward Classes with our report on the backwardness of the Maratha community. We will establish the ‘exception and extraordinary circumstances’ to show the backwardness of the community and send the proposal to the Centre. Now it is the responsibility of the Centre to accord the reservation to the community,” Ashok Chavan, PWD minister said. “In today’s verdict, the apex court clearly stated the state can approach NCBC for granting reservation. If the Commission makes a recommendation and the President approves it, then reservation can be granted. We have decided to approach NCBC and will present our side on why it is necessary to be given,” Nawab Malik, minority affairs minister said. State officials also discussed the possibility of filing a review petition against the Supreme Court verdict. “Once our legal experts study the verdict, we will discuss the pros and cons of approaching the apex court for review of the verdict by a larger bench. The law and judiciary department is looking into this possibility,” an official who did not want to be named said. “Our team of lawyers is studying the verdict. They will advise us on what to do next,” Thackeray said in his late evening address. “The 102nd amendment was notified in August 2018 whereas the SEBC Act was passed in November 2018. The argument made before the apex court is that the state government passed the act only after the 102nd amendment which makes SEBC act invalid. The previous government should have approached the Centre for clarity before enacting the act,” Shreehari Aney, former advocate general of the state told a news channel. The only alternative before the state was to bring the Maratha community within the OBC category to ensure continued reservation. “Apart from 22% reservation granted to Scheduled Caste, Scheduled Tribe and Vimukta Jati/Nomadic Tribes, the rest of the reservation quota is generally within the OBC category. If the Maratha caste would be able to bring Marathas under OBC category, then it will work and will also not exceed 50% cap. But that would require consensus from other OBC, but that is the only legal solution. For that, a lot of groundwork needs to be done for making a consensus,” he said. The reservation granted to Scheduled Caste is 13%, Scheduled Tribe — 7% and Vimukta Jati/Nomadic Tribe is 2%. He said the other legal solution could be giving the rights to the states to declare who is a socially and educationally backward class. “But that will also not fully resolve the problem because even if the state gets the right, breaching the 50% cap is not something within their capacity,” Aney said. Anant Kalse, former state legislature secretary said, “The verdict of the supreme court is the law of the land. The state government can now go for a review as the issue of states having powers for granting reservation to a community is still debatable.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/sc-scraps-maratha-quota-what-s-next-for-maharashtra-vikas-aghadi-govt-101620243398367.html

Some of them had not received appointment letters though the recruitment process was completed when the Supreme Court announced the interim stay last year. The state government had sought the clarity on it from the top court.Similarly, many college admissions were stalled halfway due to the interim order but during the first round of admission, students were admitted under the quota.“The SC on Wednesday clarified that the admissions and jobs secured before the interim stay have been safeguarded. We will have to check about the cases in which the appointment orders were not issued due to the interim order.

Data shows that 121 people have succumbed to the virus over the past ten days since April 26; this translates into 12 deaths a day. The district is among the six worst districts of Punjab. Over the past 10 days, it has added an average 568 new virus infection cases every day with 5,682 new cases reported since April 26.Sonu Maheswari, whose NGO Naujawan Welfare Society (NWS) has been working with the district administration in cremating bodies since the pandemic outbreak last year, said, “Everyday volunteers have to perform 6-7 last rites outside the cremation ground compound due to lack of space. Over the past few days, all pyre platforms remain occupied.”Bodies of suspected cases are also cremated according to the Covid protocol. Owing to a substantial number of deaths, families are asked to collect the last remains the very next day of cremation.“The city has no electric crematorium. A dignified last rite is becoming challenging due to the growing number of mortalities due to Covid, suspected death cases caused by the coronavirus, and other reasons. Bathinda city has two conventional cremation grounds with a capacity to handle 28 bodies. A cremation ground near the grain market complex is preferred, as it has enough space for 24 pyres,” said Maheshwari. Dr Sukhjinder Singh Gill, in-charge of Covid mortality cases, said in the three days, two minors have also died. “An 18-day-old infant died at Government Medical College at Faridkot, while a 5-year-old boy succumbed at Adesh Hospital in Bathinda. We have confirmation of only two deaths of patients, who were below 18,” said Gill.OPEN JAIL NOTIFIED FOR CURFEW VIOLATORSThe district administration on Wednesday designated SSD Senior Secondary School near Gol Diggi as open jail to keep violators of curfew. District magistrate B Srinivasan said that those who will be booked for violation of curfew in the district will be lodged at this open jail.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/bathinda-reporting-12-covid-deaths-a-day-for-past-10-days-101620243098863.html

Meanwhile, at the seven private hospitals, only 10 beds (including ICU and oxygen) were available.Suraj Maurya, a relative of a 50-year-old Covid-19 patient who is admitted at GMSH, said doctors told the family in the morning that the patient needs ventilator support, but a bed could not be arranged till late in the evening. “We are trying everywhere, but are receiving the same answer that no bed is available,” said Maurya.Dr GD Puri, head of the Covid-19 management panel at PGIMER, where most of the patients are admitted, said they are trying to ramp up the infrastructure.“We are doing whatever is possible, but too many patients are admitted in the emergency. We are trying to adjust them in dedicated Covid-19 hospitals.We are also adding four more ICU beds on Wednesday night and four will be added in addition to 24 high-dependency unit beds on Thursday. All concerned are working round the clock to make them functional,” he said.“This is an unprecedented situation for us. We are pushing for more ventilators. Around 30 are expected to arrive shortly,” said Dr Jagat Ram, director, PGIMER. UT adviser Manoj Parida said all department heads have been asked to see whether non-critical patients are occupying ICU beds. “At the same time, we are trying to increase the bed capacity in our Covid-19 facilities,” he said.Situation as grave in Mohali, PanchkulaThe situation is as alarming in the neighbouring Mohali and Panchkula districts. In Panchkula, all 19 ICU beds with ventilators were occupied on Wednesday evening, while only three of 79 ICU beds with oxygen/BiPAP machine were vacant. Meanwhile, the occupancy of 335 oxygen beds stood at 88%.Of 336 ICU beds at various government and private facilities in Mohali, only two were vacant on Wednesday evening. When it came to oxygen beds, only 19 of 685 were available.

On Wednesday, traders protested in Patiala city and said that shopkeepers dealing with non-essential items were facing heavy losses. There are over 21,000 such shops in the district. Rakesh Gupta, president, Patiala District Beopar Mandal, said, “Liquor vends and meat shops are allowed to open; then what is wrong with those dealing with garments, shoes and general store items? The authorities should conduct a field survey. They will find that since the implementation of these orders, traffic volume in main markets has increased, not decreased. There has also been spurt in covid cases.” “Instead of allowing selective opening of shops, the government should impose complete lockdown, so that it should be fair for all traders,” Gupta added.On Wednesday, the matter pertaining to resentment among shopkeepers over selective closure of shops also figured in the state cabinet meeting, in which CM Capt Amarinder Singh asked district administrations to work out the phased shop reopening plan.In the meeting, the CM added that closure of non-essential had been done to prevent crowding, but phased opening could be worked out by district administrations. Abhishek Garg, president, Patiala’s Sher-e-Punjab Market Association, said the lockdown has started taking toll on their businesses as well as patience. “Last year, garments lying in my stores were damaged due to a bug attack. Termites have eaten up furniture at our outlets. Fungus damaged leather goods. This will be repeated this year,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/covid19-guidelines-defiant-patiala-traders-resolve-to-open-shop-today-101620242618847.html

06-05-2021||Chandigarh||Vax shortage gives Panchkula senior citizens a harrowing time||At the time when the government is encouraging people to get inoculated, it has failed to provide adequate supply of Covid vaccines. The shortage is making many senior citizens in Panchkula run from pillar to post for days to get a shot.With finite number of doses and limited staff, the health department had to reduce the number of centres to four in urban Panchkula. Rajender Arora, 72, and his 66-year-old wife Savita Arora have made three rounds to multiple health centres to get their second dose of vaccine in a week, but have to return empty-handed. “Last month, we got our first dose at the civil dispensary in Sector 20. However, for the last few days, the authorities have stopped administering vaccines at this dispensary. On Tuesday, we left at 7.30am for Sector-12 community centre but despite waiting for an hour, we did not get any token. I then contacted a doctor at the civil hospital, who abruptly cut the call,” Savita said. The couple then visited civil hospital where they were asked to go to the Sector-26 polyclinic. “We were told to come back tomorrow at the polyclinic as well as at Sector 21,” she added. The couple said, “We are old and cannot go from one health centre to another for vaccination. The authorities should make the process convenient for people like us.”They are not the only ones suffering. Ashok Kumar, 65, finally received his second jab after eight weeks of getting the first shot and one week of search. “I had been visiting the dispensary in Sector 20 and there they used to ask me to visit the next day. Then I went to the dispensary of Sector 12 A, where I was told that they don’t keep Covaxin and told me to visit the community centre in the same sector. There too, the vaccine was out of stock,” he added. “Then I called a helpline, which asked me to visit either MDC-4 or polyclinic in Sector 26. I visited both the sites, but did not get the shot,” he said further. Immunisation officer Dr Meenu Sasan, meanwhile, said, “We have limited stock of vaccines. I am left with only 5,000 doses for 45-plus age group and 13,000 for those between 18 years and 44 years. Hence, I have brought down the number of vaccination centres in the district. In rural areas, the number has been reduced to seven from 10. With limited supply, I cannot run vaccination drives at every health centre.” However, she said that Thursday (May 6) onwards, they would start getting around 6,000 doses every alternate day. She added that detailed information is being shared on social media platforms, including WhatsApp groups of resident welfare associations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/vax-shortage-gives-panchkula-senior-citizens-a-harrowing-time-101620242078958.html

According to the arrangement till April 30, the UT administration supplied the vaccines to the private facilities which in turn paid the price of the same to the central government. However, according to the new arrangement, the private facilities have to procure their own stock from the manufacturers. The UT health department took back the remaining stocks from the private facilities on April 30 and May 1.In the last eight days of April, the number of inoculations had crossed the 5,500-mark daily and even reached the highest on April 30 when 6,200 jabs were given. But, in the beginning of May, the number has not crossed even the 5,000-mark with the daily inoculation numbers hovering between 4,200 to 4,800.Though some private hospital chains in Mohali have procured vaccines, the small-scale facilities have not been able to buy it from the manufacturers. In the process, the number of vaccination centres has also reduced to 50 from around 65.“This has resulted in confusion among the beneficiaries. We are not able to administer doses to even those who had booked the spot in our hospitals. There should be some consistency in the policy,” Dr RS Bedi, former vice-president of Indian Medical Association, said.Dr Neeraj Sharma, who ran a vaccination centre at his private hospital, said they tried to purchase the vaccine from the manufacturer, but they have failed to secure the batch so far. “We have been told to wait for three to six months,” he said.UT’s immunisation officer Dr Manjeet Singh said that people should come to government facilities, which are properly managed by the authorities.“We are following the government of India’s guidelines and if the eligible beneficiaries are concerned about the second dose, they should report to any government facility,” he added. UT health secretary Arun Gupta said it does not have a huge impact on the outcome.“There is no large-scale disruption to the drive and even government facilities have all the facilities which are required for this process,” he said. In a drive that started on January 16, 2,22,860 doses have been administered in the health facilities of the city so far. The UT, unlike Mohali and Panchkula, has not been able to start vaccination for the younger age group of 18+ category as it is awaiting vaccines for this group.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/centres-guidelines-hit-vax-drive-at-private-facilities-in-chandigarh-101620242019414.html

06-05-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai: Regulate prices for Covid vaccines at private hospitals, say experts||Pune-based Serum Institute of India (SII) in April priced Covishield at ₹600 per dose to private hospitals. After adding service charges, few private hospitals that have started inoculating citizens between the age groups of 18 and 44 years are charging between ₹700 and ₹900 per dose. While the extra charge is not illegal, the uneven and unregulated pricing of Covid-19 vaccines has raised concerns among doctors and health activists who are calling for a price cap on the vials. From May 1, the Central government allowed the vaccination of the public between the age group of 18 and 44 years. Amidst shortages of vials, only three private hospitals—HL Reliance, (Girgaum), Nanavati (Vile Parle) and Apollo (Navi Mumbai), who had placed their order for vials to SII months ago, have been able to start the inoculation programme. These hospitals are charging ₹700, ₹900 and ₹850 respectively after including charges for transportation, procurement, storage and service. A section of doctors, however, fear that hospitals in the absence of guidelines or a price cap may use the opportunity to “unethically” charge a higher price range for vials.“While all major and smaller private hospitals are struggling to get hold of the vials, a few hospitals have turned into major providers of the vaccines. This gives them the upper hand to decide on the pricing as per their wish in the absence of regulation and a cap. This may lead to unethical overcharging,” said Dr Prince Surana, chief executive officer at Surana Group of Hospitals.Santosh Marathe, chief operating officer at Apollo Hospital said their cost for a jab includes the cost of transportation, maintaining the cold chain and service charges. Nanavati Hospital was unavailable for a comment, and HL Reliance Hospital refused to comment. N Ramaswamy, commissioner of the National Health Commission, said they haven’t received any official complaint from the public on the price issue as yet. “The Central government has instructed private hospitals to procure vials directly from the manufacturers. As there are no specific guidelines, the hospitals decide their own vaccine prices. But they have to upload the price on Co-WIN for the public to decide. So far, the state health department hasn’t personally decided to put any price cap,” said Ramaswamy.Charging a higher price for vaccines will render them unaffordable for many which can become a hurdle in the mass immunisation programme, said, health experts.“Firstly, the procurement process should be centralised which will help bring better regulation on the pricing of vaccines. Also, with a cap on pricing, private hospitals won’t be able to able use it to exploit the public. Otherwise, more underprivileged people would fall prey to the infection,” said Brinelle D’Souza, senior faculty, Tata Institute and co-convener, Jan Swasthya Abhiyan-Mumbai.Dr Deepak Baid, former president of the Association of Medical Consultants (AMC) said, “At the beginning of the pandemic, some hospitals overcharged patients when there were no regulations on beds pricing. Similarly, if a cap isn’t imposed on vaccines, there is a possibility that hospitals may charge a higher amount of money from the public.” Meanwhile, amidst the ongoing shortage of vials in the city, SII has informed a few private hospitals that it would take five-six months to supply Covishield. In response to an email sent by Dr Surana, SII replied, “...Due to our current obligation to meet the government’s existing requirements and to meet the additional demand emanating from state governments under liberated and accelerated vaccination, it is challenging to meet independently the requirement across from a large number of private hospitals. Therefore, we urge you to access the vaccine when it becomes available in the private market supply chain channels which will take about 5-6 months from now.” SII, however, refused to comment on the issue. This delay in the procurement process has upset doctors who are planning to seek help from the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC). Dr Gautam Bhansali, general physician, Bombay Hospital said, “To control the second wave, we need to fasten the vaccination process. If private hospitals don’t get the vials, the mass immunisation programme will get further delayed. So, we have plans to hold a meeting with BMC.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-regulate-prices-for-covid-vaccines-at-private-hospitals-say-experts-101620241478136.html

So, we decided to reach out to them at the civil hospital. On Tuesday, our volunteers visited the hospital to hand out free meals. We bumped up the quantity on Wednesday, but that also ran out in no time,” said Pritpal Singh Pali, president of the Dukh Niwaran Sahib Gurdwara managing committee.A similar service has been started by ISKCON, that has also made available a web link – bit.ly/covidfoodservice – and helpline (740-282-8074) to place food requests between 8am and 8pm. Food will be delivered the next day between 11am and 3pm.“Around 15 volunteers have come together to prepare the meals and manage the supply across the city. We are delivering around 100 plates a day. Hundreds of patients are isolated at home, with limited access to groceries. It is time to serve those in need,” said Rajesh Garg, who is attached with ISKCON for the past three decades.At the historical Gurdwara Manji Sahib in Alamgir village, a hall been converted into a 25-bed Covid care centre.“We have set up 25 beds in the hall, where a team from Guru Ram Das Hospital can monitor patients with mild symptoms. We are working out the modalities to procure oxygen cylinders and get administration’s approval, following which the facility will be made operational,” said Gurdarshan Singh, manager of the gurdwara committee, adding that the centre was an initiative of the Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC). Dr Kiran Ahluwalia, nodal officer for Covid in district, said the facility set up by the gurdwara will be inspected before permission was accorded.She said organisations, individuals, NGOs, corporate and trusts may approach the administration to set up similar centres. “Also, when NGOs and religious organisations are lending their support, each citizen must do their bit by simply wearing a mask in public. Only Covid appropriate behaviour can help us stem the virus spread,” said Dr Kiran.In his address to the community on Wednesday, Punjab Shahi Imam Maulana Habib-ur-Rehman Saani Ludhianvi called on people to come forward and help each other in these trying times. “The pandemic has yet again reminded us to save and serve humanity. I urge people to help those in need, especially people out of means for treatment,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/amid-trying-times-ludhiana-s-religious-organisations-extend-a-helping-hand-101620241426215.html

06-05-2021||Mumbai||Admissions for PG dental students yet to commence||Dr Pratima Pandey, 24 is among at least 30,000 postgraduate (PG) dental aspirants who cleared the National Eligibility-cum-Entrance Test-Masters in Dental Surgery (NEET-MDS) in December 2020 but are still waiting for admissions to begin.What’s worse is that directives from the Medical Counseling Committee (MCC), which handles all-India admissions for MDS aspirants state that admissions to the course can only begin once NEET-PG for medical and diploma students is conducted and results are announced. “This means we will have to wait another four months minimum for admissions to begin because the Central government recently postponed NEET-PG by four months,” said Pandey, one of many students affected by this decision.While all BDS students who graduated this year have been roped in for Covid-19 duty, these MDS aspirants are waiting at home wanting to join the task force. “Most students are already working eight-hour shifts daily with various hospitals, but those of us who cleared BDS earlier and are eligible for MDS are waiting to be called on the field, but with admissions stalled we can be of no help,” said Dr Balasubramniam Shankar, another aspirant. MDS aspirants have to clear their BDS degree and complete at least one year of internship before they are eligible for admissions to the master’s course. While the all-Inda quota seats are conducted by the MCC, state quota seats are filled by the state common entrance test (CET) cell. “We can see that at present the burden of work on the medical faculty is large, and we are ready to participate in the covid task force. Most of us have cleared our BDS in the last two-three years are, however, waiting for a word from the authorities,” added Shankar. Final year PG medical examinations have been stalled in most states due to the deterioration of Covid situation. Similarly, no fresh admissions to PG medical, dental and diploma courses were done due to the postponement of National Eligibility-cum-Entrance Test (NEET-PG) exams. NEET-PG exams are generally conducted in the month of December along with NEET-MDS, but while the MDS entrance exam was conducted as per schedule, NEET-PG for medical and diploma candidates was postponed.After receiving queries from students from across the country, a statement from the MCC stating the reason for the delay was shared. “NEET-PG 2021 for postgraduate medical, dental and diploma has not been conducted yet, but counselling for MDS seats is also supposed to be done with MD/MS and diploma seats. Hence, the tentative counselling schedule for NEET-PG medical/dental seats has not been made yet. Students are advised to visit the official website of the MCC regularly for further updates,” said the statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/admissions-for-pg-dental-students-yet-to-commence-101620241298656.html
06-05-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Five years on, wetlands yet to be declared as bird sanctuaries||More than five years have passed since former chief minister (CM) Devendra Fadnavis, acting as the chairman of the State Board for Wildlife (SBWL), approved a proposal to declare three wetlands in Mumbai, Raigad and Thane districts as bird sanctuaries. However, the respective water area — including wetlands of Mahul-Shivdi, Panje-Funde and TSC-NRI wetlands in Navi Mumbai — are yet to be notified as such, as per provisions of the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972.Activists earlier this week wrote to CM Uddhav Thackeray, drawing his attention to this delay, and urged him to expedite protection for these ecologically sensitive areas, which support a rich biodiversity of migratory birds during winter months. The Fadnavis government had, on December 4, 2015, proposed to declare nearly 1,600 hectares of wetland as bird sanctuary while approving the Mumbai Trans-Harbour Link project.The same day, via the official Facebook page of the Chief Minister’s office, it had been announced, “CM Devendra Fadnavis chaired the 10th meeting of the State Wildlife Board at Mumbai, in presence of forest minister Sudhir Mungantiwar. The board approved three bird sanctuaries in Mumbai region (Mahul-Shivdi, TSC land near Palm Beach and Panje Funde), which will help in conservation of flamingos.” Mitigation measures suggested by Bombay Natural History Society (BNHS) were taken into consideration before giving approval to the MTHL project, the post read.BN Kumar, director of NatConnect NGO which has been campaigning to protect wetlands in Navi Mumbai, said, “This move is in line with what environmentalists have been demanding for years. But despite filing multiple Right to Information (RTI) queries in the recent past as to the status of Panje bird sanctuary, it was not mentioned in the responses that approval had already been granted to declare these wetlands as sanctuaries. We have now requested CM Thackeray to go ahead with his predecessor’s decision and make this announcement on World Migratory Bird Day, on May 8, as a gift to the Mumbai Metropolitan Region.”Recently, migratory birds (namely greater sandplovers) which had been tagged by BNHS at Panje in September 2018 were found to have returned to the area after a supermoon event caused tidal water to flow into the parched wetland which, Kumar said, has been dry for close to a year now. Local birder Parag Gharat who ventured out with his camera after seeing the waterflow spotted the tagged birds. Kumar quickly cross-checked the photos with BNHS which confirmed it had done the tagging. “Looks like the birds are using the Mumbai coast as a stopover or refuelling site,” said BNHS director Dr Bivash Pandav.Meanwhile, wetlands in Mahul-Shivdi in Mumbai and TSC-NRI in Navi Mumbai also continue to support a large number of resident and migratory bird populations, including flamingos. “These areas are not just important for birds; they act as urban sponges and prevent flooding as well. Since the state government had already expressed their desire to grant them legal sanctity as bird sanctuaries, there should be no further delay in the same. To have waited for over five years since then is already a serious lapse in governance,” said Kumar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/five-years-after-wildlife-board-nod-wetlands-yet-to-declared-as-bird-sanctuaries-101620241122064.html
06-05-2021||Other||Of six oxygen generation plants in Haryana, two already operational: Vij||As the state battles scarcity of liquid oxygen, Haryana health and home minister Anil Vij on Wednesday said that of six pressure swing adsorption (PSA) oxygen generation plants, two are already operational and rest of the four will start working by the end of this week.“We were allotted six such plants and one each in Sonepat and Karnal are already functional. The plant in Ambala will start providing gas by Wednesday night. Rest of the three plants in Panchkula, Faridabad and Hisar will get ready within 2-3 days,” Vij said.After inspecting the plant at the civil hospital in Ambala which will provide oxygen directly to patients’ bed in the isolation ward, Vij said other than these six plants, the Union government has allotted 60 more such facilities which will be installed at hospitals with bed capacities of 30, 50, 100 and 200.“Civil work will be carried out by the NHAI and is expected to complete within a week. Installation will be undertaken by DRDO along with a Union government agency. We have a target to make every government hospital in state ‘atmanirbhar’ in terms of oxygen supply. We’ve instructed private hospitals to install their own plants within six months or face action,” Vij added.On Wednesday, he said that chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar is himself monitoring the oxygen supply situation in state.“Most of the gas allotted in our quota is being transported from Odisha and there are some issues in its supply. So after a meeting in Chandigarh on Tuesday, we’ve decided to import 10 trucks from any foreign country where the vehicles are available, to develop an uninterrupted chain between Haryana and Odisha for its supply,” Vij said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/of-six-oxygen-generation-plants-in-haryana-two-already-operational-vij-101620241119360.html
06-05-2021||Mumbai||Private schools must submit documents on fees: Maharashtra edu dept||With several complaints concerning private schools charging indiscriminate fees coming to light, the state education department has directed its officials to ensure that schools across boards and managements submit documents with reference to fees to the department. In a letter addressed to officials at the education department, the director of primary education in the state has ordered that documents on fee- such as papers of PTA approvals, finances of school etc be sent to the department. The move came after CAPS student organisation requested the government to look into fee-related complaints of parents. “Several schools are charging students indiscriminately and are not following norms concerning fee hikes. In many places, the Parent Teacher Association is not formed as per the due process and fee hikes are still approved without following norms. We thus hope that the government acts in this regard and keeps a tab on fees across schools,” stated the letter given by the student organisation. As per the Maharashtra Educational Institutions (Regulation of Fee) Act, 2011, it is binding on schools to submit records of fee hikes and fee-related decisions to education authorities regularly. However, in the past, despite requests from parent bodies, the department has seldom acted against schools that fail to submit their records and still hike fees indiscriminately. The state government recently formed an expert committee to suggest changes and revisions in the fee act and had also invited suggestions from various stakeholders for the same.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/private-schools-must-submit-documents-on-fees-maharashtra-edu-dept-101620241119890.html
06-05-2021||Mumbai||Age of contactless customers: Drones to replace traditional delivery executives||Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), popularly known as drones, could well replace traditional delivery executives in the country in times to come as the ministry of civic aviation (MoCA) on Tuesday granted conditional exemption from Unmanned Aircraft System Rules, 2021 to 20 entities, including Dunzo and Swiggy, to conduct Beyond Visual Line of Sight (BVLOS) experimental flights of drones. Taking a step towards making home delivery by drones a reality, MoCA said BVLOS trials will help create a framework for future drone deliveries and other major applications using drones. Senior MoCA officials told HT that draft guidelines for BVLOS drone operations will be open for public scrutiny by the end of the year.In April, MoCA also granted conditional approval to Telangana government for delivering Covid-19 vaccines using drones on an experimental basis. Similar permission was granted to the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) for conducting feasibility study of Covid-19 vaccine delivery using drones, in collaboration with Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur. MoCA had constituted BVLOS Experiment Assessment and Monitoring Committee (BEAM) with an aim to undertake BVLOS experimental drone flights, following which the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) had in May 2019 issued an expression of interest (EOI).Among 34 EOIs evaluated by the committee, 20 were selected for experimental flights. As a result of which, MoCA on Tuesday issued an order granting permission (or conditional exemption) to these selected consortia to conduct experiment flights for one year or until further orders, whichever is earlier. The concept of drone delivery has, however, already taken roots in some countries with self-flying drones, from delivering Covid-19 vaccines in Ghana, a country in West Africa, to global e-commerce platforms (such as Amazon) planning to complete their deliveries by unmanned machines in the sky. Back home, in 2014, a local eatery in Mumbai, as a test flight, used a drone for delivering a pizza, making it the first city in the country to adopt high-technology in food delivery. Soon after the unlocking of the economy in June last year, DGCA granted approvals to food start-ups such as Zomato, Swiggy and Dunzo to start testing BVLOS operation drones for deliveries. In such operations, drones fly without a pilot maintaining visual line of sight on the aircraft at all times. Instead, the pilot operates the UAV using Remote Pilot Station (RPS) / Ground Control Station (GCS) instruments. A Dunzo spokesperson said they were working with local authorities in Telangana to commence drone trials for medicine delivery. A comment from Swiggy is awaited.Ministry officials said use of drones in last-mile deliveries will grow larger in the pandemic-hit world.Though, in the recently announced norms for drone operations in the country, BVLOS operations for delivery of goods has not been permitted, a senior MoCA official early in March had said that as drones become the new normal, traditional air cargo movement has to dovetail itself with last-mile or first-mile connectivity.“There are some areas of aviation, particularly in cargo, that need to grow as drones become the new normal. The civil aviation ministry may very shortly put in place a platform and rules, which will make air cargo grow as well,” Vandana Aggarwal, senior economic advisor in MoCA, had said. The Unmanned Aircraft System Rules, 2021, notified on March 12, spells out the terms of usage of drones by individuals and businesses. It also lays down rules for terms of research, testing, production, and import of such vehicles. The rule allows drones to be used to conduct surveys, for photography, security, information gathering purposes, disaster management, and surveillance operations.However, MoCA joint secretary and head of the drones division Amber Dubey said draft guidelines for BVLOS operations are expected to come by the end of this year. “After test flights are conducted, test results and proof of concept submitted by consortia will be scrutinised by DGCA. Post which, draft guidelines will be issued and will be open for public feedback before issuing the notification,” said Dubey adding, “Thereafter guidelines are expected to be issued by year-end.”A DGCA official said, “Trial flights will be affected by upcoming monsoon season and winter fog in certain parts of India. One cannot rush the trials since it has safety, national security, data security and privacy concerns.”Chirag Sharma, co-founder and chief executive officer of Delhi-based Drone Destination Pvt Ltd, said drones, owing to its autonomous capabilities, will play a key role in last-mile logistics, especially in hard-to-access areas. “Heavy lift drones with payload carrying capacity of over 5kg can be used to transport essential food and supplies, medicines and blood samples,” said Sharma, adding that a restaurant-to-home food delivery is still some time away from an Indian UAS operations perspective. “We will need drone ports in the future to enable large-scale drone powered logistics. Certain delivery companies like Zomato, Swiggy, Dunzo will be conducting government-approved trials in the next two to three months. Once learnings from the trials have been adopted and standard operating procedures (SOPs) are in place, we could see real-time implementation in the coming two to three years,” Sharma added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/age-of-contactless-customers-drones-to-replace-traditional-delivery-executives-101620241058705.html
06-05-2021||Mumbai||Different viewpoint is not hate speech, says Bombay high court||A different viewpoint does not become “hate speech” merely because it is harsh or extreme, the Bombay high court observed on Wednesday while striking down a first information report (FIR) registered against a Vashi resident for allegedly trying to created hatred between two religious groups by reposting a video on her Twitter handle along with her view.A division bench of justice SS Shinde and justice MS Karnik said the right to express your view is a protected and cherished right in our democracy. “Merely because the point of view of the petitioner is extreme or harsh does not make it a hate speech, as it is only expressing a different point of view,” the bench added, striking down an FIR registered by Azad Maidan police against Vashi resident Sunaina Holey, accusing the 39-year-old of creating hatred between different religions. On April 15, she was booked after she reposted on her Twitter handle a video of an individual addressing the huge crowd of migrant labourers who had gathered outside Bandra railway station on April 14, 2020, amid nationwide lockdown along with a purportedly objectionable message.On April 14, a rumour that trains were restarted was spread, attracting huge crowd of migrants who were desperate to return to their native places.As the atmosphere become tense, the police requested a man to pacify the crowd and he started to say that the pandemic was an act of God. When he was speaking, one person in the crowd shouted that Covid-19 pandemic was not an act of God but had been brought out by the Prime Minister of India. Someone shot the entire sequence on video and circulated it on social media. Holey retweeted the video with a message critical of the authorities The HC said the prime intent of the petitioner was obviously to criticize and counter the view point of the person in the video who was blaming the Prime Minister of India for the spread of virus. “Reading of the contents of the tweet would reveal that neither any community nor any religion is named. Nothing substantial has been brought on record by the prosecution to hold that because of the said tweet, hatred or enmity was created in between two communities,” said the bench. “Upon reading of the contents of the said tweet, it is difficult to arrive at the conclusion that the Petitioner has mens rea to commit alleged offence under section 153A of the IPC.”The HC added that the concern of the state police machinery to control the situation though justified, but the approach in registering the FIR for the comments made on the Twitter feed by the petitioner on the apprehension that the same may lead to promoting hatred or enmity between different groups was “too far-fetched and remote”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/different-viewpoint-is-not-hate-speech-says-bombay-high-court-101620241058110.html
06-05-2021||Mumbai||FIR against comedian Sunil Pal for derogatory comment on doctors||The Andheri police on Tuesday booked stand-up comedian Sunil Pal for allegedly making “derogatory and obnoxious” comments on doctors working in Covid management and treatment. The video on the same had gone viral on social media.Association of Medical Consultants (Mumbai), which represents 12,000 doctors and 811 hospitals in Maharashtra and Karnataka, had complained against Pal.Dr Sushmita Bhatnagar, the association president, in the first information report (FIR) has stated that the accused, stand-up comedian in an interview with a YouTube channel had made false accusations against doctors claiming their involvement in fraudulent deeds, comparing doctors to evil creatures of the society and also spread lies about Covid-19.The video of the interview later went viral on social media and was widely shared on WhatsApp and other platforms. Various doctor’s bodies from across the country had objected to it, ultimately forcing the comedian to tender an apology for his comments. “The content of the video incites anger and hatred against doctors among the general public and also creates panic and fear about Covid in people’s minds. Pal’s video spreads rumours. It incites negative notions to defame doctors. The video could also trigger violence against doctors across the country and the comedian will be solely responsible for it,” stated Dr Bhatnagar in the FIR (of which HT has a copy). The complaint regarding the objectionable video was submitted to the police by the association’s chairman Dr Sudhir Naik on April 22, but the Andheri police registered an FIR in the matter only on Tuesday. Pal has been booked under sections 500 (defamation) and 505-2 (statements creating or promoting enmity, hatred or ill-will between classes) of the Indian Penal Code. He would soon be summoned to record his statement, said a police officer.When contacted Pal’s spokesperson she said that the comedian had already apologised for his comments which a section of doctors found objectionable. Like the first video, the doctors should also see the second video in which he has stated that his comments were meant for the bad people and not the genuine doctors who are doing great work and serving the nation. Pal hasn’t yet received any intimation from the police regarding the FIR, she added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/fir-against-comedian-sunil-pal-for-derogatory-comment-on-doctors-101620240998577.html
06-05-2021||Other||Fire engineer files PIL before HC over blazes at hospitals||A Nagpur-based fire engineer and a private forensic expert has filed an intervene public interest litigation (PIL) before the Bombay high court (HC) concerning the fire incidents in state hospitals. Referring to the Virar hospital fire incident, where 15 patients were charred to death on April 23 due to a short circuit in the air conditioning unit, the plea also suggests solutions to avoid fires in hospitals. The hearing is for the PIL is posted on Thursday.Nilesh Ukunde, 53, the petitioner who is an engineer from the Central government run-National Fire Services College, Nagpur, said large amounts of alcohol in sanitisers and heavy curtains inside the ICU blocked cross-ventilation, this led to the spreading of fire. The intervention petition by Ukunde is based on the fire audits of several Covid hospitals in the state.In the petition before the HC, Ukunde said he has visited around 35 Covid hospitals and had also visited the Virar hospital post the tragedy on the orders of the divisional commissioner, Nagpur Municipal Corporation and the fire audit of the Virar hospital states that alcohol settled on ceilings and can result in a fire due to a short circuit in the absence of cross ventilation. The alcohol is lighter than air and settles on the upper layer of the room, as per the petition.In the Virar hospital case, there was only one point for entry and exit from the ICU, thus the patients were trapped. The hospital should have used a suction pump, every eight hours, for two minutes, to suck out the alcohol-laden air in the upper layer of the room, and thus the fire would not have occurred, said Ukunde in the fire audit.The curtains in all ICUs of hospitals should be removed and only fire retardant cloth should be used, which was absent in the Virar hospital. The Nagpur Municipal Corporation (NMC) has issued standard operating procedures (SOPs) to all hospitals which are being implemented in Nagpur hospitals, and such SOPs should be adopted by all Covid care hospitals in the state, said Ukunde in the PIL.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/fire-engineer-files-pil-before-hc-over-blazes-at-hospitals-101620240998006.html
06-05-2021||Delhi||Tragedy averted as 26 patients rescued in nick of time after fire in Delhi nursing home||Twenty-six patients, including 17 infected with Covid-19 and some of them on oxygen support, were trapped after a fire broke out late Tuesday night in UK Nursing Home at Vikaspuri, fire and police officials said. The medical facility was recently converted into a Covid hospital.All the patients, and around 50 members of the hospital staff were rescued in a 45-minute-long firefighting and rescue operation carried out by 30 firemen involving eight fire tenders. Three serious Covid patients who were on ventilator support in the hospital’s intensive care unit (ICU) were immediately shifted to two private hospitals in west Delhi – Kalra and Central – in ambulances, said fire official and the hospital administration.“As water was dripping in the ICU from the roof, we removed three Covid patients as a precautionary measure. Two were shifted to Kalra hospital while another patient was sent to Central hospital. The fire started in the first floor store room, where administrative records were kept. All patients are safe and they were shifted to ground and second floors,” said Pankaj Maini from UK Nursing Home’s administration department.Delhi Fire Services (DFS) chief Atul Garg said the fire control room received a call around 11pm that a fire has broken out in the hospital, and people were trapped inside.“Immediately, eight fire tenders were rushed to the hospital. The building has a basement, ground, and two upper floors. The fire originated in the storeroom on the first floor. While the flames were seen only on the first floor, the smoke had engulfed the entire hospital building,” he said.Since it was a Covid hospital, the firemen were divided into four different teams – one to douse the flames and three others to rescue the patients and hospital staff.None of the rescuers wore PPE kits since it catches fire easily. The firemen wore the regular uniforms, helmets with face shields, and eyeglasses and masks, said assistant divisional officer (DFS) Bhupender Prakash, who was leading the teams.According to Prakash, the firefighting team entered the hospital building through the main gate, and reached the first floor using a ladder installed on the porch. The patients on the first floor were immediately evacuated, and water was sprayed to douse the flames. The glass windows towards the front portion of the building were broken for ventilation.The fire officer said that there were six patients in the ICU on the ground floor, right below the first floor store room where the fire broke out. The water used to douse the flames started dripping inside the ICU from the roof. All the six patients were evacuated. The false ceiling of the ICU collapsed soon after all the patients were taken away safely, he said.“The members of our rescue teams evacuated patients from the ground and second floors, as well with the help of the hospital staff. We used the stretchers and wheelchairs to move the patients to safe places. Within 45 minutes, the fire was controlled while the entire operation continued till 1am on Wednesday,” said Prakash, adding that they found fire fighting equipment such as fire extinguishers in the hospital.The firefighters said that though they knew they had Covid patients inside, they knew they must carry out the rescue operation. All firefighters were properly sanitised after the rescue operation, and their uniforms were discarded.“We take calculated risk as saving lives is the top priority of fire fighters even in situations where there are chances of getting infected from Covid or other virus. As a precautionary measure, for two days we isolate the firefighters who were directly exposed to Covid patients, and watch their health condition,” DFS chief Garg said.Meanwhile, the ministry of home affairs has asked all the states and Union territories to ensure that no fire incident occurs in any of the health facilities (particularly Covid-19 dedicated facilities).The ministry has taken cognisance of fire incidents, caused by short circuits, in hospitals and nursing homes in the last few days across the country.In his letter to the states and UTs, Union home secretary Ajay Kumar Bhalla said that in the context of recent fire incidents, and particularly in view of the impending summer season, it needs to be highlighted that either because of high temperature, lack of maintenance or high load on the internal wirings within facilities, short circuits take place, leading to fire incidents and consequential loss of life and essential infrastructure.Fifteen patients died after a fire broke out on April 23 at Vijay Vallabh hospital in Virar, Mumbai. On April 25, 3 patients died in fire at hospital in Gujarat’s Surat.The ministry of home affairs has asked the states/union territories to conduct a detailed review with officials from the health, power and fire departments, and prepare a detailed plan of action to ensure that fire safety measures are in place in all hospitals and health facilities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/tragedy-averted-as-26-patients-rescued-in-nick-of-time-after-fire-in-delhi-nursing-home-101620240640193.html
06-05-2021||Mumbai||Bandra society opposes Mumbai civic body’s plan to set up Covid vaccination centre inside complex||Two housing societies in Rizvi Complex area of Bandra (West) have opposed the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC)’s plan to set up a vaccination centre inside their premises.The BMC owns a structure inside the complex, however, the housing societies, consisting of 56 flats, have written to the civic body expressing fear of crowding and spreading of Covid-19 among residents.The BMC, to scale up vaccination drives for 18 to 44 age groups is in the process of having 227 vaccination centres across the city in 24 wards, and one such is inside the compound of Harmony and Rocky housing society. The BMC’s H West ward had written to the societies on April 29, informing them about the plan to set up the vaccination centre at the welfare centre owned by the civic body. The BMC, in its letter, had sought cooperation from the society regarding the same.However, the members of both societies have opposed the plan citing that vaccination centre should not come up in residential areas. Jasmine Divekar, a resident said, “We are told to stay home and stay safe, but with the BMC planning to come up with a vaccination centre, I do not feel residents in our society will be able to remain safe. With vaccination centre, there might be crowding, and this can result in spreading of Covid-19 among residents of society.”Masud Ahmed, chairman of Harmony society said, “We are not against vaccination or vaccination centres, but we are just requesting them to not set up the same in our society premises. Senior citizens are residing in our society and we fear they might be infected. We have written to the BMC and are expecting a positive reply from them.”The residents also took to social media expressing their displeasure.Vinayak Vispute, assistant municipal commissioner of the BMC’s H West ward said, “The premises herein is located inside Harmony society and is a welfare centre owned by the BMC. There is a separate gate and parking available for us, which we do not regularly use. But now we want to use it for vaccination, considering it is the most feasible and suitable location.”He added, “I expect the citizens to cooperate considering vaccination is the need of the hour. We cannot set up vaccination centres in schools and colleges considering they might reopen any time, after which, vaccination drive might get affected.”However, the residents claim there is no individual gate for the BMC premises and there are only two common gates. The entrance to the BMC’s premises is through the main gate and compound of the society which is common for all three. In the two housing societies where 60% of the occupants are senior citizens, the vaccination centre could be a huge health hazard,” added Divekar.Meanwhile, local BJP corporator Swapna Mhatre said, “I had already informed BMC that there will be opposition if we select residential society premises for vaccination. I had already suggested schools in nearby areas, but BMC says it does not want to go ahead with schools or colleges fearing they may restart in the coming month. I feel if alternative options are available, we should avoid disturbing residential housing societies.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/bandra-society-opposes-mumbai-civic-body-s-plan-to-set-up-covid-vaccination-centre-inside-complex-101620240937984.html

Of the 33,807 beneficiaries, 26,806 received their second doses. Among the beneficiaries 17,356 were senior citizens, 11,009 were citizens in the age group of 45-59 years, 2,017 were frontline workers, and 1,131 were healthcare workers. From Tuesday, vaccination in the age group of 45 years and above restarted across Mumbai, after it was suspended for three days since Saturday due to a shortage in doses. Vaccination at the five centres that are now catering to the age group of 18-44 years, alongside vaccination for those in the age group of 45 years and above, took place amid reports of overcrowding at BKC jumbo facility and Rajawadi Hospital. By Wednesday night, photographs circulated on social media of overcrowding and a stampede like situation at the BKC Jumbo facility. However, Dr Rajesh Dere, the dean of BKC jumbo facility said, “There was only some crowding at BKC jumbo facility in the morning before we opened the vaccination centre at noon. Despite BMC’s request to beneficiaries on Tuesday, that vaccination would start post noon, people started gathering at the centre at 6am itself. Once doses arrived and gates of the vaccination centre opened at noon, everything went smoothly.” In a statement on Wednesday night, BMC’s public relations management department said, “There was no mismanagement at BKC. On the contrary, the citizens were requested to come after 12pm as doses were to come in the morning. Local administration and police also appealed to the citizens. However, people started crowding the centre in the morning hours. Once the doses arrived, vaccination was carried out smoothly.” Responding to a fake message circulating on social media, that this centre was operational for vaccinating beneficiaries in the 18-44 years age group, BMC on Wednesday morning urged citizens not to rush to the centre. Kiran Dighavkar, assistant commissioner of the G/North ward, with jurisdiction over the area, said, “Many 18 to 44 age group beneficiaries gathered at Kohinoor insisting for vaccination. I urge all to please spread this message: vaccination at this centre is only for people in the age group of 45 years and above, getting a first or second dose. Drive-in is only for senior citizens and specially-abled citizens.”Vaccination will take place for beneficiaries between the age group of 18-44 years at five vaccination centres on Thursday. No walk-ins will be permitted, BMC tweeted on Wednesday. Only those who have registered on the Co-WIN application and received a slot from BMC will get vaccinated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/covid1933807-get-the-jab-in-mumbai-on-wednesday-101620240818034.html

He said 13 FIRs were registered against the accused in eight districts and police recovered 101 vials of the drug from them.“Police have collected 1,249 cylinders as a voluntary contribution from factory owners, welding shop owners, gas-balloons sellers and ordinary citizens and handed over to the district administration,” he said, assuring that police are working tirelessly to stop the black-marketing.The DGP appealed to people to inform the police on black marketing of injections and oxygen cylinders on mobile number 7087089947 and toll-free number 1800-180-1314.SUPPLIER OF REMDESIVIR INJECTION HELD
06-05-2021||Mumbai||Covid-19: Maharashtra sees 920 deaths in a day||Maharashtra on Wednesday breached the 900 death mark for the second time, since the outbreak of the Covid-19 virus last year.On Wednesday, the state recorded 57,640 new Covid-19 cases with 920 deaths. The highest number of deaths in a single day was on April 28 when 985 people had succumbed to Covid-19.The total number of deaths in the state has now reached 72,662, with Mumbai topping the list with 13,511 deaths, followed by 9,863 in Pune.The state currently has 6,41,596 active cases in which Pune tops with 1,14,254 cases followed by Nagpur with 58,944 cases.Deaths may come downDr Tatyarao Lahane, director, Directorate of Medical Education and Research (DMER), said the deaths will stabilise in the coming days. “Most of these patients have been ill for over two weeks and the treatment was delayed. In addition, many of them had already been suffering from medical complications and the virus made it worse,” said Lahane. “However, the death rate will come down in the coming days as even the new cases are coming down,” he added.According to Dr Jeevan Jain, a leading physician from Lalbaug, the current strain of Covid-19 is highly infective and lethal compared to the first wave. “In the second wave, we are seeing the new variant of Covid-19 directly affecting the lungs, which was not the case last year. This is proving to be fatal. Last year, the fever hardly exceeded 100 degree Fahrenheit but this time, the fever is not coming down for a long time, despite administering various medicines. The range of fever now goes up to 103-104 degree Fahrenheit,” said Jain, who has treated more than 15,000 Covid-19 patients to date.Commotion over vaccineThe police personnel lathi-charged at the agitated citizens who had come to vaccinate themselves at Parli in Beed district. There were 30 doses of vaccine available, while hundreds of citizens had lined up outside the centre. The shortage of doses infuriated people. They even pushed the deputy superintendent of police (DYSP) Santosh Walke who had gone to pacify the crowd. This act infuriated the policemen who took to lathi charging. Police have also arrested six people.Oxygen leakage in tankerA leakage was reported in the oxygen tanker along the Pune-Bengaluru highway. This tanker was proceeding towards Kolhapur and the leakages continued for more than half an hour before officials stepped in to plug the same. In Nagpur, 25 minibuses are converted to ambulances.‘Become self-reliant in oxygen supply’Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray on Wednesday said he has asked the administration to ensure that the state becomes self-reliant in oxygen supply by increasing the manufacturing to 1,800 metric tones. Maharashtra daily needs 1,800 metric tonnes (MT) of oxygen. The state has been able to get 1,848 MT of oxygen, of which 1,295 MT is being arranged by the state, while 500 MT is procured from outside. The rest 53 MT is being produced from the 38 pressure swing absorbing (PSA) plants. The state has given a go-ahead to start 382 PSA plants which would produce 240 MT of oxygen informed the CMO.These plants are being constructed on a war footing and would be operational by June end. The state would also enhance the production of liquid medical oxygen and installation of such plants will also be given a green signal. This will boost the oxygen supply by another 300 MT. The state has asked the centre to hike its allocation by 200 MT from outside the state from Jamnagar in Gujarat and Bhilai in Chhatisgarh.Meanwhile, the CMO also said that the Central government has from April 21 to May 4 has dispatched 4,74,791 doses of Remdesivir injection which is 59% of its agreed quota. The state is distributing the same across all regions. The state has also floated global tenders to procure them.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/covid19-maharashtra-sees-920-deaths-in-a-day-101620240697959.html
06-05-2021||Delhi||Covid-19: Why are health bulletins often delayed in Capital?||On Tuesday, the Delhi government failed to release its crucial daily health bulletin, which gives updates on the city’s Covid-19 numbers from the previous day. This was the third time since the pandemic hit the national Capital in March 2020 that the government has been unable to release the bulletin till the end of the day.The second wave of Covid-19 across the country, and the fourth in Delhi, has turned out to be the deadliest one yet in terms of cases and deaths. Delhi is currently recording an average of nearly 23,000 new Covid cases and nearly 400 deaths every day over the past seven days. While every state issues bulletins, some later than others, Delhi’s health bulletins over the past several weeks have often been released late in the night, even though the data is from the previous day -- a decision taken last year after a health bulletin was missed (the logic being that it would be easier to compile the previous day’s data).Experts say that the quick sharing of data is the essence of public health action. “This is a national health emergency and Delhi is now the worst hit city-state. At such a critical juncture, it is critical to release data to the public on time. I do not know if it was just not released to the public, and if officials had it on time. This approach may hinder timely interventions in pandemic management,” said Dr Lalit Kant, former head of the department of epidemiology at the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR).The health bulletins were also not uploaded on the Delhi government website on May 3 and May 4, even as the administration released them to reporters and on social media.In a statement on Wednesday, the Delhi government admitted Tuesday’s delay. “We’d like to sincerely apologise for the delay in sending the health bulletin. It has always been our effort to lay the facts bare in front of the people. Health bulletins are an indicator of how we fare, what factors remain a matter of concern, where the government needs to take immediate measures and where the public can hold us to account. We’re deeply sorry and regret that we were unable to share an important document yesterday. What we can promise, is that this will never happen again in the future. We are also looking into the reasons why it was delayed,” the statement said.The Tuesday bulletin (with Monday’s data, as per the norm), was released at 8.55am on Wednesday. Later that afternoon, the Wednesday bulletin was released as well. A government spokesperson said that there was a serious effort being made to rectify the problem, and that the bulletin would be released in the afternoons, rather than late in the evenings, from now on.The other days when the bulletin did not come till midnight were June 9, 2020 (it was released at 5.30am on June 10); and on April 28 (when it was put out at 12.11am on April 29).A senior official said on condition of anonymity said that a bulk of the data used to prepare the bulletin generally come in by 1pm. “This is the data of the previous day. It comes from hospitals and our team compiles it. These days, because of the surge in case, a few batches of numbers come in by evening, because of which the bulletin sometimes gets delayed. Also, officials who need to sign the bulletin are often in some meeting or the other to handle the Covid-19 crisis.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/covid19-why-are-health-bulletins-often-delayed-in-capital-101620240228304.html
06-05-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra gets 479,000 Covaxin doses; in talks for Sputnik V||The Covid-19 inoculation drive for people between the ages of 18 and 44 is set for a boost as the state government has received nearly 500,000 doses. Currently, the inoculation drive in the third phase is going on at limited centres and with limited doses across the state. Meanwhile, the state government is still deliberating global tenders to procure vaccines from foreign manufacturers to boost the vaccination of the young people. The state government is in talks with Dr Reddy’s Laboratories to procure Sputnik V doses. On Tuesday night, health department officials said the state received 479,000 doses of Covaxin from Bharat Biotech. Officials added that the state will continue to keep the drive at limited centres to keep it sustained for a longer period. “We have received 479,000 doses from Bharat Biotech. The vaccination centres for 18-44 will continue to be five per district, as it has to be a sustained drive with minimum wastage,” said DN Patil, state immunisation officer. Patil added that the fresh stock of Covaxin has been dispatched to all the districts and it will be used in the coming day. In Pune district, the stock was used on Wednesday to vaccinate people in the 18-44 category. On April 30, the state had received 300,000 vaccines from Serum Institute of India, which helped state to start vaccination for 18-44 category from May 1.In the state Cabinet meeting on Wednesday, the ministers deliberated on procuring vaccines from foreign manufacturers, including Russia-made Sputnik V. State health minister Rajesh Tope said the state will hold consultations with Dr Reddy’s Laboratories to procure Sputnik V.However, in absence of a go-ahead from the Centre and low manufacturing capabilities of these companies, the state will depend on Indian manufacturers. A senior official who was present in the meeting said, “The issue of permission from Government of India still remains in place. Besides that, the production of Sputnik V is also not as fast. So, for the time-being we will have to depend on Indian vaccines,” he said, requesting anonymity. On Wednesday, the state inoculated over 250,000 beneficiaries in 5,038 centres across the state. The state’s numbers saw a jump on Wednesday as the state vaccinated around 79,491 and 98,150 on Monday and Tuesday, respectively, owing to less stock. Of the 253,031 beneficiaries vaccinated on Wednesday, 50,796 were from Mumbai and 59,081 were from Pune district. The state has, so far, vaccinated 16,793,770 beneficiaries, of which 2,863,037 have taken their second shot.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-gets-479-000-covaxin-doses-in-talks-for-sputnik-v-101620240457932.html

From nutritional food to sanitising different localities, these youths have come forward to give a befitting reply to the current challenge, using their resources and funds. Activists associated with the Nandi Seva Sansthan, a social organisation of the city, have been engaged in serving the corona positive patients living in home isolation. The organisation has floated a helpline number (9936667701) which can be used to get free food delivered right at home. “We have been delivering good quality food free of cost to corona positive patients living in home isolation in different colonies of the city, adopting safety measures and following the corona guidelines. The members of the organisation prepare and deliver nutritious food to the homes of the patients after receiving orders on WhatsApp”, said Lalu Lal Gupta, senior member of the NGO. Likewise, former general secretary of the Allahabad University Student Union (AUSU), Shivam Singh and his friends too are doing their bit. They held a corona testing camp at Amarnath Jha hostel of Allahabad Univerity on Wednesday. “We are determined to put in our best effort in trying to end this crisis”, said Shivam. His team of volunteers visit designated Covid treating hospitals and provide food for the family members of the patients waiting outside the hospitals. Besides, they give food packets to people sleeping on footpaths, at bus stand etc. Shivam and his friend Sharad Shankar Mishra also sanitise various hostels, areas surrounding AU etc. Shivam said that he started this work early every morning and continued till night. He sanitises battery rickshaws, hostel premises, crossings, roadside shops and bus stand and hospitals—all free of cost using his own funds collected from friends and kin. Joining these efforts is a Mumforganj-based organisation named Akhand Yuva Samiti. Although the organisation is just three years old, a distress call on the WhatAapp number is enough for getting food at the doorstep of a corona positive patient. “We have been delivering around 150 food packets each day in different localities of the city”, informed 23-year old Satyam Kerservani.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/sangam-city-youngsters-go-all-out-to-help-needy-during-pandemic-101620239677815.html
06-05-2021||Delhi||Delhi not getting enough vaccine doses: Arvind Kejriwal||Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Wednesday expressed concerns over the short supply of Covid-19 vaccines, even as he asserted that with the current infrastructure in place, the entire population of Delhi can be vaccinated in three months if supply is scaled up.“In the coming days, we will need a large scale supply of vaccines. The latest consignment we have received is not a large one. With the established procedures in place, we can scale up (the vaccination drive) in 24 hours. But there is a shortage of vaccine production. If production and supply are scaled up, we are capable of vaccinating the entire population of Delhi. Right now, the only obstacle is a short supply of vaccines,” Kejriwal said on the sidelines of his visit to a vaccination centre in central Delhi’s Rajendra Nagar.While vaccination of people aged over 45 years was underway at around 500 sites, the drive was opened to people aged between 18 and 44 years on a wider scale on May 3, in a different set of 300-odd sites scattered across all 11 revenue districts in the city.Government records showed, as on 10am on May 5, Delhi had a balance of 411,030 vaccine doses in the central government’s stock and 377,120 vaccine doses in the state government’s stock. Of the total 788,150 doses, 371,600 were of Covishield -- the Indian version of the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine manufactured by the Pune-based Serum Institute of India (SII) – and the remaining are doses of Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin.Speaking on condition of anonymity, a senior government official said going by the current rate of vaccine coverage in the city, this stock would last for eight to nine days, unless replenished. Government records showed around 89,500 people are getting vaccinated a day on average these days.Delhi’s adult population, as per electoral rolls revised in January, is around 15 million – it essentially means the city needs 30 million doses of vaccines, of which 3.25 doses were already administered by April 30, government data said. On May 1, the Delhi government had received its last consignment of around 450,000 vaccines, said the government official.Kejriwal on Wednesday also expressed concerns over the issue of oxygen shortage and said that the ongoing lockdown is likely to remain imposed till it is necessary.“We are working with the central government to ensure the oxygen shortage problem in Delhi is resolved at the earliest... Even though currently there is a severe shortage of oxygen, we are trying our best to ensure that oxygen shortage should not lead to deaths,” said Kejriwal.On being asked about the lockdown, he said, “It is likely to remain till it is necessary. It is not the government imposing a lockdown. People in Delhi want a lockdown in the light of the surge in cases. The pandemic has taken a massive shape. We are augmenting health infrastructure (during lockdown).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-not-getting-enough-vaccine-doses-arvind-kejriwal-101620239348533.html

She was suffering from fever and sore throat. Her husband was in Mumbai where he is a builder and her two sons, Arjun and Niranjan, were stuck in Dubai. “ The woman died on Monday but no one in the colony was prepared even to touch the body because of Covid -19 fear.

The park is sanitised, including the vehicles that enter the premises bringing food for animals and other purposes,” said Dr Rajkumar Jadhav, director, Rajiv Gandhi Zoological Park and Wildlife Research centre.Post the report of eight Asiatic lions at Hyderabad zoo contracting the coronavirus on Tuesday, the environment ministry has directed zoos, national parks and sanctuaries to remain closed and the officials to strictly follow precautionary measures. “The notification released by the Central Zoo Authority on April 30 includes prevention to sample collection to detection in suspected cases and safety protocols for animal keepers,” said Jadhav.The zoo has limited access to enclosures and holding areas to essential staff. The animal keepers usually wear double masks, face shields, latex gloves, and personal protective gear and regularly undergo RT-PCR tests.Datta Bhagwan Chandane, a senior animal handler who takes care of lions and four Royal Bengal tigers, said, “I have already had my shot of vaccine. We are taking utmost care of animals. We sprinkle bleach powder around the cage and its surroundings. While feeding them or even grooming them, we first dip our feet into potassium permanganate (disinfectant) and always wear gumboots, two layers of hand gloves, plastic and latex gloves,” said Chandane, wearing a mask and head cover before calling out to Subbi, the lioness to get into the enclosure. “The staff while handling the animals maintain a two-meter social distancing and avoid unnecessary contact with animals. Food supplied to animals are cleaned, disinfected and meat is sterilised by dipping in hot water (above 65 degrees Centigrade) for 10 minutes,” Jadhav said..||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/katraj-zoo-under-stricter-covid-prevention-cover-101620224615824.html

The vaccination drive is taking place in the city during the Muslim community’s holy month of Ramadan. While many took the jab before vaccine shortage disrupted the drive, now they are ready for inoculation after breaking the fast following the beginning of Ramadan from April 13, according to community elders. The clerics have appealed for early vaccination as a preventive measure from Covid. The management of Poona College, one of the Muslim educational institutions in the city, has come up with a detailed advisory. “In view of the current pandemic and the severity of Covid-19 cases, I have been directed by the general secretary to inform you all and to impress upon you and your entire teaching and non-teaching staff to take the vaccines at the earliest. This will enable you all to work in a carefree atmosphere when the school reopens. Please note that the vaccines are safe and not fall prey to rumours. Inoculation is the best form of defence to fight this pandemic and follow ‘Covid Appropriate Behaviour’. We hope you will take these instructions from the management seriously,” reads the message from the educational body that runs schools and colleges. Those who took the vaccine before Ramadan have decided to take the second dose after breaking the fast. The dose shortage had left many to miss the vaccination. Anwar Shaikh, Poona College principal, said, “Many Muslims took the vaccine before Ramadan. Long queues were seen outside vaccination centres due to shortage of doses, and many were sent away without getting the jab. We have told the staff to get vaccinated, but they cite doses are unavailable. The state must provide sufficient vaccines to all.” Sajid Shaikh, who is following the Ramadan fasting, said, “I am open to taking the vaccine in Ramadan but there is shortage.

At least 10 suspects were arrested, they said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/25-killed-in-rio-de-janeiro-police-raid-on-drug-gang-101620320715687.html

06-05-2021||World||Germany rejects US proposal to waive patents on Covid-19 vaccines||Germany on Thursday rejected a U.S. proposal to waive patent protection for Covid-19 vaccines, saying the greatest constraints on production were not intellectual property but increasing capacity and ensuring quality.President Joe Biden on Wednesday voiced support for a waiver in a sharp reversal of the U.S. position, and his top trade negotiator, Katherine Tai, swiftly backed negotiations at the World Trade Organization.The German government stood behind the goal of a worldwide supply of Covid-19 vaccines, a government spokeswoman said, adding however that the main factors in vaccine production are capacity and quality standards, and not patents."The protection of intellectual property is a source of innovation and must remain so in the future," the spokeswoman said in a statement.She said Germany supported the COVAX initiative, with the aim of ensuring that as many people in the world as possible have access to vaccines, adding that discussions were continuing at the WTO.The WTO said in April that of 700 million vaccines administered around the world, only 0.2% had been in low-income countries. A recent surge of infections in India, the world's second most populous country, has underlined the point.The European Union is willing to discuss a proposal to waive intellectual property rights for Covid-19 vaccines, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said on Thursday, as drugmakers fought their ground.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/germany-rejects-us-proposal-to-waive-patents-on-covid-19-vaccines-101620318008154.html
06-05-2021||World||Putin backs Russia waiving patents on its Covid-19 vaccines||Russian President Vladimir Putin on Thursday said he supported the idea of a waiver on patent protections for coronavirus vaccines as Russia registered its fourth virus jab called Sputnik Light.A campaign to lift patent protections on Covid-19 vaccines picked up steam on Thursday, with French, German and EU leadership saying they were ready to discuss a proposal by US President Joe Biden, before Putin added his support."We are hearing from Europe an idea that, in my opinion, deserves attention -- namely, to remove patent protections from vaccines against Covid-19 altogether," Putin said during a televised meeting with Deputy Prime Minister Tatiana Golikova."Russia would of course support such an approach," Putin said, urging Golikova to work out the logistics."As I have said many times... We should not think about how to extract maximum profit, but about how to ensure people's safety."Supporters of waivers for vaccines argue that poor countries are struggling to get inoculation drives underway while rich countries protect the intellectual property rights of pharmaceutical giants.Russia has registered three coronavirus vaccines, and on Thursday approved a fourth -- a single-dose version of its Sputnik V jab called Sputnik Light.Moscow has actively pushed Sputnik V -- named after the Soviet-era satellite -- around the world, with more than 60 countries having approved it for use.Russia registered the jab in August before results from large-scale clinical trials, but leading medical journal The Lancet has since said it is safe and more than 90 percent effective.In addition to the Sputnik jabs, Russia has also registered two other homegrown vaccines, the EpiVacCorona and CoviVac.'As simple and reliable as a Kalashnikov'In his meeting with Golikova Thursday, Putin said that while Western countries had developed "innovative" vaccines, Russia's are the safest and most reliable."As simple and reliable as a Kalashnikov assault rifle," he said.The Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF), which helped finance the vaccine, said in a statement that Sputnik Light "demonstrated 79.4 percent efficacy" compared to 91.6 percent for the two-shot Sputnik V.The state-run Gamaleya research institute, which developed Sputnik V, said Thursday that more than 20 million people globally have received their first dose of the shot.Russia, however, has struggled to inoculate its own citizens since beginning its jab drive in early December.Golikova on Thursday told Putin that 9.4 million Russians have been fully vaccinated, while 13.4 million have received their first dose in the country of 144 million people.Polls show many Russians are sceptical of Covid-19 vaccines.Last month Putin said he hoped 70 percent of Russia's adult population will be inoculated by autumn and appealed for all Russians to get a vaccine.The country has been among the hardest hit by Covid-19 with over 112,000 deaths as of Thursday, according to a tally by health officials.But authorities have been criticised for downplaying the severity of the pandemic by counting only fatalities where the coronavirus was found to be the primary cause of death after an autopsy.Figures released by the Rosstat statistics agency last week showed that Russia had actually recorded some 250,000 virus-related deaths by the end of March.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/putin-backs-russia-waiving-patents-on-its-covid-19-vaccines-101620317866768.html
06-05-2021||World||Moderna sees no impact on Covid-19 vaccine from potential patent waiver||Moderna Inc on Thursday said it believes countries around the globe would continue buying its Covid-19 vaccine for years even if patents on the shots are waived, noting that rivals would face significant hurdles in scaling up manufacturing.The comments come a day after the United States said it would support waiving intellectual property rights for Covid-19 vaccines in order to help speed an end to the pandemic, paving the way for what could be months of negotiations to hammer out a specific waiver plan.Moderna shares were off 7.5% after falling as much as nearly 12% earlier. Shares of other Covid-19 vaccine manufacturers like Pfizer Inc were also down on the patent news."While this is a negative headline," said Morgan Stanley analysts in a research note, there is no mechanism "to force management to teach other manufacturers how to make their vaccine, suggesting no change to the status quo."Moderna, which said in October it would not enforce patents on its vaccine during the pandemic, noted the lack of companies able to rapidly scale up complex manufacturing of a similar vaccine to meet surging global demand."They will have to go run a clinical trial, get the data, get the product approved and scale manufacturing. This does not happen in 6 or 12 or 18 months," Moderna Chief Executive Stephane Bancel said on a post-earnings conference call.Moderna has faced its own hurdles scaling up production with some shortfalls in the manufacturing supply chain, which includes Swiss contract manufacturer Lonza Group, leading to delivery delays in Europe.Bancel said he has had to tell some countries, "we're very sorry. We have no more supply for you in 2021."Still, the company said it expects to produce between 800 million to 1 billion doses this year.Moderna raised its 2021 sales forecast for its Covid-19 shot by 4.3% to $19.2 billion on Thursday, two days after Pfizer increased its full-year Covid-19 vaccine sales forecast more than 70% to $26 billion.Moderna expects vaccine output could increase to 3 billion doses in 2022 to meet demand from nations looking to stock up supplies and sign up deals for "booster" doses.Early clinical trial data released on Wednesday showed that a third dose of either Moderna's current shot or an experimental new vaccine increases immunity against the more easily transmissible virus variants first found in Brazil and South Africa.Moderna, which is seeking to expand authorization of its vaccine to children and adolescents, on Thursday said an initial analysis of a study in those aged 12 to 17 showed an efficacy rate of 96%.The company also reported its first-ever quarterly profit on sales of the vaccine.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/moderna-sees-no-impact-on-covid-19-vaccine-from-potential-patent-waiver-101620316434795.html

06-05-2021||World||US jobless claims fall to pandemic low of 498,000||The number of Americans seeking unemployment aid fell last week to 498,000, the lowest point since the viral pandemic struck 14 months ago and a sign of the job market's growing strength as businesses reopen and consumers step up spending.Thursday's report from the Labor Department showed that applications declined 92,000 from a revised 590,000 a week earlier. The number of weekly jobless claims — a rough measure of the pace of layoffs — has declined significantly from a peak of 900,000 in January as employers have ramped up hiring.At the same time, the pace of applications is still well above the roughly 230,000 level that prevailed before the viral outbreak tore through the economy in March of last year.As vaccinations have been more widely administered, restrictions on businesses have gradually lifted and consumers have become more willing to travel, shop and dine out, stronger spending has boosted hiring, slowed layoffs and accelerated growth. The economy grew last quarter at a vigorous 6.4% annual rate, with expectations that the current quarter will be even better.In March, employers added nearly 1 million jobs, the most since August. Roughly the same number is expected to be reported Friday when the government issues the jobs report for April. Even so, the economy will still be more than 7 million jobs short of its pre-pandemic level.The government’s report Thursday showed that about 16.2 million people were continuing to collect unemployment benefits in the week that ended April 17, down from 16.6 million in the previous week. That's a sign that some former recipients have found jobs.As economic growth has accelerated, sales of vehicles and newly built homes have soared, manufacturing output has risen and Americans on average have increased their savings and wealth. In part, this is because of $1,400 stimulus checks that were distributed to most adults and in part because many affluent households have built up savings while working from home and have benefited from a surging stock market.The economy, though, is restarting so quickly that it’s creating supply bottlenecks and parts shortages. Many companies, especially restaurants, can’t find enough applicants to fill available jobs. Others are raising pay to attract more applicants.Shortages of raw materials and parts have swollen prices for lumber, copper and semiconductor chips, which are critical to the housing and auto industries, among other sectors. Those higher costs, along with wage pressures, have elevated fears that inflation could accelerate.Analysts have forecast that when the monthly jobs report is released Friday, it will show that the economy added 975,000 jobs in April, according to data provider FactSet, and that the unemployment rate fell from 6% to 5.8%. That would show that more Americans are looking for work and more employers are hiring them.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-jobless-claims-fall-to-pandemic-low-of-498000-101620305542092.html
06-05-2021||World||France, Britain send patrol boats to Jersey in post-Brexit fishing row||France and Britain deployed maritime patrol vessels to the waters off the Channel island of Jersey on Thursday as a dispute over post-Brexit fishing rights escalated.The European Union called for calm over the row, which on Thursday saw a flotilla of French trawlers sail in protest to Jersey's main harbour and a French minister suggest earlier in the week that Paris might cut electricity to the island.French fishermen say they are being unfairly deprived of access to rich fishing grounds off the coast of Jersey, a self-governing British Crown Dependency.Jersey says it is following the rules for issuing licenses set out in Britain's post-Brexit trade deal with the European Union.British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who led the 2016 Brexit campaign, had cast the trade deal as a way to take back control of the United Kingdom's destiny after Brexit.On Thursday, he said the two Royal Navy vessels would remain off Jersey as a precautionary measure, according to his office.An official from the French presidency said the deployment of patrol vessels from both France and Britain was aimed at preventing clashes between trawlers on opposing sides of the row.France is angry on April 30 Jersey issued 41 licenses with what the Paris government called unilaterally imposed conditions, including the time French fishing vessels could spend in Jersey's waters.Jersey officials have said the accord stipulates licenses take into account how much time a vessel spent in Jersey's waters before Brexit.FRENCH FLOTILLAThe Europe Commission said that until further justifications had been provided by Britain, Jersey officials should not be attaching new conditions to the issuance of licenses."Full compliance with the TCA (Brexit trade deal) is essential in this process," Commission spokeswoman Vivian Loonela told a news briefing.A fleet of about 50 fishing boats approached Jersey, which lies 14 miles off northern French shores and 85 miles from Britain's southern coast, at dawn, with some crew holding red flares aloft.At least one French trawler entered the harbour and briefly blocked the Commodore Goodwill, a cargo vessel and ferry that connects the Channel islands to the British mainland.The French presidency official said the deployment of patrol vessels spoke of France's concern and frustration, as well as a desire "for the correct application of agreements," sealed when Britain left the EU.Ship-tracking website marinetraffic.com showed one of the two French vessels, Athos, located approximately 20 km south-east of Jersey.It was at least 20 km away from the two British naval vessels, the HMS Severn and HMS Tamar, which were on the south-western side of the island.Jersey government officials said they would meet representatives of the protesters to listen to their concerns.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/france-britain-send-patrol-boats-to-jersey-in-post-brexit-fishing-row-101620307077657.html
06-05-2021||World||Covid-19: Setback to Biden’s vaccine push as average shots per day down 37%||President Joe Biden is running out of Americans willing to roll up their sleeves for Covid-19 shots, dragging out his bid to vanquish the pandemic and forcing the administration to refocus its vaccination strategy.Biden and his aides detailed the latest phase of his pandemic response this week as domestic demand for vaccinations dries up and inoculations slide. The U.S. is now giving an average of 2.13 million shots a day, down from 3.37 million about three weeks ago. And on Tuesday, which has the lowest shots of any day of the week, fewer than a million were given for the first time since February.In response, Biden is altering his strategy. The administration announced this week that it would concentrate more on smaller clinics and mobile sites in rural areas, while planning to wind down mass-vaccination sites.The low-hanging fruit in the U.S. vaccine campaign is gone, and the modesty of Biden’s latest goal reflects the challenge: He has pledged about another 100 million shots in the next 60 days. That’s the same pace as his first 100 million, when vaccines were at a premium, but roughly half the pace of his second 100 million.“It’s going to get more granular, I think, rather than large,” Biden said at the White House this week.He again pleaded for Americans to get shots, and cast the slowdown as long expected.“At the end of the day, most people will be convinced by the fact that their failure to get the vaccine may cause other people to get sick and maybe die,” he said.Vaccine Tracker: More than 1.21 Billion ShotsBiden’s challenge would be the envy of nearly every other country -- a surplus of shots and a shortage of arms. Across the U.S., 57% of adults have received at least one dose. Biden hopes to hit 70% by July.Slowing PaceA Kaiser Family Foundation poll released Thursday found that 9% of respondents in April hadn’t gotten the vaccine but still planned to as soon as possible, down from 30% a month earlier. Another 15% said they’d wait and see, while 19% said they would never get it or would do so only if required. Lack of information remains a hurdle -- 29% of respondents, and 42% of Hispanic respondents, said they’re not sure if they’re yet eligible.“There is no one-size-fits-all approach to reaching these different groups, and a variety of strategies will be needed,” foundation Executive Vice President Mollyann Brodie said in a statement.The impact of a slowing inoculation rate remains unclear. U.S. Covid cases are falling, with the 7-day average of new cases now 12% lower than the week before. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention published research Wednesday that modeled trend lines for U.S. case numbers in several scenarios. In two of them, high vaccination rates drive new cases down to nearly nothing by September, while two models with lower vaccination rates still forecast a decline, though not as sharply.“These modeled scenarios show that ongoing efforts to continue to increase vaccination coverage and maintain physical distancing, masking, isolation, and quarantine are warranted,” the authors wrote.CDC Director Rochelle Walensky said the study offers both hope and a warning.“The results remind us that we have the path out of this,” she said at a briefing Wednesday. But spreading variants of the virus could keep the pandemic simmering for months to come if vaccinations lag, she said.“We need to keep vaccinating people, but we all need to keep practicing certain prevention interventions to help us get to the predicted good outcomes,” she said.Biden’s team, meanwhile, has backed away from predicting a threshold for so-called herd immunity, when enough of the population is vaccinated to prevent the virus’s spread. Biden’s medical advisers have said “it’s a probably a phrase that doesn’t really apply here to this particular virus in this circumstance,” White House Chief of Staff Ron Klain told CNN this week.Some experts downplay the vaccination slowdown, pointing to Israel, which saw a sharp decline in cases when roughly 40% of its population was fully vaccinated. As of now, 45% of people in the U.S. -- including kids, who aren’t eligible for shots -- have one dose and 32% are fully vaccinated.Some level of decline was inevitable. “While I want to have as high a vaccination rate as possible, I’m not worried about it,” said Amesh Adalja, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security. The point of vaccinations was to reduce Covid-19 hospitalizations and deaths, and high uptake of shots among more vulnerable people has already begun to do that, he said.“We knew that, when we went into the general population, there was going to be less of a motivation for vaccination, and we would hit a wall, but we’re still seeing the benefits of the vaccine,” he said.Biden’s team has downplayed the slowing pace of shots, saying it was always expected as the number of vaccinated people increased. They draw a distinction between the holdouts -- some are skeptics, while others are willing to get the shot but simply won’t seek it out. Polls show the the number of people who say they won’t get the shot has been falling.The White House has worked for months “to get prepared to make sure that vaccines find people if people aren’t going out of the way to find them, to make it easy, and to make sure that people’s questions get answered,” adviser Andy Slavitt said Wednesday.Text for ShotsThe administration’s new phase includes three pillars. One is making vaccines easier to find.The government has created a text-message tool and websites to find appointments, and has ordered pharmacies to make more walk-in appointments available.The administration also will begin shipping more vaccine to rural health clinics and mobile sites, in part to focus on the roughly 10% of Americans who live more than 5 miles from a vaccine site.Biden is also working with businesses to set up incentives for people to get a shot. For example, his team on Wednesday touted discounts offered at Albertsons Cos. Inc. Safeway stores, CVS Health Corp. stores and Target Corp. for people who get vaccinated.Secondly, Biden’s team is trying to persuade reticent Americans to get shots, urging them to talk to their doctors, pharmacists, faith leaders or vaccinated neighbors.“Nearly 85% of seniors have had at least one vaccination shot, and the wide cross-section of the nation trust the vaccine regardless of race or ideology,” Biden said. “Now we need to make that same progress for those under 65 years of age.”Biden appealed to younger people to get the shot. “Even if your chance of getting seriously ill is low, why take the risk when you have a safe, free, and convenient way to prevent it?”Finally, Biden is preparing a push for vaccinating adolescents. Pfizer Inc.’s shot may soon be authorized for children age 12 to 15 -- potentially opening eligibility to millions who can’t get a shot now.If authorized, the administration will move quickly to distribute shots through existing channels, including about 20,000 pharmacies, as well as through pediatricians’ offices. Biden will push to get as many teenagers as possible their first shot by July, to ensure they’re fully vaccinated in time for school in the fall.(Updates with KFF poll in ninth and tenth paragraphs)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2021 Bloomberg L.P.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-setback-to-biden-s-vaccine-push-as-average-shots-per-day-down-37-101620306416144.html

Here’s why||The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) on Wednesday warned about the worrying surge in coronavirus disease (Covid-19) cases in Nepal. The Himalayan nation, which shares an extensive border with India, is reporting around 230 daily confirmed Covid-19 cases per million people, a similar number India was reporting two weeks ago."What is happening in India right now is a horrifying preview of Nepal’s future if we cannot contain this latest Covid surge that is claiming more lives by the minute," Dr Netra Prasad Timsina, chair of the Nepal Red Cross, said in a statement.Across Nepal, 44% of Covid-19 tests returned positive results last weekend, according to government authorities quoted by IFRC. The global humanitarian network highlighted that many hospitals in Nepal, especially southern towns near Indian borders, are full and overflowing with Covid-19 patients. It further warned about the “grave fears of mass deaths” if the coronavirus continues spreading unchecked across the country.According to IFRC, Nepal is recording 57 times more cases than this time last month when the country was reporting less than five daily cases per million people. On Wednesday, Nepal registered over 8,600 new cases of Covid-19, the highest since the start of the pandemic.“It is beyond distressing to see that people cannot say goodbye to their loved ones as cremations are taking place at record levels due to these new Covid variants, which are striking down people of all ages in Nepal,” Dr Timsina stated.Also Read | It’s not just India. New virus waves hit developing nationsThe humanitarian aid organisation noted that other neighbours of India like Bangladesh and Pakistan have also been severely impacted by another wave driven by new variants. Alexander Matheou, Asia Pacific director for the IFRC, stressed that though all eyes are currently on India, other countries across South Asia may be facing the same in the coming weeks.“We need to act now and we need to act fast to have any hope of containing this human catastrophe. This virus has no respect for borders and these variants are running rampant across Asia,” said Matheou.Nepal has fewer doctors per capita than India, as per the global health observatory of the World Health Organization (WHO), and also has a lower vaccination rate than its neighbour. As of April 28, only about 7% of the Nepali population had been administered with at least one dose of the Covid-19 vaccine. Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli has urged foreign donors to supply vaccines and critical care medicines to prevent a collapse of the country's health infrastructure. Dr Samir Adhikari, a spokesperson for Nepal's ministry of health and population, on Monday said that the situation in the country is worsening every day and “may go out of control in future."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/indias-covid-19-situation-horrifying-preview-of-nepal-s-future-here-s-why-101620304849520.html
06-05-2021||World||Russia authorises single-dose Sputnik Light Covid-19 vaccine for use||Russia has authorised the one-shot Sputnik Light version of its Covid-19 vaccine for use, the Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF) said on Thursday, a move that could help vaccine supplies go further in countries with high infection rates.Developed by Moscow's Gamaleya Institute, the slimmed-down vaccine, which the RDIF said is 79.4% effective against Covid-19 and costs under $10 a dose, has been earmarked for export and could increase the number of people with partial immunity.One of its main potential uses is as a vaccine that can be shipped to a country in the grip of an acute outbreak which needs to be subdued quickly."The single-dose Sputnik Light vaccine demonstrated 79.4% efficacy according to analysed data taken from 28 days after the injection was administered as part of Russia's mass vaccination programme between 5 December 2020 and 15 April 2021," the RDIF said in a statement.A Phase III clinical trial involving 7,000 people was under way in Russia, the United Arab Emirates, Ghana and other countries, the RDIF said. Interim results are expected later this month.According to authorities, around 8 million Russians have so far been fully inoculated with the flagship two-dose Sputnik V, named after the Soviet-era satellite that triggered the space race in a nod to the project's geopolitical importance for Moscow.Russian scientists last month said Sputnik V was 97.6% effective against Covid-19 in a "real-world" assessment based on data from 3.8 million people.The slower pace of vaccination in Russia compared to other countries with domestically produced vaccines has provoked questions over its export intentions from some European officials. The European Medicines Agency has not yet approved the shot and Austria on Tuesday said it would only buy Sputnik V after EMA approval."The single-dose regimen solves the challenge of immunizing large groups in a shorter time, which is especially important during the acute phase of the spread of coronavirus, achieving herd immunity faster," said RDIF head Kirill Dmitriev.He added that the two-dose Sputnik V vaccine would remain the main source of vaccination in Russia, which has already authorised two other vaccines for use.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russia-authorises-single-dose-sputnik-light-covid-19-vaccine-for-use-101620304211510.html

And, Beijing was furious last year when Australia was among the first countries to call for an independent investigation into the origins of the novel coronavirus, which started from the central Chinese city of Wuhan in late 2019.CHINA CONDEMNS G7 STATEMENTChina condemned on Thursday a joint statement by G7 foreign ministers, which expressed support for Chinese-claimed Taiwan, saying it was a gross interference in China’s internal affairs.In a rare step, the G7 statement also said they supported Taiwan’s participation in World Health Organisation forums and the World Health Assembly - and expressed concern about “any unilateral actions that could escalate tensions” in the Taiwan Strait.In Beijing, Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Wang said the statement made “groundless accusations” which were a gross interference in China’s internal affairs, which it firmly condemned.The G7 as a group should take concrete action to boost the global economic recovery instead of disrupting it, he added.The G7 statement was welcomed in Taiwan where the government said this was the first time foreign ministers had mentioned the island in their joint communique.The G7 is an intergovernmental organisation consisting of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the UK, and the US.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-suspends-economic-dialogue-mechanism-with-australia-101620299692034.html

He accused them of “blatantly meddling” in China’s affairs.“China strongly condemns it,” Wang said at a press briefing.The officials from the United States, Japan, Germany, Britain, France, Italy and Canada said they were “deeply concerned” about Beijing's treatment of Uyghur and other minorities. But they announced no formal joint action in response to reports of mass detentions, forced labor and forced sterilization.The Biden administration wants to assemble a coalition to respond to China’s economic and strategic assertiveness. But some European governments are more cautious about dealing with the government of an important export market.Beijing rejects complaints that it mistreats minorities and says camps in Xinjiang are for job training to promote economic development and combat radicalism among the western region’s predominantly Muslim population.China also was irked that G-7 governments for the first time unanimously recommended Taiwan be allowed “meaningful participation” in the WHO. Wednesday's statement cited Taiwan's success in controlling the coronavirus.The communist Beijing government says Taiwan, which split with the mainland in 1949 after a civil war, has no right to conduct foreign relations or participate in global bodies as a sovereign government.“Taiwan’s participation in international organizations, including the activities of the World Health Organization, which is composed of sovereign states, must be handled in accordance with the one-China principle,” Wang said.G-7 governments should be working on improving access to coronavirus vaccines for developing countries instead of “making accusations and interfering with other countries in a condescending way,” Wang said.“Attempts to disregard the basic norms of international relations and to create various excuses to interfere in China’s internal affairs, undermine China’s sovereignty and smear China’s image will never succeed,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/strongly-condemn-china-rejects-g-7-criticism-on-human-rights-economic-record-101620297613982.html

"I didn't really want to name him Glenn."Instead she asked Dr. Glenn, who gave his adopted children Hawaiian middle names, for a suggestion. He offered “Kaimana,” which is now one of the boy’s middle names.The child will have to stay in the hospital's neonatal intensive care unit he is full term, about another 10 weeks, Mounga said.“The aloha spirit is definitely felt here,” she said about the care she has received in Hawaii.“It's very different from the mainland," Mounga said. “It just feels comforting, and everyone is willing to help.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/mom-who-gave-birth-on-flight-didn-t-know-she-was-pregnant-101620294740537.html
06-05-2021||World||China suspends economic dialogue with Australia, relations plunge to new lows||China on Thursday suspended an economic dialogue with Australia, stepping up a pressure campaign that began over Australian support for a probe of the coronavirus and has disrupted exports to the country's biggest foreign market.Relations have plunged to a multi-decade low since Beijing blocked imports of Australian coal, wheat and other goods over the past year. But it has failed to force Prime Minister Scott Morrison’s government to offer concessions.The suspension follows Australia’s decision last month, citing “national interest,” to cancel two deals signed by the state of Victoria with China’s multibillion-dollar “Belt and Road” construction initiative. Beijing warned then it might respond.The step “signals a deterioration” in official ties but is largely symbolic, said Caitlin Byrne, a specialist on Australia’s diplomatic relations in the Asia-Pacific region. She said officials haven’t met under the dialogue since 2017.“It’s certainly an important and symbolic move, but in terms of substance, the impact here is limited,” said Byrne, director of the Griffith Asia Institute at Australia's Griffith University.Beijing will “indefinitely suspend all activities” under the China-Australia Strategic Economic Dialogue, said a statement by the Cabinet’s planning agency, the National Development and Reform Commission.A foreign ministry spokesman gave no details for why but accused Australia of abusing “so-called national security reasons to severely restrict and suppress economic and cultural cooperation projects.”“We urge the Australian side to abandon the Cold War mentality and ideological prejudice" and “stop the crazy crackdown on China-Australia cooperation,” said the spokesman, Wang Wenbin.China holds annual economic dialogues with Australia, the United States and some other governments to discuss trade disputes and other issues.“This is unfortunate. We do need dialogue with China,” said Australian opposition leader Anthony Albanese in Sydney. “It can’t be just on their terms, though. It’s got to be on both countries’ terms.”China's relations with Australia, India and some other neighbors are increasingly strained by the ruling Communist Party's assertiveness abroad, including claims to disputed territory and accusations Beijing tries to influence politics in Australia and other Western democracies.China blocked imports of most Australian goods last year after its government called for an investigation into the coronavirus, which emerged in central China in late 2019.Chinese ministers refuse to take calls from their Australian counterparts.Australian Trade Minister Dan Tehan expressed disappointment in a statement.“We remain open to holding the dialogue and engaging at a ministerial level,” Tehan said.China is Australia’s No. 1 foreign market, but the sanctions impact has been limited because Chinese steel mills still buy Australian iron ore, the country’s most valuable export.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-suspends-economic-dialogue-with-australia-relations-plunge-to-new-lows-101620294841908.html
06-05-2021||World||Joe Biden ready to push case for $2.3 trillion infrastructure plan in Louisiana||President Joe Biden will push the case for his $2.3 trillion infrastructure plan in the reliably Republican state of Louisiana — directly challenging GOP lawmakers who say that low taxes for corporations and the wealthy will fuel economic growth.Biden is leaning into the stagecraft of the presidency on Thursday by choosing to speak in the city of Lake Charles in front of a 70-year-old bridge that is 20 years past its designed lifespan.Even as he engages with Republicans in Washington, Biden is trying to sell their voters on the idea that higher corporate taxes can provide $115 billion for roads and bridges and hundreds of billions of dollars more to upgrade the electrical grid, make the water system safer, rebuild homes and jump-start the manufacturing of electric vehicles.A White House official, who insisted on anonymity to discuss the speech ahead of delivery, said Biden would pose a basic question to voters about whether tax cuts for big companies and CEOs will make the country stronger than programs designed to bolster the middle class.Biden hinted at the theme when answering questions from reporters after a Wednesday speech at the White House that also emphasized his separate $1.8 trillion plan for education and children to be funded by higher taxes on the wealthiest Americans.“What's going to grow America more?” Biden said. “What's going to help you and your security more? The super wealthy having to pay 3.9% less tax or having an entire generation of Americans having associate degrees?”Biden then began to whisper: “Guess what. It grows the economy. Benefits everybody. Hurts nobody.”Republican lawmakers have doubled down on low taxes as a core pillar of their ideology and partisan identity. Several GOP senators favor spending $568 billion on infrastructure over five years, a small fraction of what the Democratic president has proposed — a sign of how difficult a deal might be.Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky said that Republicans would rather finance infrastructure through user fees such as tolls and gasoline taxes, though he declined to specify which fees he would back.“We're open to doing a roughly $600 billion package, which deals with what all of us agree is infrastructure and to talk about how to pay for that in any way other than reopening the 2017 tax reform bill,” McConnell said Monday at the University of Louisville.The Biden administration is banking that its message could play in Louisiana, which last backed a Democratic presidential candidate in 1996. Louisiana has been barraged by 30 extreme weather events over the past decade that caused $50 billion worth of damage. Biden is seeking $50 billion to make infrastructure better able to withstand storms, winds and flooding.Hurricanes battered Lake Charles, a city of 78,000 residents, twice last year over the course of six weeks. Biden also plans to tour a water plant in New Orleans.His infrastructure package received support in a newspaper editorial last week by Lake Charles Mayor Nic Hunter, a Republican, and Shreveport Mayor Adrian Perkins, a Democrat.“The unfortunate truth is that our aging infrastructure and local government budgets cannot withstand the strain of increasingly frequent storms,” they wrote. “As mayors of great American cities in the South, we lie awake at night dreading each forecasted storm.”There is general agreement among Democrats and Republicans in Washington about the need for infrastructure spending. But there are two significant hurdles for Biden's proposal to garner Republican backing.First, Republican lawmakers would prefer a narrower definition of infrastructure that is concentrated on roads, bridges, airports, transit and broadband rather than renewable energy and access to caregivers. Second, they object to Biden's proposal to pay for his plan by undoing the 2017 tax cuts signed into law by President Donald Trump. Biden is seeking to raise the corporate tax rate from 21% to 28%.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-ready-to-push-case-for-2-3-trillion-infrastructure-plan-in-louisiana-101620293897602.html

They were enforcing a ban on travel by air, land, sea, and rail announced in April which is due to be in place between May 6-17.Millions of people in the world’s largest Muslim-majority nation traditionally “mudik” or return home to visit their families for the celebrations.But senior health officials have expressed concern about the emergence of new and more virulent coronavirus mutations across Indonesia, including two cases this week of the B.1.617 variant, which was first identified in India late last year and is ravaging the country.Indonesia has seen the highest number of coronavirus cases and deaths in Southeast Asia.Despite the risks, some people still tried to dodge the rules early on Thursday, with police saying on Twitter that several individuals had tried to leave the capital city by hiding out on the back of a vegetable truck."I will still try to return home because this has become a tradition even though we have not gone home for two years already," said 44-year old Basuki Riyanto, who was contemplating how to get to Central Java province on Thursday."I will try to go ahead regardless of the conditions if there is a closure."Indonesia has reported a total of 1,691,658 confirmed coronavirus cases and 46,349 Covid-19 deaths.Earlier this week, the country's health minister said the first two cases of the Indian variant had been identified in Jakarta. Some 13 cases of the B.117 variant first detected in the United Kingdom were previously discovered in the country.The risk of a spike in Covid-19 infections is weighing on Indonesia's economic outlook this year. Household consumption, the biggest component in the country's gross domestic product (GDP), shrank in the first quarter of 2021.Southeast Asia's biggest economy slumped 0.74% year-on-year in the January-March period, contracting for a fourth consecutive quarter, official data showed on Wednesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/indonesia-begins-its-eid-al-fitr-travel-ban-as-some-try-to-skirt-rules-101620292108469.html

Most of the cases reported on Wednesday were in the crowded capital Male.Restrictions have been placed on movement between islands, although there are no curbs on tourists headed to private island resorts if they can produce a negative Covid-19 test. The health agency also ordered mandatory physical distancing in mosques."The numbers are very high. If we are not able to significantly lower these numbers, we are going to face very difficult days. So we have to get ready," said Mabrook Azeez, the spokesman for the President's Office.There were large gatherings during the council elections held on April 10, and mass groupings have only increased during Ramadan, with communal prayers being held without any physical distancing in the capital Male.Australian cricketers and staff involved in the Indian Premier League are headed to the Maldives after the tournament's abrupt suspension over the coronavirus crisis in India. They will quarantine there before heading home.Vaccination queues in the Maldives have also lengthened during Ramadan due to shortened hours, with thousands lining up without any physical distancing to get their shots.Azeez said the government is looking for foreign medical workers and local volunteers to staff the main public hospital in Male.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/maldives-imposes-night-curfew-after-steep-jump-in-covid-19-infections-101620292092524.html

Are you like this dog who can't wait to go out and play?" said the post in Chinese, which was accompanied by a video of an excited puppy trying to climb over a safety gate.The post drew an angry backlash from some Weibo users, however, who felt the comparison was inappropriate, and was later deleted."Is this American humour? I believe they did it on purpose!" one user wrote."Dogs in American culture basically have positive meanings, but in Chinese culture and idioms, they are mostly negative," wrote another user. Others quipped that the students' "master" was now calling them back to the United States.The Global Times, an English-language tabloid run by the Chinese Communist Party's People's Daily, also cited netizens as saying that the post was "blatant racism".A U.S. embassy spokesman in Beijing issued an apology on Thursday morning to anyone who had been offended by the comments."The social media post in question was meant to be light-hearted and humorous," he said. "We took it down immediately when we saw it was not received in the spirit we intended."It is not the first time animal-related remarks have sparked a backlash in China. In 2019, a senior economist from UBS was placed on leave after comments about pigs in China were perceived by some as a racial slur. He was later reinstated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/are-you-like-this-dog-us-embassy-social-media-post-on-student-visa-backfires-101620290660647.html

It started ebbing in July after seeing its peak in June, the report said.However, the cases spiked towards the end of the year, dubbed by the experts as the second wave.The third wave of the disease started in March, the report added.So far over 18,537 COVID-19 deaths have been reported in Pakistan since the beginning of the pandemic last year while the number of active Covid-19 cases is 845,833 as of May 5, media reports said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/provinces-in-pakistan-announce-complete-covid-19-lockdown-during-eid-report-101620291028844.html

Cascade shifted about $1.8 billion of shares in Canadian National Railway Co. and AutoNation Inc. this week to French Gates, Bloomberg reported Tuesday.Their separation is expected to involve a wealth transfer on a scale that’s only been seen in a few other divorces, though few details have yet emerged. It could also have ramifications for one of the most important philanthropic organizations on the planet. The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation has given away more than $50 billion to support health care, education, gender equality and efforts to combat climate change.Cascade transferred a stake worth about $120 million in Coca-Cola Femsa and a holding valued at about $386 million in Grupo Televisa to French Gates, according to Bloomberg calculations based on the filings.Gates, the 65-year-old co-founder of Microsoft Corp., is worth $144.2 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. French Gates, 56, is a former Microsoft manager who’s gained international prominence co-running the foundation, and more recently for starting Pivotal Ventures, an investment and incubation company to advance “social progress” in the U.S.Bill Gates’s biggest asset is Cascade Investment, which he created with the proceeds of Microsoft stock sales and dividends. Cascade oversees a vast portfolio comprising real estate, energy and hospitality as well as stakes in dozens of public companies.The biggest public position is agricultural-machinery maker Deere & Co., with Cascade holding more than 10% of the stock valued at about $12 billion, followed by an $11.8 billion stake in waste-collection company Republic Services Inc., Bloomberg data show. That’s followed by Canadian National and Ecolab Inc.Most of the portfolio, overseen by money manager Michael Larson, is comprised of North American companies, but it also owns stock in Diageo Plc, the world’s largest distiller, and London-based private-jet services firm Signature Aviation Plc.The divorce comes two years after the 2019 separation announcement of Jeff Bezos and MacKenzie Scott, another billionaire tech couple in Washington State. That split led to a division in the couple’s 16% stake in Amazon.com Inc., with Bezos getting 75% of the holding and Scott 25%.The Gateses are also among the largest landowners in America and have homes including their 66,000 square-foot mansion in Medina, Washington.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/melinda-gates-gets-billions-in-shares-from-cascade-bill-gates-s-biggest-asset-101620290640573.html

They also say waiving patents would not instantly resolve the problem, with a lack of sufficient manufacturing capacity.Vaccine-making is also complicated, as evidenced by production problems of AstraZeneca, and would also require a transfer of technology, know-how, and personnel.The United States said on Wednesday it supported the waiver, although trade chief Katherine Tai cautioned that negotiations would take time.Von der Leyen said that, in the short run, the European Union called upon all vaccine-producing countries to allow exports and to avoid measures that disrupt supply chains.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/european-union-ready-to-discuss-covid-19-vaccine-patent-waiver-101620290894650.html
06-05-2021||World||If India is in dire straits, then world is in dire straits, says USIBC president||If India is in dire straits, then the world is in dire straits, the head of a top business advocacy group has said, as the US corporate sector mounted an unprecedented effort to help India successfully fight the Covid-19 pandemic.“The speed with which the Covid crisis in India has escalated and ravaged the entire country, it has created a sense of urgency in the corporate community,” Nisha Desai Biswal, president of US India Business Council told PTI in an interview.She said that the US companies were probably the first to realise that things were moving in a perilous direction, as they were hearing about it from their workforce in India.As a result, they started mobilising early on. It was about two weeks ago that the American business community started mobilising their resources.A newly created Global Task Force on Pandemic Response, composed of CEOs of top 40 companies, announced an effort to provide massive immediate assistance to India including shipping 1,000 ventilators and 25,000 oxygen concentrators.The Task Force, through its Steering Committee, is working closely with the White House, the US State Department and the US Agency for International Development to coordinate corporate donations and with the Indian Government as well.Last week, it had a meeting with Secretary of State Antony Blinken, and on Wednesday morning it had a meeting with Indian officials in particular from the Niti Aayog.“We have mobilised an outpouring of support from the corporate community from across sectors,” she said.The companies that mobilised on the ventilator initiative range from Facebook and Amazon to Goldman Sachs, Bank of America, Amway, Qualcomm, VMware, Union Pacific, McCormick and Cardinal Health.One of the driving forces has been Accenture and Microsoft, she said, adding that IBM has played a critical role in supporting this overall effort.She praised the efforts of the US India Strategic and Partnership Forum in mobilising resources towards oxygen cylinders and oxygen concentrators.“We have not seen in any prior instance this kind of an effort to create a unified coordinated structure,” Biswal said.“What is unfolding in India, we recognise is not going to stay with India. This is a pandemic that has been ravaging around the world,” she said.“If we're seeing a new phase unfold in India, then we know that that is something that we need to prepare to address in India because the country is so critically important. It’s a humanitarian driver. It is also a driver that recognises that a global pandemic response is not possible and not effective without India playing its critically important role,” she said.“So, if India is in dire straits, then the world is in dire straits and we all need to band together to support India, and band together to figure out how we manage this next phase,” Biswal, who previously served as Assistant Secretary of State for South and Central Asian Affairs, said in response to a question.Describing India as the critical component to the global economy, she said the service economy in India is critical to the functioning of the financial sector, the functioning of the insurance industry and even hospital and university administration in the United States has key elements of operations in India.“It is also a vital part of the pharmaceutical supply chain, and the vaccine supply chain,” Biswal said, adding that they affect both India and the world.While the focus is on meeting the needs of the Indian people, they are also thinking about the needs of the global economy.“Because we want to make sure that one, the economic wellbeing and livelihoods of the Indian people, but also their ability to engage with, and be a fundamental part of the global economy is also protected and preserved and sustained as best as possible,” Biswal said.“We are bringing in so many key actors from the business community. We are also reaching out to some partners in the nonprofit community to make sure that we are sensitive to the communities and the people that are impacted by this crisis,” she said.Punit Renjen, the Deloitte CEO, told PTI that it’s India’s hour of need and as such, it is time for the world to step up its efforts and help it address the Covid-19 crisis.“This is India's hour of need. India helped us out when we were going through it in the Western world. And it is up to us to step up, not only for the people that call India home but for all of us,” Renjen said.“This is a global crisis. If the virus is in one environment, and then mutates, it will impact everybody. No one is safe unless all of us are safe. So, we have to step up. This is the right thing to do. It is also the right thing to do for each of us as business leaders,” Renjen said.“This is going to be a long fight,” said Renjen, whose mother based in Rohtak has tested positive with Covid-19 and several of his family members along with a large number of the estimated 50,000 Deloitte employees in India.To address the current situation, he said, Deloitte is encouraging its 300,000 professionals across the globe to give to three charities: GiveIndia, United Way India and the PM Cares Fund.Deloitte as part of the global business Task Force is focused on getting immediate aid to India. The first set of 1,000 oxygen concentrators, courtesy of Deloitte was delivered over the last few days to India.“We have now commitments from a number of corporates, for 25,000, oxygen concentrators,” he said.“We are also focused on cryogenic containers for oxygen,” he said, adding that Deloitte is working with other companies to get other essential medical supplies to India.“What we also need to do is, we have to stop the crunch at the hospital. “We are close to announcing an innovative approach to expand the medical ward to address the crush on hospitals,” he said.Other multinationals, he observed, are stepping up and are doing the same things that Deloitte is doing.Deloitte, he said, is directly supporting the US India Strategic Partnership Forum in their work with the government of India.It is providing pro-bono services to help the USISPF.Responding to a question, Renjen said he is very impressed with the assistance the Biden administration has provided to India.“I was very pleased to see that they were going to release the AstraZeneca shots.

Commercial and special flights between India and China have been banned since last year.South China’s Zhejiang province and Shanghai have also reported imported cases and asymptomatic cases from India.At least one among the 18 infected persons is an Indian national, the tabloid Global Times reported on Tuesday.“One asymptomatic case involved an Indian man who landed in Shanghai from Niger via Paris, and he then went to Zhejiang’s Yiwu on April 30 after quarantine, and tested positive on Saturday,” the Global Times report said.The Covid-19 strain prevalent in India has been detected in “some cities in my country, and everyone is very concerned,” Wu Zunyou, the CDC’s chief epidemiologist, had said last Thursday.Wu did not specify in which cities the cases were detected.China’s national health commission (NHC) on Wednesday said the country had added seven new imported Covid-19 cases in the last 24 hours.China has reported a total of 90,721 Covid-19 cases and 4,636 deaths since the start of the pandemic, with the last death recorded this January.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-detects-18-cases-of-double-mutant-covid-19-virus-from-india-101620275569038.html
06-05-2021||World||US backs India, South Africa’s Covid-19 vaccine patent waiver plan||The Biden administration on Wednesday announced the United State will support temporary waiver of intellectual property rights to Covid-19 vaccines, accepting a key element of a joint proposal by India and South Africa at the WTO, and said it will “actively participate” in negotiations to “make that happen”.The decision reversed former President Donald Trump’s opposition to the proposal in its entirety, was welcomed as “monumental” by WHO director general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus and was a called a “bold decision” by Doctors Without Borders (Médecins Sans Frontierè — MSF).People familiar with the matters said it is a “limited waiver” that the US is supporting, as it covers only vaccines and not therapeutics and related technologies as proposed by India and South Africa. And given the consensus-based approach of the WTO, it will not happen overnight.“The administration believes strongly in intellectual property protections, but in service of ending this pandemic, supports the waiver of those protections for Covid-19 vaccines,” US trade representative Katherine Tai said, adding, “We will actively participate in text-based negotiations at the World Trade Organization (WTO) needed to make that happen.”The proposal will now be discussed and cleared by the general council, which is the highest decision-making body of the WTO, which will lay down conditions under which member countries will be allowed to “violate” the agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS), which protects patents and copyrights. This could take weeks and months or years as it did when WTO dealt with patented drugs and HIV/AIDS, that was the last time it confronted similar policy challenges, according to people familiar with ongoing negotiations.Also Read | 412,262 fresh Covid-19 cases take India’s tally to over 21 millionThough immediately “pleased” by the US decision, India would wait for the conclusion of the text-based negotiations for the final outcome of its proposal. , It could be the largest beneficiary of the waiver as the vaccination-producing hub of the world, currently overwhelmed by domestic demand.In the joint proposal filed in October, India and South Africa had sought a waiver of TRIPS provision “in relation to prevention, containment or treatment of Covid-19”, covering, in other words, vaccines, diagnostic kits and technologies and therapeutics such as Remdesivir. The US support for waiver is only for vaccines.The Biden administration had been under mounting pressure from lawmakers of the ruling Democratic party and rights groups at home and a growing number of WTO member nations — more than 100 at last count — to reverse US opposition to the waiver proposal ordered by Donald Trump who was in office when India and South Africa had moved their joint proposal last October. The United States was joined in its opposition to the waiver by the European Union, the United Kingdom, Japan and Switzerland, essentially developed countries that had built up sizable stockpiles of vaccines and therapeutics.“The administration’s aim is to get as many safe and effective vaccines to as many people as fast as possible,” Tai said. “As our vaccine supply for the American people is secured, the administration will continue to ramp up its efforts – working with the private sector and all possible partners – to expand vaccine manufacturing and distribution.”.India and South Africa moved the proposal before the WTO last October calling for temporary waiver of the agreement on TRIPS, to protect patents and copyrights, with the goal of ensuring easy and affordable access globally, and specially to developing countries, to Covid-19 vaccines, therapeutics and related technologies till the pandemic had been crushed.Also Read | How different will Covid’s 3rd wave be from first two? What government saysThe proposal secured the support of the majority of the members of the WTO but ran up against a small group of developed countries led by the United States.“The decision probably wasn’t made lightly,” said Atman Trivedi, an Obama administration official who was on Biden’s presidential transition team, pointing to the centrality of intellectual property safeguards to the American economy. “But the strong humanitarian case, as infections surge in India, throughout South Asia, Latin America, and other parts of the developing world, is compelling.”The second wave of Covid-19 epidemic in India did indeed insert a sense of urgency into the debate on whether or not the US should support the waiver, as the tragedy unfolding in overcrowded, ill-equipped and understaffed hospitals and overwhelmed cremation grounds was depicted in graphic details in words and visuals in US media.Rick Rossow, who holds the India chair at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a leading tank, welcomed the Biden administration decision but said, “India and other nations have the right to break patents anyways under Compulsory License rules.’“But proactively announced American support further helps repair the damage caused by the noticeable period of American inaction from mid-April,” he added.The United States announced an expansive package of assistance for India last weekend, which many observers here and in India have said was too late to stem the devastation that is unfolding there, with untold shortages of life-saving oxygen supplies, personal protective equipment and therapeutics.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-backs-india-south-africa-s-covid-19-vaccine-patent-waiver-plan-101620274368820.html

The 'out of control' debris will enter the earth's atmosphere this weekend but since space debris has, on previous occasions too, hit the earth's surface without posing a threat to life or safety, there is no reason to panic, according to the report. Most debris burns up in the earth's atmosphere before having the chance to crash into its surface but at times, pieces of a large object may hit the earth. The most recent example of this is when last year, a large piece of uncontrolled space debris passed directly over Los Angeles and Central Park in New York City before landing in the Atlantic Ocean.Here is all you need to know about the phenomenon:- Space debris reentering the earth's atmosphere and hitting its surface is not a very common phenomena as space agencies try to avoid leaving big objects that they cannot control in orbit.- While the junk floating around in space poses little risk to life on earth, it threatens the active satellites that provide services such as tracking the weather and studying the earth's climate etc. - According to a statement from Defense Department spokesperson Mike Howard, the Chinese Long March 5B rocket is expected to enter earth's atmosphere around May 8, the CNN report said. The US Space Command is tracking the rocket's trajectory, he said. The exact location where the debris is going to land is difficult to determine until it is a few hours away due to the speed in which it is travelling, he added.- "We expect it to reenter sometime between the eighth and 10th of May. And in that two-day period, it goes around the world 30 times. The thing is traveling at like 18,000 miles an hour. And so if you're an hour out at guessing when it comes down, you're 18,000 miles out in saying where," Howard told CNN.- According to Jonathan McDowell, an astrophysicist at the Astrophysics Center at Harvard University, there was no need for people to take any precaution in view of the event. "The risk that there will be some damage or that it would hit someone is pretty small -- not negligible, it could happen -- but the risk that it will hit you is incredibly tiny. And so I would not lose one second of sleep over this on a personal threat basis," he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/out-of-control-chinese-rocket-debris-to-crash-into-earth-this-weekend-101620270262563.html
06-05-2021||World||Hong Kong activist Joshua Wong jailed over 'unlawful' Tiananmen Square vigil||Hong Kong democracy activist Joshua Wong's sentence was extended by another 10 months by the administration after he pleaded guilty to taking part in an "unlawful" Tiananmen Square protest last year, news agencies reported on Wednesday. The charges relate to Wong participating in an "unauthorised assembly" on June 4 last year to commemorate the Chinese regime's 1989 crackdown on protesters in and around Beijing's Tiananmen Square, reported news agency Reuters.In what is sometimes called the 1989 'Tiananmen Square massacre' or the 'June Fourth incident', Chinese troops armed with assault rifles and tanks fired on student-led protest demonstrations in Beijing to suppress the popular national movement. The Communist Party of China continues to forbid any discussion of the incident, but June 4 is commemorated by several 'pro-democracy' activists, including those in Hong Kong, in a vigil to remember the deaths of the protesters.The Hong Kong administration banned the vigil this time around, citing the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic, a first since 1990, but the district court heard that some 20,000 participants, including Joshua Wong, had still gathered on June 4, according to the South China Morning Post.Wong, 24, already in prison because of other illegal assembly convictions and among 47 activists charged under the city's sweeping national security law, was sentenced in the district court on Thursday. A 15-month sentence was reduced to 10 because of his guilty plea.Three other prominent young activists -- Lester Shum, Tiffany Yuen Ka-wai, and Jannelle Rosalynne Leung -- who also participated in the demonstrations, were sentenced to prison as well, albeit for a lesser duration than Wong's. Two other defendants, Nathan Law Kwun-chung and Sunny Cheung Kwan-yang, have fled the city and are wanted by the cops, reported SCMP.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hong-kong-activist-joshua-wong-jailed-over-unlawful-tiananmen-square-vigil-101620270578018.html
06-05-2021||World||UN says 155 million people faced acute hunger in 2020, may be worse this year||At least 155 million people faced acute hunger in 2020, including 133,000 who needed urgent food to prevent widespread death from starvation -- and the outlook for 2021 is equally grim or worse, a report by 16 organizations said Wednesday.The report, which focuses on 55 countries that account for 97% of humanitarian assistance, said the magnitude and severity of food crises last year worsened as a result of protracted conflicts, the economic fallout of the Covid-19 pandemic, and weather extremes that exacerbated “pre-existing fragilities.”The 155 million people faced “crisis," “emergency" or “catastrophe/famine" levels of food needs, an increase of around 20 million people from 2019, it said.According to the report, two-thirds of the people in those crisis levels were in 10 countries -- Congo, Yemen, Afghanistan, Syria, Sudan, northern Nigeria, Ethiopia, South Sudan, Zimbabwe, and Haiti. The 133,000 facing starvation, death, and destitution were in Burkina Faso, South Sudan, and Yemen.“The number of people facing acute food insecurity and requiring urgent food, nutrition and livelihoods assistance is on the rise,” U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres wrote in the forward to the 307-page Global Report on Food Crises.“There is no place for famine and starvation in the 21st century,” he said. “We need to tackle hunger and conflict together to solve either.”Arif Husain, the World Food Program’s chief economist, said at a U.N. news conference for the release of the fifth annual report that the biggest driver of food crises is conflict, which accounted for 99 million people in 23 countries facing food crisis last year.“Unless we start finding political solutions to conflicts,” the number of people needing humanitarian assistance will keep increasing, he said.According to the report, 40.5 million people in 17 countries faced acute food insecurity last year because of “economic shocks” including the fallout from the pandemic.First and foremost, Husain pointed to declining incomes as a result of the 255 million jobs lost in the pandemic — “four times more than the financial crisis” in 2008. He also expressed concern that the amount of debt taken on by countries large and small to mitigate the impact of the coronavirus “has exploded.”Dominique Burgeon, director of the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization’s office in Geneva, said 60% to 80% of the 155 million people facing acute food insecurity depend on agriculture, but last year FAO was able to assist only about 30%.The report presented some other grim statistics from 2020: 75.2 million children under 5 years old living in the 55 countries were “stunted” in their growth and 15.8 million were “wasted,” or underweight for their height.In terms of the prevalence of people facing a crisis, emergency, or famine levels of food needs, the report said Central African Republic, South Sudan, and Syria had more than half their analyzed populations at the crisis level or worse, and five countries -- Afghanistan, Haiti, Lesotho, Yemen, and Zimbabwe -- had between 40% and 45% of their populations at those levels.Looking to 2021, the report said, “food crises are becoming increasingly protracted and the ability to recover from new adverse events is becoming more difficult.”“Conflict, the Covid-19 pandemic, and large-scale economic crises are expected to extend food-crisis situations in 2021, necessitating continuing large-scale humanitarian assistance,” it said.The report made forecasts based on 40 of the 55 countries, saying those for the other 15 countries weren't available.It said over 142 million people in those 40 countries are forecast to face food crises, emergencies, or catastrophes this year. Around 155,000 people are likely to face “catastrophe/famine" through mid-2021 — around 108,000 in South Sudan and 47,000 in Yemen, the report said.WFP’s Husain said, for example, that providing one single meal per day for a year for 34 million people would cost about $5 billion, saying that the most critical needs are funding and humanitarian access.“Without that, we won’t be able to save lives,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/un-says-155-million-people-faced-acute-hunger-in-2020-may-be-worse-this-year-101620268848577.html

The rocket flew to an altitude of about 10 kilometers (6.2 miles) before a controlled descent, based on live video streamed by the company. The landing was marred only by a small fire at the bottom of the vehicle that was extinguished after a few minutes.Also Read: SpaceX Starship explodes during landing, FAA launches probeThe milestone achievement paves the way for more ambitious tests of a rocket that SpaceX founder Elon Musk envisions as a future workhorse for trips to the moon and Mars. NASA recently picked SpaceX to develop a moon-landing system for astronauts with Starship. The company also envisions the stainless steel behemoth as eventually being capable of reducing travel times across Earth with hypersonic, point-to-point trips.The previous Starship rocket test flight, on March 30, sent smoking debris raining down on the area after a mishap. An earlier prototype touched down at a slight incline, only to be engulfed in flames shortly after landing. Two previous efforts ended in fireballs. No people were aboard any of the spacecraft.SpaceX conceived the Starship as a versatile, fully reusable craft that can carry 100 metric tons. Excluding a booster rocket that creates a two-stage system, Starship is 160 feet high with a 30-foot diameter, able to carry as many as 100 passengers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/spacex-nails-the-landing-in-fifth-test-of-its-starship-rocket-101620260943906.html

The newly released students arrived at police headquarters in Kaduna city on Wednesday night looking weak, forlorn and wearing dirty, torn clothing.One female student could not walk alone and was carried into the building, while another was rushed to the hospital.Police did not allow journalists to speak to the students.More than 700 people have been abducted from schools in northwest Nigeria since December in a rash of kidnappings for ransom in the volatile region.Kaduna Governor Nasir El-Rufai has repeatedly said his state government will not negotiate with "bandits", as the criminal gangs are known, or pay ransoms.Abdullahi Usman, chairman of the parents' association, said a ransom was paid for the students' release, but refused to say who had paid or how much.Friday Sanni, father of two abducted girls, said police had not yet allowed parents to see them. As he waited, he fretted over the fate of his daughters Rejoice, 17, and Victory, 19."We pray it is all of them," he said.President Muhammadu Buhari released a statement that welcomed the release of 27 students. His office did not respond to questions regarding the discrepancy in the number.Kaduna police spokesman Mohammed Jalige said all remaining students had been released and would undergo medical examination before their release on Thursday.Samuel Aruwan, the Kaduna state commissioner for internal security, said in a statement that the government rejoiced with the freed students, and called on them to "put the past behind and work hard towards a happier and successful future ahead."He did not comment on whether a ransom was paid.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/weak-and-tattered-29-students-freed-in-nigeria-s-kaduna-101620260516146.html
06-05-2021||World||Facebook has 6 months to determine if Donald Trump returns||Facebook Inc's oversight board on Wednesday upheld the company's suspension of former U.S. President Donald Trump but said the company was wrong to make the suspension indefinite and gave it six months to determine a "proportionate response."Trump called the decision and his banning across tech platforms "a total disgrace" and said the companies would "pay a political price."The much-awaited board verdict has been watched for signals on how the world's largest social media company will treat rule-breaking political leaders in the future, a key area of controversy for online platforms.Also Read: Facebook oversight board upholds Trump suspensionThe board, created by Facebook to rule on a small slice of its content decisions, said the company was right to ban Trump following the Jan. 6 storming of the U.S. Capitol by Trump supporters.Facebook indefinitely blocked Trump's access to his Facebook and Instagram accounts over concerns of further violent unrest following the Jan. 6 riot. It enacted the suspension after removing two of Trump's posts during the Capitol riot, including a video in which he said supporters should go home but reiterated his false claim of widespread voter fraud, saying "I know your pain. I know you’re hurt. We had an election that was stolen from us."But the board said Facebook should not have imposed an indeterminate suspension without clear standards and said the company should determine a response consistent with rules applied to other users. It said Facebook could determine that Trump's account could be restored, suspended temporarily or permanently banned."Indefinite penalties of this sort do not pass the international or American smell test for clarity, consistency, and transparency," said former federal Judge Michael McConnell, co-chair of the Oversight Board, during a press conference after publishing its decision on Wednesday.In an interview with Reuters, board co-chair and former Danish Prime Minister Helle Thorning-Schmidt said public figures should not be allowed to incite violence or create harm though their posts, but that Facebook "can't just invent new sanctions as they go along."In its decision, the board said Facebook refused to answer some of the 46 questions it posed, including those on how its news feed affected the visibility of Trump's posts, and whether the company planned to look into how its technology amplified content as it had done in the events leading to the Capitol siege.The board said Facebook's existing policies, such as deciding when material is too newsworthy to remove, need to be more clearly communicated to users. It also called on Facebook to develop a policy that governs how it handles novel situations where its existing rules would be insufficient to prevent imminent harm. See takeaways from the board's decision.Facebook's business has thrived during the controversy and its main source of revenue, advertising, has boomed as COVID-19 pandemic restrictions begin to ease in the United States, but lawmakers across the political spectrum have raised concerns about the power of Facebook and other social media, many calling for new regulations and some calling for breakups of big tech.Trump called the move "an embarrassment to our Country," and added that "Free Speech has been taken away from the President of the United States because the Radical Left Lunatics are afraid of the truth, but the truth will come out anyway, bigger and stronger than ever before."At a Financial Times conference after the verdict, Nick Clegg, Facebook's vice president of global affairs and communication, said the company would hope to resolve the matter "considerably faster" than six months.Tech platforms have grappled in recent years with how to police world leaders and politicians that violate their guidelines. Facebook has come under fire both from those who think it should abandon its hands-off approach to political speech and those, including Republican lawmakers and some free-expression advocates who saw the Trump ban as a disturbing act of censorship.Facebook was one of a slew of social media sites that barred the former president, including Twitter Inc, which banned him permanently, a move welcomed by some civil rights groups and social media researchers. Political leaders from German Chancellor Angela Merkel to U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders expressed concern that private companies could silence elected officials on their sites.At the time of the suspension, Facebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg said "the risks of allowing the president to continue to use our service during this period are simply too great." The company later referred the case to its recently established board, which includes academics, lawyers and rights activists.The binding verdict means Trump will not for now be able to return to Facebook's platforms, where he had a combined 59 million followers across Facebook and Instagram. His campaign spent about $160 million on Facebook ads in 2020, according to Democratic digital firm Bully Pulpit Interactive's campaign tracker.On Tuesday, Trump launched a web page to share messages that readers can then re-post to their Facebook or Twitter accounts. A senior adviser has said Trump also plans to launch his own social media platform.Wednesday's decision marks a milestone for the oversight board, which Facebook financed with $130 million. The body has been hailed as a novel experiment by some researchers but criticized by those who have been skeptical about its independence or view it as a PR stunt to deflect attention from the company's more systemic problems."This verdict is a desperate attempt to have it both ways, upholding the 'ban' of Donald Trump without actually banning him, while punting any real decisions back to Facebook," said a group of academics, experts and Facebook critics known as the "Real Facebook Oversight Board."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/facebook-has-6-months-to-determine-if-trump-returns-101620260207948.html

The commitment by @POTUS Joe Biden and @USTradeRep @AmbassadorTai to support the waiver of IP protections on vaccines is a powerful example of US leadership to address global health challenges," the WHO chief tweeted.Also Read: US backs Covid-19 vaccine patent waiver plan proposed by India, South AfricaCommending the US for this historic decision for vaccine equity, prioritising the well-being of all people everywhere at a critical time, he said: "Now let's all move together swiftly, in solidarity, building on the ingenuity and commitment of scientists who produced life-saving #COVID19 vaccines."He added that the White House support for the temporary waiving IP on COVID-19 vaccines "reflects the wisdom and moral leadership of US to support vaccine equity and work to end this pandemic".US President Joe Biden's administration on Wednesday (local time) announced its support for a global waiver on patent protections for COVID-19 vaccines and said it will negotiate the terms at the World Trade Organisation (WTO)."These extraordinary times and circumstances of call for extraordinary measures. The US supports the waiver of IP protections on COVID-19 vaccines to help end the pandemic and we will actively participate in @WTO negotiations to make that happen," US Trade Representative Katherine Tai said in a statement.This comes as India, South Africa, and other nations had requested to waive certain portions of the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) for all members of the WTO.The requested waiver was to provide many people with possible access to vaccines and treatments for COVID-19, including in developing countries.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/monumental-in-fight-against-covid-who-on-us-support-for-vaccine-patent-waiver-101620259742953.html

06-05-2021||World||US backs Covid-19 vaccine patent waiver plan proposed by India, South Africa||The Biden administration on Wednesday joined calls for more sharing of the technology behind COVID-19 vaccines to help speed the end of the pandemic, a shift that puts the U.S. alongside many in the developing world who want rich countries to do more to get doses to the needy.United States Trade Representative Katherine Tai announced the government's position, amid World Trade Organization talks about a possible temporary waiver of its protections that would allow more manufacturers to produce the life-saving vaccines.“The Administration believes strongly in intellectual property protections, but in service of ending this pandemic, supports the waiver of those protections for COVID-19 vaccines," Tai said in a statement.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageShe cautioned that it would take time to reach the required global “consensus” to waive the protections under WTO rules, and U.S. officials said it would not have an immediate effect on the global supply of COVID-19 shots.Tai's announcement came hours after WTO Director-General Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala spoke to a closed-door meeting of ambassadors from developing and developed countries that have been wrangling over the issue, but agree on the need for wider access to COVID-19 treatments.The WTO’s General Council took up the issue of a temporary waiver for intellectual property protections on COVID-19 vaccines and other tools, which South Africa and India first proposed in October. The idea has gained support among some progressive lawmakers in the West.More than 100 countries have come out in support of the proposal, and a group of 110 members of Congress — all fellow Democrats of Biden — sent him a letter last month that called on him to support the waiver.Opponents — especially from industry — say a waiver would be no panacea. They insist that production of coronavirus vaccines is complex and can’t be ramped up by easing intellectual property. They also say lifting protections could hurt future innovation.Stephen Ubl, president and CEO of the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, said the U.S. decision “will sow confusion between public and private partners, further weaken already strained supply chains and foster the proliferation of counterfeit vaccines.”Dr. Michelle McMurry-Heath, chief executive of the Biotechnology Innovation Organization trade group, said in a statement that the decision will undermine incentives to develop vaccines and treatments for future pandemics.“Handing needy countries a recipe book without the ingredients, safeguards, and sizable workforce needed will not help people waiting for the vaccine," she said.Pfizer declined to comment on Biden’s announcement, as did Johnson & Johnson, which developed a one-dose vaccine meant to ease vaccination campaigns in poor and rural areas. Moderna and AstraZeneca didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment.The companies have made some efforts to provide vaccine doses to poor countries at prices well below what they’re charging wealthy nations.For instance, Johnson & Johnson agreed last week to provide up to 220 million doses of its vaccine to the African Union’s 55 member states, starting in this year’s third quarter, and agreed in December to provide up to 500 million vaccines through 2022 for low-income countries via Gavi, The Vaccine Alliance.Shares of Pfizer, AstraZeneca and Johnson & Johnson — huge companies with many lucrative products — fell less than 1% on the news. But Moderna, whose vaccine is the company’s only product, fell 6.2% in late-afternoon trading before gaining back two-thirds of a percent in after-hours trading.It remained unclear how some countries in Europe, which have influential pharmaceutical industries and had previously shared U.S. reservations about the waiver, would respond.WTO spokesman Keith Rockwell said a panel on intellectual property at the trade body was expected to take up the waiver proposal again at a “tentative” meeting later this month, before a formal meeting June 8-9. That means any final deal could be weeks away at best.Authors of the proposal have been revising it in hopes of making it more palatable.Okonjo-Iweala, in remarks posted on the WTO website, said it was “incumbent on us to move quickly to put the revised text on the table, but also to begin and undertake text-based negotiations.”“I am firmly convinced that once we can sit down with an actual text in front of us, we shall find a pragmatic way forward” that is “acceptable to all sides,” she said.Co-sponsors of the idea were shuttling between different diplomatic missions to make their case, according to a Geneva trade official who was not authorized to speak publicly on the matter. A deadlock persists, and opposing sides remain far apart, the official said.The argument, part of a long-running debate about intellectual property protections, centers on lifting patents, copyrights and protections for industrial design and confidential information to help expand the production and deployment of vaccines during supply shortages. The aim is to suspend the rules for several years, just long enough to beat down the pandemic.The issue has become more pressing with a surge in cases in India, the world’s second-most populous country and a key producer of vaccines — including one for COVID-19 that relies on technology from Oxford University and British-Swedish pharmaceutical maker AstraZeneca.Michael Yee, a Jefferies Group biotech analyst, wrote to investors that the key access issues for developing countries aren’t patents or price, but an inadequate supply of the materials needed and the know-how to produce the vaccines and keep quality high — which one of Johnson & Johnson’s contract manufacturers in the U.S. failed to do, ruining millions of doses.“Manufacturing supplies, raw materials, vials, stoppers, and other key materials are in limited supply for 2021,” and may still be next year and beyond, Yee wrote. That’s partly because it takes time to make all those components, and Moderna and Pfizer have commitments to buy them “from major suppliers in huge bulk over the foreseeable future.”He added that Pfizer previously sought authorization to sell its vaccine to India, which rejected its application and asked that additional studies be run. The U.S., European Union and many other countries have given that emergency authorization.Proponents, including WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, note that such waivers are part of the WTO toolbox and insist there’s no better time to use them than during the once-in-a-century pandemic that has taken 3.2 million lives, infected more than 437 million people and devastated economies, according to Johns Hopkins University.“This is a monumental moment in the fight against COVID-19," Tedros said in Wednesday statement. He said the U.S. commitment "to support the waiver of IP protections on vaccines is a powerful example of American leadership to address global health challenges.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-backs-covid-19-vaccine-patent-waiver-plan-proposed-by-india-south-africa-101620259025472.html
06-05-2021||World||US announces support for Covid-19 vaccine patent waiver||US President Joe Biden's administration on Wednesday announced its support for a global waiver on patent protections for Covid-19 vaccines, and will negotiate the terms at the WTO.While intellectual property rights for businesses are important, Washington "supports the waiver of those protections for Covid-19 vaccines," US Trade Representative Katherine Tai said in a statement."This is a global health crisis, and the extraordinary circumstances of the Covid-19 pandemic call for extraordinary measures," she added.Biden had been under intense pressure from world leaders to agree to waive protections for vaccine manufacturers in order to ramp up production and get the jabs out to more countries as rich nations have swept up the majority of the doses.Tai said the United States will participate in the negotiations within the World Trade Organization but cautioned that discussions "will take time given the consensus-based nature of the institution and the complexity of the issues involved."The global trade body has for months been facing calls led by India and South Africa to temporarily remove the intellectual property protections on Covid-19 vaccines, in a move proponents say would help boost production in developing countries that so far have received far fewer jabs.But that notion has until now met fierce opposition from pharmaceutical giants and their host countries, which insist the patents are not the main roadblocks to scaling up production, and warn the move could hamper innovation.WTO chief Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala has been pressing for an international agreement to provide at least a temporary patent waiver."We need to have a sense of urgency on how we approach this issue of response to Covid-19 because the world is watching," she said earlier Wednesday, describing equitable access to the tools to fight the pandemic as the "moral and economic issue of our time."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-announces-support-for-covid-19-vaccine-patent-waiver-101620243476047.html

On Tuesday, Prime Minister Scott Morrison appeared to backtrack from the move, saying it was highly unlikely violators would be jailed.Michael Bradley and Chris Ward lodged the application before Justice Stephen Burley on Wednesday afternoon. The application firstly said that the Commonwealth was acting outside its powers and secondly that the health minister Greg Hunt’s declaration was in breach of an implied freedom to return home, ABC news reported. Some critics have accused the government of racism because such drastic travel restrictions were not introduced when infection rates were rapidly increasing in the US and Europe.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/stranded-australian-man-in-india-challenges-country-s-travel-ban-101620241503787.html

By imposing lockdown, the government itself would be creating havoc," an official release quoted Rao as saying.However, the state government will take preventive measures such as setting up micro level containment zones wherever the number of cases are high, it noted."Keeping in mind the past experiences, the state government has decided not to impose lockdown," it added.The CM appealed to people to be self disciplined and adhere to the Covid-19 rules to prevent the spread of the disease.Meanwhile, Rao spoke to Prime Minister Narendra Modi over phone seeking the allotted quota of antiviral drug remdesivir to be released to the state immediately.Rao said the state was receiving only 4,900 injections of remdesivir and the same has to be increased to 25,000.He also sought to enhance the oxygen supply to the state to 500 tonnes.Similarly, Telangana uses 2 to 2.5 lakh Covid-19 vaccine doses per day and the supply of the antidote needs to be maintained from the Centre accordingly, he said.KCR also spoke to Union Minister Piyush Goyal, who assured him of necessary supplies to the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid19-telangana-cm-rules-out-lockdown-says-it-cripples-public-life-economy-101620324936725.html

06-05-2021||India||India welcomes US support for waiving patent protections for Covid-19 vaccines||India on Thursday welcomed the US administration’s support for waiving patent protections for Covid-19 vaccines and expressed the hope that a waiver can be quickly approved at the World Trade Organization (WTO) through a consensus-based approach. US Trade Representative (USTR) Katherine Tai announced the Biden administration’s support on Wednesday following pressure from a group of 110 Democratic lawmakers. More than 100 countries have backed a proposal made by India and South Africa at the WTO last October for a waiver of intellectual property protections on Covid-19 vaccines. Prime Minister Narendra Modi personally raised the matter with US President Joe Biden during a phone call on April 26, and informed him about India’s initiative at the WTO that is aimed at countries around the world. “We welcome the statement of the US government of 5th May announcing their support for this initiative. We are hopeful that with a consensus-based approach, the waiver can be approved quickly at the WTO,” the external affairs ministry said in a statement. “The waiver is an important step for enabling rapid scaling up of manufacture and timely availability of affordable Covid-19 vaccines and essential medical products,” it said. India and South Africa proposed a relaxation in the norms of the WTO Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) on October 2 last year in view of the global health crisis and the need to combat the pandemic. The move was aimed at ensuring quick and affordable access to vaccines for developing countries. “As a result of proactive outreach by India and other like-minded countries, the proposal has received the support of more than 120 countries,” the statement said. The US move comes against the backdrop of a fresh push by India and South Africa at the WTO for the waiver of patent protections by presenting a revised text of last year’s proposal that is expected to highlight the urgent need for equitable and speedy access to vaccines following a second wave of Coronavirus infections in countries such as India. The revised proposal is also expected to state that patent protections for vaccines should be waived for a limited timeframe. USTR Tai said in a statement that the Biden administration believes strongly in intellectual property protections but “supports the waiver of those protections for Covid-19 vaccines” in order to end the pandemic. “This is a global health crisis, and the extraordinary circumstances of the Covid-19 pandemic call for extraordinary measures,” she said. The US will actively participate in text-based negotiations at the WTO to obtain the waiver. “Those negotiations will take time given the consensus-based nature of the institution and the complexity of the issues involved,” she said. With vaccine supply for the American people secured, the Biden administration will ramp up efforts by working with the private sector and all possible partners to expand vaccine manufacturing and distribution. It will also work to increase raw materials needed to produce vaccines, Tai said. The US position was also welcomed by UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, whose spokesperson Stéphane Dujarric described the move as unprecedented. “It opens the opportunity for vaccine producers to share the knowledge and technology that will allow the effective expansion of locally-produced vaccines and can significantly increase the supply to the COVAX facility,” he said. However, the Biden administration’s decision has angered pharmaceutical companies, which have opposed any waiver on the grounds that it could hurt future innovation. They have also said the production of Covid-19 vaccines is a complex process that requires extensive capabilities and sophisticated technology, and can’t be ramped up simply by easing patent protections.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-welcomes-us-support-for-waiving-patent-protections-for-covid-19-vaccines-101620322553675.html
06-05-2021||India||Odisha seeks GST exemption on Covid-19 vaccines||Seeking the active cooperation of the Centre in the fight against the pandemic, Odisha on Thursday demanded exemption of GST on the purchase of coronavirus vaccines and sought financial assistance to states from the cess and surcharge collected by the Union government from various products.Noting that states have been asked to purchase vaccines from their resources for inoculating people between the ages of 18 and 45, Patnaik said, these purchases attract the Goods and Service Taxes (GST), making the vaccines costly for the states. At present 5 per cent GST is charged for coronavirus vaccines.In a letter to Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, Patnaik wrote, "I hope the suggestions will be examined and urgent necessary action is taken in view of the emergency health situation in the country and to strengthen our unified fight against Covid."If vaccines are exempted from GST, it will reduce the cost on the part of the states and facilitate the drive towards universal vaccination, the chief minister said."In this long and sustained effort required to fight Covid-19, it is important that the states are supported so that the entire country fights as one. Lack of finance should not affect any state affecting the entire country in turn," he said.The Odisha chief minister also suggested that the additional resources raised through various cess and surcharges on petrol, diesel, liquor, and other items, which are exclusively available to the Union government, "maybe suitably shared with state governments at this critical juncture"."This will strengthen our fight against the pandemic including provision of vaccinations, free treatment, undertaking preventive measures, and so on," Patnaik said.Highlighting that India is going through a tough phase in fighting the pandemic, the chief minister said, "It is a war-like situation and all our resources should be focussed on winning this war against corona. This is not going to be a one-time battle, we will have a sustained challenge in this fight against Covid till serious advances are made in treatment and vaccination".In a related development, Patnaik sanctioned an additional amount of over ₹7.50 crore to Puri, Subarnapur, and Sambalpur districts from the Chief Ministers Relief Fund (CMRF) for Covid management.While an additional fund of ₹2 crore was sanctioned for Puri district, ₹1 crore has been sanctioned for Subarnapur district and ₹4.62 crore for Sambalpur district, the Chief Ministers Office said in a release on Thursday.Earlier, the Chief minister had released an amount of ₹14.59 crore for Puri district, ₹2.50 crore for Subarnapur district, and ₹11.50 crore for Sambalpur district to tackle the pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/odisha-seeks-gst-exemption-on-covid-19-vaccines-101620318563863.html

This comes a day after Mamata Banerjee took charge as the chief minister. Banerjee had earlier promised a probe into the incident. “CID enquiry is going on. I can share details only after the CID submits its report. I am sure some mischief was there. We will take proper action against the culprits,” said Mamata Banerjee, chief minister of West Bengal. In all, five people were killed at Sitalkuchi in two separate incidents on April 10. In the first incident an 18-year-old first-time voter was shot dead by miscreants, while in the other central forces shot dead four people allegedly in self-defence.The incident had drawn protests and criticism from the ruling TMC. The Election Commission, however, had said that that the security forces had to open fire in self-defence. The BJP had referred to the firing incident multiple times to issue veiled threats against the TMC during the poll campaign. The CID has formed a Special Investigation Team and on Thursday the investigating officer of the case was questioned for more than three hours. The officer-in-charge of the police station is likely to be questioned next week.

Centre lists 6 steps||The Centre on Thursday released steps on how to monitor and report side effects after beneficiaries have been vaccinated against the coronavirus disease (Covid-19). India is currently in the third phase of the nationwide vaccination drive where beneficiaries in the age group of 18-45 are also being inoculated. As of Thursday morning, more than 162.5 million doses have been administered.India is seeing a tsunami of cases and deaths on a daily basis under the deadlier second wave of the Covid-19 disease pandemic. On Thursday, another high of 412,262 fresh cases and 3,980 more deaths were recorded in the last 24 hours, taking the caseload to over 21 million.Also Read| Developers of single shot Sputnik Light vaccine say it will be produced in IndiaAs the vaccination drive started from January 16 and picked up pace in the subsequent phases, several beneficiaries have experienced side-effects after taking the dose which has led to fear and aspersion among eligible beneficiaries, prompting many of them to not opt for vaccination. But as the country is struggling to contain the spread of the pandemic and is possibly staring at a third wave of infections, it is extremely crucial that citizens get vaccinated and even if they test positive for Covid-19, the symptoms of the virus will be mild.Here are certain steps which are to be followed to monitor and report side effects after being vaccinated against Covid-19:1. Before administering the Covid-19 vaccine, beneficiaries should be asked whether they ever had a severe allergic reaction to a vaccine. If yes, then they should be referred to an allergy specialist or health provider who will recommend next steps.2. Health or medical conditions listed as precautions by the vaccine manufacturer or the local immunisation program should be assessed. The conditions might include pregnancy, compromised immune system and severe frailty among older people. Beneficiaries with these conditions are eligible to take the vaccine dose but they should be offered information and counselling.#IndiaFightsCorona:📍How to monitor & report #COVID19Vaccine side effects❓❓☑️ Have a look👇#We4Vaccine #LargestVaccinationDrive #Unite2FightCorona pic.twitter.com/XxWxqmqZIY3. The common side-effects after vaccination should be communicated which show a beneficiary’s body is building protection to the Covid-19 disease. Arm soreness, mild fever, headaches, tiredness and muscle or joint ache are some of the common side effects experienced after vaccination.4. Vaccinate the beneficiaries.5. The vaccinated beneficiaries should be observed for 15 minutes and they should be told on how and where to report severe reactions.

Russia’s health ministry and Gamaleya National Research Center of Epidemiology and Microbiology and the Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF), the developers of the vaccine, announced on Wednesday that Sputnik Light had received authorisation for use in Russia. Sputnik Light demonstrated 79.4% efficacy, according to an analysis of data gathered 28 days after the shot was administered as part of Russia’s mass vaccination programme between December 2020 and April 2021, the vaccine’s developers said in a statement. Gamaleya Center had also demonstrated during laboratory tests that Sputnik Light had proven effective against all new strains of the coronavirus, the statement said. Phase I and II of the safety and immunogenicity study of Sputnik Light had demonstrated that it can elicit the development of antigen specific IgG antibodies in 96.9% of individuals on the 28th day after vaccination, and that elicits the development of virus neutralising antibodies in 91.67% of individuals on the 28th day after immunisation. No serious adverse events were registered after vaccination with Sputnik Light, the statement said. The infection rate among vaccinated subjects from the 28th day from the date of the injection was 0.277%. Over the same period, the infection rate among unvaccinated adults was 1.349%. The Phase III clinical study involving 7,000 people was conducted in multiple countries, including Russia, the UAE and Ghana. The interim results are expected in May. RDIF CEO Kirill Dmitriev told a news briefing that Sputnik Light could be a “key solution for many countries with viral surges” as it had resulted in “100% protection against severe infections”. “Sputnik V will be the core vaccine while Sputnik Light will be cheaper and more affordable, and ensure that more people can be vaccinated quickly. Sputnik Light will be registered in several countries by next week and we are talks with regulators in several countries,” he said. “We hope that the 64 countries that have registered Sputnik V will also register Sputnik Light,” he added. Dmitriev named India, South Korea and China among the countries that will produce Sputnik Light. “We have partnerships with more than 20 producers in 10 countries and they will make both versions of the vaccine,” he said. He said Sputnik Light works well with all existing mutations of the Coronavirus as it “includes all the mutations in its code”. Sputnik Light can also be used as a booster shot for other vaccines and trials are currently underway with AstraZeneca, he said. “Sputnik Light makes a greater booster shot with other vaccines. We are doing trials with AstraZeneca but it can also be used with others. It can be a booster shot to upgrade other vaccines for all mutations, subject to additional trials,” Dmitriev said. “Regardless of politics, all countries should come together to fight the virus. It is now a fight between mutations and vaccines,” he said. The cost of Sputnik Light globally will be less than $10, and it has simple storage requirements, at +2 +8, which provide for easy logistics, the statement said. The developers of Sputnik V, which has been granted approval for emergency use by India’s drug controller, have tied up with Indian pharmaceutical firms such as Dr Reddy’s Laboratories, Gland Pharma, Hetero Biopharma, Panacea Biotec, Stelis Biopharma and Virchow Biotech to manufacture more than 850 million doses a year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/developers-of-single-shot-sputnik-light-vaccine-say-it-will-be-produced-in-india-101620313613710.html

These include Nagpur-Kolhapur special up to June 29, the CSMT-Kolhapur special up to July 1, the CSMT-Pune special up to June 30.Coronavirus cases and deaths in India hit a record daily high with 4,12,262 new infections and 3,980 fatalities being reported, taking the total tally of COVID-19 cases to 2,10,77,410 and the death toll to 2,30,168, according to the Union Health Ministry data updated on Thursday.Registering a steady increase, the active cases have increased to 35,66,398 comprising 16.92 per cent of the total infections, while the national COVID-19 recovery rate has dropped to 81.99 per cent, the data showed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/northern-railways-cancels-premium-trains-due-to-covid-19-surge-low-patronisation-101620312001294.html

The injection Remdesivir has emergency use authorization in India, and is also a part of India’s national clinical treatment protocol for the Coronavirus disease. “Around 1,50,000 doses were already shipped a few days back to Mumbai, and another consignment of about 50,000 vials (2 consignments of 25k each) is about to land in another couple of days,” said the person, on condition of anonymity. With the sudden surge in Covid-19 cases, India faced acute shortage of the antiviral drug, and to meet the sudden increased demand, Gilead Sciences that holds the patent for the drug, announced that it was donating 4,50,000 vials of the injection to the Indian government till the domestic production was scaled up. The company has partnered with KlinEra Global Services that holds market approval and import licence of the antiviral drug in India, making them the authorized distributor partner of Gilead in India. The donations come at a zero cost to the Indian government. “The scaling up takes time—at least three to four weeks— which is why the company decided to bridge the gap by making supplies in the interim period,” the person said. Apart from donating vials, the company also announced that it will be providing its voluntary licensing partners with technical assistance, to rapidly scale up production in the wake of the exponential surge in cases. “The recent surge of Covid-19 cases in India is having a devastating impact on communities and has created unprecedented pressure on health systems,” Johanna Mercier, chief commercial officer, Gilead Sciences, had said earlier. “We are committed to doing our part to help tackle this crisis. Our immediate focus is to help address the needs of patients in India who may benefit from Remdesivir as quickly as we can by working together with the government, health authorities and our voluntary licensees.” Gilead Sciences holds the patent for Remdesivir that is one of the investigational drugs prescribed under restricted emergency use in treating Covid-19 patients in India and globally. Remdesivir has broad-spectrum antiviral activity both in vitro (test-tube), and in vivo (living beings) in animal models against multiple emerging viral pathogens, including Ebola, SARS, Marburg, MERS and SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19. Gilead Sciences has seven licensing partners based in India, and all seven of the licensees have significantly accelerated production of Remdesivir by scaling up their batch sizes, adding new manufacturing facilities and/or onboarding local contract manufacturers across the country. Experts in India, however, have been reiterating that the drug is no magic bullet, and one of the many investigational therapies recommended for use in Covid-19 patients. “The drug hasn’t shown any mortality benefit in Covid-19 patients but in a US study it showed reduction in hospitalisation time by a few days,” said Dr Randeep Guleria, director, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Delhi, who is also a senior pulmonologist in the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/gilead-to-ship-another-50-000-vials-of-remdesivir-in-next-few-days-101620311392927.html

Only close relatives were allowed to participate in the funeral at Tekipora Lolab in Kupwara, his native village.Jailed Tehreek-e Hurriyat chairman died in Jammu Government Medical hospital on Wednesday afternoon and his body was handed over to relatives in the evening after a post-mortem. Police said Sehrai had tested Covid positive in a RT-PCR test report, which came after his death. He had earlier tested negative in a rapid antigen test. PTI quoted officials claiming he had Covid-19 symptoms and his oxygen levels had fallen.From Jammu, the body of Hurriyat leader was directly taken to Tekipora for burial. Inspector General of Police (IGP) Kashmir, Vijay Kumar said Sehrai’s funeral was done as per Covid protocol in presence of his family members.Sehrai, 77, a close confidant of hardliner Hurriyat Conference leader Syed Ali Shah Geelani, was incarcerated at the district jail in Udhampur since July 13, 2020 under the Public Safety Act. He complained of breathlessness on Tuesday and was taken to the district hospital before being shifted to Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH), Jammu, after his health deteriorated, said officials.He was the incumbent chairperson of Tehreek-e-Hurriyat having replaced Geelani in 2018. Sehrai was one of those detained during ahead of the revocation of special status to Jammu and Kashmir and its bifurcation into two union territories in August 2019. He was finally arrested under the PSA from his Barzaulla residence in Srinagar in July last year.The All Parties Hurriyat Conference claimed Sehrai, suffering from multiple ailments, was left unattended despite requests by his family for medical attention. However, officials rejected the allegations as “baseless”, saying he was taken to hospital after he complained of health issues.Last year, Sehrai’s son Junaid, joined the Hizbul Mujahideen terror outfit and was killed in an encounter in the old city. Meanwhile, the Kashmir Bar Association questioned the circumstance of the separatist leader’s death.“Sehrai was detained under PSA last year and his habeas corpus petition is still pending disposal before the J&K high court at Srinagar. The council for Sehrai had filed three applications before the court for shifting him from Jammu jail, hospitalisation owing to ill serious heart ailment and meeting with the family members,” the bar association said in a statement.Leaders of almost all mainstream political parties in Kashmir expressed condolence over Sehrai’s death.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jammu-and-kashmir-separatist-leader-ashraf-sehrai-buried-at-native-village-101620309892885.html

Lt Governor Tamilisai Soundararajan would induct Rangasamy as Chief Minister at a brief session on the precincts of Rajnivas here. Official sources said Rangasamy alone would be inducted as Chief Minister tomorrow although he would be heading an NDA dispensation which has the BJP as the other constituent. According to party sources, the swearing in of other ministers, including those from BJP will take place in the next few days. Usually, the strength of a ministry in Puducherry would be six including Chief Minister. There is however a reported move to have one Deputy Chief Minister now although there is no precedent in this regard. A Namassivayam, who joined the BJP in January after quitting the Congress is tipped for the post of Deputy Chief Minister. The concurrence of the Centre is awaited for the appointment of Deputy Chief Minister, BJP sources said. The AINRC bagged 10 seats out of the 16 it contested in the April 6 polls while the BJP garnered six out of the nine seats it contested. The total strength of the Assembly is 30 and sixteen is the magic number for formation of a ministry. The AINRC and BJP has a combined strength of 16. There are six independents elected to the House and they are by and large supporters of Rangasamy. The DMK has emerged victorious from six segments out of 13 seats it contested. The Congress fared poorly by annexing only two out of the 14 seats it contested.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rangasamy-to-be-sworn-in-as-puducherry-cm-on-may-7-101620304767381.html

The volume of calls increased after Sayarthi posted a helpline number on Twitter on April 29.BBA now receives about 70 calls a day seeking help for children whose parents are dead or seriously ill, and a greater number of calls from parents who have tested positive and want to know if the group can take care of their children if their health fails."NEED A BREAST MILK DONOR"With 3.57 million active cases of Covid-19, India recorded more than 400,000 new infections over the last 24 hours - the highest daily tally reported globally - while deaths rose by a record 3,980.Experts say actual numbers could be five to 10 times higher. Citizens across the country, the world's second most populous, are struggling to find beds, oxygen, or medicines needed for treatment, and many are dying for lack of treatment.Desperate pleas to help children have been appearing on social media."Need a breast milk donor for a one-day-old baby in Delhi. Her mother passed away due to Covid," read one Tweet. The person later said help had been found.Protsahan India Foundation, a children's rights NGO, said its frontline workers recently attended to children who had gone without food for days after their mother, the main caregiver, passed away."The father is a daily wage worker and is in a state of shock and trauma himself. We are helping with food and immediate care, education and protection needs of those kids," said Sonal Kapoor, founder-director at Protsahan.In the state of Karnataka, home to the tech city of Bengaluru and an epicentre of the second wave, the government has appointed an official to identify children orphaned by Covid-19 ensure they receive appropriate support.The state this week also ramped up messaging around children's safety and appealed to citizens not to seek help online from unknown groups.In the capital New Delhi, the city-state's child protection arm this week wrote to the police asking them to investigate posts on social media calling for urgent adoptions."They may also be cases of trafficking and sale-purchase of the children," the Delhi Commission for Protection of Child Rights warned.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pleas-for-help-in-india-as-covid-19-leaves-children-without-carers-101620297157035.html

The research data of CCMB far does not establish that N440K is a variant of interest and is very virulent."N440K Strain of coronavirus (B136) was detected in the month of June-July last year from the samples of south India (Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka and Telangana). This strain was prevalent in December 2020 and January and February 2021 and dropped down drastically in March and now the share of N440K among the positives is very minimal.At present, B1617 and B1 are the major strains identified from the samples of south India from the positives of the April month data, which is very infectious and is also spreading in the younger age groups apart from the adults.B1617, and the 'double mutant' -- this name comes from two notable mutations found in other variants that appeared together for the first time in this new strain and first detected in western parts of India, the letter stated."Although, N440K variant shown to be efficient in cell culture system in experimental conditions, it is important to remember that just because a variant behaves a certain way in cell cultures (with no competition, and in controlled settings), it does not mean it will behave the same way in humans, or in a complicated pandemic scenario. N440K story is one such example.""It is pertinent to note that Covid-19 Weekly Epidemiological Update dated April 25 issued by WHO mentions about lineage B1617 as VOI (Variant of Interest)from India and does not mention about variant N440K. If this variant is of such public health concern as reported in certain sections of media, it should have by now found place WHO reports as well as ICMR reports, it added."Hence it is clarified that research data so far does not establish that N440K is variant of interest and is very virulent," Chairman Reddy said.Meanwhile, the health department of the state appealed to the media to be "responsible" in publishing material pertaining to scientific issues and avoid creating panic in the minds of public during this pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/research-data-doesn-t-establish-n440k-variant-is-very-virulent-andhra-covid-command-centre-chief-101620293119756.html

As many as 144 alleged black marketeers have been arrested and 451 vials of Remdesivir injections, 242 oxygen cylinders and 285 oxygen concentrators among other critical medical equipment seized ffrom them.According to data accessed by Hindustan Times, Delhi Police Commissioner S N Shrivastava spoke to his Jharkhand and Bihar counterparts on Wednesday to seek support for raids in certain parts of the state to book medical black marketeers. As of now the raids are being carried out.While Delhi Police has registered 225 cases of cheating against unscrupulous elements over charges, including promise of supply of essential drugs, setting up of fake websites, and has registered another 78 cases of black marketeering and hoarding. Three ambulances have also been seized for overcharging patients upto ₹1 lakh per trip to hospitals. A total of 2,822 medical equipment has been seized during the raid, including Favipiravir tablets, oxygen pumps and flow regulators.Even as the Delhi Police has launched a major initiative to book black marketeers, unscrupulous elements throughout the national capital region, particularly in Noida and Gurugram, have made a killing out of medicines used to treat cased of the Covid-19 virus. For instance, a single vial of Remdesivir has reportedly been sold at ₹2,500 per vial in the black market in Gurugram, while Tocilizumab injection, used to treat critical patients, has been sold between ₹7.5 lakh and ₹10 lakh per injection in the past week.The black marketeers have made hay out of patients requiring oxygen cylinders, regulators and even basic medicines at a time when the second wave of the pandemic wreaked havoc across the country. The situation in neighbouring Noida is no better with certain unscrupulous elements charging a huge premium in lieu of arranging oxygen beds or ICUs for critical patients.In Delhi, the maximum number of cases have been registered in the south and west zone with the former making maximum arrests of 35 persons on charhes of cheating, fraud and black marketeering. A number of those arrested have also been charged under relevant sections of the cyber law for allegedly creating a fake website of ministry of health and family welfare to "offer" Covid-19 vaccine at a cost of ₹4,000-6,000 to unsuspecting victims.Incidentally, this fake website had the same layout and texture of the original website including the national emblem. A number of cheating cases pertain to demanding upfront payment for Remdesivir injections and then not delivering on the promise.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhi-police-raids-hoarders-of-medical-oxygen-and-medicines-in-bihar-jharkhand-101620290583653.html

She is still under treatment.Pandu was handpicked by matinee idol and former chief minister MG Ramachandran (MGR) to design the party’s symbol and flag after he split from the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) in 1972 and launched the Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam or ADMK (later renamed AIADMK). The AIADMK’s two-leaves and the DMK’s rising sun symbol have a major recall value among the electorate who largely vote based on the symbols. AIADMK’s coordinator and outgoing deputy chief minister O Panneerselvam said Pandu’s death was “shocking and heartbreaking”. Pannerselvam tweeted a picture of Pandu sketching two green leaves. Outgoing chief minister Edappadi Palansiwami also tweeted his condolences and recalled Pandu’s contribution to the AIADMK. Besides him, chief minister elect MK Stalin and several members of the film fraternity too expressed their condolences.Pandu made his debut in the 1970 film Maanavan and went on to play comic and character roles in several films with leading actors. Pandu also ran a firm, Capital Letters, which designed signboards.

He has since found it hard to sustain his family of four. Sahni, who lives in a small, rented room with his wife and daughters aged nine and seven, has also been unable to return to his native Vaishali in Bihar as he does not the money for it.“It is a much worse situation this time,” said Sahni, referring to the lockdown imposed last year to check the pandemic spread that forced tens of thousands of migrant workers left jobless to cycle or walk back to their homes.Sahni said around 15 people from his village, who sold ice creams in Neemrana, have returned to their homes. “... we could not. There is no money left for us to travel back home [over 1,300 kilometres away].”Sahni said they utilised all their savings during the lockdown last year and that they fear for their survival. He added people were reluctant to offer help as they are fearful of getting infected. “Last year, many neighbours would offer us food. This time no one came. People are fearful because of the virus,” said Sahni. “My daughter injured her foot last week and that wound had to be stitched. The medicine and ointment cost ₹500. I did not have any money to pay for it. I asked the chemist if we could pay later but he refused. My wife somehow managed to borrow money. The times are bad. How would anyone lend me money? Most of the people I know are skipping meals.”Many like the Sahnis are finding it difficult to stay afloat as lockdowns imposed across the country in the face of surging infections have left them jobless.Also Read | Covid test, week-long quarantine must for migrant workers returning to JharkhandAccording to Stranded Workers Action Network (Swan), a volunteer group, livelihood distress is beginning to rise again among workers like Sahni as the economic activity has come to a standstill across India. “As many as 81% of the workers, who are stranded or are in their homes, said that work had stopped in early April due to locally declared lockdowns/restrictions,” said a Swan report based on survey conducted over the last fortnight.As many as 82% of workers that Swan spoke to said that they had not received any money from their employers since the lockdowns began last month. At least 32% of workers had not got their wages of previous months.Sahni said even if he manages to find some work, people usually pay less. “My ice-cream factory owner has a flour mill too. ...he paid me ₹400 daily for selling ice creams.. after lockdown, he called me to his flour mill for loading and unloading of flour bags. This work was more difficult than the first, but hardly has he ever paid me more than 200 rupees daily.”Dinesh Rathore, a construction worker in Delhi, said since the weekend curfew in April, he and his brother have lost all savings. “We have a few hundred rupees left which would hardly last till 10th of this month,” said Rathore. He added an NGO paid them ₹2,000. “We do not know what to do if the lockdown is extended here. Last year, the government had put us up at a school in Delhi and gave us food. This year, no one is helping. There is nothing to do at home. Many of us have now shifted to a single room to share the rent. The government should at least open up the schools like last year and give us food.”Anandita Adhikari of Swan said while there are no travel restrictions and workers can go their homes, there are fears of a nationwide lockdown, which, if unplanned again, might lead to the repetition of what happened last year.Mohammad Gulzar, 24, a migrant worker from Jharkhand who works in Goa, said even for a week before the lockdown was imposed, police would not allow them to go for work. “I along with a few more from my village left Goa three days back on a train. We did not want to go through what happened with us the last time. We did not even have anything to eat,” said Gulzar, who is the sole bread earner of his family.PK Gupta, officer on special duty, Union labour ministry, said the government has set up 20 control rooms to address wage-related grievances of migrant workers and to mitigate their problems through coordination with state governments. “We have even shared personal numbers of our officers so that the migrant workers can directly call them to get their grievances resolved. Even, last year, when this crisis erupted as many as ₹295 crore of pending wages were paid to over 20,00,00 workers... People who need help should call and the best possible help shall be given to them.”Ajay Tiwari, joint secretary, directorate general labour welfare, said they held a meeting with the states on Thursday over the issue. “Though at a few places, these workers are getting help in the form of food provisions by the states but today [Thursday] all the states have been directed to lend some financial assistance as well as ration support...”Also Watch | ‘All options being discussed’: Govt on nationwide lockdown amid Covid crisisAdhikari said the government should provide income support to these workers to ensure their families do not suffer. “They are usually away from their homes and do not have access to their ration cards. Thereby they cannot avail the subsidised food grains.”Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Tuesday said that the state will once again provide free ration for two months to ration card holders and also give financial aid of ₹5,000 to autorickshaw and taxi drivers in the city to help them tide over financial losses due to the lockdown in the city.According to the Swan survey, over 70% of workers needed ration or cash support immediately. “While many of the workers living alone have returned to their villages, those with their families cannot... A direct income support in the form of wage compensation would at least help them sustain this crisis,” said Adhikari. She said the government should prioritise vaccination of these workers. Adhikari said if they are not vaccinated immediately, the virus of every strain will reach villages as the migrant workers frequently move from urban to rural areas.“Before the state governments coordinate and arrange for the transportation of these workers, they should organise vaccination drives...” Adhikari also called for vaccine awareness campaigns as many migrant workers are hesitant to go for the vaccination.Economist Karan Bhasin echoed Adhikari and said India cannot afford another mass migration. “...the central government should help them sustain rental and other expenses through direct income support...it is the responsibility of the state governments as well to reach out to them with help and prevent them from migrating to their villages.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/migrant-workers-among-worst-hit-as-curbs-put-in-place-to-check-covid-19-cases-101620290510968.html

The bench as solicitor general Tushar Mehta to explain how prepared the Centre is to deal with the third wave of the pandemic.Justice Chandrachud said in the impending third wave, children might be affected and when a child goes to a hospital, his parents will also go. So, the vaccination of this group of people needs to be over by that time, Justice Chandrachud said.During the hearing which pertains to oxygen supply to Delhi, Mehta said to allot 700 metric tonne of oxygen to Delhi, the allotment for other states has to be interfered with.Centre moves SC challenging Delhi HC's show cause notice of contempt over deficit in oxygen supply to CapitalMost of the hospitals that are raising SOS for oxygen now were not Covid hospitals and so they did not have tanks, Mehta said, adding that the capacity to hold oxygen in a cylinder is 12 hours and as many hospitals only had tanks, SOS messages were raised.As Mehta said that now the Centre will be answerable for taking oxygen from elsewhere and rerouting it to Delhi, Justice Chandrachud said the formula needs a relook as it has grossly underestimated Delhi's requirement.Advocate Rahul Mehra said it is wrong for the Centre to say that other states will suffer from additional oxygen supply to Delhi as according to Centre's affidavit, the additional 210 metric tonne of oxygen is less than 1 per cent of what they have. People in Delhi are dying and the Centre shouldn't be allowed to reduce the supply, Mehra said.Terming Centre's oxygen allocation to states arbitrary, Mehra said if an audit is required, then it is required to examine these allocations and the tankers.Tushar Mehta said the Centre can not only be concerned with Delhi. "People have given mandate to this government twice. People are in the heart. But we can not be concerned only about Delhi. Our concern is that there has to be mechanism in place for propoer allocation and distribution."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/how-will-you-deal-with-3rd-surge-of-pandemic-supreme-court-asks-centre-101620289403764.html

The test positivity rate has reached 25.69% -- an all time high, while the active caseload reached 375,658.Though its fatality rate is the lowest in the country (below 0.4%), statistics show it is also climbing steadily in the last one week with 58 deaths reported in the last 24 hours. In terms of total cases of the viral infection, Kerala is at the third spot after Maharashtra and Karnataka.Hospitals and ICUs are overflowing and long queues are visible outside crematoriums in worst- affected districts. A worried CM wrote to Prime Minister Modi on Wednesday seeking more liquid medical oxygen and vaccines.Besides shortage of essential medical equipment and oxygen, many hospitals have shortage of human resources, a problem compounded by rising infections among the staff. The government opened oxygen war rooms in every district with senior officials co-ordinating with medical officers and collectors to ensure hassle-free supplyCurrently the state has a stock of 272.2 metric tonnes of liquid oxygen and it needs 108 mt of oxygen daily, health ministry statistics show.The government has also decided to convert hostels, lodges and empty offices as first line treatment centres to meet the surge of patients. It also tweaked protocol to only allow admission to patients in need of urgent medical care. The CM had also sought the help of NRIs to tide over the grave situation. The state has about 25 lakh people working abroad and 70% of them are in West Asian countries.Kerala has so far vaccinated 74 lakh people, almost 20 per cent of its 3.25 crore population. The Union Health Ministry and PM had recently lauded its zero wastage of vaccines.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-covid-19-cases-reach-unprecedented-levels-state-announces-8-day-lockdown-101620289131210.html

He had entered around 100 meter inside our territory..,” said the BSF officer.He added that the intruder ignored repeated warnings to stop, given by the BSF jawans, leaving them with no alternative but to shoot him.“His dead body is still lying there,” the BSF officer added.On April 13, the BSF had caught a Pakistani intruder along the IB in RS Pura sector of Jammu district. He, too, didn’t heed BSF warnings and received minor injuries when fired at by a BSF jawan. He was later handed over to local police.On April 24, A couple of Pakistani drones entered the Indian territory along the border in Arnia sector of Jammu district in the early hours. They returned to Pakistani territory after BSF guards opened fire.On May 3, Monday, Pakistani rangers opened unprovoked fire at BSF jawans busy with maintenance work at the border fence in Ramgarh sector of Samba district, violating the renewed ceasefire agreement between the two sides.Eom.....||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pakistani-intruder-shot-dead-by-bsf-in-jammu-kashmir-101620287390654.html

In a webinar on oxygen therapy for Covid-19 treatment, organised by AIIMS, experts on Wednesday emphasised that oxygen therapy is more important than ventilation as more people on oxygen therapy can be brought back to life. But equally important is saving oxygen and not overusing it. If someone's oxygen saturation is around 95 per cent, trying to bring that to 98 or 99 per cent is futile."If your oxygen saturation level is around 94 per cent, it means there is sufficient oxygen in your body. Previously when we used to do prolonged oxygen therapy for people with lung diseases, we have seen people doing fine in oxygen saturation of even 88 per cent. Oxygen saturation of 92 or 93 should not be considered critical. But this is a buffer level when you can seek medical help without panicking," Dr Guleria said.How to use oxygen for Covid-19 treatment? What are the safety precautions? Centre releases guidelinesThe experts also stressed the need of checking the oxygen saturation 15 minutes after resting and consult a doctor only when there is a sustained drop at the level, not when there is a one-off dip in the measurement, as the reading can depend on posture too.Should one buy oxygen cylinders for home usage? Answering this question, Dr Guleria said people are stocking up on oxygen cylinders at home without knowing the proper usage. Handling without care will lead to wastage."One common example of oxygen wastage is when patients are given food, they take the oxygen mask off and keep it at the side without switching off the connection," Dr Guleria said.The Union health ministry has also issued a detailed guideline on self-proning to improve breathing where one can lie face down or at different prescribed postures for better ventilation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/if-oxygen-level-is-94-aiims-director-on-oxygen-misuse-in-covid-treatment-101620285750347.html

Of this, the total consumption including wastages is 16,26,10,905 doses, as per the official data made available at 8 am."More than 89 lakh Covid vaccine doses (89,31,505) are still available with the states and UTs to be administered. States with negative balance are showing more consumption (including wastage) than vaccine supplied as they have not reconciled the vaccine they have supplied to the armed forces," the ministry said.Furthermore, more than 28 lakh (28,90,360) vaccine doses will be received in addition by the states and UTs within the next three days, it said.The central government is leading the fight against the Covid-19 pandemic in collaboration with the states and UTs through a “Whole of Government” approach, the ministry said.Vaccination forms an integral component of the five-point strategy of government of India of containment and management of the pandemic (including Test, Track, Treat and Covid Appropriate Behaviour), it said.The ministry said implementation of the ‘Liberalised and Accelerated Phase 3 Strategy’ of Covid-19 vaccination has started from May 1.Registration for the new eligible population groups has commenced since April 28. Potential beneficiaries can either register directly on the CoWIN portal (HYPERLINK "http://cowin.gov.in"cowin.gov.in) or through the Aarogya Setu app, it said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/over-89-lakh-covid-19-vaccine-doses-still-available-with-states-uts-centre-101620283721105.html

06-05-2021||India||Odisha: Covid-19 deaths not reconciled, data doesn’t reflect true picture||A year after battling the Covid pandemic successfully during its first wave, Odisha appears to have faltered during the second wave with number of actual Covid deaths acceding the numbers in official data even as the virus spreads deep into rural areas with high test positivity rates.Data shows it took just 29 days in April this year to register 1 lakh new Covid cases compared to the 169 days taken in the first wave last year. As cases gallop, the state government on Wednesday extended the lockdown to entire state for a period of 14 days after similar restrictions failed to curb the spread in western Odisha and the state’s urban areas.On Thursday, the state reported 10,521 new cases, taking the total number of active cases to 81,585 amid a positivity rate of 21.77%. While the total number of active cases has doubled since last year’s peak figure of 39,184, anecdotal evidence suggests under reporting of Covid-related deaths. Though officially the death toll stood at 133 in April, inquiries with various Covid hospitals and district authorities suggested many more people had died due to the infection.In Bhubaneswar, official figures put active Covid cases at 8,947 and the deaths at 12 for the month of April. However, Bhubaneswar Municipal Corporation said 20-30 bodies were being cremated daily at the Satya Nagar crematorium in the state capital for over a fortnight. On Monday, at least 40 bodies were cremated there while 8-9 bodies were in queue, said the municipality.“In the early parts of April, I would see at least 10 pyres burning at any given point of time. Now there are more and more bodies,” said a resident of Satyanagar, who lives close to the crematorium.In neighbouring city of Cuttack, the workers at the crematorium in Sati Choura too have been busy. On Sunday last, at least 44 bodies were cremated there according to Cuttack Municipal Corporation (CMC) officials, who didn’t wish to be named. But as per government statistics, only three persons in Cuttack succumbed to Covid in April. Again, in coastal district of Balasore, at least 14 deaths have been reported from Covid hospitals, but only 5 deaths have been shown on the state government portal.In western Odisha’s Nuapada, were the test positivity rate in April was consistently around 35% (which means one out of every three persons tested there turns out to be positive for the disease), the official death toll was just 4. But local officials said 82 deaths were reported from the Covid hospitals of the district. Similarly, in Sambalpur district, more than 191 deaths due to Covid were reported from hospitals, but the government data cites only 82 deaths.Immunology consultant in SUM Covid hospital, Pradipta Patra said compared to the first wave of Covid last year, the mortality is higher in the second wave. “In the first wave, there were more asymptomatic cases, but in the second wave there are more symptomatic cases where lungs are getting affected in a greater degree. More and more patients are requiring oxygen,” he said. Health department officials confirmed that during Covid peak last year, the maximum demand for Oxygen was 23 MT per day while in April it was 36 MT.Director of health services Bijay Mohapatra admitted that the deaths being shown in the department’s Twitter handle was not real-time data and a reconciliation of the death toll was pending. “The deaths that you see that are not the deaths that happened yesterday. We notify the deaths only after we get report from districts where a committee audits each of the deaths. So at any given point of time, there may be 100 deaths that are being audited,” he said.CDMO of Nuapada district, Kali Prasad Behera admitted that death audits were taking time as they have been busy with overall Covid management. "We are doing the audit as per the ICMR protocol," he said.Unlike last year, when the test positivity rate (TPR) hovered around 10 and 11% during July and August, this year the TPR has consistently been above 15% for the last 10 days. On Thursday, Odisha’s TPR went beyond 20%, the third time in the last 7 days. Yet, the state government has not pushed forward the number of tests, more so in western Odisha districts that are recording 50% positivity.In April, the daily tests have never gone past the 50,000 figure and the RT-PCR tests, considered to be the gold standard of Covid testing, barely constitutes 40% of the total tests. Leading microbiologist Dr TM Mohapatra, who was earlier associated with the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), said the state should have been testing at least 1 lakh samples every day. “As the current strain is very infectious compared to last year’s, tests should have been ramped up. It would be difficult to find out the extent of the spread and save people if tests are not increased,” he said.However, the tests have not gone up partly due to couple of RT-PCR machines malfunctioning and suppliers not providing required number of testing kits, forcing the state government not to go beyond the set target.Activist Pradip Pradhan alleged that delayed tests were hampering the fight against Covid.“One of my friends got his RT-PCR test done 5 days ago, but his report is yet to come. How would he be treated without a RT-PCR report,” he asked.As lesser number of tests was being conducted despite high positivity rates, health activists were wary of the virus spreading further in rural hinterland. Of the 13,050 active cases in Khurda, more than 4,000 are in hundreds of villages of the district. Of the 5,423 active Covid cases in Cuttack district, around 1,600 are spread in several villages.In Nuapara district, bordering Chhatisgarh and Sundargarh that borders Jharkhand, the TPR crossed 50% on some days indicating every second person to be tested was positive. It was in Nuapara and Kalahandi districts, where infections were first reported in late March after several people travelled to watch a cricket match in neighbouring Chhatisgarh, bringing the virus to their home.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/odisha-covid-19-deaths-not-reconciled-data-doesn-t-reflect-true-picture-101620282469949.html
06-05-2021||India||How to use oxygen for Covid-19 treatment? What are the safety precautions? Centre releases guidelines||As the Centre is ramping up the supply of oxygen to states and all hospitals, the Centre on Thursday released a guideline of the use of liquid medical oxygen. "Oxygen is crucial for the treatment of patients with severe Covid-19 since the disease affects lung functioning. Shortness of breath or difficulty of breathing is one of the most common symptoms in patients with severe Covid-19. It also hampers the supply of oxygen to various parts of the body. They hence need oxygen therapy, to be supplied through medical oxygen," it said.Liquification enables the storage of oxygen in a larger volume and easier transportation, the Centre said, detailing how it is produced, stored and what precautions should be taken for storage. How is liquid medical oxygen produced?There are several methods. The most common production method is the separation of oxygen in what are known as Air Separation Units or ASUs. ASUs are basically plants that separate large volumes of gases. They use a method called Fractional Distillation Method to produce pure oxygen from atmospheric air, which consists mostly of nitrogen and oxygen - 78% nitrogen, 21% oxygen and the remaining 1% other gases including argon, carbon dioxide, neon, helium, and hydrogen.In this method, gases from the air are separated into various components after cooling them into a liquid state and then liquid oxygen is extracted from it.As India fights Covid-19 second wave, here's all you need to know about oxygen concentratorsAtmospheric air is first cooled to -181°C. Oxygen liquefies at this point. Since the boiling point of Nitrogen is -196°C, it remains in a gaseous state. But Argon has a boiling point similar to that of oxygen (–186°C) and hence a significant amount of Argon liquifies along with Oxygen.The resultant mixture of Oxygen and Argon is drained, decompressed and passed through a second low-pressure distillation vessel for further purification.We then get the output as final purified liquid oxygen, which is then transported using cryogenic containers.What are cryogenic containers?Cryogenics is the production and behaviour of materials at very low temperatures. A cryogenic liquid is defined as a liquid with a normal boiling point below –90°C.Cryogenic liquid containers are specially designed for safe and economic transportation and storage of liquefied gases at cryogenic temperatures, lower than –90°C. These containers are highly insulated, in which liquid gases are stored at very low temperatures.What is the Pressure Swing Absorption Technique?Oxygen can also be produced non-cryogenically, in gaseous form, using selective adsorption. This method leverages the property that under high pressure, gases tend to be attracted to solid surfaces. The higher the pressure, the more the adsorption of gas.If a gas mixture such as air is passed under pressure through a vessel containing an adsorbent bed of ‘zeolite’ that attracts nitrogen more strongly than oxygen, a part or all of the nitrogen will stay in the bed, and the gas exiting the vessel will be richer in oxygen, relative to the mixture entering the vessel.Hospitals can also opt for on-site generation of oxygen by this method, where oxygen is produced from ambient air by concentrating it. Producing oxygen near hospitals has the additional advantage of eliminating the need for transportation.In addition to the above sources of medical oxygen, there are also portable oxygen generators known as Oxygen Concentrators that can be used at home.What are the safety precautions to be followed?If the temperature is high enough, many substances will burn in oxygen. Hence, it is equally essential to ensure proper fire safety measures and train all staff in the safe handling of oxygen as the increased storage and handling of oxygen cylinders during Covid-19 heightens the risk of hospital fires.There are also additional requirements and rules for medical oxygen, including requiring a person to have a prescription to order medical oxygen.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/how-to-use-oxygen-for-covid-19-treatment-what-are-the-safety-precautions-centre-releases-guidelines-101620281352922.html

The group has demanded transparency from various governmental entities regarding the use of 'facial recognition' technology, reportedly in use at various airports across India, and on the government's plans on using such technology for a 'touchless' vaccination process.Also Read: Why India must resist facial recognition tech | OpinionThe IFF is also keeping a close watch on free speech violations, and demanded accountability from the Centre over Twitter removing 50 posts from its platform last month on government requests. Most of these posts were related to the government's handling of the Covid-19 pandemic, and the foundation demanded a response from the government over "violations of free speech on the internet."The foundation, which runs campaigns to defend online freedom and data privacy, said that it has filed six RTI requests this month, pertaining to the newly introduced government projects. "Under IFF’s Project Panoptic, we routinely file RTI requests with various public authorities after we come across news reports that they are developing or using facial recognition technology," the IFF report read.According to the Internet Freedom Foundation, the RTI requests demanding transparency on the government's use of 'facial recognition' technology relate to five distinct public projects. These are listed as follows:The Hindustan Times earlier reported that work was underway at the Varanasi and Pune airports to install automated passenger-based facial recognition systems, that the government says will ensure "hassle-free movement of travellers from entry to boarding points." The government says walk-through security scanners, once capable of identifying passengers by their faces, will make entry into the airport faster and ensure automated check-ins without the requirement of any paper-based intervention. Details of passengers provided at the time of booking tickets will be examined digitally through their Aadhaar numbers.In its RTI applications, the Internet Freedom Foundation has demanded to know the specific purposes for which facial recognition technology will be used by the government entities, the legislation which authorises them to do so, and the total expenditure incurred to procure such technology. The IFF has also sought a bunch of other information, including the list of persons authorised to access the technology, the software and hardware being used, and details of the database.Complete details on the RTI requests can be found here, on the official website of the Internet Freedom Foundation.Moreover, one more RTI request was also filed with the department of agriculture, cooperation and farmers welfare on the memorandum of understanding (MoU) with Microsoft for a pilot project in 100 villages of six states.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/internet-freedom-foundation-rti-report-government-use-of-facial-recognition-technology-in-airports-coronavirus-covid-19-vaccination-101620276808052.html

Moscow has decided to ramp up Sputnik V doses to more than five million next month and more than 10 million vaccines in July.According to diplomats based in New Delhi and Moscow, Russia is sending at least four medium oxygen generating trucks, which can feed a 200-bed hospital after being plugged into the power supply. These trucks produce 70 kilograms of oxygen per hour and 50,000 litres per day so that there is no paucity of oxygen at the hospital to which they are attached. “We have already procured four such trucks and getting more so that oxygen paucity is reduced. These trucks will be landing by Russian IL-76 aircraft by the end of this week,” said a diplomat.The first batch of 150,000 doses of Sputnik V arrived on May 1, the day when India opened its third phase of vaccination to people between the age group of 18 to 44 years. Sputnik V is based on human adenoviral vectors, is one of three vaccines (the other two are Pfizer and Moderna) that have an efficacy of over 90 per cent against the coronavirus disease, which is caused by SARS-CoV-2. It was given regulatory approval or restricted use authorisation in India on April 12.The Russian medical support can be seen at Kalawati Hospital in Delhi with 75 ventilators, 20 large capacity oxygen concentrators and 150-bed monitors being installed at the Central Delhi hospital. Besides 60 large oxygen concentrators already on way through private donation, Russia has supplied 200,000 tablets of Fafivir drug, used for treating early stages of coronavirus, to all central AIIMS facilities in north India.While Russia is keen to supply Remdesivir vials also, the Indian regulators simultaneously working out minor regulatory issues like getting the vials of Sputnik V labelled in English apart from the overall packaging. “New Delhi and Moscow are constantly in touch with each other through the diplomatic channels so that medical support is available on demand as much as possible,” said an Indian diplomat.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/russia-sending-another-batch-of-150-000-sputnik-v-vaccines-to-india-101620279218533.html

06-05-2021||India||Rights panel chief cautions against social media posts about orphaned children||National Commission for Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR) chairperson Priyank Kanoongo has cautioned against social media posts seeking help or donations for children, who may have lost their parents to the Covid-19 pandemic. “People must understand the procedure. Right now, the need of the hour is to ensure that the children must be produced before the child welfare committees. Each child’s case will require a different sort of intervention and will be analysed separately. Whether the children are taken to a welfare home or sent to reside with a relative, all will be decided on a case-to-case basis,” said Kanoongo on Wednesday.Kanoongo said adoptions cannot be done without going through proper channels. The Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act also empowers the district magistrates to authorise adoptions.Kanoongo said the NCPCR has written to states to ensure timely involvement in cases of orphaned children. NCPCR has also called for roping in frontline workers, police officials, NGOs, and even NITI Aayog to help vulnerable children.“We have asked the states to apprise us of how many children may have been exposed to such a difficult situation due to the pandemic...,” Kanoongo said.Also Read | Maharashtra opens two helplines to check fake child adoption messages going viral on social mediaIn its letter dated May 2, a copy of which HT has seen, NCPCR directed the states to ask NGOs to share the details of children who have lost their parents. “The Commission has been made aware of instances where it has been seen that many NGOs are advertising about the children who have become orphan... In such a sad situation of the surge in COVID-19 cases in the country, there are situations arising where the child has lost both its parents and is found to be abandoned,” NCPCR said in the letter. “It is of utmost importance that these children who have lost their family support must be produced before the child protection authorities of the district and information about these children must be shared with the authorities.”Union minister Smriti Irani on Tuesday asked people to alert the authorities about vulnerable children. “If you come to know of any child who has lost both parents to Covid and has no one to take care of her/him, inform Police or Child Welfare Committee of your district or contact Childline 1098. It is your legal responsibility,” Irani tweeted. “It is illegal to give or take orphan children of anyone else in adoption. Such children should be taken to child welfare committee, which will take necessary action in the best interest of the child.”Delhi Commission for Protection of Child Rights on Tuesday said orphaned children are vulnerable to trafficking.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rights-panel-chief-cautions-against-social-media-posts-about-orphaned-children-101620274968931.html
06-05-2021||India||Samajwadi Party says it won UP panchayat polls, will target assembly polls next||The Samajwadi Party (SP) on Wednesday claimed to have defeated the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in the recently concluded three-tier panchayat polls in Uttar Pradesh with party backed candidates winning over 800 zila panchayat member seats. It also claimed that the results were a verdict on the BJP’s ‘misrule’ ahead of the 2022 assembly elections. The BJP disputed the SP’s claims and said it will “emerge as the overall leader” in the polls.Declaring victory, SP state spokesperson and former UP minister Rajendra Chaudhary said the party “will not waste energy in countering BJP’s horse-trading” to win zila panchayat headship elections that will follow the declaration of panchayat election results.“We would rather capitalise on putting up an even more impressive show in the UP assembly polls in 2022,” he said. Zila (district) panchayat headship is an indirect election in which the directly elected Zila panchayat members vote to gain administrative control. The election for over 8.69 lakh posts, including the 3,050 Zila panchayat member seats, was held in four phases last month in Uttar Pradesh. The three-tier panchayat system elected public representatives from the village to the district level and was being seen as a curtain-raiser to the 2022 state assembly polls.“Seventy per cent population lives in villages and they have given their mandate against the BJP and in favour of the SP already. We had fielded party supported candidates on approximately 1,500 zila panchayat member seats, of which more than 800 won. Not only this, party’s national president Akhilesh Yadav’s strategy of leaving ‘free candidates’... also worked,” said Chaudhary. The panchayat elections were not fought on party symbols, but rival parties had marked their preferred candidates.Chaudhary explained that the term ‘free candidate’ is used to describe party supported candidates. “If there are more than one deserving candidate... then the party let’s all of them contest. If anyone of them wins, it becomes the party’s victory. On more than 800 seats, SP’s free candidates won the zila panchayat memberships”, he explained. However, the UP BJP chief Swatantradev Singh dismissed his claims. “We fought on more than 3,000 seats for the post of zila panchayat members. The claims of opposition parties that the BJP performed badly are incorrect. We will remain ahead, and emerge as overall leader in the polls,” he was quoted as saying by a news agency. On Monday, the ruling party had claimed that over 45,000 party-supported candidates won the village pradhan posts and over 60,000 were elected to the kshetra (block) panchayats apart from the zila panchayat member posts.As per the results announced on Tuesday, the BJP faced losses in strongholds such as Ayodhya, Varanasi, Lucknow and Gorakhpur. In Varanasi, while the Samajwadi Party won 15 of the 40 wards, BJP and the BSP won seven each and the Congress won five wards. In Ayodhya, SP was the biggest gainer with 24 of the 40 wards, while BJP won six and BSP won five wards. In Gorakhpur, the BJP with 20 of the 68 wards had just one more than the SP’s 19. SP president Akhilesh Yadav alleged on Wednesday that the BJP was indulging in “horse-trading” to seize control of zila panchayats.“After tasting defeat in the panchayat polls, the BJP is now engaging in enticing, intimidating and threatening winners to win the indirect elections,” he said in a statement released by the party. Another party leader claimed that the Samajwadi Party would easily win 25 zila panchayat headship elections. “There is no need to waste energy on the rest of the seats,” he said. The party hopes to win zila panchayat headship in Lucknow, Ayodhya, Lakhimpur Kheri, Sonbhadra, Varanasi, Azamgarh, Prayagraj, Siddharth Nagar, Jaunpur, Ghazipur, Deoria, Kushinagar, Kanpur Nagar, Mirzapur, Ballia, Bijnor, Etawah, Fatehpur, Unnao, Auriya, Ambedkarnagar, Firozabad, Kasganj, and Etah. SP spokesperson Rajendra Chaudhary said the results showed that the ruling BJP had “failed miserably on all fronts” and described the party as “anti-farmers, anti-youth.” He added that crime against women in the state, law and order [situation], price rise including petrol and diesel prices affect villagers immensely, which resulted in the SP’s win. SP member of legislative council (MLC) Sunil Singh Yadav described it as the “beginning of the change”. “The training camps that the party president Akhilesh Yadav ran across the state and attended, foot marches, and events like Kisaan Ghera in villages connected people with his vision,” he says. Samajwadi Party ran various campaigns such as Kisan Ghera (informal meetings with farmers locally) to mobilise farmers against the three farm reform laws enacted by the BJP-led Union government, held exploitative by a section of farmers. Similarly, it also organised ‘Yuva Ghera’ and ‘Mahila Ghera’ programmes to engage students and the women folk in discussions involving their issues. Akhilesh also travelled widely across 40 districts and held meetings, addressed the public and conducted cadre training camps. 270 Congress-supported candidates emerged victorious on the post of zila panchayat members, while on 571 seats they came second, and third on 711 seats, said a Congress leader.AAP claimed it had won 83 seats for members of zila panchayat, 300 village pradhans seats, and 232 seats for the post of members of kshetra panchayats.SP’s ally Rashtriya Lok Dal too performed well in some districts of west UP, such as Baghpat and Shamli.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/samajwadi-party-says-it-won-up-panchayat-polls-will-target-assembly-polls-next-101620274188832.html

About 13.5 million (13,565,728) frontline workers have received their first vaccine dose, and nearly 7.3 million (7,332,999) have so far been fully vaccinated.

06-05-2021||India||'If vaccine makers are threatened': Lawyer seeks Z security for Adar Poonawalla||A Mumbai-based lawyer has filed a writ petition in the Bombay high court seeking z+ security for Serum Institute of India CEO Adar Poonawalla who, in an interview to a British newspaper, talked about life threats in India for vaccines against Covid-. In his petition, advocate Datta Mane sought protection for Adar's family members and the properties of Serum Institute of India as well, Livelaw reported."If vaccine makers are threatened with life, then they will not be able to produce a vaccine to its fullest resources...If Mr Adar Poonawalla is out of India due to fear to his life, then it will be Ship in Storm without its Captain. Mr Poonawalla and SII have become lifesavers of the Indian population and hence the government must protect them. However, the chief ministers have indulged into giving threats; hence the court-monitored security protection is required to be given," the plea said.Last month, the Union home ministry accorded Y category security to Poonawalla after Serum Institute of India director Prakash Kumar Singh wrote to Union home minister Amit Shah. In his letter, he claimed that Poonwalla was getting threats from various groups. As India began the third phase of vaccination, extending the jabs to people between the age group of 18 and 44 years, and allowing state governments and private hospitals to procure vaccines directly from vaccine makers, vaccines are in high demand. As states are yet to receive fresh doses, the third phase vaccination drive has not begun in full swing in many states.Adar Poonawalla faced controversy over differential pricing of vaccines between the Centre and the state governments. Initially, one dose of Covishield was priced at ₹400 for state governments, which was later brought down to ₹300.Claiming pressure from several influential people for vaccines, Adar Poonawalla told The Times that he had been receiving aggressive calls from some of the most powerful people in India, demanding supplies of Covishield.As the Maharashtra government assured of a detailed probe into Adar Poonawalla's complaint, if he formally lodges one, the government said it did not have any word with Poonawalla after he went to London, regarding vaccines.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/if-vaccine-makers-are-threatened-lawyer-seeks-z-security-for-adar-poonawalla-101620271836949.html

06-05-2021||India||How different will Covid's 3rd wave be from first two? What government says||Variants are only one factor of the huge second wave of the Covid-19 that is sweeping the country now, the government's principal scientific advisor K Vijay Raghavan said on Wednesday. As new variants of a virus are natural, the existing variants will make way for new variants which may or may not be more virulent, but variants should not make any difference in people's primary approach to combat Covid-19, which should consist of maintaining social distancing, the expert said. While in 2019 and 2020, the virus continued to be a generalist, like a key that can be fitted into many locks, the virus in 2021 became much fitter and efficient as it is trying a "hit and run lifestyle" to gain entry to the human body. In the coming days, the virus will become more efficient as immunity, vaccination are building adaptive pressure on the virus. Here is what the government said about the various waves of the pandemic:> The first wave halted as a combination of a standing level of immunity in the population and cautionary steps.> The second wave started because new opportunities for the spread of the infection come up. When the guard drops, the immunity is sometimes not enough to stop the infection from spreading.> Many people get infected until a new threshold of immunity is reached.> Such a second wave is typically smaller than the first wave. Such a second wave was expected. However, multiple parameters can change in small amounts and add up to a second wave which is much larger than the first wave.> Such a larger second wave with such ferocity was not predicted.Third wave of Covid inevitable, says government> Immunity, developed after the first wave, is not widespread. The number of people who remained unaffected because of cautionary steps taken in the first step may have been large. Immunity can also fade. Someone infected earlier can get reinfected but we know that the protection is still very high after eight months.> In 2019, when the virus emerged, it was a generalist. It could infect many mammals and was not a tightly human-adaptive virus. The lineage continued for a long period. In the second phase, which started in October 2020, the virus became fitter. "It was a key that could fit many locks," the expert said adding that with the increase in the transmission, the key became more refined.> In early 2021, a very large number of people all over the world had been infected. As the immunity increases, the virus does not have the opportunity to grow. But it sees that there are pockets it can go through and therefore there's selection through evolution for the viruses to be more efficient in transmission. In the second phase, efficiency has been selected because of already present immunity in the population. The virus will thus find new routes.> A phase 3 is inevitable given the high levels of circulating virus, but the time scale is not yet clear.> On immunity getting eroded by the evolution of SARS-CoV-2, experts said it is positioned somewhere between measles and influenza. Measles immunity never gets eroded while that for influenza gets depleted rapidly. The viral evolution of SARS-CoV-2 is somewhere in between but will change.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/how-did-first-two-waves-of-covid-subside-what-government-says-on-3rd-wave-101620265451308.html

06-05-2021||India||Value criticism, don’t spread rumours or argue with users: Centre to police forces||A social media policy prepared by the Centre for police forces across the country has asked personnel to value criticism and appreciation equally, and avoid propagating unverified facts and frivolous or misleading rumours while using social media.The policy, prepared by ministry of home affairs’ police think-tank – Bureau of Police Research and Development (BPRD), and shared with all the states last month, encourages use of social media by the police officers to reach a broad audience and spread the word about department’s work, but cautions them about conducting any “political activities or private business”.It says that the “online activity [of police officers] during working hours or using agency equipment must be primarily business related”.The “Social Media Policy for Police Organisations”, reviewed by HT, is a comprehensive document on the “dos and don’ts” for police departments – both in the states and the Centre, and aims to help police in image-building and bridging the trust deficit with the public. The army already has its social media policy in place since 2005.On personal social media accounts of police personnel, the BPRD policy says: “Department personnel are free to express themselves as private citizens on social media sites to the degree that their speech does not impair working relationships of this department for which loyalty and confidentiality are important, impede the performance of duties, impair discipline and harmony among co-workers, or negatively affect the public perception of the department.”It says police personnel should not post messages that may be prejudicial to court proceedings, abusive, defamatory, harmful, obscene, racially offensive, sexually offensive, and unlawful.“Show proper consideration for others’ privacy and for topics that may be considered objectionable or inflammatory — such as politics, religion and personal life,” the policy states.It asks cops not to make “statements about the guilt or innocence of any suspect or arrestee, or comments concerning pending prosecutions, nor post, transmit, or otherwise disseminate confidential information, including photographs or videos, related to departmental training, activities, or work-related assignments without express written permission”.Police officers using social media platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, or other accounts, the policy adds, should not argue with social media users/followers. Also, while responding to a negative post from a user, the cops should provide facts and supporting documentation.“Value criticism and appreciation equally on social media. Be the first to correct your own mistakes. Do not alter previous posts without indicating that you have done so. When responding to a negative post, state facts and provide supporting documentation. Avoid ongoing conversations that do not progress toward greater understanding,” the policy says.Experts welcomed the policy. “A police officer is a government servant and is bound by service rules. Hence, it is necessary that police officers must watch what they are writing or saying on social media, even through their personal accounts, because anything they say is invariably taken as view of the government,” retired IPS officer Karnal Singh said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/value-criticism-don-t-spread-rumours-or-argue-with-users-centre-to-police-forces-101620261234532.html
06-05-2021||India||Ensure Delhi gets 700 MT O2 every day: Top court to Centre||The Supreme Court on Wednesday directed the Union government to ensure 700 metric tonne (MT) of medical oxygen is supplied to Delhi every day, stating that even its judges feel “helpless” after hearing cries of people suffering due to shortage of oxygen, beds, and essential medicines in the national capital. It asked the Centre to submit a plan in the court by Thursday morning detailing how this target would be met, including logistical details.The bench of justices Dhananjaya Y Chandrachud and MR Shah also stayed the contempt proceedings initiated by the Delhi high court against the Centre on Tuesday over deficit in oxygen supply, but not before clarifying that this is contingent on the Union government’s admission that the court order of May 2 required the Centre to supply 700 MT of oxygen to Delhi until further orders.“We are not only judges but also citizens of this country. I and justice Shah have been continuously on phone trying to come up with some solution by using our good offices. But we are also helpless. So, we can understand what a common man and citizens feel. We are ultimately answerable to the people,” the bench told solicitor general Tushar Mehta, who represented the Centre.Mehta requested that the court not insist on 700 MT for Delhi, adding that the Centre will try to supply as much as possible,but the bench declined to accept such a suggestion.“We can’t accept this as an institutional response. Situation of Delhi is really critical. We are answerable to the citizens, and we know with 550 MT (the amount that reached Delhi on Tuesday), what is happening on the ground. Our friendships are limited because of our positions, but our offices are getting numerous calls, and the lawyers and others are crying. They plead ‘please do something’. When 550 MT is not solving the problem of Delhi, we cannot review our orders... there is tremendous anxiety on the part of the citizens to run from pillar to post for oxygen and cylinders,” it told the S-G.Mehta, on his part, pressed for an audit to figure out the real requirement of Delhi and optimal utilisation of medical oxygen before determining the final number. While the bench accepted the suggestion for having an audit and asked the Centre and Delhi government to suggest some names by Thursday morning for a panel that would examine this, it made it clear that the May 2 order on supplying 700 MT shall remain in force till the time this order is modified by specifying a higher or lower quantity.The Centre has consistently claimed that it cannot supply as much oxygen as Delhi wants, and also said that the Delhi government has not been able to transport supplies of oxygen allocated to it -- which is true; Delhi does not have the tankers required to do so.The oxygen crisis in the Capital has been due to the lower allocation by the Centre despite demands from the Delhi government for an enhanced oxygen quota, and the Delhi government’s failure to arrange for cryogenic tankers and trucks to lift even that allocated oxygen and seamlessly distribute it to its hospitals.‘National disaster’“Nobody can dispute it is a national disaster. Nobody can dispute there is a deficit of oxygen. Nobody can dispute some people have lost their lives due to shortage of oxygen... so, now let us ensure that lives are saved. We want you to ensure 700 MT is given between today and Monday (when the special bench takes up the matter initiated on its own) so that it takes the sting off the immediate humanitarian crisis in Delhi,” it said.The bench asked the S-G to submit a tabulated statement by 10.30am on Thursday, indicating the manner in which its order of supplying 700 MT oxygen to Delhi shall be complied with, and the details on sources of supply, transportation and other logistical arrangements. “This plan will remain in operation till further orders,” it ordered.Referring to the contempt proceedings initiated by the high court on Tuesday, the bench expressed displeasure at the Centre’s law officers trying to misinterpret the Supreme Court’s order on 700 MT (on Sunday) to wriggle out of the liability.“Why did your additional solicitors general tell the high court that we didn’t order for 700 MT? The problem is when your law officers argue like this and then you get into a crossfire. Tell your ASGs not to misinterpret the orders of the Supreme Court. The effort has to be to comply after our orders. Hauling up anyone in contempt will not get anybody oxygen in the country. We want the oxygen to come,” it told Mehta.“It must be clarified that taking recourse to contempt will not resolve the problems. The country is faced with a serious pandemic of unprecedented humanitarian crisis, the efforts of courts should be to have active engagement and cooperation of all stakeholders,” the bench noted in its order, as it stayed the contempt proceedings against the Centre. At the same time, the bench clarified that the Delhi high court shall continue to monitor the case before it relating to the supply of oxygen and other essential resources.‘Examine Mumbai model’The court also asked the officials of the Centre and Delhi government to have a meeting on Wednesday evening for a deliberation on supply and distribution of oxygen, besides also examining the “Mumbai model” of optimal utilisation of oxygen.The S-G cited the “Mumbai model”, pointing out that despite having a case load of 92,000 cases as on April 10, Mumbai made do with just 275 MT of oxygen. The city also made arrangements for a buffer storage for imminent requirements. The court said that the Delhi government should consider replicating this model for the national capital.The top court also urged the Centre to revisit its oxygen allocation policy, saying the existing quantum of allocations were chiefly linked to the number of ICU and non-ICU beds in a state but did not consider the requirement of patients who could not get beds in hospitals but required oxygen support. “Your allocation formula is not scientific but based on some generic assumptions,” it said.The bench also noted that the expert committee of the government did not include any eminent doctor associated with private hospitals, adding that it will consider setting up a committee on the next date of hearing for reviewing the formula of oxygen allocation.Raghav Chadha, MLA in-charge of overseeing the oxygen supply in Delhi, said that after the high court’s rebuke, the central government has given a maximum of 555MT oxygen a day to Delhi till date, while the city’s requirement is 976MT. He said that the Centre’s responsibility doesn’t end there and added that it should also provide cryogenic tankers to ensure the transportation of liquid medical oxygen.“The oxygen supplied to us yesterday (Tuesday), only 57% (555MT) of the needed amount of 976 MT, was not done via regular sources, but on ad hoc basis. It was a result of ‘jugad’ done by the Centre. It was not supplied to us via our identified sources... However, it was supplied only after the HC’s reprimand, through ad hoc and temporary means, like for example the trucks which were supposed to go to another state were diverted to the national capital… We really hope that we receive the oxygen with full certainty, and the plants which are designated to supply to us, must do so on a regular basis. It shouldn’t be occasional, wherein whenever the HC denounces the central government, they supply the oxygen to us on that same day or the next day…,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ensure-delhi-gets-700-mt-o2-every-day-top-court-to-centre-101620248289044.html

Goa’s increasingly grim Covid-19 situation has left the state’s health services on the brink of collapse. The state also recorded 71 deaths over a 24-hour period -- the highest single day death toll since the pandemic began last year. Goa has been grappling with high positivity rates with the positivity rate crossing the 50% mark for the first time on April 29 and it has consistently remained around the 45% mark since then. Goa’s average positivity rate for the week between April 26 and May 2 stood at 48% which was the highest in the country ahead of Haryana which stood at around 37%. Goa Chief Minister Pramod Sawant has said that he expects the positivity rate to come down over the next ten days as the effects of the state ramping up testing are yet to be seen. The Goa government has marginally increased testing from around 2,000 tests they were conducting per day since the first wave began to around 5-6,000 tests per day during the second wave. Long queues continue at testing centres with people having to wait for at least a couple of hours until they can be tested including at testing centres in the capital city. Goa avoided a major tragedy on Tuesday evening when the oxygen supply briefly ran out at a ward of the Goa Medical College and Hospital but was quickly restored after the chief minister’s intervention. On Wednesday, the state commissioned an additional 150 beds that will help some patients who have been lying on stretchers and made to sleep on the floor due to lack of beds.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/goa-grapples-with-country-s-highest-positivity-rate-amid-covid-19-spike-101620246159687.html

On Wednesday, the state reported 41,953 new cases with a test positivity rate of 25.69%. Though its fatality rate is the lowest in the country (below 0.4%) statistics show it is also climbing steadily in the last one week--58 deaths were reported in the last 24 hours. “We are going through a serious phase of the pandemic. Rising number of cases and TPR shows we have to tighten curbs further. We have asked private hospitals to strictly follow the health ministry’s admission norms,” said the CM addressing the media virtually. He said he sent a letter to Prime Minister Modi seeking more help to tide over the crisis. The chief minister said hostels, lodges and empty offices will be converted as first line treatment centres to meet the surge of patients. To avoid overcrowding of hospitals, he said, admission norms were being tweaked and only cases that need urgent medical care will be admitted. He also sought the help of NRIs-- the state has about 25 lakh people working abroad and 70 per cent of them are in West Asian countries. In his letter to the PM, Vijayan said medical oxygen storage in the state should be augmented urgently as there is an increased demand for life-saving medical gas. “To augment storage we need 1000 tonnes of imported liquid medical oxygen. The Ministry of External Affairs may be advised to allot required quantity partly from the current tranche of imports and balance from future imports,” he said. He also asked the PM to provide more oxygen concentrators, ventilators and other equipment on priority basis considering the high volume of cases. This is the first time the state has appealed to the Centre frantically. Kerala has so far vaccinated 74 lakh people, almost 20 per cent of its 3.25 crore population. The Union Health Ministry and PM had recently lauded its zero wastage of vaccines while in some states it is between 5 and 18 per cent. The CM has also requested the PM to send more vaccines--- 50 lakh doses of Covishield and 25 lakh Covaxin doses. Currently the state has a stock of 272.2 metric tonnes of liquid oxygen and it needs 108 mt of oxygen daily, health ministry statistics show. The government has also decided to deploy trainee doctors and nursing students to meet the shortage of medical staff and set up oxygen plants on war-footing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/keralas-daily-covid-19-cases-close-to-42-000-cm-pinarayi-vijayan-writes-to-centre-101620244959243.html

The positivity rate in the state also reached a new high as it jumped to 32.28%.The surge in cases took the state’s active case count closer to the 500,000 mark at 487,288 of which Bengaluru accounts for 313,314.There were 346 fatalities reported in 24 hours, including 161 in Bengaluru. Only three districts--Kodagu,Koppala and Yadgir-- out of the 30 districts in Karnataka did not report any fatalities on Wednesday.Karnataka chief minister BS Yediyurappa has imposed lockdown-like restrictions across the state as a last ditch effort to contain the surge in the state.“We are waiting for directions (from Prime Minsiter Narendra Modi),” Karnataka chief minister BS Yediyurappa said on Wednesday.The second wave in Karnataka is said to have begun around the first week of March when the state started to see a sharp spike. Bengaluru, which is one of the worst impacted regions in the country, bore the brunt of the second wave as the number of infections jumped from 6,813 in February to 31,886 in March to 338,360 in April. In the first five days of May, India’s IT capital has recorded nearly 88,000 new infections, according to data from the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP).The situation in other districts have also turned dire, going by government data. Experts have indicated that the next wave of infections may be seen in the other 29 districts of Karnataka, where medical infrastructure is far more inadequate than Bengaluru.There were 1,009 new infections in Chikamagaluru, 1,529 in Dakshina Kannada, 1030 in Dharwada, 1604 in Hassan, 1097 in Kalaburagi, 1115 in Kolar, 1621 in Mandya, 2790 in Mysuru, 2335 in Tumakuru and 1655 in Udupi district, according to the health bulletin.Chitradurga with 152 infections was the lowest in the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ktaka-breaches-50k-mark-in-daily-covid-cases-101620242080855.html
06-05-2021||India||‘I did not control O2’: DC rejects allegations in Chamarajanagar deaths||Bengaluru Mysuru deputy commissioner Rohini Sindhuri on Wednesday refuted allegations that she rationed or controlled oxygen supplies to Chamarajanagar district where 24 Covid-19 patients at a government hospital died reportedly due to shortage of the life-saving gas earlier this week. Meanwhile, the Karnataka government appointed retired high court judge Justice B A Patil as the one-man commission to inquire into the death of the patients and sought a report within one month.The government also named a senior IAS officer to probe the incident and submit a report within three days.In a press note, Sindhuri said: “I categorically state that as Deputy Commissioner, Mysuru, I did not ration or control oxygen supplies to Chamarajanagar or any other district.” “It is the responsibility of the district to manage their own oxygen supplies,” she added. The deputy commissioner’s clarification came days after the Chamarajanagar administration alleged that Sindhuri had delayed the dispatch of oxygen as she retained most of it for use in her own district, which is one of the worst Covid-19 hit regions outside Bengaluru. Chamarajanagar deputy commissioner M R Ravi said that Sindhuri’s claims that the district had over 250 cyclinders of oxygen was false. He added that he had brought the matter to the attention of the chief secretary, district in-charge minister and the nodal officer but in vain.In her letter, Sindhuri said the supply of oxygen was a transaction solely between district authorities and suppliers or refillers and no other administration could intervene in this process. “If any supplier does not supply or the district needs are not met, the supervision and correction is (taken up) by the state level officers. The Chamarajanagar deputy commissioner should have coordinated with these state level officers and got his supplies. He failed to do that and is now blaming the Mysuru deputy commissioner,” Sindhuri alleged. “As a matter of fact, Mysuru district, upon emergency request from Chamarajanagar, took out 40 oxygen cylinders out of its own district hospital on the night of 1st May and sent them to Chamarajanagar. All these facts will be proved in the enquiry that is already ordered by the state government,” she added. The Chamarajanagar DC could not be reached for comment. The deaths on Monday also led to a slugfest between the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the opposition in the state.“24 deaths on Monday. 9 on Tuesday due to oxygen shortage. Instead of demanding more oxygen from the Centre, creating more ICU beds & saving lives, BJP is diverting attention from their failures that are causing deaths & distress. Your Govt. Fix the scam. People don’t want drama,” Krishna Byre Gowda, former minister and Congress legislator from Bengaluru, posted on Twitter.On Tuesday, the Centre had informed the Karnataka high court that the Union government had increased the state’s quota of the gas from 802 to 865 metric tonnes. The state requires at least 1,467 metric tonnes of oxygen amid a massive spike in the number of persons requiring oxygenated beds.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/i-did-not-control-o2-dc-rejects-allegations-in-chamarajanagar-deaths-101620242018261.html
06-05-2021||India||Apex Court’s ruling brings Jat quota demand under focus||The Supreme Court’s decision to scrap a quota for Marathas on Wednesday has brought under focus similar agitations for reservation by other dominant communities.In Haryana, where a law granting 10% quota for Jats is being held in abeyance, leaders of the agitation said they will call a mega meeting of major communities to decide the next course of action.According to All India Jat Aarakshan Sangharsh Samiti (AIJASS) chief Yashpal Malik, the apex court verdict was on expected lines. He said now a political consensus is required.“We will call a meeting of representatives of Jat, Maratha, Patel and other communities whose reservation has been stuck down,” said All India Jat Aarakshan Sangharsh Samiti chief Yashpal Malik, who was leading the agitation for Jat reservation. “If this reservation is not valid as per the constitution, as the judgment says, then the people who have provided reservation beyond this limit should be punished...,” he added.He said the governments have fooled people by giving them reservation without following norms. Endorsing his views, Hawa Singh Sangwan, Haryana unit head of the Akhil Bharatiya Jat Aarakshan Sangharsh Samiti, sought a political consensus.Violence broke out in Haryana on February 2016 over demands for a separate jat quota or including the community in the other backward class category. Later, the state government enacted a law to provide 10% reservation in government jobs and educational institutions to Jats and the five other castes.In September 2017, the Punjab and Haryana high court ordered this law be kept in abeyance till the Haryana Backward Classes Commission, determines extent and quantum of quota in jobs and educational institutions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/apex-court-s-ruling-brings-jat-quota-demand-under-focus-101620241958555.html
06-05-2021||India||Raise state’s O2 allocation: HC to Centre as cases surge||Bengaluru: Karnataka high court on Wednesday directed the Centre to increase the allocation of oxygen for the state to 1,201 metric tonnes for the next four days amid rising demand and reports of shortage in the state. The bench of Chief Justice Abhay Oka and Justice Aravind Kumar asked the state government to submit a projected estimate of oxygen required for the next week. “The state estimation is 1,162 metric tonnes of oxygen as of April 29 and 1,792 metric tonnes as of May 4. Therefore, there is justification if more than 1,792 metric tonnes sought by the state,” the bench observed. The order comes two days after 24 Covid-19 patients died in two hospitals in Chamarajanagar district allegedly due to shortage of oxygen. More than 20 hospitals in Bengaluru have sent out emergency messages after they ran out of oxygen. Karnataka and its capital Bengaluru have been experiencing an exponential rise in the number of Covid-19 cases in the recent weeks amid a surging second wave of the pandemic. The state reported 44,631 new cases on Wednesday, taking the active caseload to 464,363. Bengaluru accounted for 20,870 new infections, taking its active cases to 301,712. As many as 292 fatalities were reported across the state on Wednesday, which took the state’s toll to 16,538. Bengaluru’s death toll due to Covid-19 jumped to 6,845, with 132 deaths being reported on Wednesday, according to state health department.Meanwhile, the Karnataka government on Wednesday appointed retired high court judge Justice B A Patil as the one-man commission to inquire into the death of 24 Covid-19 patients in Chamarajanagar district allegedly owing to oxygen shortage. A notification regarding the appointment of Justice Patil was issued by the additional chief secretary in the home department, Rajneesh Goel on Wednesday. The term of reference of the commission read, “To inquire into the circumstances and events leading to the death of COVID-19 patients in District Hospital, Chamarajanagar on May 3, reportedly due to scarcity of oxygen and any further similar incidents, which are entrusted to the Commission of Inquiry by Government.” The office of the commission has to submit its report in one month. Advocate General Prabhuling K Navadgi told the court, “…Yesterday, the cabinet took cognizance of your lordship’s order, which prima facie indicated that Judicial Inquiry is necessary. They have passed an order for constituting a Commission of Inquiry with a request to the Honourable Judge to complete the inquiry within a period of one month, the outer limit.” However, the bench took serious exception to the decision of the state government to set up a commission of inquiry and appointing a retired judge to probe the deaths without taking its prior approval. “Intention of the government is very clear from the manner in which the whole thing is being done... It is a peremptory order...we are not against your appointing a particular judge, but you should have left it to the court...In all fairness you should have left it to the court to appoint a retired judge to conduct inquiry...,” observed a special division bench comprising Chief Justice Abhay Shreeniwas Oka and Justice Aravind Kumar. Expressing displeasure over the approach of the state government, the HC directed state’s chief secretary to seize all records and documents related to oxygen supply from the offices of deputy commissioners of Chamarajanagar and Mysuru districts, and Chamarajanagar district hospital. The bench said the chief secretary should immediately seize all the documents and keep them in his safe custody till further orders. After passing the order, the bench told the AG: “You can either consider modifying the order or else we will tell you what we propose to do. The Committee appointed by the Karnataka State Legal Services Authority is headed by a retired judge and we propose to forward the records to him and ask him to inquire into the matter.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/raise-state-s-o2-allocation-hc-to-centre-as-cases-surge-101620241900167.html
06-05-2021||India||13 die in TN govt hospital, officials deny oxygen shortage||Chennai: Thirteen people died on Tuesday late night and wee hours on Wednesday at the Chengalpattu government medical college hospital adjoining Chennai district. Authorities said one of them was Covid-19 positive and denied allegations of oxygen shortage. A probe is underway to find the cause of their death. Post graduate doctors of the hospital staged a protest on Wednesday demanding more oxygen, workforce and against healthcare workers being diverted from their hospital. Videos recorded from the hospital on the wee hours of Wednesday shows attendants of patients wailing. A woman inside the ward was seen shouting and crying saying that her husband has passed away even as a container named INOX Air Products entered the hospital premises at night. Chengalpattu district collector A John Louis, who reviewed the situation on Tuesday night, denied reports that the deaths were due to oxygen shortage. “Oxygen supply was maintained and I was present there at that time,” Louis said. “One of them is positive, the rest tested Covid-19 negative. The Director of Medical Education is inquiring,” he told reporters earlier in the day. “I was there at the field the whole night monitoring the situation. Oxygen supply (for the patients) was not interrupted. Seven of those (13) patients got admitted yesterday,” he said, adding that the hospital has a capacity of 23,000 litres of oxygen out of which 2,900 litres is consumed per day. The hospital dean Dr J Muthukumaran said that the patients had viral Pneumonia and some of them who had tested positive, recovered, but still had respiratory issues. “They died due to age, comorbidities and the condition of the diseases despite receiving treatment and not because of oxygen shortage,” said Muthukumaran. “At the stage of admission most of them had oxygen saturation below 80 with 50-60% lung involvement which is critical,” he said. According to the dean, 10 of the 13 patients were on oxygen support and there was a drop in the oxygen pressure but that was still not the cause. “The same low pressure oxygen was being given to other patients including serious Covid-19 patients and at the neonatal ICU. The new born babies with respiratory problems are more vulnerable than adults with Covid-19. But there were no deaths anywhere else. We had oxygen of 10,000 kilo liters in our tank.As the oxygen was going down there was a drop in the pressure; so the drive of the oxygen was less. For this we connected 180 cylinders as a substitute until the lorry carrying liquid oxygen container came in and filled up to 7000 kilo liters. During this four-five hours oxygen was available in the tank and pipeline,” he said.When asked about his hospital’s doctors protesting for more oxygen, the dean said that they had witnessed a drop in oxygen pressure the previous week. “There was no death then too but it was a panicky situation. Since it happened again, the doctors protested because they are worried that relatives of patients will take it out on them as they are the ones who are directly treating them.” He added that the DME, Narayana Babu has assured 100 more health staff for the hospital.A total of 447 patients is undergoing treatment in the hospital out of which 256 are Covid-19 patients while 191 were suspected to be infected with the virus. On Tuesday, 325 patients were on oxygen support. “We are taking steps to provide an additional 72 oxygen points,” he told reporters. “Since last night, oxygen was very low. At least 10-12 deaths have occurred but authorities are saying only one death due to Covid-19,” Nirmal, a protesting doctor, told Tamil channel Thanthi TV. There was oxygen scarcity for the past one week in the hospital, including for about 3 hours on Tuesday night, because of which the deaths occurred, said another doctor. Chengalpattu which is adjoining Chennai has the second highest caseload in Tamil Nadu. On May 4, Chengalpattu reported 1,608 new cases taking its active cases tally to 9,663.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/13-die-in-tn-govt-hospital-officials-deny-oxygen-shortage-101620241838114.html
06-05-2021||India||Oxygen equipment, critical medicines focus of India’s efforts to obtain foreign support||Oxygen-related equipment, especially large plants that can meet the oxygen needs of hospitals, and medicines such as Remdesivir continue to be the focus of India’s efforts to obtain support for its response to the deadly second wave of Coronavirus infections. Medium to large oxygen generation plants that can make hospitals autonomous and help address the severe shortage of oxygen at healthcare facilities in several cities will remain crucial even as the government transports oxygen to areas where it is needed most, including through the cryogenic tankers coming in from abroad. Portable oxygen generators, ventilators and cylinders, all of which have been supplied in large numbers by several countries, have their uses but there is a need for more large oxygen generation plants despite the difficulties associated with their transportation, installation and operationalisation, people familiar with developments said on condition of anonymity on Wednesday. So far, Italy has supplied one such plant and France eight more. One large plant is coming in from Germany and the US and the UK have pledged several more. Some of the French plants have already been installed at hospitals in New Delhi and have become operational. While critical medicines such as Remdesivir, Tocilizumab and Favipiravir are being sourced from abroad, efforts are also on to expand their production in the country though this process is being hampered by lack of adequate raw materials, the people said. Pharmaceutical giant Gilead has pledged 450,000 doses of Remdesivir and some 150,000 doses arrived on Wednesday; while efforts are still on to acquire about 400,000 doses from Egypt, the people said. Meanwhile, support for India’s Covid-19 response has continued to pour in from around the world. On Wednesday, Israel airlifted the first consignment of oxygen generators and concentrators to India to conveying a message of solidarity. More flights will come in from Israel this week, carrying thousands of group and individual oxygen generators, respirators, medications and additional equipment. Israeli ambassador Ron Malka said, “In this hour of need, our two democracies stand solidly side by side. The state of Israel is happy to lend a helping hand to our friend India in this complicated and difficult time.” The European Union (EU) announced on Wednesday it will allocate an initial 2.2 million euros in emergency funding to respond to the drastic surge in infections in India. This funding will support the World Health Organization (WHO) for a six-month case management of Covid-19 patients and strengthen laboratory capacity for testing. The Central government said in a statement that between April 27 and May 4, India had received 1,764 oxygen concentrators, 1,760 oxygen cylinders, 450 ventilators, more than 135,000 Remdesivir vials, and 120,000 Favipiravir strips. “All items received up to 4th May, 2021 are allocated to the states/institutions and substantial part of it stands delivered. This is an ongoing exercise,” the statement said, without giving details of the state-wise allocations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/oxygen-equipment-critical-medicines-focus-of-india-s-efforts-to-obtain-foreign-support-101620241658675.html
06-05-2021||India||NTK gains ground in TN, 3rd in vote share||Chennai: With the two Dravidian majors, DMK and AIADMK, re-sealing their positions in the recently concluded assembly elections, the smaller parties that hoped to be an alternative or form a third front didn’t win any seat but have split the votes. Among them, Tamil nationalist S Seeman’s Naam Tamizhar Katchi (NTK) emerged from a fringe outfit to being recognised as a contender. NTK came third with 6.7% vote share —below the DMK and AIADMK. The party had only 1% vote share in the 2016 assembly elections. Many of its candidates also finished third in constituencies. The party has been growing steadily having polled 4% of votes in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections. While most of the attention was on how the AIADMK’s rebel faction, Amma Makkal Munnetra Kazhazgam (AMMK) led by TTV Dhinakaran, and actor Kamal Haasan’s Makkal Needhi Maiam (MNM) would perform, the Seeman-led party out performed them. AMMK and MNM polled 2.47% and 2.45% votes. Seeman has captured the voters with his fist-thumping oratory and switching from classical Tamil to colloquial expletives. Interviews from voters in the north, west and south regions indicated that they liked his ethno-nationalistic speeches peppered with emotions that bashed the status quo. Some, fed up with the Dravidian parties that have successively ruled Tamil Nadu, felt Seeman could be given a chance as an alternative. In part, these are the voters who had previously backed parties like Desiya Murpokku Dravida Kazhagam (DMDK) founded by actor-turned-politician Vijayakanth in 2005. DMDK was promising in its early days, and Vijayakanth even became the leader of the opposition when J Jayalalithaa was chief minister in 2011, but the party has got only 0.45% votes this time. Vaiko too after leaving the DMK developed his Marumalarchi Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (MDMK) on a fervent Tamil pitch but dwindled and is back as an ally in the DMK fold, while Seeman has captured this space. Seeman started his party with a goal of an independent statehood for Lankan Tamils, a year after the LTTE was defeated in the Sri Lankan war in 2009. A passionate and polarising orator, Seeman has refused to tie up with any party because he fights on the plank of anti-corruption besides Tamil rights. He has dismissed Dravidian parties, espoused a militant Tamil majoritarian and linguistic pride. His position has been that a Tamil should rule Tamil Nadu. Political observers predicted that while Dhinakaran will eat into AIADMK’s voter base and Haasan will draw in the urban crowd, Seeman would gain from rural areas. “We have broken such projections in this election,” said Packiarajan Sethuramalingam, NTK’s spokesperson. “The perception is that the elite won’t vote for us, but we have polled more than 290,000 votes in Chennai and more than 100,000 each in Coimbatore, Trichy and Madurai.” Haasan’s MNM however came third in 12 of the 16 assembly constituencies in Chennai. The NTK wants its base to grow across Tamil Nadu and not be confined to a region or caste. “Dravidian parties have their presence across the state. Similarly, as an alternative our strategy to gradually build our presence is working,” Sethuramalingam said. Seeman’s rise is also discomforting to political analysts. “The emergence of Seeman as a third player is a matter of concern because they’re more like a cult than a political party,” says political commentator Maalan Narayanan. “What he speaks on a platform may be catchy among youngsters but it would not be practical. Like, he says if they come to power he won’t clear the state’s debts created by the previous governments. He still uses language similar to LTTE which may work for military outfit but not in an electoral democracy.” Another reason for NTK’s increase in votes polled is the arithmetic. NTK contested in all 234 constituencies and half the candidates were women. “We were criticised that we can afford to field 117 women because we are a small party but 14-lakh of our votes went to women and 16-lakh to men. That society is accepting these changes is revolutionary for us” said Sethuramalingam. Their only disappointment is not being able to enter the assembly this year. Seeman lost as their chief ministerial candidate from Chennai’s Thiruvottiyor constituency. Like in previous elections, NTK didn’t forge an alliance with anyone. This consistent conscious decision has worked in favour of the party’s image. The other fledgling parties didn’t go it alone and didn’t have much choice left, as several regional and the two national parties, Congress and BJP, were in the DMK and AIADMK alliances; AMMK, abandoned by VK Sasikala, contested in 161 seats, took in a wounded DMDK -- now led by Vijayakanth’s family due to his health issues. DMDK walked out of the AIADMK unhappy with the seats allotted and Dhinakaran gave away 60 seats to them and the remaining to SDPI, All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM) and others. MNM contested in 135 seats and offered the remaining seats to little known parties who had walked out of the AIADMK and DMK alliances -- Indhiya Jananayaga Katchi (IJK) -- 40 and All India Samathuva Makkal Katchi (AISMK) -- 37.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ntk-gains-ground-in-tn-3rd-in-vote-share-101620241538093.html
06-05-2021||India||Vijayan writes to Modi, seeks 1,000 tonnes of oxygen amid surge||Thiruvananthapuram: As Covid-19 cases continue to surge and almost all hospitals packed to the brim, Kerala chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan on Wednesday said he has written to Prime Minister Modi seeking more liquid medical oxygen and vaccines for the state. “We are going through a serious phase of the pandemic. Rising number of cases and TPR shows we have to tighten curbs further. We have asked private hospitals to strictly follow the health ministry’s admission norms,” the CM said, in a virtual address to reporters. He added that he sent a letter to the prime minister on Wednesday seeking more help to tide over the crisis. In terms of total cases, Kerala ranks third in the country, only behind Maharashtra and Karnataka. The state reported 41,953 new Covid-19 cases on Wednesday, taking the active caseload to 375,658. The test positivity rate in the state was 25.69. Though the fatality rate in Kerala is lowest in the country (below 0.4), statistics show it is also climbing up steadily in the last one week. As many as 58 deaths were reported in 24 hours, taking the toll in the state to 5,565, according to the state health department. Vijayan said hostels, lodges and empty offices will be converted into first line treatment centres to meet surge of patients. To avoid overcrowding of hospitals, he said, admission norms were tweaked and only cases that need urgent medical care would be admitted. He also sought the help of non-resident Indians (NRIs) -- the state has about 25 lakh people working abroad and 70% of them are in West Asian countries – in the state’s fight against the pandemic. In his letter to the PM, Vijayan said medical oxygen storage in the state should be augmented urgently as there was an increased demand for life-saving medical gas. “To augment storage, we need 1,000 tonnes of imported liquid medical oxygen. The Ministry of External Affairs may be advised to allot required quantity partly from the current tranche of imports and balance from future imports,” he said. The chief minister also asked the PM to provide more oxygen concentrators, ventilators and other equipment on priority basis considering high volume of cases. This is the first time the state was knocking at the Centre’s doors frantically, experts said. The state has, so far, vaccinated 7.4 million people, almost 20% of its 32.5-million population. The Union health ministry and PM had recently lauded the state’s zero wastage of vaccine while in some states it was between 5 and 18%. The CM has also requested the PM to send more vaccines – 5 million doses of Covishield and 2.5 million Covaxin doses. Currently, the state has a stock of 272.2 metric tonnes of liquid oxygen, and it needs 108 mt of oxygen daily, as per the health ministry statistics. What really worries the state is that the number of patients who need oxygen is rising alarmingly. In some of the worst-affected districts like Kozhikode and Ernakulam, most of the government hospitals are filled to the capacity, according to state government data. The government has also decided to deploy trainee doctors and nursing students to meet shortage of medical staff and set up oxygen plants on war-footing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/vijayan-writes-to-modi-seeks-1-000-tonnes-of-oxygen-amid-surge-101620241478704.html

Two priests who attended the retreat, Father Bijumon (52) and Rev Shine B Raj (43) died last week after contracting Covid-19. CSI officials declined comment but reformist groups in the church confirmed it.Chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan has termed the incident “unfortunate” and said he has directed district authorities to conduction an investigation. “When situation is grave such an event should not have taken place.”The retreat was held between April 13-17, a period when Kerala was seeing an average cases with the test positivity rate of 20 per cent. It was also held at a time when Covid-19 restrictions were in place. The CSI retreat is the latest religious event to hit the headlines for recklessness during the pandemic. Last year, at the beginning of the first wave, a congregation of the Tablighi Jamaat in New Delhi caused a spike in cases. Last month’s massive congregation for the Kumbh Mela has contributed to an increase in cases in many northern and central Indian states .Reports in local media claim that more than 40 priests are undergoing treatment at the CSI Medical College Hospital in Karakonam. When contacted hospital authorities declined comment. Hectic efforts are on to cover up the incident.“Permission was not sought from district authorities for the event. We are inquiring into the incident . We will take strict action against the resort and organisers of the event,” said Idukki district collector H Dinesh.Church insiders said some young priests questioned the timing of the meet but they were threatened with disciplinary action by church authorities.“The retreat was held without permission. Even if permission was there, more than 50 people are not allowed in the present pandemic situation...,” said Jacob Mathew., a member of the Joint Christian Council, a reformist group.Kerala on Wednesday logged over 41,000 coronavirus cases.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/100-priests-covid-2-die-after-church-event-in-kerala-s-munnar-101620241298089.html
06-05-2021||India||MP Tejasvi Surya’s remarks on Muslim Covid warriors trigger furore||Bengaluru: Bengaluru south MP Tejasvi Surya courted controversy for unfairly targeting members of the Muslim community during his inspection of the Covid-19 war room in south Bengaluru on Tuesday. During the inspection, he read out the names of 17 out of the 205 persons employed at the centre, asking their qualifications. All of them were Muslim names.While there has been outrage against his statements in social media and civil society, lawyers in the city say his actions should result in a police FIR.In a video that has been in circulation since the inspection, Surya, standing along with MLAs Satish Reddy and Ravi Subramanya, is seen reading out the names of the 17 Muslim employees at the centre and demanded the qualifications of these persons.A staffer responded to him saying all of them were hired after applications were invited by the BBMP for agencies. In response, MLA Subramanya is heard asking, “Only these people are sending applications?” He then goes on to add that, “Are you hiring for a corporation or a Madarasa?”Surya then demanded the details of the hiring agency and sought to know the qualification of the 17. The series of communal references was live-streamed on the MLA’s social media handles.No questions were raised about the qualifications of other employees. An officer familiar with the matter said the process is on to replace that outsourcing agency that hired the 17 Muslims.A BBMP official said on condition of anonymity that these 17 people were part of the 205 people employed by the BBMP at the war room. A list of these 205 employees is available with HT.The MP claimed at a press conference that he had uncovered a massive fraud in how the BBMP war-room books beds. Interestingly, the BBMP is controlled by his own party, the BJP. Surya claimed that there was a “bribe for beds” scam, with BBMP officials, third-party agents, and employees hired for the war-room all playing a part -- blocking hospital beds in the names of asymptomatic people (without their knowledge) and releasing them 12 hours later to those willing to pay.When HT contacted Bengaluru police, they said two FITs have been registered in the case, and subsequently transfrred to the Crime Branch, but that none of these 17 men was part of it. Joint Commissioner of Police Sandeep Patil identified the four accused as Rihan, Shashi, Rohit, and Netravati. “As part of the investigation, we have conducted searches in all eight zonal war rooms,” he added.However, soon after the MP’s press conference about his inspection, a WhatsApp message titled “List of terrorists working in BBMP WAR ROOM killing thousands of Bengalurians” began doing rounds in Bengaluru. The message listed 16 of the 17 names mentioned by the Surya in his live stream. HT could not ascertain the origin of the WhatsApp message.Amother WhatsApp message targeted BBMP joint commissioner Sarfaraz Khan and said he “has to be made accountable”. In response, the official said in a Facebook post that he has nothing to do with the war-room, “I’m extremely pained to see WhatsApp messages, where my name is dragged into the mismanagement of the BBMP war room established for the allocation of beds. It was shocking for a simple reason that I have no role in the war room, nor do I know any doctor in the war room. My job is to take care of Covid Care Centres and Solid Waste Management,” he wrote. Khan subsequently filed a complaint with the Bengaluru police, seeking an investigation by the cyber cell to track down those responsible for the message.A legal expert in the city said that Surya’s actions were not only disturbing but should invite legal action. “The communalisation of this incident is deeply disturbing. The MP reads out the names of 17 Muslims there ? What does that imply? Even in the press conference, he mentions the name of a Christian doctor. But the fact is that police have not arrested any of these 17 people or the Christian doctor, instead, they have arrested one Rohit and one Netra. He doesn’t mention those names,” said Vinaya Srinivasa a city-based lawyer.Surya didn’t respond to calls and a WhatsApp message seeking comment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mp-surya-s-remarks-on-muslim-covid-warriors-trigger-furore-101620241238018.html
06-05-2021||India||US to support waiver of IPR on Covid-19 vaccines||The Biden administration Wednesday announced the United States will support the temporary waiver of intellectual property rights to Covid-19 vaccines as proposed by India and South Africa at the WTO and said it will “actively participate” in negotiation to “make that happen”.“The Administration believes strongly in intellectual property protections, but in service of ending this pandemic, supports the waiver of those protections for COVID-19 vaccines,” US trade representative Katherine Tai said, adding, “We will actively participate in text-based negotiations at the World Trade Organization (WTO) needed to make that happen.”It’s a limited waiver that the US is supporting, according to people familiar with these matters, as it covers only vaccines and not therapeutics and related technologies as proposed by India and South Africa. And given the consensus-based approach of the WTO, getting it done will not happen overnight.The Biden administration has been under mounting pressure from members of the Democratic party and rights groups at home and the growing number of WTO member nations to reverse US opposition to the waiver proposal ordered by former President Donald Trump who was in office when India and South Africa had moved their joint proposal last October.“The Administration’s aim is to get as many safe and effective vaccines to as many people as fast as possible,” Tai said. “As our vaccine supply for the American people is secured, the Administration will continue to ramp up its efforts – working with the private sector and all possible partners – to expand vaccine manufacturing and distribution.”.India and South Africa moved the proposal before the WTO last October calling for temporarily waive of the agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) to ensure easy and affordable access globally, and specially to developing countries, to Covid-19 vaccines, therapeutics and related technologies till the pandemic had been curbed.It secured the support of more than 100 members nations, but was being opposed by the United States, the United Kingdom and some other countries, essentially developed countries who have secured sufficient numbers of vaccines, therapeutics and raw materials for their own needs, pre-ordering most of it.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/us-announces-support-for-india-south-africa-waiver-proposal-at-wto-101620241178100.html
06-05-2021||India||Centre granted 'blanket exemption' from customs for donations sent from abroad as Covid relief||Centre granted blanket exemption from customs and Integrated Goods and Services Tax (IGST) for all items sent as donations from abroad as Covid relief material, according to an internal Standard Operating Procedure note on for ‘receiving Donations/gifts from abroad,’ reviewed by HT.“Indian Red Cross Society (IRCS) will be consignee and Hindustan Latex Limited (HLL) will provide logistic support Procedure….Such offers will be given blanket exemptions from Customs, IGST and other mandatory clearances,” the SOP states. The SOP has been sent to the coordinating officers from the Niti Aayog, external affairs ministry, ministry of civil aviation and the ministry of health.However, as explained in PIB’s statement on Tuesday, the goods will still need to be cleared by the customs department.“The Indian Customs is sensitive to the need for availability of COVID related imports including Oxygen & Oxygen related equipment etc., and are working 24 x 7 to fast track and clear the goods on arrival and lead to expeditious clearance within hours,” the PIB statement said. It added Indian customs has waived ‘Basic Customs Duty’ and ‘Health cess’ on goods identified for defending Covid, and, conditionally, IGST.As questions continued to swirl on Tuesday regarding allocation of oxygen-related equipment and supplies provided by other countries to back India’s Covid-19 response, the government said medical infrastructure of 38 institutions across 31 states, stretched thin because of an unprecedented surge in Coronavirus infections, was strengthened using supplies from around the world. The supplies have either reached the state or are on their way, it added.For donations related to private individuals, companies and NGO’s the SOP said the missions will need to inform the Niti Aayog and the external affairs and health ministries.The Centre has made apex government think-tank Niti Aayog the nodal body for coordinating such offers. Niti Aayog will coordinate with the IRCS and HLL for its distribution.“Missions will vet such offers, including verification of antecedents of donors before forwarding proposals,” it said. “Donations meant for private use will also be coordinated by Niti Aayog Such consignments will be cleared by an agency designated by Nit Aayog and its distribution will be under the direction of Niti Aayog, which will keep MEA informed,” it added.It also said missions will share with foreign governments list of priority items prepared by the health ministry for their consideration. “Offer of PPE kits, RT-PCR tests kits masks etc as well as refurbished items may politely be declined stating that these are available in sufficient numbers domestically,” the SOP said.“Missions may convey diplomatically that offers of humanitarian aid made by foreign governments Private individuals/ Indian associations/ companies/ NGOs to Government of India should be of a minimum threshold for effective use and expeditious clearance on arrival,” the SOP said.“Missions on receipt of information on offer(s) of donations/ gifts from foreign governments will forward them to Ministry of External Affairs ( MEA) MEA will compile offers and forward them to the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MoHFW) with specifications and other details. The proposals will be discussed in the inter-ministerial consultation group for its consent and approval.It also said missions should also provide information on technical teams who will travel for the purpose for installation, training of personnel and maintenance. “Alternatively Missions may identify foreign manufacturers for their technical teams in India for the purpose The expert will both under the guidance of MoHFW which will also facilitate their stay in India,” it noted.PIB’s statement indicated that the SOP for distributing foreign aid materials was framed by the Union health ministry on May 2. Supplies procured from abroad under commercial contracts began entering the country on April 25 and aid from other countries started arriving from April 27.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-grants-customs-igst-exemption-on-donations-from-abroad-101620241122622.html
06-05-2021||India||G7 delegation in isolation in UK after Covid scare||The Indian delegation, led by external affairs minister S Jaishankar, to the G7 foreign ministers meeting in London was self-isolating on Wednesday after two members tested positive for Covid-19, triggering a scare at the event.Jaishankar tweeted he became aware of “exposure to possible Covid positive cases” and would conduct all his engagements in London virtually, including participation in the G7 meet on Wednesday.Public Health England, which deals with issues such as infectious diseases, asked the Indian delegation to self-isolate, according to BBC. A British official confirmed two positive tests among the delegation. British rules require a 10-day self-isolation period.“Was made aware yesterday evening of exposure to possible Covid positive cases. As a measure of abundant caution and also out of consideration for others, I decided to conduct my engagements in the virtual mode. That will be the case with the G7 Meeting today as well,” said a tweet by Jaishankar, who is on his first foreign trip after India was hit by a devastating second wave of infections. Jaishankar subsequently tweeted an image of himself holding a virtual meeting with his Canadian counterpart Marc Garneau.The report of the delegates testing positive immediately triggered Covid-19 worries at the G7 meeting. There were also questions as to whether members of other delegations had been exposed in any manner.People familiar with developments said on condition of anonymity that all members of the Indian delegation in London had tested negative on Sunday. The Indian side is working with UK health authorities to ascertain the level of exposure and what needs to be done regarding the delegation’s travel plans, the people said.British high commissioner Alex Ellis in New Delhi said that UK authorities have protocols in place for the G7 meeting which will determine how such an incident is handled.While participating in a live virtual event with the theme “Does India have a plan? From survival to revival”, Jaishankar described the second wave of infections as an “all consuming” challenge and admitted that India’s health system “stands exposed”. Asked if the government took its eye off the ball with regard to the pandemic, he said: “There were repeated advisories going out and public health teams sent out. There was a move to ramp up oxygen production. The reality unfortunately was, as the numbers came down there was an amount of public confidence. This is genuinely not a blame game, but I don’t think anyone can say we kept our guard up all the time.”Jaishankar added, “With the benefit of hindsight, it is easy to say we shouldn’t have allowed gatherings of any kind. ..We are a deeply democratic and political country and in a democracy, you can’t not have elections. Elections are sacrosanct.”The elections in four states and a UT through the month of April, saw several leaders address large gatherings, where there was almost no compliance with Covid-safety protocols. April also saw a large religious gathering, the MahaKumbh, which attracted millions of pilgrims to Uttarakhand.India is not a member of the G7 and was invited to the meeting as a guest along with Australia, South Korea, South Africa and the chair of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations.Jaishankar met British interior minister Priti Patel on Tuesday. Patel didn’t have to self-isolate because the meeting was held in line with existing rules.Jaishankar held bilateral meetings in London with US secretary of state Antony Blinken, South African foreign minister Naledi Pandor, and European Union foreign policy chief Josep Borrell, and a trilateral meeting with Australian foreign minister Marise Payne and French foreign minister Jean-Yves Le Drian.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-worries-at-g7-meeting-after-two-indian-delegates-test-positive-101620241121421.html
06-05-2021||India||States scamper to meet rising oxygen demand as cases surge||Even as two incidents of Covid patients dying because of an alleged disruption in oxygen supply in hospitals were reported on Wednesday, several states across India continued their efforts to ramp up oxygen supply to meet the increase in demand due to rising Covid infections.On Tuesday night, 13 people died at the Chengalpattu government medical college hospital, allegedly due to oxygen shortage. In a private hospital in Roorkee, five Covid-19 positive patients died, again, allegedly due to non-availability of oxygen on Wednesday morning.So far, about 80 persons have died in hospitals across the country, all allegedly due to a shortage of oxygen or disruption in its supply. The Delhi government on Monday, controversially told the Delhi High Court that the death of 21 patients at the Jaipur Golden Hospital was not because of lack of oxygen but “respiratory failure”.On Wednesday, Kerala chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan and West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi asking for additional supply of oxygen as number of Covid cases in the two states, where elections concluded on May 2, is on the rise.All supplies of medical oxygen are channelised by the Centre.Kerala has the third highest number of active cases in the country, after Maharashtra and Karnataka.The number of active cases in the state has increased from 6,500 on February 27 when assembly elections were announced to 41,953 on Tuesday. For West Bengal, the corresponding numbers are 400 and 18,102.In his letter to the PM, Vijayan said to augment storage the state need 1000 tonne of imported liquid medical oxygen.“The Ministry of External Affairs may be advised to allot the required quantity partly from the current tranche of imports and balance from future imports,” he said. The CM also asked for more oxygen concentrators, ventilators and other equipment on priority basis considering high volume of cases. He also sought 7.5 million more doses of Covid vaccine to increase vaccination coverage; Kerala has so far administered 9 million doses of the vaccine to 9.1 million people(1.1 million have received two doses and 8 million, one).In her letter to the PM, West Bengal chief minister Banerjee asked for additional allocation of least 500 MT of medical oxygen per day out of the total oxygen produced in Bengal to prevent any shortage. “There have been no deaths in any of the hospitals in West Bengal for oxygen so far. Till now we have not faced any shortage. But our oxygen demand has shot up from around 220 MT to around 400MT.It is expected to rise further as cases are rising,” said a senior state government official who asked not to be named.The Rajasthan government has also sought an additional 200 MT of oxygen daily from the Centre to meet any shortfall that may arise due to rising cases. The state’s health minister Raghu Sharma said he estimates demand for oxygen may rise to 950 MT by May 12.“We are getting 230 MT less oxygen than the current requirement,” he said, asking the Centre to provide oxygen to Rajasthan from nearby sources so that oxygen can be easily transported.He said the state needs 26 tankers to transport 370 MT of oxygen, which will be enough to meet the current demand. Rajasthan has 35,000 active cases.The Punjab cabinet on Wednesday decided to ask the Centre for additional supply of oxygen. Punjab’s daily quota is 195 MT but its demand has risen to close to 220 MT, officials said. In Haryana, the officials said, there was no shortage of oxygen.In Madhya Pradesh, in cities such as Bhopal, Indore, Jabalpur, Ujjain and Gwalior, private hospitals are admitting only those patients who can arrange for oxygen cylinders. The state is facing oxygen shortage as it does not have enough tankers to transport the oxygen to hospitals.“We have placed an order of eight cryogenic tankers to a Thailand based company to improve transportation of the gas,” said Vishwas Sarang, minister of medical education.Several hospitals across Karnataka, including Bengaluru have reported shortages in oxygen with at least 10 sending SOS messages.“They say that government has been promising to fix the issues but so far only providing “stop-gap” arrangements with supplies to last a few hours,” said a government official who asked not to be named.The officials said oxygen shortages have been reported from Mandya, Kalaburagi and Bengaluru Rural District .||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/states-scamper-to-meet-rising-oxygen-demand-as-cases-surge-101620241059309.html
06-05-2021||India||Apex court’s ruling brings Jat quota demand under focus||Chandigarh The Supreme Court’s decision to scrap a quota for Marathas on Wednesday has brought under focus similar agitations for reservation by other dominant communities. In Haryana, where a law granting 10% quota for Jats is being held in abeyance, leaders of the agitation said they will call a mega meeting of major communities to decide the next course of action. According to All India Jat Aarakshan Sangharsh Samiti (AIJASS) chief Yashpal Malik, the Apex Court verdict was on expected lines. He said now a political consensus is required. “We will call a meeting of representatives of Jat, Maratha, Patel and other communities whose reservation has been stuck down by the top court,” said All India Jat Aarakshan Sangharsh Samiti (AIJASS) chief Yashpal Malik, who was leading the agitation for Jat reservation. “If this reservation is not valid as per the constitution, as the judgment says, then the people who have provided reservation beyond this limit should be punished for passing such misleading laws for their political gains,” he added. He said the governments had intentionally fooled people by giving them reservation without following norms. Endorsing his views, Hawa Singh Sangwan, Haryana unit president of the Akhil Bharatiya Jat Aarakshan Sangharsh Samiti (ABJASS), called for a political consensus. Violence broke out in Haryana on February 2016 over demands for a separate jat quota or including the community in the other backward class category. Soon after the violence subsided, the state government enacted a law to provide 10% reservation in government jobs and educational institutions to Jats and the five other castes. The community constitutes a quarter of the state’s population. The quota law hit a legal hurdle in September 2017 when the Punjab and Haryana high court ordered this law be kept in abeyance till the Haryana Backward Classes Commission (HBCC), determines the extent and quantum of reservation in jobs and educational institutions. The commission was asked to submit its report by March 31, 2018. However, it could not do so due to status quo being ordered by the Supreme Court.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/apex-court-s-ruling-brings-jat-quota-demand-under-focus-101620240938626.html
06-05-2021||India||Third wave of Covid inevitable, says government||India has detected a total of 3,532 Sars-CoV-2 variants of concern in 27 states, the government announced on Wednesday, adding that a third wave of Covid-19 was inevitable looking at the current surge in infections.Researchers have found that the circulation of the UK variant (B.1.1.7) that is known to be 50% more transmissible is on a decline in India, and the double mutant variant (B.1.6.1.7) is on the rise, said senior scientists.“A phase three is inevitable, given the high levels of circulating virus, but it is not clear on what time scale this phase 3 will occur. Hopefully, incrementally, but we should prepare for new waves. Previous infections and vaccines will cause adaptive pressure on the virus for new kinds of changes which try to escape, and, therefore, we should be prepared, scientifically to take care of that,” said K Vijay Raghavan, principal scientific advisor, to the government of India.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageThose mutations are a variant of concern for which there is evidence of an increase in transmissibility, more severe disease etc.He also said that scientists were currently making a map in the laboratory of all possible changes that could happen to the virus and see how these changes could affect immune and vaccine evasion.Many factors contributed to this second wave and variants are one of the factors, Vijay Raghavan said.The first wave peaked in September last year and declined because of two factors, he said. “As infections rose, so did immunity among those infected. A combination of the standing level of immunity in the population and cautionary steps halted the spread of the first wave,” he said.But as the cautionary steps declined, new opportunities for infection arose and the level of immunity among the population is often not enough to stop the infection spread. “Many people get infected until they reach a new immunity threshold. Such a second wave is typically smaller than the first. Such a second wave was expected. However, multiple parameters can change and add up to the second wave, much larger than the first.“(But) Such a larger second wave with the ferocity we are seeing was not predicted,” he said.The consortium of 10 advanced laboratories that is performing genome sequencing of positive samples across the country since December 2020, found that the UK variant (B.1.1.7) of Sars-Cov-2 that was dominating till some time ago, is on a decline in the country, and it is the double mutant variant (B.1.617) that is gradually gaining prominence.Also Read: How different will Covid's 3rd wave be from first two? What government says“We have seen the B.1.1.7 lineage that was quite prevalent in the initial period especially in states such as Maharashtra and later Delhi, is declining in proportion during the last one-and-a-half month. As of today, our B.1.6.1.7 lineage that was initially centred initially around Maharashtra, is now detected in many other states. And in some states, we have established its correlation with the current surge. However, its epidemiological and clinical correlation needs to be established yet,” said Dr SK Singh, director, National Centre for Disease Control, Delhi.Three-four states had shown higher variant load, including Maharashtra, Punjab, Delhi, Andhra Pradesh and Telangana, said Dr Singh in his presentationExperts also said that more than higher transmissibility, it is the clinical correlation that was crucial. “INSACOG [Indian Sars-Cov-2 Genome Sequencing Consortium] data just shows that variants, especially the B.1.617 may have some advantage in the spread, but what that has to do with phase 3 remains to be seen.,” said Dr Gagandeep Kang, professor at Christian Medical College, Vellore. Singh added, “At least 1.3 million mutations have been notified globally so far in Sars-cov-2, and not all mutations are of concern...”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/third-wave-of-covid-inevitable-says-govt-101620240939205.html
06-05-2021||India||States have no power to draw up own lists of backward classes: Supreme Court||The Supreme Court on Wednesday ruled that after a constitutional amendment in 2018, state governments have no power to draw up their own lists of backward classes and that they must rely on the Centre to include or exclude any community for granting reservation.By a 3-2 majority, a five-judge bench interpreted the 102nd constitutional amendment, whereby provisions were inserted to give constitutional status to the National Commission for Backward Classes (Article 338B) and for empower the President to notify the list of socially and educationally backward classes of state or Union territory (Article 342A).While justices Ashok Bhushan and SA Nazeer maintained that the amendment act was confined to the list to be issued for central government jobs, justices L Nageswara Rao, Hemant Gupta and S Ravindra Bhat held that the scheme of the amendments has taken away the power of the state to identify backward classes. The majority dismissed the Centre’s understanding of the amendments. Attorney general KK Venugopal told the court that the 102nd amendment did not deprive state legislatures to enact law determining the Socially and Educationally Backward Classes and conferring benefits on them.According to the top law officer, Article 15(4) and 16(4) of the Constitution were untouched by insertion of Article 342 and that the states will continue to exercise their power to identify SEBCs and give reservation even after the amendments.Several states, including Maharashtra, Punjab, Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu and Karnataka, also asserted their right under Articles 15(4) and 16(4) to make special provisions for SEBCs and give them benefits of quota.Both the Centre and states urged the court to lend credence to the parliamentary select committee report of 2017 and a statement of Union minister Thawarchand Gehlot on the floor of Parliament in August 2017 that the amendments did not affect the rights of the state governments to notify backward classes for reservation.But the majority judgment rejected this plea. “I am convinced that there is no reason to depart from the text which is in clear terms and rely upon the legislative history to construe Article 342 A contrary to the language...”Stating that the states could only make suggestions with the President who will have the exclusive authority to notify the list of SEBCs, Justice Bhat added that once the list was notified, states could exercise their power under Article 15(4) and 16(4) to decide on extent of reservations, the kind of benefits, the quantum of scholarships, etc.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/states-have-no-power-to-draw-up-own-lists-of-backward-classes-sc-101620240638571.html
06-05-2021||India||India predicts another agricultural expansion||India has forecast an expansion of agriculture despite a massive surge in Covid-19 numbers, as farmers are projected to raise output to record levels in the oncoming kharif or summer-sown season, following a pandemic-defying performance in 2020.The Union government is anticipating an increase in sowing and higher demand from the farm sector. It has issued instructions for the seamless availability and supply of critical inputs, such as fertilisers, seeds, pesticides, and machinery.Millions of farmers have worked hard to keep agricultural operations going throughout the pandemic, aided by an exemption of the farm sector from Covid-related restrictions.The pandemic has hit urban centres and smaller towns harder, relatively sparing farming activities in the countryside. “We expect a nearly 10% increase in fertiliser demand,” an official of the agriculture ministry said, requesting not to be named.A key reason for the optimism has been the forecast of a normal 2021 monsoon, the third straight year of optimal rains. The India Meteorological Department on April 16 forecast that rainfall during the June-to-September monsoon season to be 98%. Rainfall between 94-106% is considered “normal”.On April 27, fertiliser minister DV Sadananda Gowda reviewed the demand-supply situation. In the meeting, officials projected that fertiliser demand could be around 35 million tonne in the summer-sown season, up from 32 million tonne last year, a second official said.On April 30, agriculture minister Narendra Tomar led a meeting of strategists and officials who will steer the so-called “Kharif Campaign 2021”. He announced a higher foodgrains production target of 307 million tonnes for 2021-22, up from 301.92 million tonne in 2020-21.According to a presentation by agriculture commissioner Suresh Malhotra at the meet, there were sufficient supplies of seeds, fertilisers, pesticides and machinery, except soyabean and maize seeds. “When you have a normal monsoon, that in itself takes care of most of the issues in agriculture. But the government should also be ready with adequate plans for patches where droughts are still possible...,” said RS Mani, a former faculty of the Tamil Nadu Agricultural University.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-predicts-another-agricultural-expansion-101620240638000.html
06-05-2021||India||UP panchayat polls: SP extends lead, parties try to woo independents||The Samajwadi Party (SP) extended its lead over the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in the Uttar Pradesh panchayat elections on Wednesday as parties attempted to woo independent candidates, who won the largest chunk of rural body seats.Trends and results available for 3,050 district panchayat wards on Wednesday evening showed the SP winning or leading in 779 wards, the BJP in 579, the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) in 361 and the Congress in 76. Independents and smaller parties won or led in 1,272 wards.The BJP, which secured a landslide victory in the UP assembly election by bagging 312 out of 403 seats in the state assembly, suffered setbacks in its bastions of Ayodhya, Varanasi, Lucknow and Gorakhpur in the panchayat elections and the SP maintained its grip on strongholds of Etawah (western UP), Kannauj (central UP), Mainpuri (western UP), Azamgarh (eastern UP), Etah (western UP), Kasganj (western UP) and Farrukhabad (western UP).The panchayat elections are not contested on party symbols, but all parties officially released the names of the candidates backed by them. The State Election Commission (SEC) has said results won’t be declared on party lines.Independent candidates, a majority of them rebels from various political parties, are likely to play a crucial role in the election of the district panchayat chairpersons to be held later this month. The BJP has already opened communication channels with independents to try and win district panchayat chair and block chief positions. The indirect elections are to be held for 75 posts of district panchayat chiefs and 826 block chiefs, likely by the end of May, according to a SEC officer.The victory of SP and other Opposition candidates is likely to set the ground for fresh political realignment and alliances before the assembly election in 2022. Smaller political parties, including the Suheldev Bhartyiya Samaj Party (SBSP), Aam Admi Party (AAP), Apna Dal, Azad Samaj Party (Bhim Army) and Pragtisheel Samajwadi Party-Lohia also bagged wards in the areas of their influence.The Bhagidari Sankalp Morcha launched by the smaller parties has called for a united alliance against the NDA in the 2022 assembly election, said SBSP chief Om Prakash Rajbhar.The farmers’ agitation against three central agrarian laws dented the BJP’s fortunes in west UP where it had won maximum seats in the 2017 assembly elections. The Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD), which won only one seat in the 2017 assembly polls and was wiped out in its stronghold in west UP, made a comeback in the panchayat polls, winning seats in Meerut, Shamli, Bulandshahr, Baghpat, Hapur and Bijnor.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/uppanchayat-polls-sp-extends-lead-parties-try-to-woo-independents-101620239438374.html
06-05-2021||India||3 more Rafale jets leave for India from France||Three Rafale jets took off from the Bordeaux–Mérignac airbase in France on Wednesday and were scheduled to reach India by night, taking the total number of Rafales in the Indian Air Force inventory to 21 and setting the stage for raising the second squadron of the fighters in the country’s eastern sector, officials familiar with the development said.“Next batch of three #Rafales leave from France to India today; wished the pilots smooth flight and safe landing,” the Indian embassy in France said on Twitter. This is the sixth ferry of Rafale jets from France to India.IAF chief Air Chief Marshal RKS Bhadauria last month flagged off four Rafale jets from France to India. Bhadauria was in France on a five-day visit in April.India ordered 36 warplanes from France (equivalent of two squadrons) in 2016 for Rs.59,000 crore under a government-to-government deal. The jets’ arrival will allow the IAF to begin raising its second Rafale squadron at Hasimara in West Bengal. “The new jets will be based in Ambala initially before moving to Hasimara when the raising of the squadron begins,” said one of the persons cited above. All the 36 planes are likely to join the IAF’s fighter fleet by the year-end.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/three-more-rafale-fighter-jets-arriving-tonight-stage-set-for-raising-2nd-squadron-101620216696010.html
06-05-2021||India||Maratha quota setback in Supreme Court may hurt Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi govt||The scrapping of the Maratha quota could be a major setback for the Uddhav Thackeray-led Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government, and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) could use the unrest in the influential community against the ruling coalition, said political experts.Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray will write to President Ram Nath Kovind and Prime Minister Narendra Modi, requesting them to take a decision on Maratha reservation.“I am requesting the Prime Minister and President to take a decision on Maratha reservation as the Supreme Court has also acknowledged that it comes under their authority,” Thackeray said in his address on Wednesday evening.The chief minister requested Marathas to exercise peace and restraint as the state is in the midst of a pandemic. He asked them not to get provoked. “The SC verdict is disappointing as it has said that the state doesn’t have powers to give reservation… But it has also shown us a way by saying that the Centre and President has powers to grant reservation to a community. I am sure that the PM or the Centre will not disrespect this demand as it is not of just a community but of entire Maharashtra,” he said.Marathas, who make up nearly 32% of the state population, are a strong force in the state both politically and socially.Mansing Pawar, one of the organisers of the Maratha Kranti Morcha, said there were two options: increase the ceiling of reservation quota which the central government could do, or the state government incorporate Marathas in the Other Backward Class category. “The central government will have to think of making an amendment to increase reservation quota from 50% and above to grant reservation to the Maratha community. The other option is that the state government can make Maratha community part of OBC category to grant reservation,” he said.State minister Ashok Chavan, who heads the cabinet sub-committee on Maratha reservation, said then chief minister Devendra Fadnavis misled the people on quota issues by passing it without due right. Fadnavis and other BJP leaders held the MVA government responsible for quashing of the reservation.Political analysts said the BJP will use the verdict to its advantage to corner the MVA politically. “The bill and subsequent law were passed during their government, but still they will make the argument emotional to fire up the Maratha youths. Whether there is any major election or not, the unrest will be engineered,” said Pratap Asbe, a political analyst.Another analyst Surendra Jondhale said that although the BJP enjoyed support of many Maratha leaders, it needed to be seen if Maratha youth come under their influence.“The BJP will attempt to mobilise the Marathas and make an issue out of it. Fadnavis has played an ambiguous role in the quota issue. Interestingly, [BJP MP] Sambhaji Maharaj has taken a stand that both governments pursued the matter and he accepted the verdict. The response of Maratha youths to the BJP will be important now,” said Jondhale, a former professor at Mumbai University.According to a Congress leader, the SC verdict may have long-standing political repercussions. “The BJP has been painting a picture that they had given the reservation to the community, but the three-party government could not safeguard it. It is now very difficult to regain it by filing a review petition and next to impossible to include them in other backward classes. The conclusion is the reservation was struck down, when the parties with strong Maratha base are at helm of affairs. The effect may be felt in the upcoming local body elections,” said the leader, requesting anonymity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/maratha-quota-maharashtra-to-approach-centre-bjp-blames-mva-for-sc-verdict-101620210442927.html
06-05-2021||Today's||A political and policy blow to the Centre||For the last seven years, they have been projected as India’s political jodi number one. Prime Minister (PM) Narendra Modi, as the larger-than-life strongman leader, and home minister Amit Shah, as the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)’s chief election strategist, have carried an aura of near invincibility. If Modi and his governance model are identified with catchy buzzwords such as “acche din” and “new” India, Shah is branded as a modern day Chanakya. However, the past month has dented this well-cultivated imagery. If the handling of the second Covid-19 wave has raised serious questions over the PM’s governance style, the BJP’s West Bengal debacle has undermined Shah’s image of being a master at winning elections.Take Covid 2.0. A terrifying pandemic offers no easy solutions but can it be denied that an all-powerful political executive at the Centre has been behind the curve in the Covid fight? Be it green signalling potential super-spreader events such as the Kumbh Mela or the utterly confused vaccine policy or the botch-up over oxygen supplies, the Modi government stands accused of bumbling at every turn.That it has taken repeated court interventions to goad the Centre into acting swiftly reveals the failings of a highly centralised and bureaucratic style of functioning that appears trapped in its own echo chamber of complacency and hubris. That Rahul Gandhi, often lampooned as “pappu” by the BJP’s hyper-active IT cells, has been pressing most of the right buttons on Covid should be a cause for further embarrassment. Even the much-vaunted Gujarat model stands exposed by the long queues of ambulances outside state hospitals, a grim reminder of the darker side of a development paradigm that didn’t invest enough in public health.Hype has been confused with reality in West Bengal too. The BJP marched into the Bengal elections like an all-conquering army, backed by massive resources, institutional support and a media blitzkrieg that suggested a landslide victory. For Shah, in particular, the conquest of Bengal was a personal mission, one where his crucial role as Union home minister in a national crisis appeared to lose out to his persona as an aggressive party campaigner. When he should have been focusing on coordinating with all states on Covid protocols, he was distracted with an overwhelming ambition to win another Opposition-ruled state. Here again, there was an unmistakable arrogance in approach, a failure to recognise that a Vidhan Sabha polls is fought on a different template than a Lok Sabha battle. The divisive “Jai Shri Ram” war-cry, which proved so effective in 2019, appeared out of sync in a more localised election. Without a strong, credible Bengal face, the BJP lured key lieutenants of the chief minister to switch sides, exposing their own limitations of symbolising an “Asol Poribortan” (real change) on the ground. As it turned out, a lone Mamata Banerjee in a wheelchair versus the BJP’s muscular men on a chariot only mirrored a compelling narrative of Bengali sub-nationalism — a rooted popular Bengali- speaking mass leader taking on the might of the Hindi-speaking “outsiders”. So is India’s primary political pair on the retreat? Yes and no. Despite the criticism of the failings of the Modi government in handling the pandemic, the PM remains a highly popular leader whose mass connect isn’t going to evaporate overnight. Likewise, as a consummate 24x7 politician, Shah will doubtlessly gear up to fight the next big electoral battle in Uttar Pradesh. Reports of their imminent political demise are exaggerated. Bengal 2021 is hardly India 2024.And yet, underplaying mounting citizen anger at the monumental collapse in basic health services would be politically foolhardy. When a national health emergency puts tens of thousands of people on ventilators, the central government cannot, to quote the Delhi High Court, “be living in ivory towers”. When people are desperately struggling for oxygen and ICU beds, there needs to be genuine outreach to address their grievances, with empathy and common sense and not through typical bureaucratic apathy or crafty perception management. An authoritarian mindset that views any criticism as “anti-national” is dangerous when the country is gasping for oxygen — what stops the PM, for example, from bringing together the finest minds in the country across key sectors to identify mistakes and course correct? Is this not an ideal moment to decentralise decision-making and build bridges with those who might have useful, even if contrarian, views?Unfortunately, the strongman model of political leadership is often unwilling to accept blunders and take responsibility. Rather than pass the buck, the top leadership needs to do a mea culpa, fix accountability and ring in changes. Can, for example, the Union health minister get away by claiming only last month that the country had sufficient stock of vaccines when alarm bells were already ringing across state capitals that vaccine supplies were running out? The “achche din” bubble has been well and truly pricked by the smoke and ash that bursts out of funeral pyres across the country. The nation wants to know who will bear the cross for an unimaginable tragedy. Post-script: Covid 2.0 calls for an urgent redrawing of priorities. Earlier this week, the Indian Premier League was suspended after a few players tested positive. A high-profile sport event in Covid-19 times was going to be a high-risk venture. So here is another suggestion: Why not also halt the construction of the Central Vista in the Capital, a grandiose vanity project, when the health risks facing the construction workers should be prioritised?

06-05-2021||Today's||India’s judiciary and the rights of refugees||Shortly before the beginning of World War II, the ship, St Louis, left Nazi Germany, carrying on board more than 900 Jewish refugees, who were trying to escape anti-Semitic persecution. United States (US), Canada, and Cuba refused to admit the refugees, forcing St. Louis to turn back for Europe. Historians now estimate that at least a quarter of the refugees aboard the St. Louis were eventually murdered in the Holocaust.Events such as these are legion in the annals of World War II. For these, and other reasons, after the end of the war, an international treaty concerning the rights of refugees was drafted and signed by many nations. At the core of international refugee law is the principle of non-refoulement — that is, refugees fleeing persecution on racial, ethnic, religious, or other grounds, may not be deported back to their country of origin, where their lives will be in danger.While India is not a signatory to the United Nations (UN) Refugee Convention Protection, it is by now widely accepted that the principle of non-refoulement has acquired the status of customary international law, i.e., it is binding on all States that make up the community of nations. This principle was affirmed in an important judgment by the Manipur high court (HC) on May 3, 2021, in a case concerning the status of seven Myanmarese refugees, who had fled to India after the military coup in their home country.Also Read | UN welcomes US President Joe Biden’s decision to admit more refugees this yearIn granting the refugees safe passage to Delhi so that they could apply to the UN High Commission for Refugees for a formalisation of their status, the Manipur HC correctly held that Article 21 of the Indian Constitution — which guarantees to all persons the right to life and personal liberty — included within it the right to non-refoulement.Over the last four decades, the Indian judiciary has achieved worldwide renown for its generous interpretation of Article 21 of the Constitution, expanding it to include a panoply of rights that protect the dignity and freedom of the individual. Relying upon that storied history, the Manipur high court held that Article 21 would continue to apply even in the case of refugees, who had fled to India seeking sanctuary from persecution.The high court’s judgment is particularly important, especially when considered in light of the Supreme Court (SC)’s inaction in a similar case. For the last four years — well before the coup — the Rohingya community in Myanmar has been subjected to genocidal persecution and ethnic cleansing, a fact that was provisionally accepted last year by the International Court of Justice.Since 2017, a petition has been pending in SC, asking the court to clarify that the principle of non-refoulement is part of the Indian Constitution, and that therefore, the government should not deport refugees back to Myanmar without a determination of their status. However, not only has SC not decided the case, but — in two interim orders — allowed deportation to go ahead, pending final resolution. This is starkly reminiscent of the actions of the US and Canadian governments in turning away St. Louis, and consigning Jewish refugees to a terrible fate.Indeed, the Manipur HC is not the first Indian HC to have held that Article 21 protects the right to non-refoulement. The Gujarat and Delhi HCs have also done so, and indeed, the Manipur HC drew upon a rich tradition of Indian jurisprudence that guarantees the basic rights of refugees, in passing its judgment.Thus, it is perhaps in the teeth of the Supreme Court’s inaction that the high court’s judgment stands out as a beacon of judicial courage and principle, in protecting the rights — and indeed, the lives — of the most vulnerable.Gautam Bhatia is a Delhi-based advocateThe views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/indias-judiciary-and-the-rights-of-refugees-101620304012397.html
06-05-2021||Today's||The suspension of IPL and idea of decency||Another fortress fell this week. The Indian Premier League (IPL), having dodged all kinds of curve balls and leapt over numerous hurdles in its decade-and-a-half of existence, finally stumbled to an abrupt halt, midway into its 14th season.The “bio-security bubble”, as the quasi-airtight logistics of the event are labelled, gave way. A number of players and staff, supposedly insulated from the grimy, pandemic-ravaged world outside, tested positive for Covid-19. The same fear and dread, which the rest have been enduring for over a year, came visiting those who dwelt in their firewalled fastness.Commentators on TV, print and digital media got busy working out the economic impact of the curtailed extravaganza — on the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI), the participating clubs, the small army of support staff which holds it all together, the fans and, above all, the advertisers who had backed it with thousands of crore of media spending.How badly have the advertisers been served?Marshall McLuhan published Understanding Media: The Extensions of Man in 1964. Six decades on, his principal thesis, that “the medium is the message”, continues to resonate for its prescience and accuracy, and endures through all media forms.A television advertising spot which runs in a commercial break during an IPL fixture is a medium (spot) in a medium (break) in a medium (fixture) in a medium (TV). Unpacking the nesting is important to parse the layers at which a viewer engages with advertising.Also Read | Shane Warne extends ‘love & support’ to India in battle against Covid-19TV is increasingly emblematic of the involuntary confinement we have been subjected to. While it attempts to inform and entertain us, it is also a constant reminder of all the other media which we have had to forsake. It is our solitary window to the world, but one with which we now have a paradoxical, “now I love it, now I don’t”, relationship.Move up a step to the IPL tournament. Over 14 years, hundreds of millions of cricket fans across the country, and many millions overseas, have aligned themselves with the participating clubs and have developed the same sort of parochial tribes which you associate with club sport all over the world. Last year, organisers showed contextual sensitivity when they moved the venue to the United Arab Emirates. The tournament could proceed without imposing pressure on stretched support services.This year, in contrast, with India having declared premature victory over the pandemic, the organisers got swept up in the exuberance and kept it back in India, albeit with severe curtailment in venues and nobody in the stadium stands. While the audiences tuned in, they probably nursed some resentment too. After all, here they were, being instructed to mask up, even when they were at home. And there were the young, brash, larger-than-life players, like gods amongst us, in their impervious bubble, so near in close-ups, so far from our trials and tribulations.Which brings us to the commercial break. By definition, advertising is about hedonism — desire, craving and sensual gratification. Our incarceration has left us leading strangely abstinent lives. Our wardrobes full of different clothes for different occasions have surrendered before unfussy, well-worn tees, shorts and yoga pants. Make-up dries in its pots and tubes. Fancy footwear gathers dust in shoe racks. What may have tantalised in a different time, only serves to aggravate today. The yawning gulf between what we need and what we want has been bridged, on the side of what we need. In the event, anything which belongs to the realm of want, not need, is now superfluous. The string of ad spots in a break is, in lesser or greater measure, a grating reminder of our privations.At this point, it may be redundant to examine what the smallest level of our nested hierarchy, the spot, conveys. It is, however, important that we do so, to determine what gains or losses the advertisers whose media plans were frustrated by the decision to suspend IPS may tot up.Brands are recognised as manifestations of every aspect of the human condition. As such, they manifest, explicitly or implicitly, the joys and sorrows, anxieties and aspirations, interests and aversions, of the consumers they speak to. If they step away from the semantic space which they are expected to inhabit, they face backlash. If they line up with what their loyal users wish from them, they are rewarded with loyalty and advocacy. All too often, the alignment may be entirely involuntary, expressed in media choices. This fraught area of communication analysis is now called “Brand Safety”.Also Read | RCB players and support staff leave for their respective destinationsOver 30 years ago, a small band of visionary marketing communications professionals established the Advertising Standards Council of India. They swore a solemn commitment to “Ensure Honesty, Truthfulness and Decency in Advertising”. They may not have known it then but they were, in effect, enshrining the very same idea.How so? And why does this settle the issue of the gains/losses experienced by advertisers in the current contretemps?Decency is the bridge bridge which connects McLuhan’s medium/message assertion with brand safety. At every level of our nested hierarchy, we encountered a persistent paradox. We were drawn irresistibly to what the medium wanted to share with us. And yet, it also felt like the nagging discomfort of a pebble in our sneakers. The problem with the pleasure principle, by definition, is that it is transient. Pain, conversely, is relentless, persistent.Advertisers, unaware of the immutable law of unintended consequence, were tantalising the sensate. And infuriating the subliminal.There will be another day to advertise and drive those throngs to your brands. Consider yourself lucky. You dodged the bullet.Paritosh Joshi is a media professional with a keen interest in audience measurementThe views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/the-suspension-of-ipl-and-idea-of-decency-101620303112422.html
06-05-2021||Today's||In India’s Covid war, the role of the fauj||India’s Covid-19 crisis and the extraordinary surge in the second wave have become a matter of global concern. Public policy experts have offered professional advice based on their own national experiences. In a recent interview with The Indian Express, Anthony S Fauci, the chief medical adviser to the president of the United States, compared the current public health challenge to a war and referred to the Indian military. He noted: “What is the role of the (Indian) military? Can the military come in and help?” Fauci added: “You should think of this, in some respects, like a war. The enemy is the virus. It is almost like wartime because it’s an emergency.”Since the pandemic was acknowledged as a major national challenge in March 2020, the Indian military has been providing “aid to civil power” in a variety of ways. When the virus was spreading slowly last year, the fauj helped set up quarantine facilities and assisted in the evacuation of Indian citizens stranded abroad. Special military medical teams were also sent to some neighbouring nations to help establish Covid-testing facilities.In recent weeks, when the virulence of the second wave called for emergency measures, transport aircraft of the Indian Air Force ferried much-needed oxygen and other medical supplies from donor nations. The Indian Navy carried medical supplies from the neighbourhood. The Indian Army, which has the largest footprint across the nation, created dedicated Covid-19 facilities for civilians, and military medical personnel are at the forefront in hospitals set up by the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO). Prime Minister Narendra Modi has also met with the military top brass and emergency measures have been put in place to enable the military to provide assistance to the Covid-19-afflicted. However, while recognising the contribution of the military to India’s Covid-19 effort, the answer to Fauci’s query (can the military come in and help?) is yes — but only when such help is sought by the civilian government. Every nation evolves its civil-military template — and it is important that this balance is not upset. The military must and will help, but it cannot be suddenly expected to fill in all the deficits caused by entirely avoidable policy mistakes of the civilian domain. The primary role of the military is to safeguard national integrity, counter territorial challenges and prepare for war to deter any adventurism. The past year has been particularly taxing for the Indian military — China’s incursions across the Line of Actual Control, and the subsequent Galwan setback, occurred due to the pandemic-induced disruption of the Army’s annual deployment in Ladakh.The Covid-19 tsunami is expected to continue in India till at least the end of May, and remain an issue of concern for the rest of the year. Hence maximising the institutional capacity of the military in the war against Covid-19, without diluting its primary operational orientation, in the backdrop of a resource crunch, is the task ahead for the Indian political and defence leadership. The military’s core characteristics are professional competence, innovation in the face of adversity, proven organisational acumen and a deeply ingrained spirit of selfless service. Add to this the intrinsic training ethos of the military and some policy options can be identified.A key immediate, and medium-term, Covid-19 management objective for India will be to create across-the- broad capacity to avoid the kind of tragic situation of today, most visible in oxygen shortages. Only last week, to address the dire shortage of oxygen in Agra district, the local army and air force helped the district administration set up a new oxygen plant that was completed in a record seven days. Further, the army’s technical corps, the electronics and mechanical engineers (EME) in Agra, repaired a local oxygen manufacturing unit that was non-operational for a few years. It has now been entrusted with a similar task to repair a plant in Saifai. Policymakers must think about whether this kind of civilian-military partnership to boost oxygen production can be replicated on a wider scale and under what conditions. The next Covid-19 crisis for India will be a shortage of trained medical staff — doctors-nurses-paramedics. A large number of under trainees are in the final stages of completing their courses in medical colleges, and the military can play a role in bringing them into the mainstream with focused and rigorous final grooming — in a matter of weeks. Just as the Indian military had trained thousands of young citizens in the mid-1960’s in a warlike environment, it can significantly augment medical human resources capacity. A few high-risk, meagre infrastructure districts can be entrusted to the military for relief and can be scaled up judiciously. Further, the community of retired military veterans is a large, disciplined pool and can be encouraged to join the effort. They can be pulled in for the tasks of coordination, logistics management, and direct medical assistance in the case of trained personnel, among other measures.But all such initiatives will need careful planning, based on envisioning an effective role for the military in pandemic management. Exploiting the military for short-term political advantage and optics (for instance, the location of the first set of DRDO hospitals in Varanasi, Lucknow and Ahmedabad have generated questions) must be avoided. When the death toll is moving towards half a million, the situation, alas, is grim and warlike, requiring all of India’s institutions to weigh in.C Uday Bhaskar is the director of Society for Policy Studies The views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/in-india-s-covid-war-the-role-of-the-fauj-101620131297517.html
06-05-2021||Editorials||The economic impact of Covid-19||The second wave of Covid-19 infections is bound to have an adverse impact on the economy. While Reserve Bank of India (RBI) governor Shaktikanta Das has said that its economic impact will not be as severe as that of the first wave, private forecasters are beginning to factor in the effects. For example, S&P Global Ratings has slashed its GDP forecast for 2021-22 from 11% to 9.8%. Such projections, if true, will mute the V-shaped recovery that the government was banking on. But it is important to go beyond the headline GDP numbers. Azim Premji University’s latest State of Working India report, which was released on May 5, makes a convincing case about the pandemic’s regressive impact — it has affected the poor more than the rich — on jobs and incomes. According to the report, 230 million people fell below the income poverty line (at a minimum wage of ₹375 per day) due to the pandemic. Had the pandemic not happened, according to the report, 50 million people would have come above the poverty line. The report also shows that employment recovery has stagnated at a lower benchmark than pre-pandemic levels, and even when jobs were restored, there has been a fall in quality of employment or incomes. These findings align with anecdotal accounts of the post-pandemic recovery being profit- rather than wage-led. They also underline the threat of prolonged demand headwinds for the economy. The Indian State — and this includes both central and state governments and independent institutions — was complacent about the threat of a second wave. The latest APU report should caution policymakers, both at the national and state level, against being complacent on the economic front as well. Supply-side measures, including the latest ones announced by RBI on Wednesday, will not be enough to mitigate the pandemic’s economic impact. More demand-side relief measures are needed, as the report argues. This is especially true for those who are at the bottom of the pyramid. This is not just a matter of academic debate anymore. Post-pandemic relief measures by state governments seem to have played a big role in shaping voting preferences in the recent state elections. Politicians who ignore the economic pain of the pandemic will do so at their peril.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/the-economic-impact-of-covid19-101620304853918.html
06-05-2021||Editorials||The battle over reservations||On Wednesday, a five-judge bench of the Supreme Court (SC) struck down Mahara-shtra’s move to extend the ambit of reserv-ations in government jobs and educational institutions to the Maratha community; this had resulted in breaching the 50% cap on reservations set by court in the Indira Sawhney judgment of 1992, taking Maharashtra’s reservation up to 68%. While the decision pertained to the state and the specific quota for the Maratha community, the relentless expansion of reservations has made a mockery of India’s entire architecture of affirmative action.Even as political parties are engaged in blame game, SC’s verdict must open up a conversation about quotas. This newspaper unequivocally supports reservations for Dalits and tribals in India — there has been historic injustice; these marginalised communities lag behind on every social and economic indicator; and ensuring affirmative action to the discriminated is fundamental to India’s goals of being an equitable, ethical democracy. But reservations have become an endless exercise in power-sharing, dependent on the political heft of the community demanding it. It is seen as a quick fix when the country is going through an employment crisis. They have become a staple demand of dominant agrarian communities (Marathas are an example) because agriculture cannot absorb the young and there aren’t opportunities in either the public or private sector. But what this requires is not additional quotas but a serious attempt to fix India’s political economy and its inherent inequities. Instead of finding ways to breach the 50% cap on reservations, expanding quotas to win over powerful communities for electoral purposes, and painting the judiciary as regressive, the political class must focus on structural problems.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/the-battle-over-reservations-101620304675591.html
06-05-2021||Editorials||Beyond image management||For any government, public communication is an important tool — to outline policies and actions, keep citizens informed, and provide its side of the story in public conversations. In a democracy, political parties running a government have an added incentive to aggressively communicate — for this is tied to shaping the public narrative and determining electoral outcomes. And, therefore, it is not wrong for any government to have internal deliberations on how best to engage with citizens. All regimes do it, and some are more successful than others.But the focus on controlling the narrative should neither be excessive nor distract the government from what should be its core job. In the middle of the most severe emergency India has ever seen, around 300 officials of the central government, as reported by this newspaper on Wednesday, were pulled in for a workshop on effective communication. The aim was to help create a “positive image” of the government, “manage perceptions through effectively highlighting positive stories and achievements”, and portray the government as “sensitive, bold, quick, responsive, hardworking etc”. The meeting may have been routine, but its singular focus was on projecting the right narrative — something also reflected in the constitution of a group of ministers last year at a time when India was battling the first wave and Chinese incursions (the story about this committee and its suggestions was first broken by this newspaper).The easiest and best way to fix a message is to fix the product. And at the moment, the lived experiences of Indian citizens — desperately pleading for oxygen cylinders and hospital beds, or struggling to get vaccinated — is so much at variance with official claims that the message won’t work. This also ends up putting the government in a box. Public communication during a pandemic must focus only on health-related issues, not how to make the government look good. It isn’t just the Centre; some states are equally focused on the narrative. This is not the time for narrative management. Accelerate the vaccine drive, get the second wave of the pandemic under some control, and perceptions will automatically improve.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/beyond-image-management-101620280549774.html
