The high court has acted on a plea by Chanchal Singh, an assistant professor in the department of physiology and biochemistry at Guru Angad Dev Veterinary and Animal Sciences University, Ludhiana. The court was told that the petitioner is a Covid-19 warrior, who acquired kidney disease when he was posted for virus testing at Viral Research and Diagnostic Laboratory, Ludhiana, in November 2020. Suffering from chronic kidney failure, for which the cause is unclear, the petitioner is undergoing dialysis at Dayanand Medical College and Hospital, Ludhiana, and Max Super Specialty Hospital, Mohali. The court was told that he has been enrolled in the list of kidney transplant patients by the Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education Research, Chandigarh, and directions be issued to the authorities concerned for getting his transplant done at the earliest under the Deceased Donor Kidney Transplant Scheme. The petitioner has argued that as he is a Covid-19 warrior, he should be given priority over other patients. The Centre, Punjab government and PGIMER have been asked to respond by May 24, whether there are any specific instructions or policies for providing such preferential treatment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/can-covid-warriors-be-treated-on-priority-hc-asks-centre-punjab-101620670520018.html
10-05-2021||Gurugram||RWAs complain over biomedical waste pile-up, raise health concerns||At least 52 residents’ welfare associations (RWAs) submitted a joint complaint to the Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) and the district administration on Sunday over the poor collection of waste from Covid-affected households in their respective areas over the past few weeks and also raised health concerns due to piled up biomedical waste.The RWAs, under a collective front called RWAs United, also alerted the MCG and the administration via social media on the matter. They complained that the workers of Ecogreen, the civic body’s agency for door-to-door collection of waste, visit their areas infrequently and when they do visit, collect only 20-30% of the accumulated biomedical waste due to the limited capacity of their vehicles.Officials of Ecogreen said that they have recently increased the total number of biomedical waste collection vehicles from eight to 12 to handle higher capacities.“Dedicated Ecogreen vehicles are going to different corners of the city on a daily basis for collecting biomedical waste from Covid-19 houses. They are often making multiple trips to one location. Numbers of Ecogreen supervisors have been shared by the MCG so that residents can reach out to our staff and accordingly waste is being collected from such places on a priority basis,” said Sanjeev Sharma, the official spokesperson for Ecogreen.In the letter to MCG and administration, the RWAs of Vatika City, Orchid Petals, Tatvam Villas, Princeton Estate, Unitech Harmony, Ridgewood, Central Park 2, Uniworld Garden, Vipul Greens, Omaxe Nile and Malibu Condominium, alleged that their areas were the worst affected.“Until last month, Ecogreen vehicles were coming to the society twice a week. But over the last four weeks, they came once every 10-15 days and as a result, there was a huge pile of biomedical garbage accumulating inside the society. Even when the vehicles arrived, of the nine 900-litre dustbins reserved for biomedical waste, they were only able to empty three or four dustbins at a go as their vehicles ran out of space,” said Jyoti Ahuja, joint secretary, Vatika City RWA.Ahuja said that following their complaint, the MCG reached out to them and sent a waste collection truck to clear out the waste on Monday.However, representatives of RWAs United said on Monday that of the 11 residential areas where the situation of biomedical waste is severe, waste had only been cleared from Vatika City.“The remaining RWAs are still waiting for Ecogreen vehicles to arrive. The situation of biomedical waste has been severe over the past four to five weeks, Ecogreen vehicles are collecting waste once every seven to 10 days, and when they come they are only able to lift 20-30% of the total biomedical waste load. In the interim, balconies of Covid-19 houses are getting filled with biomedical waste and people are running out of space to store them,” said DIG (retd) of the Indian Coast Guard Siddharth S Sood, president, Harmony Apartment Owners Welfare Association (HOWA).In residential societies and condominiums, two in-house staff collect biomedical waste from each floor. One person is responsible for collecting it while the other person has to ensure that the area is immediately sanitised. Subsequently, the collected waste is either directly dumped in the Ecogreen vehicles or dropped at a designated area. In June last year, the MCG had issued a public release stating that to reduce the risk of transmission of Covid-19 and cope with logistical difficulties, Ecogreen vehicles will lift biomedical waste from each of its 35 wards on two fixed days in a week.On April 21, amid complaints from residents, the MCG issued a public release reiterating that Ecogreen has eight dedicated vehicles for this task, two for each of its four zones. The MCG had also given the mobile numbers of supervisors of these vehicles so that residents could contact them directly.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/rwas-complain-over-biomedical-waste-pile-up-raise-health-concerns-101620670160574.html
10-05-2021||Gurugram||100-bed facility at Tau Devi Lal stadium to start in a week, aid in treating cases from rural areas||A 100-bed makeshift Covid-19 facility being set up at the Tau Devi Lal Stadium is likely to be operational within a week, which will aid in handling patients from rural areas that are witnessing a gradual surge in infections, Gurugram’s deputy commissioner said on Monday.“The construction of the facility has been going on at a fast pace and will be ready within six to seven days. Medical supplies have already been procured and health staff is also being arranged to run the facility. It will ease the Covid-19 burden and mitigate the current crisis, especially emerging in rural areas that lack proper healthcare infrastructure,” said Dr Yash Garg, the deputy commissioner.In rural areas falling under Pataudi, Farrukhnagar and Sohna, the test positivity rate (the proportion of positives out of the sample tested) has gone up to 21%. Subdivisional hospitals in these blocks lack the infrastructure to handle moderate to severely ill Covid-19 cases. Even the existing healthcare infrastructure in the city is under immense pressure in catering to patients from urban areas. Until Monday, at least 2,402 critically ill patients were admitted to the Covid-19 hospitals in the city.According to Garg, since many people from villages cannot afford treatment in private hospitals, the new facility will help in providing timely treatment to patients from rural areas and will also cater to the urban population. The facility will be run and managed by the district administration.The facility will have at least 10 ventilator beds and 10 beds in a high dependency unit, along with 80 beds with oxygen support systems. “The administration has been working on setting up an oxygen plant at the facility so that we are prepared for the next wave,” said Garg.The district health department has sent a request for hiring at least 84 health workers, comprising 60 staff nurses, 16 medical officers, three physicians and five anaesthetists to run the facility. “The list has already been shared with the deputy commissioner,” said Dr Virender Yadav, chief medical officer.The facility was earlier planned to come up in Sector 27 but faced resistance from residents of the area, following which the district administration shifted it to Tau Devi Lal stadium.On Monday, more than 80 workers were involved in setting up the makeshift facility. The construction in-charge, who requested not to be named, said, “Within a week of the announcement, the basic infrastructure has been set up. Now, electricity, air conditioning and water support systems are being arranged. In all likelihood, it will be ready in seven to 10 days,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/100bed-facility-at-tau-devi-lal-stadium-to-start-in-a-week-aid-in-treating-cases-from-rural-areas-101620670159478.html
10-05-2021||Gurugram||RTI activist, sons arrested for duping banks of ₹15 crore||A Gurugram-based RTI activist and his family members were booked on Monday for allegedly duping two banks of ₹15 crore by taking multiple loans against a property by transferring it among the family members, the police said.Right to Information (RTI) activist Harinder Dhingra and his two sons were arrested on Monday, while his wife, daughter-in-law and grandson were issued a notice asking them to join the investigation, the police said.According to the police, the family members attached the house, constructed over 500 square yards in DLF Phase-1, in 2003 for a business loan of around ₹3 crore. When the bank issued a notice over the non-payment of the loan and filed for the attachment of property, he allegedly transferred the property to his elder son, Prashant, and took another loan for ₹8 crore, by mortgaging the property with another bank. He, however, allegedly failed to repay the second loan as well.The police said when the second bank filed for attachment of the property, Dhingra’s younger son, Tarun, filed a case claiming a stake in the property. The family is accused of cheating the banks and keeping courts in the dark about the pending loans while seeking a transfer of property through court.The police received a complaint from a resident of Malibu Town on April 16 against the family and after investigation, registered a case under the Indian Penal Code sections 420 (cheating), 467, 468, 471 and 120B (criminal conspiracy) on Monday. However, the police did not disclose how the complainant was affected.Dhingra and his two sons, Prashant and Tarun, were arrested while the rest of the family members were issued notices.Dhingra and his wife, Poonam, purchased the 500 square yard property in DLF Phase-1 in 2001. In 2003, Poonam and Prashant allegedly took a loan for their export firm from a bank against the property. In 2004, the loan of around ₹3 crore was declared a non-performing asset (NPA) by the bank, which filed a case before the debt recovery tribunal (DRT) in New Delhi for attachment of the property in lieu of the pending loan amount.Karan Goel, an assistant commissioner of police (ACP), said to save the property from being attached, Prashant approached a district court seeking a claim in the property. “In November 2006, they reached a compromise at the Lok Adalat and transferred the property to Prashant Dhingra. The bank could not attach the property as its ownership changed. The family members had conspired to dupe banks and did not disclose the facts before the court,” he said.In 2007, Prashant mortgaged the property with another bank for a loan of ₹8 crore for his export firm and this loan was also declared an NPA in 2008. The bank issued a notice for recovery of ₹10 crore (including interest) and approached the DRT Chandigarh seeking attachment of the property.To allegedly avoid attachment of the property, Tarun filed a case before a Gurugram court challenging the order of the Lok Adalat decision of 2006 and staked a claim in the property. The court stayed the 2006 order of Lok Adalat, following which it was challenged in the Punjab and Haryana high court in February 2016, and the order of the Lok Adalat was overturned. The property was transferred back to Harinder Dhingra and Poonam.Goel said as a case for attachment of property was pending before the court, Dhingra forged papers and transferred the property to Tarun Dhingra and his grandson Garv, who is Prashant’s son, in December 2016. “All of them live in the same house and kept transferring property among themselves after taking loans from banks,” he said.“During the investigation, it was found that Dhingra and his family duped the bank as per plan and they took loans that were never repaid and kept on transferring the property to avoid attachment,” said Goel.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/rti-activist-sons-arrested-for-duping-banks-of-15-crore-101620670160056.html
10-05-2021||Pune||Real estate developers worry slow vaccination may adversely impact sector||While the lockdown has already impacted many construction sites after workers preferred to return to their native places, the slow vaccination process has added worry to the real estate developers who feel the inadequate supply may further affect the sector. “Under the second wave of lockdown which has hit us very badly, all sectors have been affected including real estate. Vaccination is the only solution and if vaccination drives speeds up, then we will soon see near to normalcy by the year end,” said Satish Magar, chairman of Credai National. He was speaking at the webinar organized by Credai Maharashtra to guide developers during pandemic.Those present on the occasion were Credai national vice president Shantilal Kataria and Anant Rajegaonkar, Credai national advisory board chairman Jitendra Thakkar, Credai Maharashtra president Sunil Furde, secretary Sunil Kotwal along with 854 members of Credai Maharashtra along with many developers from across the country.In Pune, as many as 14.5 lakh persons have been given the first dose so far while the process has slowed down in the past few days due to inadequate supply of vaccines. “Many home buyers in Maharashtra, who are caught in the second wave of Covid should be given a four-month extension for property registration and should not be penalized after the extension,” expressed Kataria. “Construction workers, who are the backbone of the construction sector, are currently returning to their villages. Therefore, it is not possible to complete the construction on time. This sector is facing endless difficulties. Today, there are more than 12 lakh registered workers in Maharashtra and about 250 businesses are directly and indirectly dependent on this sector. It is our role to co-operate fully with the state government to prevent layoffs”, he added.“The honourable high court has proposed the state government to consider a strict lockout to prevent the further outbreak of Covid-19 but if this is implemented it will have an adverse effect on the construction sector. If the labourers go back to their hometowns, then there will be a delay of several months to complete the projects,” Furde said “Not only are the developers supplying groceries and other necessities to construction workers, if there is sufficient availability of vaccines, the Credai will soon undertake a comprehensive campaign to vaccinate the workers in proper coordination with the state government.” added Furde.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/real-estate-developers-worry-slow-vaccination-may-adversely-impact-sector-101620669739395.html
10-05-2021||Chandigarh||Wheat procurement nears end, but no clarity on what Centre owes to Punjab||Wheat procurement is nearing its end this Rabi season in Punjab, but the Centre has still not released the cost sheet on what it owes to the state government.A cost sheet is a document that confirms the accruals, such as rural development fund, market fee and labour and transport charges to be paid to the state for procurement. Postponed due to the Covid-19 surge, procurement in the state began on April 10. Against the projections for 130 lakh tonne procurement, the four state agencies — Pungrain, Punsup, warehousing corporation and Markfed — and the Centre’s Food Corporation of India have so far procured at least 129.25 lakh tonne wheat and made ₹22,500 crore payments to the farmers. However, there is no clarity on various taxes the state agencies charge from the buyer of foodgrain, ie, the Centre. The procurement figures are expected to go up further in this week. Sources in the food department said the payment for gunny bags supplied by arhtiyas (commission agents) have been made after the Centre’s clearance as procurement was hit due to their shortage. Payments to contractors stuckThe cost sheet is released by the Centre’s food and public distribution ministry. The same ministry mandated direct benefit transfer (DBT) of minimum support price (MSP) to farmers, which was implemented despite the opposition from arhtiyas. Earlier, these agents were a link between the government and farmers, and the entire payment was routed through them. “Why can’t the ministry release the cost sheet when they have forced the DBT upon us?” said an official of the state food and civil supplies department, who didn’t want to be named. Sources in the department said that all other states engaged in wheat procurement have also reported delay in cost sheet. After opposition by arhtiyas, the Punjab government managed to bring them on board by making minor changes in public finance management system and allowed them to view payments transferred to farmers attached to them. “In the past, the Centre used to release provisional sheet before the start of every procurement season, but this time the season is almost over, but there are no signs of the document. It is very important, as without it, all expenditures made by the state government in transportation of wheat from mandis to godowns and the labour involved will be deemed illegal, halting the disbursal,” said the official.According to another senior official in the department, MSP has been disbursed through the cash credit limit received at the start of the procurement. “But for making other payments, we need clearance from the Centre, and so far payments to the tune of ₹2,000 to be made to transporters and labour contractors are pending,” he said. The Centre has fixed ₹46 per quintal as dami (commission) to be paid to arhtiyas, but in the absence of the cost sheet, even that can’t be transferred into their accounts. RDF, market fee and moreThe Centre has also failed to provide any clarity on the rural development fund (RDF) to the state government. During paddy procurement in the last Kharif season, the Centre provisionally allowed the state to charge 1% RDF, instead of 3%, according to provisions of its Agricultural Produce Market Committee Act.RDF goes to the rural development board led by the chief minister and is used for development in villages.On being asked for a justification for charging 3%, the state has sent all facts and figures to the Centre, explaining the fund’s importance, but so far there is no response, and the issue remains unclear in the current procurement season. The cost sheet will also give clarity on market fee (3%) that goes into the kitty of the mandi board that manages 1,850 mandis for procurement of wheat and paddy in Rabi and Kharif seasons. Principal secretary, food and civil supplies, Punjab, KAP Sinha said he would take up the matter with the Centre.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/wheat-procurement-nears-end-but-no-clarity-on-what-centre-owes-to-punjab-101620669562857.html

Under the banner of Dron Rehdi Patri Feri committee of Gurugram, street vendors submitted a copy of the letter to the deputy commissioner of Gurugram, seeking financial aid of ₹7,500 per month.Yogesh Kumar, the president of the committee, said, “The government has allowed even small restaurants to operate for deliveries, but no provisions have been made for the street vendors who depend on daily earnings. At present, we are able to manage food, using the ration we had purchased for our stalls, but there is no option available to us for medical expenses or paying the school fee of our children.”“We are requesting the government to allow us to function so that at least packed food can be delivered from our stalls, which will help us in earning some money. If the government does not allow us to start our shops, then we request them to pay ₹7,500 to each street vendor in the district,” added Kumar.At present, there are around 50,000 street vendors associated with the committee of which “around 40% have gone back to their villages as it is difficult to manage major expenses like rent, without daily earnings.”Deputy commissioner Yash Garg said that as the matter was under the jurisdiction of the Municipal Corporation of Gurugram, the letter was forwarded to them.A senior MCG official, requesting anonymity, said, “Last year, after the lockdown, the government had started a scheme where street vendors could take loans of ₹10,000 on low interest rates from banks to set up their work again and the same scheme is continuing. We will be looking into this matter again and see that all possible help is given to them.”Rajendra Singh Saroha, the general secretary of the Centre of Indian Trade Unions, said, “Since the lockdown was imposed, I have been getting calls daily from street vendors and daily wage earners seeking help as they are not able to manage daily expenses. Keeping the situation in mind, we have written to the chief minister seeking financial assistance so that the street vendors can sustain themselves.”Ashok Kumar, who worked as a helper at a food stall in Sector 40 market, said, “The lockdown was imposed at the starting of the month, so the owner did not pay me last month’s salary as he himself did not have money. Now, with the lockdown being extended, there is no clarity on when I would get paid and without money, it is difficult to stay here.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/street-vendors-seek-financial-aid-from-government-101620669563306.html

MCG commissioner Vinay Pratap Singh drafted an order in this regard on April 29, a copy of which is with HT, before he was diagnosed with Covid-19. Singh’s order was circulated by the MCG internally on Monday and subsequently, made public. He stated in the order that the civic body had been receiving complaints from the public that caretakers of the cremation grounds in MCG limits are overcharging different amounts for cremation within MCG limits. “Therefore, to bring uniformity in the fee/charges for cremation of a human corpse at different cremation grounds..... I do hereby prohibit the charging of a fee beyond a sum of ₹5,500 per cremation, including the charges for wood, the fee of a priest, and sanitation charges,” the order stated.Singh further directed the in-charges of cremation grounds to submit a daily report to the MCG office about information, including the amount charged for each cremation. The order was issued under the Haryana Municipal Corporation Act, 1994, and further stated that any person found violating these orders will be prosecuted under the relevant provisions of the act. “At certain places, we received complaints that the in-charges were asking over ₹15,000-20,000 for doing one cremation. Hence, a standard fee has been introduced and the rates will be displayed across all the four major crematoriums as well,” said a senior MCG official privy to the matter.The four major crematoriums falling under the MCG area at Madanpuri, near Pataudi Chowk, Atul Kataria Chowk, Sector 32 near Medanta Hospital, and at Carterpuri.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/mcg-fixes-fee-of-5-500-per-cremation-including-covid-19-deaths-101620669561683.html
10-05-2021||Gurugram||Rural areas hit by Covid-19, positivity rate remained over 21% in April||The second wave of Covid-19 has hit rural areas too, officials of the district health department said, with the test positivity rate (proportion of positives out of the samples tested) reaching 21.8% in April, as per the department’s data. Seven high-risk areas have also been identified, where mass surveillance by conducting door-to-door rapid antigen tests started from May 8.“The second Covid-19 wave has penetrated rural areas of the district. Through aggressive and timely testing, we are trying to control the transmission. At least 138 teams have been formed who will do antigen testing in seven rural areas where test positivity rate has been high,” said Yash Garg, deputy commissioner.The worst-affected rural blocks of the district are under Sohna and Pataudi, said officials, pointing to an increase in cases in Bhondsi, Palra, Kasan, Bhangrola, Bhangrola, Badshahpur and Farrukhnagar.The health department data shows that in April, the test positivity rate was 16.6% in Bhorakalan, 19.3% in Bhondsi, 17.7% in Farrukhnagar and 14% in Mandpura. Kasan primary health centre (PHC) in Pataudi and Palra PHC in Sohna showed the highest positivity rate, of almost 21%, officials said.These high-risk areas are inching closer to a positivity rate of almost 26% that is reported in large outbreak regions of the city. Gauging the seriousness of the matter, antigen testing started in rural areas on May 8.Of 2,194 rapid antigen tests administered on May 8, at least 33 tested positive while on May 9, at least 25 people were confirmed positive for Covid-19 out of the 1,169 who were tested. Antigen test delivers results within 15-20 minutes but has lower specificity to detect the SARS-CoV-2 virus despite people exhibiting symptomsAccording to health officials, people in rural areas do not come forward for testing compared to those in urban areas. “Therefore, antigen testing is one of the ways to control the spread before it creates a crisis-like situation in the coming time. Most of these areas have a mix of urban and rural populations, leading to faster transmission of coronavirus. Many people commute every day to the city for work or other tasks. All these factors have led to the Covid-19 spike in rural areas,” said Dr Jai Prakash, district surveillance officer.In May, at least 1,392 new infections have been confirmed in Badshahpur, 1,552 in Bhangrola, 305 in Kasan, 374 in Farrukhnagar and 281 in Bhorakalan. On the other hand, over 5,521 cases have been reported from urban areas of the new Gurugram under Tigra urban primary health centre until May 9. Likewise, in areas under Chanderlok UPHC, which covers Sushant Lok and adjoining societies, about 4,832 cases have been reported this month, whereas 2,970 cases have been reported in Wazirabad and Sector 56 in nine days of the month, said officials.On Monday, 2,794 cases were reported in the district, taking the total count of active cases to 33,185. As many as 12 deaths were also reported, taking the toll to 599.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/rural-areas-hit-by-covid-19-positivity-rate-remained-over-21-in-april-101620669559441.html
10-05-2021||Other||Oxygen supply to private hospitals increased||Officials of the health department, as well as hospital administrations, said that the oxygen supply has stabilised in the district, with fewer SOS calls, an increase in oxygen cylinders and reduced waiting time for oxygen beds and cylinder refills pointing to a move in the right direction.The district is receiving nearly 46 metric tonnes (MT) of oxygen at present, against a demand of 60 MT, district administration officials said.Yash Garg, the deputy commissioner of Gurugram, said that they are regularly getting oxygen supply from Rourkela and Angul in Odisha, Bhiwadi in Rajasthan and neighbouring Panipat, following which the situation has stabilised. “We are getting nearly 46 MT of oxygen every day and we need 60 MT to meet the demand. The process is streamlined and the district administration is monitoring the demand and supply directly to ensure families (of Covid-19 patients) do not have to arrange for oxygen cylinders,” he said.Private hospitals that were receiving five to 10 cylinders earlier are now getting as many as 50 cylinders, as they no longer have to shuttle between different plants to get oxygen.Dipankar Sethi, general manager (operations) of Sethi Hospital in Model Town, said that they are receiving at least 19 oxygen cylinders per day and the supply is regular. “Earlier, we hardly used to get six cylinders and were facing challenges to admit Covid-19 patients. Now, with the regular supply, the staff are focussing more on the Covid ward and only one vehicle is used to get supply from the designated station,” he said.The queue at all refilling station has also been streamlined and the stations are divided between the hospitals to avoid confusions.SP Yadav, the managing director of Pushpanjali Hospital in Civil Lines, said that their quota has been increased to 50 cylinders a day. “We have 31 Covid beds and are getting regular oxygen supply. The families do not have to struggle to arrange for the same,” he said.Garg said that the demand is rising exponentially as the number of serious patients is also rising. “We are distributing as per the demand and also to ensure there is no distress situation at any hospital. In case of any emergency, we have directed the hospitals to get in touch with me so that oxygen can be sent to them without any delay,” he said.Anil Khatana, the head of operations at W Pratiksha Hospital in Sector 56, said that they have 37 Covid beds and hardly used to get 20 oxygen cylinders earlier but the same has now increased to 100. “The district administration increased our quota to 100 on Monday. More than three vehicles used to run to different locations to get oxygen and used to wait for more than seven hours to get them refilled. Now, we get supply from only one station and there is no waiting period also. We also used to ask patients to arrange for cylinders, which is no more the case,” he said.The regional transport authority, in a bid to streamline oxygen supply in the district, converted 12 nitrogen and argon tankers into oxygen tankers to enable transportation of oxygen from two plants in Odisha.Officials said that the increased supply of oxygen over the past two days has helped in reducing the number of distress calls from hospitals.Dr Prithvi Raj Aryan, the director of Aryan Hospital on Old Railway Road, there are nearly 80 Covid patients admitted to the hospital, for whom they are getting 70 oxygen cylinders every day. “The refilling stations which were demanding exorbitant rates are controlled by the district administration and now, there is no struggle to get cylinders refilled. The staff which was busy getting oxygen waiting in long queues are now taking care of Covid-19 patients and regularly updating district administration regarding the oxygen supply,” he said.Garg appealed to hospitals not getting a regular oxygen supply to contact him for a quick resolution of the issue.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/oxygen-supply-to-private-hospitals-increased-101620669560017.html

Officials said that wedding processions, including baraat, are banned and ceremonies should be held only at homes or in courts.Besides the additional restrictions, the state administration, this time, has allowed tree cutting operations of the forest department and Haryana Forest Development Corporation during the lockdown for meeting fuelwood requirement of the municipal corporations and district administrations.“The extended lockdown period will be observed as Mahamari Alert- Surakshit Haryana in compliance with the state government’s directive. Covid-19 cases in the district will start plateauing after May 13 as the impact of lockdown could be seen in Delhi-NCR now,” said Yash Garg, the deputy commissioner of Gurugram.With Gurugram likely to reach its second Covid-19 wave peak before May 15, Garg said that the ongoing lockdown from May 3 has already started showing its impact.On May 9, Haryana chief secretary Vijay Vardhan issued an order on the extension of restrictions, which was imposed from May 3 till May 10, after the state home minister Anil Vij had tweeted: “Mahamari Alert / Surkshit Haryana announced from 10 May to 17 May. Stringent measures will be taken to contain the spread of Corona in Haryana”.Under the previous lockdown, wedding functions could be conducted with a ceiling of 30 persons in indoor spaces and 50 persons in open spaces, if granted permissions by the district administration. Even for funerals and cremation, at least 20 people were allowed. However, officials said that the cap was decreased for stricter enforcement of safety protocols.As per the current lockdown regulations, all educational, training and coaching institutions, cinema halls, malls, shopping complexes, gyms and religious places will continue to remain shut.No restriction has been imposed on the movement of domestic helps, cooks, drivers, nurses, medical attendees and caregivers to senior citizens and specially-abled persons.Hotels and restaurants including those within malls will remain open only for home deliveries and takeaways until 10m. Roadside dhabas and food stalls have been allowed to provide parcels for takeaway and delivery services.Movement of private vehicles will be allowed only for emergency services vaccinations, hospital visits, veterinary care and getting essential commodities.Passengers returning from airports, and railway and bus stations are also allowed to move.

While the second dose of Covishield is to be taken within four to eight weeks of the first jab, the interval for Covaxin is four to six weeks.However, due to the non-availability of doses, especially of Covaxin, many beneficiaries are unable to book an online slot or are being sent back from government vaccination centres without getting the second jab, according to ground reports from many parts of the state.“More than 200 eligible teachers and staff members of our school were administered Covaxin in March and April, but many are still awaiting their second dose,” says Sukhpreet Kaur, who teaches at a private school in Amritsar. Kaur says she is trying to book a slot for the second dose, which is due for the past two weeks, but no slot for Covaxin is available for the next seven days at any of the hospitals in Amritsar. “I also visited the civil hospital, but to no avail,” she says.In Ludhiana, Kiran Malik, 67, who got her first Covishield dose on April 14, has been unsuccessfully trying to book a slot for the second shot on May 26. “At a time when it is so risky to step out of our houses, how can the authorities expect us to visit the centres and try our luck with on-the-spot registrations,” says her husband, BL Malik. A 73-year-old woman from Amritsar, who is not willing to be named, claims she visited the local civil hospital twice, but failed to get the second Covishield dose that is due for the past three weeks. “I took my first dose in the second week of March. I have visited the civil hospital for my second dose twice, but due to limited stock of vaccines, I didn’t get the jab,” she says, while adding that instead of extending the drive to others, the first preference should be given to beneficiaries eligible for the second dose. Only 1.64 lakh got second dose in past week In the past one week, only 1.64 lakh people have been administered the second dose in Punjab, as compared to 2.44 lakh who got their first shot.In all, around 6 lakh people have completed their vaccination cycle, which is just 18% of the people inoculated with at least one dose. Among these 6 lakh people who have received both the doses, 2.25 lakh are health care and frontline warriors while 3.75 lakh are other citizens in the 45+ age group.Dr Puneet Juneja, district nodal officer, vaccines, Ludhiana, said that due to limited stock, the department is not scheduling online appointments. “We release a list of centres where residents can get vaccinated daily,” he said.Though claiming that many people, especially frontline workers, are willingly skipping the second shot, Dr Rajesh Bhaskar, state nodal officer for Covid-19, admitted that the second dose of vaccine, especially Covaxin, is being delayed due to limited stock.”The vaccination drive in Punjab picked up the pace in April, after it was opened for all people above 45 years of age. So far, the state health department has administered 2.34 lakh doses of Covaxin, but we have received only 75,000 doses for the second shot, which are insufficient,” he said, while adding that around 15 lakh beneficiaries will get eligible for their second dose, of both the vaccines, in Punjab by May 31.

10-05-2021||Gurugram||Ventilator beds increased in city hospitals||Officials said that the number of ventilator beds in private hospitals has increased after pending orders were supplied this month. At least 20 of the 43 Covid-19 hospitals HT spoke to on Monday confirmed that they have increased the number of ventilators beds, by 280 in total at the 20 facilities.Yash Garg, the deputy commissioner of Gurugram, said that private hospitals are increasing ventilator beds as the number of patients has increased following the Covid-19 surge. “Critical patients need immediate medical support systems to prevent fatalities. This is a medical emergency and private hospitals should increase the capacity of ICU or ventilator beds,” he said.Garg said that nine new ventilators and life support systems were installed in government hospitals, including four ventilators at Civil Hospital in Sector 10.Garg said that at least 10% of all hospital beds must be equipped with ventilators. “The demand is increasing with the number of cases and the situation will improve within a week as more and more hospitals are procuring ventilators,” he said.At present, only 2% of the total beds have ventilator facilities, officials of the health department said. At present, there are around 350 ventilator beds in the district.A ventilator is a life-support apparatus that breathes for a patient who is physically unable to breathe or is breathing insufficiently. Private hospitals charge ₹20,000 to ₹40,000 per day for a ventilator.Anil Khatana, the head of operations at W Pratiksha Hospital in Sector 56, said they only had one ventilator bed for Covid patients earlier, which has been increased to five at present, with four more in the pipeline. “The price of a ventilator has increased from ₹4.5 lakh to ₹9 lakh in the last two months. The number of patients is increasing and ventilators are required,” he said.“We have already increased our ICU bed capacity, added more ventilators and are trying to procure more. We see admissions are predominantly for ICU beds now,” said Dr Anjali Kaul, medical superintendent of Artemis Hospitals.Dr Subhash Khanna of Kalyani Hospital in Sector 14 said that they are increasing ventilator beds as critical patients are not finding beds in other hospitals. “Many families have to shift them to Delhi or nearby districts risking their lives without a life support system. We are increasing five more ventilator beds, but are waiting for the nursing staff. The hospitals have to increase the numbers of ventilators for serious patients to save their lives,” he said.Dr Vikram Singh, director of Aarvy Hospital, said that at their two hospitals, the number of ventilators has been increased from 15 to 55 over 10 days. “We have demanded 20 more as the number of critical care patients is increasing and shifting a patient from one hospital to another is risking their lives. Many patients have died in this process, so we decided to increase the number of ventilators,” he said.Amit Bhura, the facility director of Narayana Superspeciality Hospital, said that to help save more lives and be able to better serve the patients, they have added six more ventilators. “Now, we have 16 ventilators in total to treat patients from Delhi-NCR,” he said.Many people lost their relatives and loved ones due to the non-availability of ventilators. Families find it difficult to even shift patients in critical condition.Kriti Parmar, a resident of Sector 31, said she lost her mother last week as she could not get a ventilator bed in any of the hospitals. “We were told that demands have been sent, but they were awaiting the consignment for ventilators. We tried in six hospitals but could not get a bed anywhere. Doctors said she could survive only on ventilator support but unfortunately, we didn’t get any,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/ventilator-beds-increased-in-city-hospitals-101620669501242.html

The move came at a meeting chaired by chief minister Naveen Patnaik.During the meeting, it was also decided to form a technical team for swift procurement of vaccines and vaccination.Odisha is seeking to import vaccines to vaccinate its people in the 18-44 age group. Currently, the state is getting Covishield and Covaxin vaccine produced by the Serum Institute of India and Bharat Biotech respectively.The state expects to get the Sputnik V vaccine, with an efficacy of 91 per cent, that was invented by Russia’s Gamaleya Research Institute of Epidemiology and Microbiology. Sputnik V recently got central approval for production and use in India.The government’s decision to float global tender came as the vaccination drive has slowed down due to a poor supply of vaccines. On Monday, several senior citizens in districts like Balasore, Keonjhar and Bhadrak, who had come to a vaccination centre to take the second dose, staged dharna protesting the unavailability of the Covid-19 vaccine.The beneficiaries alleged that they have been visiting the centre every other day for the second jab, but to no avail. So far 62,84,644 doses of Covaxin and Covishield have been given to beneficiaries.In another move to strengthen Odisha’s preparedness to fight the second wave of Covid-19, the Cabinet has also approved amendments in Industrial Policy Resolutions 2015 incentivising the production of medical oxygen in the state. This will offer benefits to those manufacturing medical oxygen and containers.While appreciating the hard work and sacrifices of Covid-19 warriors across the state, the CM expressed heartfelt gratitude to the people for their cooperation in the fight against the pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/odisha-becomes-5th-state-to-float-global-tender-for-covid-19-vaccine-101620668000003.html

10-05-2021||Other||Haryana stops wheat procurement operations||After procuring around 81 lakh MT wheat, government procurement agencies in Haryana have stopped the procurement operations in all 394 mandis in state.As per government, 83.49 lakh MT wheat arrived in the mandis in state and government procurement agencies have procured 80.77 lakh MT wheat.However, there were reports that payments of farmers are pending.Expecting a bumper produce this year, the government had increased procurement target to 80 lakh MT against 74 lakh MT of last year.But the government figures revealed that around 83.50 lakh MT wheat arrived in mandis and around 2.72 lakh MT is still lying unprocured.The procurement operations were stopped on April 30 but the government could not disburse payments of all farmers as only ₹12,977 crore has been paid to farmers and payments of around ₹3,000 crore are still pending. Most pending payments belong to farmers of Uttar Pradesh.Additional chief secretary (food, civil supplies and consumer affairs department) Anurag Rastogi had said that the target of procuring 80 lakh MT wheat was fixed by the Union government but the actual procurement can be less or more than the target.On whether government has any plans to procure more wheat from Haryana as crop is still arriving in mandis and procurement has exceeded the target, he had said that the target does not change.Ground-level mandi officials said that there are no instructions to resume procurement operations so far.On the other hand, farm union leaders and arhtiyas are demanding that government should resume procurement operations to ensure that entire wheat arrived in the mandis can be procured in MSP of ₹1,975 per quintal.As per officials of the food and supplies department, arrival of wheat in some grain markets has reached beyond expectations. In Karnal grain market, around 15 lakh quintal wheat has arrived against 12.40 lakh quintal of last year.Rajnish Chaudhry, president of the association of commission agents in Karnal grain market, said that over 50,000 quintal wheat was of hundreds of farmers not procured by government and they are waiting for government orders so that wheat of all registered farmers can be procured.Haryana BKU president Gurnam Singh Charuni has threatened to hold protests in mandis if the government does not resume procurement in mandis.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/haryana-stops-wheat-procurement-operations-101620664947088.html

10-05-2021||Pune||Ramwadi underpass diversion causing inconvenience to commuters||The Ramwadi underpass was closed by Pune traffic police on April 24, 2021, in anticipation of MahaMetro starting work on construction of six pillars, which is causing problems among residents living in Kalyani Nagar and Viman Nagar, causing them to take longer detours to travel between Koregaon Park and Viman Nagar. “I was going to my doctor for a follow up and we had to go round up, although there is not much traffic, it causes a lot of inconvenience when a person is in a hurry to complete his work and return back home. I am aware of the metro beginning their work on this stretch but with almost 60 per cent of the labourers not there, why close the underpass early,” said Qaneez Sukhrani, Viman Nagar Citizen’s Forum. The forum has also written to DCP traffic and to PMC authorities demanding to open up Ramwadi underpass so that inconvenience is not caused to public. Currently, commuters are subject to a long 7-km detour from Kalyani Nagar to Viman Nagar. They have also suggested that traffic police should not shut down Ramwadi when there is no immediate work from Metro in those areas where the underpass is without work, man and machinery, it is unnecessarily inconveniencing local public and those going to airport. DCP traffic Rahul Shrirame stated that he personally visited the Ramwadi underpass and diversion made for completion of work until October 2021. In a letter, DCP said, “I would like to submit in broad sense of public interest that MahaMetro undergoing construction work from Civil court to Ramwadi work is in progress. Ramwadi underpass is a small narrow path so pillar cannot be installed at the centre of road so pillars are to be constructed at both sides of the narrow underpass road. MahaMetro rail has assured to complete the work in six months so they sought permission for work and diversion of traffic as the underpass road is narrow and cannot run traffic when work is on. Due to the Covid 19 pandemic and lockdown, there is less traffic on the road so instructed the metro to gear up the work. As we do not know till how much time the pandemic will stay, I discussed with metro officials to fasten the work and complete it on time. This decision is taken in public interest and there is no such interest to cause inconvenience to traffic and public. Hence, the decision to close Ramwadi underpass is taken practically considering the less traffic during lockdown along with traffic diversion with utmost convenience for people and traffic.” Ganesh Sonawane from Maha Metro said, “We are working on the stretch from Kalyani Nagar to Viman Nagar and we feel that this is the best period to work as there is less traffic on the road. We are working with 50 percent of the labour force and have brought all the resources to work on this stretch to meet with the deadlines and if possible, finish before the deadline. We are aware that it is causing an inconvenience to the locals at this moment but once this mega project is ready, traffic will be smooth.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/ramwadi-underpass-diversion-causing-inconvenience-to-commuters-101620664578796.html
10-05-2021||Pune||Pune market faces shortage of Konkan Alphonso, traders say price unlikely to come down||The supply of Alphonso mangoes from Konkan has almost been reduced by 40 per cent to 50 per cent this year and the rates are still higher than usual and unlikely to come down, according to traders. According to the APMC officials, currently 2,000-2,500 boxes are coming in daily in the Pune market which is far less than the normal supply during this time of the year. Traders claim that the rates are unlikely to come down as the Devgad mango season will be over in 3-4 weeks and the supply may not improve in the required proportion. From the beginning of this year’s season, the demand has dominated the supply of Ratnagiri mango. “The supply is low, and the rates are still high for a box of mangoes from Konkan. Currently, around 2,000-2,500 boxes are coming in daily in the market. Each year the supply is more than double during this time of year. This year the supply has come down to almost 50 per cent. Akshya Trutiya is delayed almost by a month this year. The chances are less that the supply would increase before Akshay Trutiya. Monday was the day when more boxes were expected as the mangoes require 3-4 days to ripe before they can be consumed,” said Baba Bibawe, head of fruit market department, Market Yard Pune. As the supply is lower than the demand, the rates of mangoes produced in Konkan areas of Ratnagiri and Devgad are still high. “Each year during this season 8,000-10,000 boxes of mangoes from Ratnagiri and Devgad arrived in the market daily. Now, only up to 3,000 boxes are coming into the market. Last year, in this season the cost of one box of 4-7 dozen mangoes was around ₹1,000- ₹1,500. But this year the same box costs around ₹1,500- ₹3,000. Karnataka mango is available in ample quantity, a box of two dozen costs around ₹350 ₹700. Mangoes were expensive during the time of Gudi Padwa. Now, Aksay Trutiya is this week, but the shortage supply and high cost has continued,” said Yuvraj Kachi, mango trader in Market Yard Pune. Vilas Bhujbal, president - Market yard commission agents claimed that the rates are unlikely to go down as the Konkan mango season is coming to an end in next few weeks. “Karnataka mango is available, but the supply is lesser than last year. The rates are unlikely to go down now as the season is coming to an end. The demand is still there, families at least buy one box as per their budget. Currently, hotels, juice centres are closed due to curbs. That’s why, the demand is comparatively less. If these establishments had been open, the demand would have increased exponentially and the rates would have gone much higher than the present rates,” said Bhujbal. The export of mangoes has continued this season. Officials in the Maharashtra State agricultural marketing board said that export in the USA may begin after May 14th. “Last year, the export to America didn’t happen.

10-05-2021||Pune||Despite centralised Remdesivir distribution, cops recover 27 vials from black market||Two separate units of police in Pune district have collectively seized a total of 27 Remdesivir injections that had landed in the black market, within a day. The injections are floating in the clandestine black-market weeks after the district collector’s office centralised the process to regulate the flow of the experimental drug from the manufacturers to the hospitals treating the patients directly through the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). In one raid, the Pimpri-Chinchwad police found 21 vials of the drug, while in the other raid, the Pune rural police found six vials of Remdesivir. The three arrested by officials of Wakad police station of Pimpri-Chinchwad police were identified as Krushna Ramrao Patil (22), a nursing staff member at Crystal Hospital in Thergaon; Nikhil Keshav Neharkar (19), a delivery executive living in Annex Hospital, Chinchwad; and Shashikant Raghunath Panchal (34), a chemist working at Ayushri Medical store in Chinchwad. They were collectively found in possession of 21 vials of the drug and cash, according to the police. Patil and Neharkar were arrested by police at 2:45am on Sunday at a check post along Kalewadi Phata. Two vials of Remdesivir were found in their possession while the permit for sale was absent, according to the police. “After taking them in custody, they revealed that the Remdesivir injections found from them was taken from Ayushri Medical in Chinchwad in order to sell at a price higher than the one prescribed,” read a statement from Pimpri-Chinchwad police. Upon searching Panchal’s Maruti Swift car, the police found a total of 19 more vials. All the vials were of Hetro company. They have been booked under Sections 420 (cheating) and 188 of Indian Penal Code (IPC) along with relevant sections of Drug Price Control Order, 2013; Essential Commodities Act, 1955; and Drug and Cosmetics Act, 1940 registered at Wakad police station. In another incident, the Pune rural police found three men in possession of six Remdesivir and one Actemra (Tocilizubam) injection in Kurkumbh MIDC area in Daund at 2pm on Sunday. The three men were identified as Dattatray Maruti Londhe, Aditya Anirudha Wagh, and Amol Narsingh Munde, according to the police. The three also had cash worth ₹51,500 and were found moving near the gates of a company in the MIDC area on one Activa and one Santro car. A case under relevant sections of IPC and Drugs and Cosmetics Act 1940 was registered against them at Daund police station. As per the district collector’s order, the distribution of Remdesivir has to be done directly to the hospitals. In a nutshell, the seven distributor companies and hospitals in the district have to give their stock availability and requirement numbers to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) officials respectively and the FDA, along with the district collector’s office deconstructs the figures to put the hospitals in touch with the right distributor. However, due to various lacunae, including friction in the procurement process and leak in the hospitals, the vials land up in the black market. “The Pune Municipal Corporation has provided us with a Google form. This form does not ask for the names but the number of patients who require Remdesivir. The information that we fill in the google form goest to the FDA every evening. The information is processed and on a WhatsApp group, a list is published. This list lets us know which distributor has been allocated to us for the drug. We contact the distributor, and the location is decided thereafter,” said Anuradha Temkar, executive assistant of director, Poona Hospital while explaining what the hospitals are required to do. “The process is highly monitored. Hospitals have to register the patients in their hospital who require the injection and submit it to the FDA officials. The district collector’s office along with FDA allocates stock to the hospital. Procurement is done by hospital. Every company gives their list of availability to the district authorities. Every hospital representative comes to the distributor to purchase the stock. It is random allocation as per available stock with stockists in particular region,” said Nilesh Amritkar, Shloka Enterprises, Sadashiv peth who is a distributor for Jubilliant. While the process has reduced the struggle for patients at major hospitals, the fear instilled by unavailability by the hospital forces relatives of patients to explore the black market to save their loved ones.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/despite-centralised-remdesivir-distribution-cops-recover-27-vials-from-black-market-101620664338786.html

In the Remdesivir distribution order issued on Monday from the collector’s office, hospitals are specifically asked not to handover Remdesivir prescription to relatives. The order states that because of these prescriptions, black marketing of Remdesivir has been taking place. From April 11, the retail sale of Remdesivir was banned in Pune district and the Remdesivir injections have been distributed in a centralised control room established in the Pune collector’s office. The district administration warned Covid hospitals that if they continue to handout Remdesivir prescriptions to relatives, the supply of Remdesivir from the collector’s office will be stopped the concerned hospital. The same warning had been tendered in the order issued on Saturday. On Monday, 7,740 Remdisevir injections were distributed among 624 hospitals in Pune district. Currently, in order to procure Remdesivir, hospitals need to place an order with the control room in the collector’s office. Then as per availability and the proportion of oxygen beds, the vials of this anti-viral drug are allotted to the hospital. But there have been instances where hospitals are still handing out prescriptions to the relatives and they had to go in search of the injections. Hospitals are also asked to use this drug judiciously and keeping the guidelines issued by the task force in mind. “From April 11, Remdesivir has been made available directly to the hospitals by the collector’s office. Remdesivir is not available at chemist shops as hospitals are still handing out Remdesivir prescription to relatives, the black marketing of this drug is encouraged. Hospitals should not give Remdesivir prescriptions to relatives to get the drug otherwise the supply to such hospitals will be stopped,” the order stated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/dont-hand-out-remdesivir-prescriptions-to-patients-or-relatives-dist-admin-to-hospitals-101620664278705.html
10-05-2021||Pune||SCERT surveys students for decision on CET exam for FYJC admission||After the state education department cancelled Class 10 exams due to the rising cases of Covid-19, questions have been raised by parents, students on the structure of Class 11 admissions. In an attempt to find a solution, the state education department with the help of the State Council of Educational Research and Training (SCERT), Pune is conducting an online survey, through which all Class 10 students are asked their opinion about holding a Common Entrance Test (CET) for First Year Junior College (FYJC) Class 11 admissions. Earlier the deadline to submit this online survey form was until Sunday which has now been extended until May 11. This survey is for students from all boards including the state, CBSE and CICE where they need to give answers to simple questions and their opinion on whether CET should be held or not. The state education department has given a link of the online form for the survey: https://www.research.net/r/11thCETEST. While only students are allowed to participate in it, school administrations have been asked to send out the survey link to maximum students. “It is a simple survey to be done by students of Class 10 from all the boards. The link has been sent on our official website and its deadline has been increased until May 11. Till now we are getting a very good response from students and over 2 lakh students have submitted their response. We appeal to all the Class 10 students to please give their valuable opinion which will help us to take further important decisions regarding conducting CET,” said Vikas Garad, SCERT deputy director. While students have welcomed this move, Siddhant Miraje a class 10 student said, “We are happy that the state government cancelled the examinations in such tough times and now are asking students’ opinion to conduct CET exams. In my view CET should be taken so that students will get proper marks through which admission can be given to them.” The proposed CET exam will be held around in the month of June or when the Covid cases decrease in the state. It will be a multiple-choice questions (MCQ) test and students will be provided optical mark recognition (OMR) sheets for answering them. There will only be one paper with 100 marks with questions from all subjects and two-hour duration to complete it. Those students who clear this CET exam will get the Class 11 admissions as per their performance. Rajendra Zunjarrao, principal, Modern College of Arts Science and Commerce, Shivajinagar said, “This year’s Class 11 admissions are going to be tough, but it is good that the state education department is thinking about CET exam. It will help the college administration to fill up the seats and there will be proper allocation of seats as per the performance of students in the CET exam.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/scert-surveys-students-for-decision-on-cet-exam-for-fyjc-admission-101620664218840.html

He was 90 years old and is survived by his wife, three children and their families. Kakade, the last of socialist leaders from the city, represented Baramati Lok Sabha seat, which is currently the stronghold of Sharad Pawar family. During his active days in politics, Kakade was known as an arch-rival of NCP president Sharad Pawar. Known as Lalasaheb in social and political circles, Kakade was elected to the Lok Sabha from Baramati in 1977 and 1984 as a Janata Party candidate. Expressing grief, NCP chief Sharad Pawar said Baramati had lost a strong political personality. “He was the veteran leader of Janata Dal and put a great impact on the state’s politics. He worked towards giving direction to the new leadership,” Pawar tweeted. During 2004 Lok Sabha elections, Kakade had withdrawn from the race from Baramati after Pawar announced his illness in the middle of the campaign heat. “Kakade had issued a statement to the effect, saying he was withdrawing from the poll race in support of Pawar who was suffering from a serious disease,” he said. He also worked with contemporaries like S M Joshi, Mohan Dhariya and Nanasaheb Gore Kakade defeated congress stalwart Vithalrao Gadil in 1977 Lok Sabha polls, which happened after emergency was lifted. During 1984 by polls, he won from Baramati when Pawar extended his support. Kakade’s nephew Viraj had also once contested from Baramati but lost the election.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/former-mp-shambhajirao-kakde-dies-at-90-101620663618684.html

MSiNS have categorised incubators in three categories based on the work and progress so far namely beginners, emerging and leaders. In a very short time, the centre has created a mark for itself, which will now open opportunities for start-ups to get funds as ‘seed capital funding’ through MSIS funding. Set up in 2018, the Centre for Innovation, Incubation and Linkages (CIIL) has been working very closely with start-ups in and around Pune and has quickly scaled up with many innovative start-ups, a sizable number of mentors and a very modern incubation centre.\ The assessment was based on the large number of activities done by the centre to spot the right kind of start-ups, engagement with various colleges from the affiliating system with more than 275 colleges attached to the university through this, support through funding of patents, large scale ongoing events and meaningful partnerships with the likes of Entrepreneurship Institute of India (EDII), Ahmedabad, PCSIC (Pimpri-Chinchwad Start-up Innovation Cell), TiE Pune to name a few. Few of the start-ups here have also received funding from external sources and have received many laurels byways of prizes from IIM-C, IIM Udaipur, and IIT-B. Dr Apoorva Palkar, director, CIIL-SPPU said, “This recognition is really helpful for new incubators like us who are working hard to make a mark by spotting grass root innovators and providing them a platform through incubation centre, providing advisory, mentorship and handholding at the most crucial juncture of their venture,” “The centre today has more than 40 start-up companies engaged with us that are nurtured through SPPU- research park foundation and the next cohort training of 60 start-up companies is underway through the virtual mode,” she added. SPPU vice-chancellor Nitin Karmalkar said, “SPPU has focused on innovation, start-ups through systematic work that has resulted in our progression in the direction of job givers than job seekers. This recognition is a baby step, and we shall strive towards innovation excellence.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/sppus-centre-for-innovation-gets-leader-status-by-msis-101620663558740.html

The underlying basis of the Motor Vehicles Act is to ensure that lives are saved on the road, however, with the usage of the same cameras, crucial time is being wasted on the roads, it said.The Bench of Justice DN Patel and Justice Jasmeet Singh is scheduled to hear the PIL on Tuesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/plea-in-delhi-hc-seeks-suspension-of-challans-by-red-light-violation-cameras-during-covid-19-pandemic-101620659845393.html
10-05-2021||Delhi||Exams cancel? High-schoolers come to Covid patients’ rescue||Suffering inspires compassion. Proving this are school going youngsters, who have been led by the Covid-19 crisis to find an opportunity to utilise their time and energy to serve the humanity in this grim situation caused by the pandemic. Amid the second wave of Corona, as exams of most high school students stand either postponed or cancelled, they have taken to saving lives by providing verified leads to those looking for oxygen cylinders, plasma donors, ICU beds, etc. From saving lives of their relatives, to supporting strangers, these youngsters are doing it all and shining bright while they provide a glimmer of hope to the city residents. “I was casually talking to my cousin when she told me about how her friend’s mother needed plasma. I was moved by her condition and really wanted to help, so I started digging up resources and making phone calls,” says Ananya Sharma, a class XII student of a Ghaziabad-based school, adding, “The next day, I saw an Instagram story of a girl looking for an ICU bed for her grandfather. Luckily, I was able to help her too, and felt magical after that! One thing led to another until volunteering became a full-time thing. Eventually, I joined a lot of WhatsApp groups through which I got connected to more volunteers. People posted their requirements on these groups, and the rest looked up resources for them. That’s what I’ve been up to. And due to social media platforms getting flooded with phone numbers, we divide the work among ourselves, to work more efficiently.” With eyes that shine with the dream of seeing a pandemic free world, these youngsters are driven to save every life they can. “I got inspired by a DU student who was saving lives amid the pandemic and decided to help too,” says 16-year-old Bhumik Dirolia, a student of a Haryana-based school, adding, “An 11-year-old boy from Hisar came to meet me after I saved his father’s life, and this was the best feeling ever! Ek insaan dusre insaan ki madad nahi karega to kaun karega? So far I’ve helped 500 people, but out of those I’ve saved approximately 100 and belive that I saved 1,000 lives because every person has 10 family members behind them. Now I’ve set a goal to help 10,000 people. When I had started helping people, I initially got 20-30 calls. But straight from day two, I got 50-60 calls and currently I get 200 calls per day. I verify each and every lead by calling them up, whether it’s 20 or 200, I verify them all and then only share them with the patient or their relatives. Just yesterday I verified 400-500 leads personally by calling each one up, and I’ve been helping people all over the country and not just those in Delhi-NCR. I have also donated a part of my pocket money to the needy, to help provide them ventilators, oxygen, and medicines etc... I want to set an example to the youth of my age that we all can make a corona free India! If only 1,35,000 people out of the country’s population work everyday on helping 10,000 people in a month, it will help all the 135 crore people of IndiaAnd these youngsters even know the significance of a heartfelt conversation, and how it can make a difference in the lives of people struggling due to Covid. “A lot of my friends who were Covid positive needed someone to talk to, and I was there for them. I helped ease their fears, and even read them stories on the phone... Whatever pocket money my parents give me, I donated all of it to the foundations that have been helping Covid patients with oxygen cylinders. Though I can’t go out of my house, but I ensured that I’m able to help in whatever capacity I can, as there’s not much to study right now since exams have been postpones. So I used the time to help those who I know were infected, by verifying leads for their relatives who were running out of time to make so many calls. Now, I’m looking forward to getting vaccinated when it’s my turn,” says Nikhil Kumar, a class XII student at a public school in Delhi.Author tweets @FizzyBuddhaFollow more stories on Facebook and Twitter||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/exams-cancel-high-schoolers-come-to-covid-patients-rescue-101620660501709.html

The announcement came after the state received 2.40 lakh doses of the two vaccines, Covishield and Covaxin, against its purchase orders placed with the two approved manufacturers--Serum Institute of India and Bharat Biotech, respectively. “Against our purchase orders, we have so far received a total of 2.40 lakh doses of Covishield and Covaxin. We are going to kick start the free inoculation drive for 18-44 age group from May 14,” state health department’s principal secretary Arun Kumar Singh said.The third phase of the nationwide inoculation drive for the aforementioned age group was earlier scheduled to begin on May 1. However, it could not be started in Jharkhand, as the Centre disallowed all states from using the existing doses in their stock for inoculating the 18-44 age group.The Centre, last month, said that the vaccines sent to states earlier were meant for only people above the age of 45 and other priority groups.It then asked the states to purchase the vaccine doses on their own directly from manufacturers to inoculate the younger age group. Following this, the state health department issued purchase orders (PO) to both companies, demanding 25 lakh doses from each of them.According to sources, against the new PO, the state received 134,400 doses of Covaxin and 100,000 doses of Covishield. It was likely to get another consignment of 287,000 doses of Covishield by the end of this week.However, the number of doses received by the state so far was very less, and if the supply chain is not maintained, the inoculation drive will likely come to a halt.When asked about any special preparations being made to carry out a smooth vaccination drive for the third phase, the health secretary refused to divulge details. The 18-44 age group constitutes around 48% of the state’s population. According to an estimate of the health department, the state has around 16 million people in this group, for which it requires 32 million doses of the vaccine.With only 2.40 lakh doses at its disposal, the department will require to meticulously plan division of vaccines among the 24 districts in order to keep the vaccination drive going. If calculated, each of the 24 districts will likely get an average of 10,000 doses only.Chief minister Hemant Soren announced to provide free vaccination to all eligible citizens between 18-44 years of age. Jharkhand till May 9 inoculated 2,731,546 beneficiaries, including health care workers (HCW), frontline workers (FLW) and citizens aged over 45 with the first dose of Covid-19 vaccine. As many as 585,950 of them have also taken the second dose. This accounts for around 8.30% vaccination coverage against the state’s 32.9 million population.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ranchi-news/1844-group-to-get-the-jab-from-may-14-101620659418483.html

The RJD chief has spent nearly 40 months in jail after his conviction in fodder scam cases. In his statement, Prasad said the onus to get every eligible citizen get vaccinated free of cost in a phased manner rested on the central government and cited the example of polio vaccination undertaken during the sting of HD Deve Gowda as the prime minister.“At the time when the country lacked facility and sensitization for healthcare, around 12.73 crore children were administered polio vaccine in a single-day drive on January 8, 1997. This is still a world record. On December 7, 1996, as many as 1.74 crore children were offered polio drops,” claimed Prasad.The then JD-led government had confronted a lot of difficulties in convincing the people to go for vaccination, who had many misconceptions. “But the government overcame all the obstacles with its firm determination. It is unfortunate that the present government being led by a leader having reputation as Vishwaguru is unable to arrange the required number of vaccines even after charging the common people for the jabs,” said Prasad.Earlier, on Sunday, Prasad held a virtual meeting with party leaders from his daughter Rajya Sabha MP Misa Bharti’s residence and urged them to set up Covid care centres in their respective areas of influence and help people fight the pandemic.The party leaders were also urged to “expose and thwart” any instances of black marketing of oxygen cylinders and other important medicines, and help needy patients with food and other logistics like ambulances.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/give-free-vaccination-to-all-against-covid-lalu-tells-pm-101620658998428.html

10-05-2021||Kolkata||Ex-TMC minister Suvendu Adhikari becomes leader of the opposition in Bengal||After serving in chief minister Mamata Banerjee’s cabinet, Suvendu Adhikari, who joined the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in December last year and defeated her at Nandigram in East Midnapore district in the recent state polls, on Monday emerged as the leader of the opposition at the state assembly. “As the leader of the opposition, my priority will be to carry out a movement to free Bengal of political violence and establish a parliamentary democracy. The killings and arson must stop,” said Adhikari. The Trinamool Congress (TMC) routed the opposition by winning 213 seats but Adhikari made news by defeating Banerjee by around 1,900 votes. Challenging the result, the TMC demanded recounting of votes but the Election Commission (EC) turned it down. Adhikari, who underwent training at Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) camps in his youth, started his career as a youth Congress leader before joining the TMC under the guidance of his father Sisir Adhikari, the TMC’s Contai Lok Sabha member who joined the BJP recently. BJP national vice-president Mukul Roy, one of the founding members of the TMC and now a BJP national vice-president, proposed Adhikari’s name for the post of leader of the opposition when the BJP’s newly-elected legislators met at the party’s election office at Hastings in south Kolkata on Monday afternoon. Of the 77 BJP MLAs, 52 were present at the meeting while the rest were in their constituencies in the districts.  <blockquote class=”twitter-tweet”><p lang=”hi” dir=”ltr”>पश्चिम बंगाल में श्री <a href=”https://twitter.com/SuvenduWB?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw”>@SuvenduWB</a> जी को विधानसभा में प्रतिपक्ष का नेता चुने जाने पर हार्दिक शुभकामनाएं।<br>मुझे पूर्ण विश्वास है कि आप के नेतृत्व में <a href=”https://twitter.com/BJP4Bengal?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw”>@BJP4Bengal</a> विपक्ष की जिम्मेदारी को पूरी मजबूती के साथ निभाएगी और प्रदेश की जनता के लिए न्याय और अधिकार प्राप्त करने का माध्यम बनेगी।</p>&mdash; Jagat Prakash Nadda (@JPNadda) <a href=”https://twitter.com/JPNadda/status/1391757072316784640?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw”>May 10, 2021</a></blockquote> <script async src=”https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js” charset=”utf-8”></script>Since Roy is senior to Adhikari and he won the polls from Krishnanagar in Nadia district, many leaders in the party thought he would be elected leader of the opposition. While arriving for the meeting, Roy brushed aside the speculations, saying, “I am too old.”“Twenty-two MLAs supported Suvendu Adhikari’s nomination. I asked the others if they wanted to propose any other name. Since there was no other nomination, Adhikari was unanimously elected leader of the BJP’s legislative party in the West Bengal assembly,” announced Union law minister Ravi Shankar Prasad, who, along with the BJP’s central election observers, attended the meeting. Manoj Tigga, who won the Natabari seat in north Bengal for the second time, was elected the BJP’s chief whip in the assembly. Asked why only 22 of the 52 BJP MLAs supported Adhikari’s nomination, BJP state president Dilip Ghosh said, “He was unanimously elected. Even those who are the districts told us that they would accept the party’s decision.” Adding to this, Adhikari said, “The fact that no other name was proposed means the decision was unanimous. All wings of the BJP and people supported the nomination.”TMC leaders did not want to comment on one of their former colleagues becoming the leader of the opposition.Kolkata-based political science professor and poll analyst Udayan Bandopadhyay said, “Adhikari joined the BJP five months ago. His becoming leader of the opposition may demoralise many leaders who worked hard for years and helped the saffron camp grow in Bengal.”Adhikari became a legislator for the first time in 2006 and was later elected to the Lok Sabha. He was also made president of the TMC’s youth wing but Banerjee’s nephew Abhishek Banerjee replaced him in 2014. His younger brother Dibyendu Adhikari is the TMC’s Lok Sabha member from Tamluk. The youngest sibling, Soumendu, headed the Contai civic body before joining the saffron camp in January.Polls were held in 292 of Bengal’s 294 assembly seats. Polls at two seats in the Murshidabad district will be held later as two opposition party candidates died of Covid-19 during the unprecedented eight-phase polling held between March 27 and April 29.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/extmc-minister-suvendu-adhikari-becomes-leader-of-the-opposition-in-bengal-101620658519464.html

Chief secretary Vini Mahajan disclosed this after a meeting of the steering-cum-monitoring committee of the midday meal scheme on Monday. The additional funds, according to the chief secretary, were needed as the state-run schools registered a sizeable increase in enrolment during the current academic session.

A police team led by inspector Parkash Singh was enforcing the administration’s left-right formula for opening shops in the market when the incident took place. On Monday, the administration had allowed only those shops that are situated on the left side in the market to open. Police said the trader, identified as Raghav, had violated the norms by opening his shop, which is on the right side. They said a meeting was also held with the shopkeepers on Sunday to make them aware of the guidelines.Closed circuit television footage shows two cops standing outside Raghav’s cloth shop. First, they manhandle his worker and then slap him after he comes out with folded hands.“I had opened my shop to file my returns, as it was the last day,” said Raghav, adding that senior police officials have assured him that appropriate action will be taken against the erring cops.Varun Bhatia, another shopkeeper in the market, said: “Raghav was confused over the left-right formula. We are not criminals. If any rule was flouted, action should be taken as per the law. How can police thrash any shopkeeper like this? We are already suffering due to the pandemic.”Assistant commissioner of police (central) Parvesh Chopra confirmed that the incident involves inspector Parkash Singh. “I have myself apologised to the shopkeeper.

10-05-2021||Kolkata||Durga idol makers in Kolkata's Kumartuli anxious about business in second Covid-hit year||The second wave of coronavirus has made the artisans of Kumartuli, the famed colony of clay modellers in north Kolkata, anxious if they are facing the same scenario of last year when Dura Puja organisers ordered smaller, less priced idols to suit their reduced budget induced by the pandemic. Kumartuli supplies idols of gods and goddesses to various parts of the country and abroad and the artisans earn the most during the Durga Puja, the largest festival of West Bengal.The modellers said they are also worried that the already dwindling number of their workers may further go down as the apprehension of a total lockdown from mid-May is gaining ground in the neighbourhood where many people have been affected by Covid-19."Most of the well-known artists of Kumartuli have got a few orders (of Durga idol) before the sudden rise in cases and various restrictions were imposed," Sujit Pal, one of the leading clay modellers in the potter's colony, told PTI.The West Bengal government has ordered the closure of shopping complexes, cinema halls, restaurants, bars, sports complexes, and allowed shops and markets to operate for reduced hours to check the spread of the infection.Pal received two bookings for Durga idols one from a community puja organiser which is celebrating its golden jubilee this year and the other from a family in late March when the Covid situation was not so alarming in the state.He said that they do not want to press the panic button yet as less than 10 per cent of total orders are booked during the Bengali months of Chaitra and Baisakh from mid- March to mid-May."But the sudden spike in Covid-19 cases and the intensity of the second wave are causing anxiety among us. How long will this last? Will there be a third wave as predicted? Pal said.The Durga Puja festival will be held in October this year.He said that a number of cases of infection were reported in the neighbouring pockets of Kumartuli, though the colony was not much affected as yet.The apprehension of a total lockdown after May 15 has made the 100-odd workers currently employed in the workshops scared "and they are planning to leave for their homes in districts", the artist said. Even this workforce is very less as Kumartuli employs at least six-seven times more people in this time of the year when idols of other goddesses are made."Work on all these idols will come to a halt if we don't have labourers," Pal said. Each modeller received orders for one or two idols of goddess Shitala and Raksha Kali, the pujas of whom are held in summer, instead of four-five in other years.The artists of Kumartuli wait for the Rathyatra days in July when booking for Durga idols starts frenetically.However, in 2020 when the Covid-19 and the lockdown triggered a decline in the booking of Durga idols till September, many organisers settled for smaller idols of 6-7 feet height instead of the average 12-13 feet because they were less priced, Pal said.The budget of big-ticket Durga Pujas took a hard knock due to the economic impact of the Covid-19 outbreak last year as sponsorship by corporate advertisers was reduced, leading to scaling down of the grandeur."They (organisers) had also opted for low-height traditional ekchala idols which cost less. However, as the situation eased after the Durga Puja, the order for Kali or Jagaddhatri idols went up," he said.Artisan Chaina Pal, one of the prominent women involved in the trade in Kumartuli, said that the situation was very encouraging before the Saraswati puja in February this year "as people thought coronavirus has gone will not return".However, she is keeping her fingers crossed. "I am sure orders (for Durga idols) will start pouring in from July and we can see a spurt in demand from September."Chaina Pal has received bookings for three Durga idols, all household pujas, and the number is not less in comparison to the corresponding period of 2019."My workers are at my studio and the initial work of creating the idols has completed," she said.Another modeller Prodyut Pal said there has been no booking, not even from overseas, and work has stopped in many studios including his."The money at the hands of us, from the earnings last year, has kept us going till now. We don't know what lies in future," he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/durga-idol-makers-in-kolkata-s-kumartuli-anxious-about-business-in-second-covid-hit-year-101620655361976.html

Every person should strictly abide by the Covid-19 protocols, and behave like a lockdown was in force across the state," she insisted.Banerjee further said that a negative RT-PCR test will be made mandatory for all those coming to West Bengal from outside, even if they fly to the state via helicopters or special flights.Asking media persons to refrain from causing panic among people, the CM further said that a Pandemic Act will be enforced soon to deal with such issues.Banerjee thanked common people and corporate houses for providing valuable aid to the state government for boosting its healthcare infrastructure.She requested them to continue backing the administration financially for purchase of requisite vaccines, assuring that there will be an audit of all expenditure made with the money.The CM iterated that the Centre should do away with GST on any initiative to build health infrastructure amid the pandemic so that more number of corporate entities can come forward to provide assistance."As the central government is not providing any financial aid, we can strengthen healthcare infrastructure and buy vaccines with the support rendered by corporate entities and other residents."Bengal needs 550 metric tonne oxygen, but the Centre has allotted it a little over 300 metric tonne," she claimed.Claiming that the Centre has reportedly exported 65 per cent of vaccines produced in the country, she said, "I ask the Union government to mull over its options and source more vaccines, if necessary from foreign countries."The CM stated that the cabinet has formed a committee comprising chief secretary and other top officials of home, finance and health departments to address gaps in critical infrastructure."This committee will look into implementation of promises made to the people after the Covid-19 situation is brought under control," she said.Talking about the allegations made in reference to post-poll violence in Bengal, the chief minister claimed that the BJP's IT cell was spreading rumours with fake videos."People have given their verdict (in the recently concluded election) for peace and unity. We will not tolerate any violence," she underlined."Barring one incident in Sitalkuchi (CISF firing), there has been no genocide in West Bengal. A government has taken charge in Bengal following a landslide victory, why should a central team be sent within 24 hours after the new dispensation took over?" she stated, lashing out at the Ministry of Home Affairs that sent a four-member group to find out reasons for post-poll violence in the state.Accusing the central team of adopting a "partisan attitude", the chief minister said that the team was only visiting the houses of BJP workers."Half of those killed are from our party, we have declared relief (of ₹2 lakh) for all, no matter which party they belong to, including the BJP," she added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/covid19-in-bengal-strict-measures-taken-to-control-spread-of-virus-says-cm-101620654438596.html

I took a break from acting to start my casting agency to help youngsters and ensure that they don’t face the same struggle that I went through after I came from UP to join the industry. Seeing today’s state of affairs, finally many more have started to understand the real meaning of love and support,” said the actor.Known for shows like ‘Maharana Pratap,’ ‘Samrat Ashok’ and ‘Yeh Rishte Kya Kehlata Hain,’ and with a career spanning almost a decade, the Prayagraj-lad wishes to go back to acting soon. Talking about his work, Sanjay said, “I am a trained singer and reached Mumbai to take up singing but landed into acting. My first break was with the show ‘Maharana…’ followed by many more till 2017 before embarking the journey of a casting director.” Sanjay began his casting journey with the show ‘Khidki’. “Since then, I have done casting for shows like ‘Kkundali Bhagya’, ‘Meri Durga’, ‘Chandra Kantha’, ‘Aladdin’ and was working on casting of a number other shows and films when this pandemic struck in 2020. Though we all are trying to keep the work rolling and having virtual meeting almost every day but still uncertainty looms over us and when will the normalcy be restored — none of us have an idea,’ said Sanjay who is working on casting of the film ‘Welcome to Bajrangpur.’||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/we-should-realise-the-importance-of-helping-each-other-sanjay-101620654438891.html

Of the 990, the highest allocation of 150 ventilators was for the newly constructed Indira Gandhi hospital in Dwarka that the Delhi government is currently operationalizing for Covid-19 patients. The Delhi health minister Satyendar Jain had earlier said that the hospital will start with 500 oxygen beds for the patients with the viral infection. “To augment medical resources, optimum utilisation of space is being done. 500 oxygen-bedded centre will be set up here by next week,” Delhi health minister Satyendar Jain said last Wednesday.Two new hospitals that were operationalized last year for treating Covid-19 patients by the Delhi government in Burari and Ambedkar Nagar have also been allocated 80 ventilators each. Other hospitals to receive 80 ventilators were Deen Dayal Upadhaya in Hari Nagar and Baba Saheb Ambedkar Hospital in Rohini. The government allocated 80 ventilators each to makeshift facilities such as the Sardar Patel Covid Care Centre in Chattarpur, the extension of Burari hospital, and Sant Darshan centre. Two hospitals of the Employees State Insurance Corporation in Okhla and Jhilmil were allocated 50 ventilators in total. Currently, Delhi has 5,872 intensive care unit beds, not all of which have ventilators. Of these, 98.9% of the beds are occupied. The occupancy is likely to reduce over the week as the number of cases in the city has started going down.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-government-to-add-990-ventilator-beds-in-15-hospitals-makeshift-facilities-101620654019373.html

10-05-2021||Delhi||'In what greed': Manish Sisodia slams Centre for Covid-19 vaccine export||Delhi deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia once again hit out at the Centre on Monday for exporting Covid-19 vaccines to the country at a time when a resurgent second wave has affected lakhs of people in the country. The experts were conducted as part of the 'Vaccine Maitri' initiative of the government.“In what greed were 6.50 crore vaccines supplied to foreign countries when people in our own country are dying?” Sisodia said at a press conference.The deputy chief minister of Delhi also claimed that the Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP) allegations of the Delhi government ordering only 5.50 lakh doses of vaccines is incorrect as the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) government had placed orders directly with the two vaccine manufacturers in the country for 1.34 crore doses to vaccinate those above 18 years of age.“Today BJP alleged that Delhi govt ordered only 5.50 lakh doses of vaccine. The Government of India decided in April that the two companies can sell vaccines to states directly, states were also told the same. We ordered 1.34 crore doses for Delhi for people above 18 years,” Sisodia further said.Sisodia alleged that after the Delhi government placed orders for vaccines with manufacturing companies, the Centre stepped in to inform the government that Delhi would be receiving only 92,840 doses of Covaxin and 2,67,690 doses of Covishield to inoculate its citizens.“Right after our order, Centre sent us a letter - vaccine companies hadn't responded by then - that Delhi can get only 92,840 doses of Covaxin and 2,67,690 doses of Covishield in May,” said Sisodia.“BJP is lying that we ordered only 5.50 lakh doses. We had ordered 1.34 crore doses,” he added.Earlier in the day, Delhi health minister Satyendra Jain told reporters that the national capital is left with only a day’s worth of Covaxin stock. Delhi had received 1,50,000 doses of Covaxin for inoculating those within 18-45 years of age, and after administering 1,02,020 doses till Monday morning only 47,980 doses are available on hand, he said. The national capital’s stock of Covishield is expected to last for 3-4 days more, the minister added.Both Jain and Sisodia’s remarks came a day after Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal’s letter to Union minister Harsh Vardhan urging an increase in vaccine supply to the capital between May-July.Earlier on Monday, the BJP had slammed Arvind Kejriwal government over the Covid-19 crisis, claiming the chief minister has been busy spending crores on publicity and "misleading" people while washing his hands of responsibility and leaving everything to the Centre.Addressing a virtual press conference, BJP spokesperson Sambit Patra cited a RTI reply to say that the Kejriwal government has spent around ₹805 crore on advertisements since 2015 but not opened a single new hospital in the city.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/in-what-greed-manish-sisodia-slams-centre-for-covid-19-vaccine-export-101620652424585.html
10-05-2021||Patna||Bihar govt seeks additional support from Centre to tackle second wave of Covid-19||The Bihar government on Monday told the Patna High Court that it needed more D-type (46-litre capacity) and B-type cylinders for smooth transportation of oxygen to far-flung areas in the state and the Centre has already started with the supply of 75 D-type cylinders through the Indian Air Force (IAF), HT has learnt. “Bihar has lifted 208 mt of the 214 mt allocation. Oxygen supply has been streamlined but the real challenge is to have an adequate number of D-type cylinders as they can be directly used with a pipeline to ensure gas supply to beds in hospitals in different parts of the state,” senior counsel Vikas Singh, appearing for Bihar government, said, adding that in the last three days, the number of cases in the state had come down and recovery rate improved to around 82%. Singh submitted the affidavit filed by the chief secretary about the status of healthcare facilities in the state before the bench of Chief Justice Sanjay Karol and Justice Sanjay Kumar. Alongside, a letter of principal secretary, department of health, Bihar, to the secretary, Union ministry of health and family welfare, sent on May 7 for additional support to tackle the second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic was also attached.The additional requirements include 20,000 D-type oxygen cylinders, 10,000 B-type cylinders, 5,000 10-litre capacity cylinders and 3,000 5-litre cylinders, besides 25,000 flow meters, 50,000 oxygen masks, 1,000 high-flow nasal cannula and 50,000 pulse oximeters. Bihar health minister Mangal Pandey has also requested the Union government for the same. Additional solicitor general KN Singh said that 3688 D-type and 6400-B-type were delivered in April 2020 and further allocation was coming in. Vikas Singh also informed the court that Bihar’s demand for 300 mt of oxygen had also been enhanced to 400 mt, as the demand was dynamic, and the government was hoping that the allocation of 214 mt would also be accordingly increased. Advocate General (AG) Lalit Kishore told the bench that the government was in the process of constituting a high-power experts’ committee, while the chief minister was himself monitoring the situation and associating senior ministers in the decision-making process. “There is no notification for the constitution of a group of ministers, but the CM is himself monitoring the situation,” he added. The court, however, wanted certain information regarding the availability of beds and their occupancy and demand in every district, the number of positive cases and the number of people in home isolation. The court will again hear the matter on Wednesday. The bench also cited the example of one district, Araria, where just around 400 beds could cater to a population of 28 lakh. The court was also informed that Araria had just six ventilators, and all were lying unutilized. On this, Vikas Singh requested the court not to get down to micro-management as it could involve the officers in data preparation only and not in the actual work. However, the bench said that it could not shut its eyes. “We are just seeking information, as these are the issues that concern all. We are not here to govern. When it comes to oxygen requirement, the court is expected to pass orders. But the court also needs to know the ground situation, as it also gets feedback from its sources,” it added. The AG also requested the bench to pass an order for the release of cylinders seized by police, as they were exhibits and could pose problems at a later stage. The court said that it could be ensured simply by approaching the magistrate. “After taking photographs, the cylinders could be released. There are enough provisions in this regard,” it added. What the govt affidavit says Bihar has 167 Covid care centres, 117 dedicated Covid health centres, 12 dedicated Covid hospitals and 219 private hospitals providing care to patients. Instructions have been given to increase the existing bed capacity of the dedicated Covid health centres by 25% and upgrade CCCs and DCHCs for the treatment of moderate cases. The health department has a total capacity of 855 ventilators, out of which 378 are deployed for treatment of Covid-19 patients at dedicated Covid hospitals and DCHCs. Keeping in view, the need for ventilators in approved private facilities, the nod has been given for their use from government facilities to private facilities also. CT scan service is available in 16 district hospitals and the installation process is underway at additional 15 district hospitals. A total of 95 essential drugs for the general management of Covid-19 and 54 ICU drugs has been notified. Out of these, the Bihar medical services infrastructure corporation limited has a rate contract in place for 70 essential drugs and 31 ICU drugs. For the drugs which do not have a rate contract in place, the civil surgeons have been instructed to procure them locally. The Central government has allocated 87,800 Remdesivir vials to Bihar. Out of that, 42,500 have been distributed to civil surgeons and medical colleges. Special powers have been entrusted upon medical superintendents of medical colleges and hospitals and civil surgeons for procurement of goods, services and manpower for three months under the provisions of the disaster management act, 2005. Vacancies According to the affidavit, against a total of 5,566 sanctioned positions of general medical officers, at present 2,893 are working. Advertisement has been issued for the recruitment of additional 2632 general duty medical officers. Besides, against 5508 sanctioned posts of specialists, the working strength at present is 1,795. An advertisement for additional 3706 specialists has also been issued. The last date to apply is May 24 for both. Against 915 sanctioned contractual posts of general medical officers, the working strength is just 279, while against 769 sanctioned contractual posts of specialists, presently 150 are working. The government has also created 1,000 posts of MBBS doctors at medical colleges and hospitals across districts for appointment on a contractual basis for one year through walk-in interviews. The government has also issued orders to continue the services of final year post-graduate and diploma students of medical colleges and hospitals for three months beyond the academic session at ₹95000/month and ₹90000/month respectively.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/bihar-govt-seeks-additional-support-from-centre-to-tackle-second-wave-of-covid19-101620652580147.html
10-05-2021||Other||Covid warriors overcome the odds to fight virus in Haryana||Frontline workers from administrative officials to medical staff are leading by example as they battle the Covid-19 pandemic in Haryana. Some got infected, while others lost relatives to coronavirus but that has only strengthened their resolve.Chairing a meeting of the Rewari district administration last week, Union minister Rao Inderjit Singh appreciated the work done by deputy commissioner Yashendra Singh despite having lost two relatives to Covid.Yashendra Singh resumed office on April 30 after training when the district was in the grip of oxygen supply shortage. Four patients at a private hospital had lost their lives due to the shortage of oxygen cylinders. Singh has since been personally monitoring the distribution of cylinders to hospitals in the district.“I have assured doctors that no patient will die in hospital due to shortage of oxygen. I hold coordination meetings at night too and have started home delivery of oxygen cylinders,” he says. Last week, the demand for oxygen increased in Rewari, prompting him to arrange 120 cylinders from Rohtak, 30 each from Gurugram, Mahendragarh and Faridabad districts after coordinating with his counterparts.FACE OF RESILIENCE, SHE SETS AN EXAMPLEPriyanka, a staff nurse at Rohtak’s Post Graduate Institute of Medical Sciences, is another face of a resilient Covid warrior. She returned to duty at the Covid ward with a smile on Sunday after defeating coronavirus for the second time.The past three weeks were the toughest for the young mother after she tested positive.“There was no one else at home to look after my two children, both of whom are aged below 10 years, till my husband, a soldier, took leave to be with us after five days. I was confined to one room and the children to another. My in-laws wanted to come from our native village in Bhiwani, but I didn’t want to put them at risk. My husband and I remained away from the children even though we stayed in the same building,” she said.IN ISOLATION BUT CONNECTEDJhajjar civil surgeon Dr Sanjay Dahiya has been isolation ever since he developed Covid symptoms, but that hasn’t stopped him from coordinating from a room at the PWD rest house in Beri.“Though 264 employees of the 1,635 health department employees in Jhajjar contracted the virus, services have remained unaffected. A commander is as good as his army and I want to thank my team for rising to the occasion,” says Dr Dahiya. The civil surgeon and his wife, Dr Pamila, who is also a government doctor, had gone home in Gurugram in the beginning April, but had never imagined that they would be battling such a situation.“We have a 23-year-old daughter who is looking after my elderly parents as we work in isolation. She makes it a point to make a video call at 11.30pm every night. My mother is concerned about us, but she wants us to continue our duty,” he says.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/covid-warriors-overcome-the-odds-to-fight-virus-in-haryana-101620650958653.html
10-05-2021||Delhi||Arvind Kejriwal explains how Delhi is preparing for next wave of Covid-19||Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Monday said that his government is boosting the infrastructure to prepare the national capital for the next wave of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19). Delhi has seen a surge in the number of daily cases of Covid-19, which led the Kejriwal government to announced strict lockdown-like measures to check th spread of the infection in second wave."We're increasing oxygen beds... we must prepare for the third wave. In this wave, Delhi recorded maximum 28,000 cases in a day. The scale at which we're creating infrastructure, we'll be able to deal even if 30,000 daily cases are reported in next wave," the chief minister said.His comments come on a day when the Delhi's health minister Satyendar Jain said that the city was running out of vaccines, with just three to four days of supplies remaining of AstraZeneca's Covishield, made by the Serum Institute of India and a day for Covaxin."We're left with vaccine stock vaccines for 3-4 days. We're placed orders with companies but I think Central government is allocating the vaccines because we get letter from the Centre about the stock that we would get in a month. We request Centre to give us more vaccines," said Kejriwal.On Monday, Delhi entered a fourth week of lockdown, with tougher curbs such as the shutdown of the suburban rail network (metro trains) and a ban on outdoor weddings and gatherings."This is not the time to be lenient," Kejriwal had said on Sunday. "This phase is so tough, this wave is so dangerous, so many people are dying...the priority at this hour is to save lives," he said in a televised address.Delhi on Monday reported 319 fresh Covid-19 fatalities and 12,651 new infections, the lowest in four weeks, with a positivity rate of 19.10 per cent, according to health department bulletin.The dip in new cases, the lowest since April 12, can also be ascribed to a smaller number of tests (66,234) conducted on Sunday.At 19.10 per cent, the positivity rate is the lowest since April 16, when it stood at 19.7 per cent, according to government data. On April 22, a positivity rate of 36.2 per cent, the highest so far, was recorded.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/arvind-kejriwal-explains-how-delhi-is-preparing-for-next-wave-of-covid19-101620649792755.html
10-05-2021||Kolkata||Suvendu Adhikari chosen opposition leader to take on Mamata in West Bengal house||The BJP on Monday unanimously elected Suvendu Adhikari as Leader of Opposition in the new West Bengal Assembly to take on Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee in the house. Union minister Ravi Shankar Prasad announced Adhikari's name as leader of the BJP legislature party in the assembly after a meeting of the legislators at the party's Hastings office. The saffron party has emerged as the main opposition party winning 77 seats in the 294-member house. Adhikari has been preferred by the saffron party ahead of senior party leaders like Mukul Roy, who also got elected from Nadia constituency, to take on Banerjee in the house. The ruling TMC bagged 213 seats while Indian Secular Front emerged victorious in one assembly segment and an Independent R S Lepcha, belonging to the Binay Tamang faction of the Gorkha Janmukti Morcha (GJM) won from Kalimpong. Congress and the Left party drew a blank. Voting in two assembly segments will take place in future. Since BJP has the overwhelming numbers in the opposition camp, Adhikari becomes the leader of opposition in the house, party President Dilip Ghosh later told reporters at a media briefing. While 22 MLAs present at the meeting pledged support to Adhikari, those absent were either on the side of the workers facing TMC attack in the districts while two are down with Covid, Ghosh said when asked about the reason why not all the MLAs were present at the meeting. "If others don't oppose the selection that means they are supporting the name proposed. It is not mandatory for every single legislator to pledge support vocally," Adhikari, who was present, said. Senior leader Mukul Roy, who was elected from an assembly segment in Nadia district, said "Suvendu will lead BJP to greater height in the house and fight the misdeeds of ruling party in state." Roy once considered number two in the TMC, was the saffron party's chief architect in driving away many legislators from the ruling camp to them. Adhikari said "I have been MLA since 2006. I have seen arrogance of the then CPI(M) led regime. We have to constructively perform the role of opposition in the assembly adhering to parliamentary norms." He said the BJP will continue to take up the issue of Trinamool Congress attack on political rivals, the terror unleashed by the TMC and fight for democratic right of every citizen. Union minister and senior BJP leader Ravi Shankar Prasad and Bhupendra Yadav were the observers at the election of Adhikari as BJP legislature party leader. Adhikari had won the elections from Nandigram assembly seat, defeating his former boss-turned-political adversary Mamata Banerjee by a narrow margin of over 1900 votes. Adhikari was one of the key associates of Banerjee during the Nandigram land movement in 2007-08 and was instrumental in the formation of anti-land acquisition committee formed in 2007 which launched a fierce struggle foiling the bid of the then Buddhadeb Bhattacharya government to set up a petrochemical hub in the area acquiring thousands of acres of farm land. A former state minister, having handled several key portfolios including transport and environment, Adhikari had joined the Bharatiya Janata Party in December last year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/suvendu-adhikari-chosen-opposition-leader-to-take-on-mamata-in-west-bengal-house-101620648539742.html
10-05-2021||Jaipur||Follow lockdown guidelines with sincerity, Rajasthan CM Gehlot tells people||As a strict lockdown came into force in Rajasthan from Monday to curb the spread of coronavirus, chief minister Ashok Gehlot asked the people of the state to follow the guidelines with sincerity and responsibility. Lockdown restrictions were already there in the state but the state government on last Thursday decided to make it more stringent from May 10 to 24. Gehlot tweeted the lockdown guidelines, saying there is a complete lockdown from 5 am on May 10 to 5 am on May 24. He asked the people of the state to follow the guidelines with sincerity and responsibility. Under the complete lockdown, movement from one district/village to another district/village except in case of medical emergency, wedding functions, movement of all vehicles except those engaged in medical services are prohibited and several other restrictions are also there in addition to the guidelines issued earlier. The state government has called it "Pandemic Red Alert Public Discipline Lockdown".Places of worship are also closed, MGNREGA works have been suspended and movement from one city/village to another city/village within the state is prohibited, except medical emergency cases, under the lockdown. Those coming from outside the state will have to produce a negative RT-PCR test report which should be not older than 72 hours. In case there is no negative report, the person will be quarantined for 15 days.In order to prevent migration of workers, works are permitted in factories, construction sites and industrial units have been asked to operate buses for workers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/jaipur-news/follow-lockdown-guidelines-with-sincerity-rajasthan-cm-gehlot-tells-people-101620647098924.html
10-05-2021||Jaipur||Rajasthan village has unique punishment for those violating Covid-19 norms||A small village in Rajasthan’s Dholpur is punishing villagers, who do not wear face masks, by making them stand guard at village check-posts in its bid to enforce Covid appropriate behaviour.The villagers of Kaithri in Dholpur say the punishment serves a message to the community that one person’s complacency cannot be allowed to put others life at grave risk at a time when nearby towns in neighbouring Uttar Pradesh are struggling to contain Covid cases with hospitals overflowing with patients.“Simple admonishments don’t work. We had some people within the village who shrugged off the gravity [of the situation] by calling Coronavirus an illness confined only to big cities. Therefore, we started community services at check posts to drive home the point that no one is immune from the illness and the attendant suffering,” said sarpanch Ajay Pal Sharma.Rajasthan recorded 159 deaths and 17,921 coronavirus cases on Sunday, taking the death toll to 5,665 and the infection tally to 756,707. A strict lockdown till May 24 has come into force in the state from Monday restricting movement from one district/village to another except in case of medical emergency. Movement of all vehicles except those engaged in medical services is also prohibited.According to Kaithri sarpanch, in the last one week, as many as 28 villagers have been made to man the check posts since they didn’t wear masks properly. Apart from standing guard at the check-posts, they are instructed to spread awareness about the importance of social distancing and sanitisation in fighting the disease.Sharma said they realised the need for taking serious steps after noticing that several villagers continued to act irresponsibly despite 11 residents testing positive last month. “We held a meeting that something needed to be done, so we decided to set-up barricades for outsiders, and for people within the village, a two-day duty at the check posts was agreed upon.”The ideas seemed to have worked, at least for now, says the sarpanch Most of the villagers stepping out of their homes are now wearing proper masks or covering their faces with Gamchaas. The village has not reported any fresh case of Covid-19, and all the 11 patients have recovered too.According to the district collector Rakesh Kumar Jaiswal, Kaithri has been at the forefront of the fight against Covid-19. “The village has a very good vaccination record; they also undertake regular sanitization work. The efforts at the panchayat level will go in a long way in our collective fight against the coronavirus,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/jaipur-news/rajasthan-village-has-unique-punishment-for-those-violating-covid-19-norms-101620646698607.html
10-05-2021||Mumbai||'Mark of Centre’s failure': Sena on Supreme Court-constituted Covid task force||Shiv Sena on Monday said that the appointment of a 12-member task force of experts by the Supreme Court to tackle to monitor oxygen allocation amid the second Covid-19 wave in the country is a mark of failure of the Narendra Modi-led government. An editorial in Sena mouthpiece Saamana said that the apex court-formed panel will now breathe life into the collapsed health infrastructure in the country.“The Supreme Court has now taken steps, but the rulers of the country are still stuck in politics. They are busy in selecting Assam chief minister. Even though Mamata Banerjee has won the West Bengal election, they are busy whiling away time to not let her run her administration. What will happen to people who are choking to death at such a time? Who is their saviour? Supreme Court has now appointed a 12-member task force of experts in this war against coronavirus. This task force will now breathe life into the collapsed health infrastructure,” the editorial said.Criticising the Centre for lack of planning in managing medical oxygen supply, it said, “Like the situation in Delhi, the crisis is bad in other parts of the country. The nation did not chalk out any supply management plan of medical oxygen. The guidelines will now be prepared by the 12-member task force. Despite getting oxygen from other countries, the situation has remained the same… States such as Uttar Pradesh and Bihar are counting their dead.”Also Read | Supreme Court-appointed task force holds first meetingThe editorial also slammed Union health minister Dr Harsh Vardhan for staging protests in West Bengal without wearing a mask. “Vaccines, drugs are being black-marketed and Dr Harsh Vardhan is staging protests on the streets of West Bengal without wearing a mask...It seems the health ministry does not know how bad the situation has deteriorated in the country. Therefore, the Supreme Court gave it anaesthesia and gave the responsibility of the war against Covid to the national panel,” it said.Countering the attack, Maharashtra BJP chief spokesperson Keshav Upadhye said it was the Centre that suggested the formation of the panel of experts to the apex court and not the other way around. “Today’s editorial is based on the court-appointed panel. But the Centre itself had suggested formation of such a panel. Only Saamana can write an editorial without reading the proceedings. Sanjay Raut’s only task is to criticise the Centre... he should at least get accurate details,” he said in a tweet.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/supreme-court-constituted-covid-task-force-a-mark-of-centre-s-failuresena-101620645078425.html

This is still a world record,” he said.The then JD-led government faced many difficulties, “but the government overcame all the obstacles with its firm determination...It is unfortunate that the present government being led by one with the reputation of being Vishwaguru is unable to arrange the required number of vaccines even after charging the common people for the jabs,” he said.The Centre drew flak from the Supreme Court as well for differential pricing of Covid vaccine for the Centre and the state governments.

10-05-2021||Pune||Monday Musings: The political economy of the Marathas in Maharashtra||Last week when the Supreme Court quashed reservation in jobs and education to Maharashtra’s politically dominant Marathas, every political party came forward to position itself. Understandably so, political outfits cannot afford to be seen against Marathas that constitute almost 33 per cent, including Kunbi-Marathas, of the overall population in the state. For the community, the verdict by the five-member constitution bench is a setback as its finds itself fragmenting among various groups with loyalty to different political parties. The community has over the decades retained its clout in Maharashtra’s politics, keeping its power share intact. If Maharashtra has had more than 60 per cent of its chief ministers from the Marathas, the community has a fair representation in the cabinet or in the state assembly. Over the years, its politics is shaped by identity where Hindutva and caste have been at the core. On the economic front, Marathas are a stratified community. Dalit write Anand Teltumbde, who has written extensively on caste system in India, has observed in his Economic and Political weekly piece that Marathas have witnessed threea -fold stratification. The lowest at the hierarchy are either land-less or marginal farmers. They are mostly from Maharashtra’s Marathwada and account for the largest number within the community. It’s for the same reason, the demand for reservation gained maximum traction in this region. It is for this section many political parties have sought reservation, citing they account for a majority of the community. The same class, attracted towards caste- based outfits such as Maratha Mahasangh, Sambhaji brigade and Chhawa, has largely remained dissatisfied with those within the community holding on to power. This section is largely trapped in the agriculture sector without access to urban resources. The Gaikwad Commission constituted by the then Devendra Fadnavis government in its report had highlighted that a large section of Marathas are economically and educationally backward. The Supreme Court, however, found no merit in exceeding the existing 50 per cent ceiling of quota, which could have accommodated Marathas. In the middle are those having control over land and resources through various institutes like cooperatives and credit societies. Many in this category have control over rural credit and banking. There are many in this category whose next generation has migrated to bigger cities such as Pune and Mumbai for jobs. In the cities though, this section has not been able to dominate the economy. On the contrary, many have had to settle for a secondary position, not in consonance with Maratha pride. The top category in the Maratha stratification is one that has direct control over power. This section, no matter which party is in government, has enjoyed the fruits of power. This has at times led to increasing gap between Maratha elite and the community, with the former using identity politics to gain power without ensuring the benefits reach the community at large. Since 1950s till the 1980s, this class was with Congress party. However, as party’s political fortunes begun to change, the section within the community shifted to first Shiv Sena, then Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) and later to BJP. In 2014, many among Maratha-Kunbi voted for BJP. In their paper, prominent political scientists Rajeshwari Deshpande and Suhas Palshikar observed: “The discursive space of backwardness on the one hand facilitates a suitable construction of caste ideology that covers up material deprivations at least in a tokenist manner and also keeps intact the consensus around the theme of social justice. On the other hand, the Mandal discourse legitimises caste as a political category and creates small openings within practices of democracy, for assertions of traditional caste dominance. This is what the Marathas attempted during the more recent times — despite, but also, because of their dominant political position in the state.” Today, the community that assumed control of the state’s political apparatus seeks tag of backwardness as many within it couldn’t taste the benefits of post-globalisation economy. While the community draws its dominance from the caste cluster of Marathas and Kunbis, which makes its numerically strong, economically, a large section of it hasn’t been able to achieve material growth.

10-05-2021||Delhi||Delhi’s Covaxin doses to last a day, Covishield 3-4 days: Health minister Jain||Delhi’s stock of Covaxin will last only a day and that of Covishield will last three to four days, according to Delhi health minister Satyendar Jain. “There are two vaccines available in India; we have stock for just one day for one and for three or four days for the other. Covaxin stock will last a day and Covishield three or four days,” said Jain during his visit to a 400-bed Covid facility at Guruwara Rakab Ganj Sahib. There were just 274,460 doses – both Covaxin and Covishield – meant for those between the ages of 18 and 44 years purchased by the state as on May 9. There were 467,190 doses allocated by the Centre meant for those above the ages of 45 years, healthcare workers, and frontline workers till May 9. As per Centre’s directives, the states have to use 70% of these doses to give the second shot to those who have already received one.Also Read | 400-bed Covid care centre at Gurudwara Rakab Ganj to begin operations todayDelhi has been giving nearly 95,000 shots a day during the last week, according to data shared by the government. Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal had written to the Union health minister Dr Harsh Vardhan on Sunday, stating that the government must come up with a uniform price for the vaccine doses as states and private hospitals were competing for the same supply. The companies have to provide 50% of their manufactured doses to the Centre. “A uniform price should be fixed for vaccines for supplies made to governments (Central or state) and to private hospitals. The inherent fallacy and danger in the current pricing mechanism is that there is an obvious incentive for private manufacturers to prioritise supplies to private hospitals over supplies being made to governments since under the current mechanism they will earn more from the latter,” the letter read. Meanwhile, the Centre has justified in the Supreme Court its Covid-19 vaccination policy, saying its response and strategy is completely driven by expert medical and scientific opinion which leaves little room for judicial interference and emphasised that citizens of all age groups will get free vaccination throughout the country.In 218-page affidavit filed late Sunday night in the top court’s suo motu case on Covid-19 management, the Centre said, this policy “conforms to mandate of Article 14 and Article 21 of the Constitution of India and is made after several rounds of consultation and discussion with experts, state government and vaccine manufacturers requiring no interference by this Court as while dealing with a pandemic of this magnitude, the executive does have a room for free play in the joints, in larger public interest”.

While several schools run by the Delhi government and civic bodies have been functioning as isolation centres for Covid-19 patients, this is the first time a private school has set up a Covid care facility on its premises in the national Capital. Michael Williams, dean of Mount Carmel Schools, said that last week his father and founder of these schools, VK Williams, passed away due to Covid-19. His mother is fighting the disease. “The work on setting up such a facility had begun a month ago. People from over 100 churches across Delhi decided to turn minority schools into Covid care facilities to help the city amid this pandemic. The school buildings are anyway shut these days due to the pandemic...We chose Mount Carmel as the first school for such an initiative… My father passed away while fighting Covid last week and that’s why we decided to name the facility after him. If this experiment works, we will roll it out in other minority schools in Delhi,” he said.Also Read | Fire erupts at Delhi lab conducting over 1,000 RT-PCR Covid-19 tests dailyThe facility will admit Covid patients with mild symptoms.

Our friends from South Korea have gifted us two oxygen generator plants that will be up and running by this weekend. We can then generate our own oxygen for these facilities,” Williams said.There will be 75 volunteers, including doctors, and nurses from Christian hospitals, working with the school administration. “Four full-time doctors with nursing staff will be there round the clock. Other doctors will be available for tele-consultation...The facility is meant for people with mild to moderate symptoms and hence, there will be little intervention of doctors.

10-05-2021||Delhi||Covid positive, no more: DU hostellers share recovery tales||Being in the comfort of your home when battling Covid-19 is one thing, and being alone in a hostel or rented accommodation is another. “The most scary thing was standing all alone in line in a Covid testing line in a Delhi hospital. I was trembling with fear, hearing other people say things like ‘I don’t want to die’, ‘I’m here to re-check my results’, ‘I don’t want to infect my family’ etc.” This is what most hostellers of Delhi University went through, who were away from their families when infected by coronavirus. Yet, they went on to defeat Covid! Being mentally strong, at a time when they were away from their loved ones, wasn’t easy. “Being with your family is always a blessing, it makes you stronger than any sort of medicines or medications, however we didn’t have that privilege so we had to make the best use of what was at our disposal,” says Ranjan Kumar, a PhD student who is a resident of Gwyer Hall hostel. Kumar adds, “My friends and the hostel authorities went out of their way to help me with medicines, food and everything, when I was self isolated, and that kept me upbeat! I’m grateful to the hostel administration for their support during this crisis; they converted the Teacher Court (TC) to Doctor Court (DC) — a separate ward in hostel for quarantining of students where they don’t have to use the common facilities. Starting from water to food supply, everything was nicely maintained. And most importantly, the main authority like the Provost, Warden and Section Officer of the hostel were always active and connected with me over chat and call to check on my health. This made me feel cared for, and my fellow hostellers and hostel authorities became my extended family. I recovered with their help, with good food and medicines. Talking heart to heart with others is extremely important when you’re scared and Covid positive.” For Avinash Chandra, a master’s student residing in Post Graduate Men’s Hostel, DU, it was knowledge that came as a source of comfort. “I missed my family during quarantine, but knew that ultimately I couldn’t travel in these conditions. So I spent most of my time resting or on video calls with my bhaiya, didi, and mummy. Connecting with them virtually made me feel supported in crisis. I recommend every hosteller or those who are not with their families and battling this virus, to communicate frequently and open up to their family members,” says Chandra, whose hostel authorities ensured that he gets regular access to kaadha, turmeric milk, and fresh fruits. “They even called me from time to time to ask about how I was doing... And I realised that knowledge is power, and used the time to surf online to learn more about Covid and the precautions that one must take. This knowledge comforted me. Besides, I did certain exercises and yoga in my room’s balcony, watched movies and listened to songs that kept me engaged.”For some it’s candid conversations and for others it’s knowledge, which helped them recover well. But for hosteller Shyamjeet Yadav, a PhD student staying at a hostel near DU’s North Campus, it’s yoga and reading that kept him upbeat during his recovery. “My family was in Jaunpur, Uttar Pradesh, and I was battling Covid here in Delhi, all alone. My family was worried, but I told them that I’ll be okay. We need to understand that Covid is not serious in most cases. As my symptoms were controllable, I reassured my folks back home that I’ll be fine. Meanwhile, here, I practised a lot of yoga, including surya namaskar, and meditation. This helped me gain mental strength. I even read many books of my interest, and saw upbeat web series during my quarantine period. It’s all about what you choose to focus on! I focused on positive, upbeat news and practised yoga diligently. Now my family has asked me to come back as soon as I get a negative report,” says Yadav, further advising, “According to the reports, 97% people are recovering themselves. In my hostel, all 15 students who were Covid positive recovered well. So we need to get rid of the panic, take medicines in time, and keep friends virtually close!”Author tweets @FizzyBuddhaFollow more stories on Facebook and Twitter||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/covid-positive-no-more-du-hostellers-share-recovery-tales-101620628405322.html
10-05-2021||Delhi||DU’s foreign students share their pandemic experiences||Within a few weeks of Delhi University opening admissions for foreign students, the seats have been reportedly filled up, even before the last date. Youngsters hailing from different homelands are ready to bite into the campus life, at a time when the world is engulfed by a pandemic. Exuding extreme mental strength and resilience, the foreign nationals who are presently studying in various colleges, share what makes the DU experience worthwhile, even though the pandemic has curtailed their campus life!Easy to make friends @DUKokoro Okamoto, who hails from Japan and is a student of Psychology (Hons) at Lady Shri Ram College For Women, says: “My experience of the pandemic can be summed up in one word ‘Online classes’, which has been bittersweet. Bitter in the sense that I’m yet to visit my college campus where I’m missing out on the college fun with my friends or eating at the cafe and canteen, meeting new people and definitely the physical essence of the societies that I have joined during the past months. In terms of sweet, being an ambivert, sometimes I love to stay at home and enjoy these online classes where I can attend them at my own comfort zone. Despite having a pandemic year, which was plagued with uncertainty and loneliness, I would recommend DU as a place to be! India is great, wherever you visit, the culture, food and the people you meet are different. This is something that is unique to India and I really want students from other countries to experience these wonderful moments. Moreover, the education here, I believe is great when one compares it in terms of the cost to study in India with countries, because it is relatively affordable. Apart from education, one can learn something valuable like connecting to animals which is rare in other countries and being around with stray dogs and cats really teaches us the importance of their presence. Lastly, this is something I have noticed in my pandemic year that making friends with Indians is very easy and they are willing to become friends with you and help you whenever you struggle, miss your family or are just having a bad day, which made me love this country more.”Stuck in homeland, eager to visit IndiaArefa Mohibe, from Afghanistan, who is pursuing Economics (Hons) at Daulat Ram College, says: “My pandemic experience has been challenging. I prefer physical classes rather than online ones because as foreign students we have many kinds of challenges such as economical issues, internet connectivity, electricity shortage and lack of course materials. These impact our studies as sometimes we miss out some of our classes. Sometimes we need to buy books online, but for many of us it’s difficult to buy them through the internet. I’m in my first year and second semester, so unfortunately I haven’t been able to even come to India yet, and haven’t experienced the physical campus. Those like me who are on a scholarship, have signed an undertaking that unless we are not in India we would not be paid the scholarship stipend, so that’s another challenge. And as a foreign student, I’m really interested to study offline and meet my classmates and teachers and have discussions on our lessons. Hopefully that time will come soon.” #FOMO Complete campus experienceYoutso Rakdo, a Tibetan national pursuing MA in English at Jesus and Mary College, says: “This is my first year at DU, and sadly, I never got to experience the real campus life. I wish things would go back to normal soon. I never got a chance to apply for a hostel since the lockdown started before my admission, but the admission process was quite a breeze. The authorities at Foreign Students’ Registry, DU, were helpful in addressing all my concerns. Most of my professors have been extremely dedicated and try to not let the pandemic jeopardize our education... Online classes for me have been very convenient, I feel like this is where my privilege comes into play. I’ve been lucky to have internet access and electronic devices at my disposal. But nothing can beat the real life experience of a physical class. Especially the environment of my college. I had so many plans for my campus debut. I miss every detail of my college – the food, class, library – all of it looked so interesting on the brochure!”Author tweets @FizzyBuddhaFollow more stories on Facebook and Twitter||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/dus-foreign-students-share-their-pandemic-experiences-101620628040692.html
10-05-2021||Kolkata||Kolkata’s civic body takes Rapid Antigen Test to doorstep||With Kolkata registering the highest number of new Covid-19 case every day among all districts in West Bengal, the city’s civic body has planned to take Rapid Antigen Test to the doorstep of citizens. “When the first wave hit in 2020, we had seen that many housing societies and high-rise buildings became hot spots of Covid-19. Many had to be declared as containment zones,” said a senior Kolkata Municipal Corporation (KMC) official. With a dedicated helpline, the KMC plans to reach these high-rise buildings and large housing societies. “A dedicated mobile number (9831036572) has been launched for the purpose. Residents living in high-rise buildings and large housing societies can call on this number. If the number of residents is more than 30, the KMC would send a vehicle to conduct tests there,” said a senior official of the civic body.

An example of this is the conferring of a ministerial charge to Akhil Giri, locally known for his Medinipur faction against that of turncoat strongman leader Suvendu Adhikari. Members who toed the party line are also being suitably recognised.According to TMC leaders, Subrata Mukherjee, Partha Chatterjee, Javed Khan, and Moloy Ghatak are among the senior leaders that are likely to return to the cabinet.

10-05-2021||Patna||Bihar to use tamper proof laser technology for quality control of roads||Bihar road construction department (RCD) will now use a “high precision laser-based technology” to check the quality of newly constructed roads and maintenance of old ones to save time, cost and ensure accuracy in assessment.The department till now relied on manual verification of quality control measures as stipulated under the International Roughness Index (IRI), which was not only time-consuming and costly but also prone to fudging. It has now decided to adopt the laser-based network survey vehicle (NSV) technology, recently introduced to check the quality of construction of national highways.Vehicles equipped with NSV technology come with high resolution camera and laser-beam throwing capacity to record and assess the condition of roads beneath the surface. Bihar has around 5,000 km of national highways, 4000km of state highways and around 11,000km of major district roads. Additional chief secretary, RCD, Amrit Lal Meena said the new technology will also ensure that contractors are penalized suitably for not adhering to quality control measures. “Manual inspection of road is a vigorous exercise and costs a huge sum as road maintenance was brought under the Bihar public grievances resolution rights act,” said Meena.Bihar Right to Public Grievance Redressal Act 2015 makes it incumbent on the government agencies to deliver a set of services within a stipulated time, empowering residents with the legal right for hearing of grievances, redressal and of communication on the decision taken.Meena said the department decided to adopt the NSV technology after RCD minister Nitin Navin, during a recent meeting to review various undergoing road projects, asked for speedy disposal of complaints related to poor maintenance of roads.Accordingly, the executive engineers of the department have been told to engage among 41 firms, empanelled by the Union ministry of road transportation and highways (MoRTH), for faster and digitized survey of roads for their timely maintenance.Under the RCD’s maintenance policy, contractors are obligated to maintain roads for seven years after its completion. Meena said the policy also had provisions for high-level inspection of the projects.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/bihar-to-use-tamper-proof-laser-technology-for-quality-control-of-roads-101620616458074.html

10-05-2021||Delhi||Delhiwale: Street life in the pandemic||This narrow lane in the Walled City doesn’t go past any historic monument. No beautiful doorway opens into it.And yet, the lane shows so much. Especially these days, with its scenes conveying the oppressiveness and distress of the curfew and coronavirus pandemic.Here’s an anthology of impressions collected over a handful of days.6am: An elderly beggar is sitting on the street-side, his arm resting upon a cloth bundle of what presumably gathers his possessions. The man is without mask, and his back is resting against a shuttered store named Discount Medicura, a pharmacy whose banner announces “free home delivery” and “20 percent discount.” The street is otherwise empty, save for a few cats and dogs.7am: Another beggar is sitting on another part of the street. He is in a mask. A cat settles close to him, but far enough to respect the codes of social distancing, and is staring at him attentively.9am: The aforementioned pharmacy is open. A side-shelf is mostly decked with oximeters. (Until recently, that space was dedicated exclusively to glucometers for the diabetics.) The young man behind the counter is wearing two masks. His phone is playing the film song “Didi tera dewar deewana.”11am: Two men are riding a bike. The man at the back is holding an oxygen cylinder.1pm: A figure hesitantly appears from a side-lane. His mask is falling under his nose. The man has ventured out “because our whole family lives in a one-room house, with no balcony or window. I have come for fresh air.” He is coughing as he speaks.2.30pm: A public announcement of a local resident’s death echoes through the street. It is coming from a mosque.

10-05-2021||Delhi||Working beside docs, nurses, multi-tasking staff lead fight||While the pandemic has thrown doctors and nurses to the forefront of the fight against the infection in the national capital, supporting their efforts are thousands of ward boys, attendants and sanitation staff who have been working tirelessly behind the scenes.In most hospitals across Delhi, at least two such staff, known as multi-tasking staff (MTS), work in each ward in every shift, sharing tasks ranging from serving food to patients to helping clean them or change clothes and clean the wards. Above all, they have also become a medium to connect patients with their families who are not allowed inside Covid wards.Manoj Kumar Paswan (37), a ward attendant at RML hospital, looks after at least 20 patients during his regular morning shift. “First I serve breakfast to all the patients. It’s important for them to eat first so that they take the day’s first dose of medicine. Many of the patients are either very weak or old and require assistance to eat. I also help such patients in changing their diapers, clean them and change their clothes,” he said.Also read | Regulate supply of Covid-19 vaccine shots: Delhi CM Kejriwal writes to health minister Harsh VardhanTirath Ram (44), a helper at the civic-run Swami Dayanand Hospital, said that many patients admitted at the hospital belong to economically weaker sections, who do not own smartphones. He said that he does not hesitate in passing on his phone number to their relatives so that they can be in touch with each other or at least enquire about the well-being of the admitted patients. “Doctors and nurses are busy... Covid symptoms are treated by doctors, I can only provide some mental peace to patients and families that are already stressed,” said Ram.Abhishek Singh, an attendant at Lok Nayak Hospital, said that many a times, patients seek help to make video calls to their family members. “There is hardly any communication... They just want to see their loved ones...It feels good to help,” he said.Suresh (38), who is lovingly called ‘Suni bhaiyya’ at the Hindu Rao Hospital, said that two weeks ago, a 19-year-old patient admitted to the hospital expressed her wish to eat Parle-G biscuits. “She was nearly my sister’s age... I bought her two packets of Parle-G at my own expense. She was so happy... These are the small joys that we hold on to,” Suresh said.Some attendants said they also encountered “misbehaviour” by relatives of patients. A ward attendant in GTB hospital said, “A few days ago, a patient could not be revived as he was brought in very critical. The family members started to abuse us and the nurses. We tried to make them understand but later had to call in security.”Meanwhile, many said the fear and guilt of infecting family members is also on their minds. Shamsher Rai, an attendant at RML hospital who lives with his family of six including elderly parents, said, “Even as I wear PPE kit all the time in the Covid ward, the fear of infection is always there... If people living in big houses are getting infected, what are the chances of a family of six living in a two-room set of not getting the virus?”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/working-beside-docs-nurses-multi-tasking-staff-lead-fight-101620598504846.html

10-05-2021||Delhi||Sisodia hits out at Centre for jab exports||Deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia attacked the Centre on Sunday for sending Covid-19 vaccines to other countries even as India was facing a vaccine shortage, calling it “image management”.“When it was time for our youth to get vaccinated, Delhi government opened centres all across the capital but (the) central government gave only 5.5 lakh vaccines for the youth. 5.5 lakh vaccine for our youth and 6.5 crore vaccine for other nations. These numbers show that our central government doesn’t value the lives of our younger generation,” said Sisodia in a press statement on Sunday.Citing a report in The Indian Express newspaper, Sisodia said the Centre sold coronavirus vaccines to 93 countries of which 60 per cent had Covid-19 under control, and also where there was no threat of loss of life due to the virus.“A report published by Indian Express claimed that (at) a time when Indians were reeling from Covid-19 and deaths, (the) central government, instead of collecting vaccines for India, sold 6.5 crore doses of vaccines to 93 other nations. Upon doing further research, I found out that 60% of these 93 nations have not reported many Covid cases. In fact, 88 of these 93 nations have not reported many deaths and therefore do not see fatality rate as a big challenge,” Sisodia said.“If other nations, countries like Canada, US gathered enough vaccines and prioritised vaccinating their own citizens first, then why did India fall behind? No other nation, except France, exported vaccines to other countries before fully vaccinating its own people. France exported 1 lakh doses after ensuring enough stock for its people,” said Sisodia, who is also Delhi’s nodal minister for Covid-19 management and inter-ministerial coordination.India has so far supplied over 60 million doses of Covid-19 vaccines, mostly Covishield, to 76 countries. This includes 8.5 million doses provided as grants and commercial supplies of 34 million doses.Also read | Covid-19: Metro shut in stricter lockdown across DelhiLast month, other opposition parties also attacked the BJP-led Union government for exporting vaccines in the face of an unprecedented surge in Covid-19 cases. The government, however, rejected the criticism as “short-sighted”.“If you ask why are you exporting (vaccines) at all, somebody (else) will ask - why am I exporting to India. That is so short-sighted. Only non-serious, irresponsible people can make that argument,” external affairs minister S Jaishankar said last month.Close to 1.8 million individuals between 18 and 44 years have received their first Covid-19 vaccine shot, shows Union government data.“Ten states account for 66.78% of the cumulative doses given so far in the country,” said Union health ministry in a statement.As per the recent government data, nearly 500,000 Covid-19 positive cases currently are in the intensive care units (ICUs), with over 170,000 persons on ventilator support at various hospitals across the country, with many more seriously ill patients in need of a hospital bed.There was no response from the Union government and the BJP on Sisodia’s remarks till the time of going to press||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/sisodia-hits-out-at-centre-for-jab-exports-101620596398168.html
10-05-2021||Other||Now, Ludhiana Covid patients’ kin scramble for oxygen flow meter||While the oxygen crisis is not over yet, the shortage of flow meters has further added to the problems of Covid-19 patients and their kin, who are now left with little chance to catch a breath during their fight against the virus.An oxygen flow meter is a device that measures the flow of oxygen from an oxygen-dispensing unit to the user of the oxygen. The regulator valve usually has gauges like an oxygen flow and a pressure meter. If they are lucky enough to arrange an oxygen cylinder, chances are they may still end up struggling to arrange a flow meter. The shortage of flow meters and regulators can be gauged from the fact that the suppliers of these equipment are now reaching out to those who have successfully defeated Covid-19 so as to buy back the equipment at double the rates.Not only this, but hospitals are also being contacted to see if they have any broken flow meters or regulators that can be fixed.Lockdown hits supplyRishi Sood, a medical equipment trader, said, “It is an unprecedented situation. Like tocilizumab and remdesivir, there is now an acute shortage of oxygen flow meters and regulators, an essential product to operate the oxygen cylinder.”“The equipment was being supplied from Delhi and Kolkata but due to the lockdown in many places, many of the products are stuck in transit. Now, there is a waiting period of nearly a month for delivery of fresh stock,” said Sood.While the flow meter made in Kolkata is costlier, the ones made in Delhi are sold at affordable rates, said Sood. Hoarding, panic-buying also a problemAccording to Ludhiana district chemist association general secretary GS Grover, hoarding and black-marketing are also leading to the shortage. The equipment which was being sold for ₹1,000 a few months ago is now being sold for ₹2, 500 to ₹3,000 in wholesale markets and for nearly ₹10,000 in retail markets. Rishi Sood added that panic buying is also to be blamed. “Earlier, only those patients who were sick and required oxygen used to buy the product but now residents are indulging in panic- buying, which has also resulted in a shortage,” said Sood. ‘No luck online too’ Vikas Malhotra, a resident of BRS Nagar, said, “I tried medical shops near Dayanand Medical College and Hospital but no one seemed to have a flow meter. I even tried my luck online but it was not available there either. Finally, a friend sourced it through one of his contacts.” Punjab chemist association general secretary GS Chawla said, “The government must look into the matter and take action against those indulging in hoarding.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/now-ludhiana-covid-patients-kin-scramble-for-oxygen-flow-meter-101620592755956.html

He alleged that the even before the completion of the harvesting season, the government agencies had stopped the procurement on April 30 and several farmers from the state failed to sell their produce. “Farmers are telling us that their produce was not procured even after they had got the gate passes as the government stopped procurement without any prior intimation,” he added. He demanded the government to immediately resume the procurement so that all farmers could sell their produce on MSP.“This is another cruelty of the government on the farmers, but we warn the government of another protest if the procurement is not resumed immediately,” he added.The Haryana government had recently announced that said there would be no procurement of wheat in all mandis of the state during the lockdown and no gate passes will be issued. In a statement issued by the government on Thursday, total 83.49 lakh MT of wheat had arrived in 396 mandis of the state during this season and the government agencies had already procured 80.72 lakh MT wheat against the target of 80 lakh MT. Even an amount of ₹12,977 crore was directly deposited in the verified accounts of the farmers, the government claimed.Though the government did not mention whether the procurement will be resumed after the lockdown or not, the arhtiyas alleged that thousands of quintals of unprocured wheat was lying in the mandis since the government agencies stopped the procurement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/bkuchief-charuni-warns-of-agitation-if-wheat-procurement-not-resumed-101620592338816.html

10-05-2021||Chandigarh||Residents of Bhiwani village impose self-lockdown||Residents of Mundhal Khurd in Bhiwani have imposed a self-lockdown till May 13 after the village witnessed a surge in unreported deaths in the last two weeks. The decision was taken after prominent persons, elderly people and youths held a meeting recently and decided to ban the entry of outsiders.To break the chain, the villagers announced that all shops, except those selling medicines, will be opened from 7 am to 10 am till May 13. The medical stores will remain functional round the clock. Sarpanch Vijay Pal, who is leading the village until new panchayat forms, said more than 35 deaths were reported in the village in the last two weeks.“Entire village is suffering from fever, cough and cold. We have written to the DC to start testing in the village. Most of those who succumbed were people who had fever, but remained reluctant to get themselves tested. The health department had cremated bodies of five persons with Covid protocol at village crematorium. Many fatalities were Covid suspected deaths. We have no other option than to impose self-lockdown,” he added.The villagers have also restricted gathering of those playing cards and smoking ‘hookah’ has been banned across the village. “We have been demanding a hospital for a cluster of three villages here, but the government has not paid heeds to our demands. The village has a population of 15,000 and still there is no government hospital here. The primary health centres are at Dhanana and Talu villages, both 10km away from here,” the villagers said.Health department starts testingThe health department on Sunday collected 80 samples, reports of which are awaited. The sampling process will continue for the next couple of days, said officials.Bhiwani DC Rahul Narwal said they have also got information about the deaths at Mundhal Khurd village, but as per their record, only two persons died of Covid there. “The exact number of deaths will be ascertained after the families of the deceased register their deaths. The families will have to register the data within a month. We have started the sampling process and the true picture about the transmission of the virus will be known after the testing report comes out,” he added.Nine cremations in a single day in Rohtak villageNine pyres were burnt at Rohtak’s Madina village crematorium on Saturday. Former Congress’ Meham MLA Anand Singh Dangi, who hails from the same village, said he had visited the houses of these nine persons, who died on Saturday.“Most of them were suffering from fever. Our village has reported more than 42 deaths in the last three weeks. I have requested the administration to provide oxygen beds at the community health centre at Madina, but my pleas were turned down. Seven to eight people have died due to Covid in various private hospitals,” he added.Sarpanch Karambir Foji said villagers are reluctant to get themselves tested and people have fear of Covid. “In the history of our village, we had never witnessed more than 40 deaths in three weeks. We are urging people to appear for testing and vaccination,” he added.Senior medical officer Dr Joginder, who is in charge of the village, said there has been a rise in deaths and the sarpanch can provide actual figures.“Some people had died of Covid too. We would be able to say more about total deaths after registration only. Nine deaths were reported on Saturday. The people are suffering from fever here. More people are coming forward for vaccination than testing. The situation in this village is challengeable as compared to other villages,” he added. In Karnal, 200 MBBS students to offer tele-consultation to patients in isolation With the help of 200 MBBS final-year students, the Karnal district administration has launched a home care and tele-consultation system to provide medical assistance to Covid patients isolated at home. As per the health authorities, the initiative will help to avoid hospitalisation of non-critical patients.Karnal DC Nishant Kumar Yadav said the MBBS students of Kalpana Chawla Government Medical College and Hospital have been given proper training and they will dial all home-isolated patients to provide them all required information and medical assistant over phone.“Over 92% patients don’t require hospitalisation and MBBS students will talk to all home isolated patients regularly,” he said, adding that if required, they will also advise them when to seek hospital admission. He said that one student will have list of 25 patients and they will track their medical records regularly. As per the information, the district administration was facing shortage of hospital beds and now, all 500 beds with oxygen support and 220 beds in ICUs are already occupied. The district administration has set up 100-bed temporary hospitals in Panchayat Bhawan to accommodate more patients.

This arrangement has been continuing even when there is a provision of hiring lawyers for court cases and sufficient clerical staff is available with the directorate after re-structuring of posts from February onwards,” the official said.State medical education minister OP Soni said the services of the doctors posted anywhere on deputation are required in the field to fight the pandemic.“The directions have already been issued to the director of medical education and research to relieve these doctors and send them to their parent departments immediately.

10-05-2021||Chandigarh||Mansa admn ropes in quacks to contain virus spread in villages||Amid surge in Covid infections, the Mansa district authorities have started roping in quacks to serve as the first line of defence in the battle against the virus. Quacks are unqualified rural healthcare practitioners who are often consulted by villagers for most ailments.Mansa, predominantly a rural district, has reported 2,766 infections and 24 deaths since May 1. The district has 3,003 active cases of which, around 2,000 are from the rural belt. The authorities say the trend is alarming but the situation is more serious as villagers are not sharing their health conditions. Additional deputy commissioner (development) Amarpreet Kaur Sandhu, who is coordinating Covid management at the district level, said villages have seen a spurt in Covid-related deaths in the last 15 days. “Narinderpur and Nangal are among two villages where several deaths were reported due to suspected Covid infection in the last fortnight. People are reluctant to respond to government medical teams for testing and medication. Since Tuesday, we engaged three quacks of Narinderpur to supply Covid kits to ailing villagers and they have been asked to administer medicines as per the pandemic protocol,” said Sandhu.Mansa is a hotbed of farmer union activities and people from the rural areas of the district have a significant presence at dharna sites on the Delhi border.Sandhu said more quacks will be taken on board in other villages to contain the virus. She, however, clarified that untrained workers are not treating Covid patients.“Scores of people of these two villages are frequently attending dharnas and falling sick. As people are not going for vaccination and testing, we decided to take the assistance of quacks to handle the situation. People in the area traditionally rely upon these unqualified healthcare providers and we have started taking their help to contain infection spread,” said the ADC.Village panchayats have been roped in to provide thermometers to ailing persons and motivating sick villagers to practice home isolation, besides boosting immunity with simple home remedies. Sick patients are also being provided health supplements through quacks and it is being ensured that these untrained resources do not offer un-prescribed medication to the suspected Covid patients, he said. “Against an estimated target of 3 lakh population above 45 years in the district, only 54,000 have come forward for vaccination to date. It is a cause of concern that people are frequently attending protests and Covid guidelines are not being followed,” said Mansa civil surgeon Dr Sukhwinder Singh.He said community leaders should come out to make people understand the gravity of the medical emergency and ask them to follow instructions to break the virus chain.“Fully occupied hospitals and lack of space at cremation grounds reflect the ground reality of infection spread. But unfortunately, a sizeable section of Mansa population continue to underestimate the major threat of Covid infection,” she added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/mansa-admn-ropes-in-quacks-to-contain-virus-spread-in-villages-101620590655457.html

He is scheduled to leave for Mumbai on Monday and will serve at the facility for the next couple of weeks.A specialist in anaesthesiology and critical care, Dr Harman, who did his MBBS in Amritsar Government Medical College before moving to New York in 2011, has also imparted training to many doctors and nurses in the holy city, especially at Dukh Niwaran Hospital, at par with the modalities being used in New York hospitals. He returned to India on April 1 this year.Harman says he would continue extending his help to all those in need until the situation becomes normal in India. His father, RPS Boparai, is an orthopaedic specialist, while his mother, late Gian Kaur, was a gynaecologist. Harman said his mother, who passed away in 2011, had inculcated the value of sewa (volunteer service) in him during his childhood and young age.“As soon as I came back to India, though the cases were not so high at the time, I started talking to the doctors here on how we can build capacity in case cases surge, apart from strengthening the infrastructure to handle any kind of crisis. Soon enough, we saw a catastrophic rises in the cases in India. I have been able to build a capacity for intensive care at Dukh Niwaran Hospital, besides imparting training to the nurses and doctors regarding the Covid protocol that I learnt in New York during the first wave,” Harman said.Dukh Niwaran Hospital, which has now been given on lease, was run by Harman’s father as a charitable hospital.Sharing his views on India’s Covid situation, he said, “We have not been able to contain the spread of the virus for various reasons here, even though we had time to prepare for the bad waves as were seen across the world earlier. We could have vaccinated many more people so far. But, due to issues in the system, help couldn’t reach many in time.”He said, “Doctors in the health department, especially in Punjab, have been working so hard in order to save lives. We must continue to support them and give them our best wishes and solidarity, for this is not an easy job.”He also advocated imposing lockdown to break the chain of transmission.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/indianamerican-sikh-doctor-returns-to-roots-to-assist-in-covid-fight-101620590595656.html

Reading the HC orders on April 9, the state government spokesperson observed that as per direction, the investigation of these FIRs will be concluded expeditiously, preferably within six months from the date of the constitution of the SIT. “This court direction has been reproduced in the SIT re-constitution notification by the state government, which has been specifically barred from interfering in any manner,” added the spokesperson, further clarifying that as evident from the court directive, the period of six months is an upper limit which has been imposed by the HC, the spokesperson pointed out, adding that the SIT is free to conclude investigation before that. Reacting to criticism of the government on the six-month deadline, the spokesperson said it was clear that the notification, and the intent, of the state government had been misread and misconstrued by certain elements, motivated by vested political interests. The spokesperson further said that the SIT had already conducted its first meeting virtually on May 8, a day after it was constituted, and started the process of investigations by summoning the case file and other relevant records from the Faridkot court.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/kotkapura-firing-new-sit-free-to-conclude-probe-before-six-months-says-govt-101620590235470.html

It is too early to say anything. The trend has to be observed for at least 10-15 days,” said Dr Kant.According to the bulletin, 61,552 total tests were recorded on Sunday – as against an average of 73,657 tests each day over the previous two weeks.However, it must be noted that tests generally dip on the Sunday and Monday health bulletins owing to the weekend.Epidemiologist Dr PK Sharma, adviser to the New Delhi Municipal Council (NDMC), said: “It is good that the number of cases and the positivity rate have come down, but we should wait for some time before drawing any conclusion.

10-05-2021||Chandigarh||30% jump in demand in May so far, Punjab on verge of oxygen crisis||With a sharp spike in Covid-19 cases in the past two weeks, Punjab is on the verge of an oxygen crisis. The rising trajectory of coronavirus cases has led to a jump of more than 30% in demand of the life-saving resource, depleting its oxygen reserve to an all-time low of 10 to 12 hours during the devastating second wave of the pandemic. The oxygen allocation, which stands at 227 metric tonne (MT), has failed to keep pace with the rising demand despite repeated requests to the central government which has been flooded with similar requests from other states as the number of new infections is also at an all-time high in the country. Chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh, who has repeatedly requested the central government to increase its oxygen allocation, on Sunday again urged Prime Minister Narendra Modi to increase Punjab’s total oxygen quota to 300 MT in view of the growing caseload of critically ill coronavirus patients. “The oxygen demand has risen by more than 60 MT in the past eight days whereas our allocation has only increased by 10 MT. We have been managing so far by enhancing efficiency and dipping into reserve. If the patient load does not plateau and the increase does not keep pace, we are headed for tough times,” Ajoy Sharma, in-charge of Punjab’s Covid control room, said. Of the total allocation of 227 MT, 195 MT is from other states, including 90 MT from Bokaro, 15 MT from Roorkee, 10 MT from Dehradun, 20 MT from Panipat and 60 MT from Barotiwala and there lies another problem. The state authorities have not been able to lift their entire allocated quota, particularly from Bokaro, for want of tankers of lifting and distribution of oxygen. The state government had on its own arranged 21 tankers for lifting and distribution of oxygen, excluding tankers bound by contractual obligations of the plants from adjacent states that make direct supply to some hospitals, but needed more. A request was made to the central government to supply at least 20 tankers and two were given through Indian Oil Corporation (IOCL). “Against a total requirement of 36 tankers at present, only 20 are available, leaving a shortfall of 16 tankers, particularly needed to lift liquid medical oxygen from Bokaro,” according to officials. They said the state government has also called immediate attention to the need for immediate resolution of logistical issues, tankers and IAF sorties and for lifting the allocated Bokaro stock. “We have increased the number of tankers to Bokaro from two to four, but need more as turnaround time is four days,” said Sharma. The state team, which has requested for at least two sorties daily, held a virtual meeting on Sunday morning with IAF officials to review the situation and is also trying to explore train options. Also, the Centre has been requested to make oxygen allocation to the state from nearby sources and not from far off states.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/30-jump-in-demand-in-may-so-far-punjab-on-verge-of-oxygen-crisis-101620589935526.html

After killing the doctor at their residence in Chhatarpur’s Loknathpuram on April 29, she left for Jhansi in Uttar Pradesh the next morning and reported the death on May 1 after returning home.The SP said: “Dr Neeraj Pathak was found dead at his residence on May 1. His wife Mamta told the police that she had gone to Jhansi and when she came back on May 1, she found her husband dead. During investigation, police found an audio of Dr Pathak, which he had released on social media on April 28, that he was being harassed by his wife Mamta and son. When police interrogated Mamta, she confessed that she killed her husband by plotting electrocution.”The police are investigating if the couple’s 28-year-old son, Nitesh, was also involved in the murder.Sharma added: “Mamta was a professor of chemistry and she knew that the presence of sleeping pills or any poison wouldn’t be found in the postmortem report after two days of the death, so she made a plan to hide the death of her husband for two days. She gave an overdose of sleeping pills to Pathak on April 29 and later used a live electric wire to kill him inside their bedroom.”A forensic expert, who wished to remain anonymous, said it’s not necessary that traces of chemicals found in sleeping pills won’t show up in postmortem report as it could depend on several factors.The next day, the accused and her son left for Jhansi, reportedly to get tested for Covid-19. According to Mamata’s statement to the police, there was a backlog in collection of samples for Covid-19 testing in Chhatarpur.According to her statement to the police, the retired professor told Nitesh while leaving that his father was sleeping. Mamata and Nitesh returned home on May 1, when the accused reported that her husband died after being electrocuted.“Mamta suspected that her husband was in a relationship with another woman. A few months back, she lodged a complaint with police that her husband used to give sedatives to her in the night to meet a woman. Police investigated the matter and found the accusation to be false,” Sharma said.The 60-year-old woman has been booked under section 302 (murder) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC).(With inputs from HT Correspondent in New Delhi)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bhopal-news/retd-chemistry-professor-kills-doctor-husband-101620589608751.html

Now it has been extended till 5am next Monday,” Kejriwal said at an online press briefing on Sunday.He added that the “enforcement of the lockdown” will be stepped up and operations of the Delhi Metro -- which had been available for people engaged in providing essential services until now -- will be “completely shut down”.“We must remember jaan hai toh jahan hai... this time the lockdown will be stricter,” he said.Later in the day, an order issued by the Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA), which is chaired by lieutenant governor Anil Baijal, said: “Delhi metro services shall not function during curfew.”The order also prohibited any wedding ceremony at hotels, banquet halls, marriage halls or public spaces. Instead, such events can only be held in courts and in private spaces with a maximum gathering of 20 people, the DDMA order -- a copy of which has been reviewed by HT -- said.Also read | No metro, 20 people in weddings: Delhi to see stricter lockdown till May 17With Sunday’s announcement, Delhi has extended its lockdown for the third consecutive time, although this is the first instance of restrictions being tightened in this wave. The new restrictions will remain in place till 5am on May 17.Under the ongoing lockdown that was first imposed on April 20, when the city was well into its fourth wave of infections, a curfew was imposed except for specific activities (such as going to buy groceries and medicines, or for going to a hospital or airports/railway stations) but all essential services like food and medicine shops were allowed to operate.Weddings were previously allowed in banquet halls and hotels, but the gatherings were limited to 50 guests. Metro services were previously open for people engaged in essential activities and were running with 50% seating capacity.Kejriwal also said on Sunday the extension of the lockdown was necessary to further augment Delhi’s public health infrastructure as the city’s latest surge in Covid-19 cases inundated medical facilities and triggered an acute shortage of life-saving supplies such as oxygen and drugs.“On April 20, we were forced to impose a lockdown because of an unprecedented increase in Covid-19 cases. We were also running out of beds, ICUs, etc. On April 26, the positivity rate increased to 35%. After April 26, because of the lockdown, the situation slowly started improving. Positivity rate has now reduced to 23%... We cannot afford to go back to a worse situation from this stage. The situation has to be further controlled,” the chief minister said.On Sunday, Delhi added 13,336 new cases (fewer than its daily average of 19,383 for the previous seven days on account of low level of testing on weekends) and 273 deaths.The test-positivity rate -- which refers to the proportion of samples tested for Covid-19 returning positive -- also dropped to 21.67%, the lowest in 23 days, data from the government’s daily health bulletin issued on Sunday showed.Also read | 'Need 83 lakh Covid doses every month': Kejriwal explains 3-month plan to CentreDespite indicators of the situation easing, there are still 86,232 active cases in the city and a majority of hospital beds occupied. Of the total 22,545 beds across the Capital, 19,912 are occupied and 2,633 vacant.“We used the lockdown period to strengthen health infrastructure. Oxygen beds were added. We need to continue doing that. We also faced a severe shortage of oxygen because of the high number of cases and high proportion of severe cases compared to the past three waves. Now the oxygen situation has slightly improved with the interference of the Supreme Court and the Delhi high court, and cooperation of the central government,” the chief minister said.Burdened by the massive caseload, hospitals across the national capital sent out several distress calls, resorting even to making appeals on social media websites, as their stocks of medical oxygen dwindled rapidly from the third week of April.Police authorities will ensure effective checking of persons and vehicles on roads by putting an adequate number of pickets, the DDMA order said. “Delhi Police will also ensure that movement of individuals and vehicles should be allowed strictly as per the guidelines/protocols prescribed in the curfew order,” it added.Traders on Sunday welcomed the Delhi government’s move to introduce more curbs, but raised concerns over enforcement.Praveen Khandelwal, national secretary-general of the Confederation of All India Traders (CAIT), said: “There is huge movement of people without any checking. Not only shops but all kinds of activities, except essential commodities, should remain locked down. All the borders of Delhi should be equipped with strict checking of individuals and vehicles. Strict vigilance is required at airports, railway stations, bus terminals, etc.”Brijesh Goyal, chairman of the Chamber of Trade and Industry and an Aam Aadmi Party leader, said: “We did a survey of 480 traders across the city and 65% of them were in favour of increasing the lockdown for another week. Large number of traders have assured that they will adhere to all regulations concerning the lockdown.”Watch | India receives 3 oxygen generators, 1000 ventilators arrive from UKBanquet hall owners, however, said their businesses will take an even bigger hit. “We were told that the curfew was temporary. Both the chief minister and LG had requested people to not leave the city. Our staff that had stayed back has nowhere to go now. Our earnings have come to a halt and with so much uncertainty, we are not sure if we can continue to pay their salaries anymore,” said Ramesh Dang, president of the Community Welfare Banquet Association Delhi.Greesh Bindra, vice-president, operations, The Suryaa, also said that the hotel will push for the deferment of wedding ceremonies. “We will not refund the money but give an option to the customer so that they can come back to us once the curfew is over. The advance amount paid for blocking the date is never refundable,” he said.Kejriwal spoke of the city’s vaccination drive on Sunday and again appealed the Centre to provide more doses to the Delhi government. “The vaccine drive has also been expanded now. All arrangements are in place and turnout is high. There is a shortage of stock but we have sought help from the central government in this regard and we are sure this will be resolved soon,” he said.“The situation in Delhi is not under control yet. Patients are not getting hospital beds, ICUs, ventilators, oxygen, medicines, etc. Even though the Covid-19 numbers and positivity rate are going down, as per the government’s health bulletins, it is too early to draw conclusions. Delhi needs more time to bring the situation under control. It is extremely necessary to minimise gatherings, crowds and the possibility of large number of people in any space. The lockdown is an important step in that regard,” said Dr Lalit Kant, former head of the epidemiology at the Indian Council of Medical Research.(With inputs from Sadia Akhtar in New Delhi)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/covid19-metro-shut-in-stricter-lockdown-across-delhi-101620588363310.html
10-05-2021||Other||Among unsung heroes: ward boys, attendants, cleaning staff at Covid hospitals||New Delhi While the pandemic has thrown doctors and nurses to the forefront of the fight against the infection in the national capital, supporting their efforts are thousands of ward boys, attendants and sanitation staff who have been working tirelessly behind the scenes.In most hospitals across Delhi, at least two such staff, known as multi-tasking staff (MTS), work in each ward in every shift, sharing tasks including serving food to patients, helping clean them or change clothes, clean the wards, checking oxygen saturation levels, and shifting patients from one ward to another. In many cases, they have also become a medium to connect patients with their family who are not allowed enter the Covid wards.Manoj Kumar Paswan (37), a ward attendant at Ram Manohar Lohia (RML) hospital, looks after at least 20 patients during his regular morning shift. “First I serve breakfast to all the patients. It’s important for them to eat first so that they can have the first dose of medicine for the day. Many of the patients are either very weak or old and require assistance to eat. I also help such patients in changing their diapers, clean them and change their clothes. It’s difficult to work but if we won’t do it, who else will help patients at a time when their own family members cannot meet them,” he said.Paswan said as soon as he comes out of the Covid ward after his duty, the family members of patients’ waiting outside approach him to check the well-being of their loved ones. “I tell them whatever I know. Only doctors can tell the exact situation but I try to ease their pain by talking to them. It is such a helpless situation when a child cannot meet his father or mother, or a wife cannot see her husband or vise versa,” he said. Similar experiences have been shared by attendants in other Covid hospitals. Tirath Ram, a helper at the municipality-run Swami Dayanand Hospital, said that many patients admitted at the hospital belong to economically weaker sections, who do not own smartphones. He said that he does not hesitate in passing on his phone number to their family members so that they can be in touch with each other or at least enquire about the well-being of the admitted patients. “Doctors and nurses are busy and are often not very approachable. When a patient is admitted I often give my personal phone number to family members so that they can enquire about their health. It takes me only a few minutes to go check on them. Covid symptoms are treated by doctors, I can only provide some mental peace to patients and families that are already stressed,” said Ram. Abhishek Singh, an attendant at Lok Nayak Hospital, said that many times, patients seek help to make video calls to their family members. “It feels so difficult to just hold the phone when people at both sides are just weeping. There is hardly any communication between the severe patients and their family members. They just want to see their loved ones...It feels good to help them,” he said.While hospitals do not allow families to come inside Covid wards, these helpers and sanitation workers are also helping patients run small errands, such as buying snacks that they crave or passing on messages to their family members. Thirty-eight-year-old Suresh, who is lovingly called ‘Suni bhaiyya’ at the Hindu Rao Hospital, said that two weeks ago, a 19-year-old patient was admitted to the hospital and she had expressed her wish to eat Parle-G biscuits during his morning cleaning duty. “She was nearly my sister’s age and how much can one eat hospital food. I bought her two packets of Parle-G at my own expense. She was so happy to get it. The situation is so grim these days that all you hear from each ward is news of people dying. These are the small joys that we are holding on to,” Suresh said. Some attendants said they also encountered “misbehaviour” by family members of patients who succumb to the virus. A ward attendant in Guru Tegh Bahadur Hospital said, “A few days ago, a patient could not be revived during resuscitation as he was brought in very critical. The family members started to abuse us and the nurses. We tried to make them understand that we did our best but they resorted to creating a ruckus. We had to call in the security.”Meanwhile, many said the fear and guilt of infecting family members is eating at them. Rai, who lives with his family of six including elderly parents, said, “Even as I wear PPE kit all the time in the Covid ward, the fear of infection is always there. So many of our colleagues and their family members have tested positive for Covid-19 since April. Some of them even have even died. If people living in big houses are getting infected, what are the chances of a family of six living in a two-room set of not getting the virus?”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/among-unsung-heroes-ward-boys-attendants-cleaning-staff-at-covid-hospitals-101620588794711.html
10-05-2021||Delhi||Deputy CM calls for inquiry into 23 missing Covid patients||Deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia on Sunday called for an urgent inquiry into 23 Covid-19 patients going missing from the North Delhi Municipal Corporation’s Hindu Rao Hospital.Taking cognizance of a report published in Hindustan Times on Sunday, Sisodia said in a letter, “It is very shocking that to note that such a large number (of) Covid-19 patients have gone missing from Hindu Rao Hospital in spite of separate wards... It is not only dangerous to the lives of these patients but also a setback to the efforts of the government, which has imposed curfew/lockdown to break the chain and to check the spread of this dreaded disease.”Directing health department to submit the findings by Monday evening, Sisodia said, “Responsibility [should] be fixed and action be taken against the erring officials.”Also read | 23 Covid-19 patients missing, Delhi's Hindu Rao Hospital says﻿HT reported on Sunday that between April 19 and May 6 this year, 23 Covid-19 patients admitted to HIndu Rao hospital left without informing the hospital authorities. The hospital currently does not know whether these patients have transferred into other Covid hospitals or have left for their homes.While the civic body officials said that they informed police about instances of patients leaving against medical advice (LAMA), Delhi Police officials on Saturday denied having received any complaint from either the hospital or the municipality.This is not the first time that the Hindu Rao Hospital has reported such cases. Last year, between June 27 and July 18, five Covid positive patients left the hospital without informing the authorities.Jai Prakash, mayor of the BJP-ruled civic body, said the corporation will do everything to give the details of the 23 missing patients. However, he said that the security of the Covid-19 hospitals in Delhi is managed by the Delhi’ government’s civil defence and the deputy CM should seek answers about the lapse in security from their own officials. “Why doesn’t the government first call an inquiry on the hoarding of oxygen cylinders and other equipment by their own ministers and MLAs, or regarding the shortage of oxygen supply in the city that led to the death of so many people in Delhi?” Prakash said.BJP spokesperson Praveen Shankar Kapoor said the Delhi government should question their own officials as the security of the Hindu Rao hospital and other Covid-dedicated hospitals is managed by the government’s civil defence.“Security to all Covid hospitals is being provided by Delhi government’s civil defence and it is civil defence that owes a reply for missing patients from a hospital of north corporation,” Kapoor said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/deputy-cm-calls-for-inquiry-into-23-missing-covid-patients-101620588734746.html
10-05-2021||Delhi||Cops in PPE on guard outside Covid-19 wards as Delhi hospitals turn high-security prisons||Outside a room in the Covid wing at All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), four police personnel wearing PPE suits stand on guard round-the-clock. Unlike other Covid-19 patients, who are lodged in wards and share space with others, underworld gangster, Chhota Rajan alias Rajendra Sadashiv Nikalje,62, is lodged in a single room because of the threat to his life. Since April 24, when he was shifted from Tihar jail number 2 to AIIMS, the police’s quick reaction team (QRT) has also been posted at the AIIMS campus along with many others in plain clothes to keep an eye on suspicious movement in the facility.In East Delhi’s Guru Teg Bahadur hospital, where at least 14 Covid-19 prisoners are lodged, police and hospital authorities have dedicated one of the building gates only to the entry and exit of those going to the prisoners’ ward. This is where one of Delhi’s top gangster, Gaurav Jhareda was lodged until Thursday along with at least other Covid prisoners. Jhareda died of the infection on Thursday night. The entry to the building where the prisoner-patients are lodged is sealed by police barricades. Private security guards and Delhi police personnel monitor every suspicious movement.As cases of Covid-19 continue to spread rapidly inside Delhi’s Tihar jail, prompting the jail administration to shift some prisoners to hospitals outside, many hospitals across the city have turned into high security zones with police personnel in some cases donning PPE kits to guard them inside Covid wards. Until last week, when former gangster turned politician Mohammed Shahabuddin was admitted to the Deen Dayal Upadhyay Hospital, armed police officers in PPE kits guarded his room. In north Delhi, the Burari hospital has been transformed to a mini-temporary jail with at least 21 prisoners admitted there.Also read | Covid-19: Metro shut in stricter lockdown across DelhiA GTB hospital security guard, who wished not to be named said, “On Thursday night, that man(Gaurav Jhareda) died at the hospital. The following day, when his body was being taken for cremation in an ambulance, many of his friends had come and wanted to take photographs. It was very scary. Those men looked tough and insisted on opening the PPE kit to see his face. There were so many people recording the video of the body being transported.”Explaining the need for tight vigil at the hospitals, an officer from the Delhi police special cell, who wished not to be named, said, “Hospital is the most misused place to escape from custody. On March 25, gangster Kuldeep Fajja, who had come to GTB hospital for a medical check,fled from outside the hospital after a shootout with police. These gangsters are desperate and will try to escape the moment they are out. Because of the killings they have been part of, they are also targeted by rival gangs at the hospitals. The fear of Covid-19 prisoners spreading infection after fleeing the hospital is not so much, in comparison to the danger they possess if they escape.”In September last year, a convicted criminal named Mehtab Ahmed, involved in over 10 cases of murder, snatching, kidnapping and robbery, who was admitted at the Lok Nayak hospital for Covid-19 escaped after breaking the window grille of the hospital’s bathroom. He was arrested again after a shoot out.Explaining, the nature of threat to prisoners such as Rajan or Shahabuddin’s outside the jail, the officer quoted above said that even inside Tihar, the two men were lodged in solitary confinement. In Rajan’s case, the Intelligence Bureau had on many occasions alerted Tihar officers to allow only his wife and no other family member to visit him. The IB had also said that Rajan’s rivals could use Delhi’s gangsters behind bars to murder him in prison.Currently, Tihar has 249 active cases of Covid-19. The spread of the infection inside Tihar has been quicker and far more compared to the last three waves in Delhi.In February, there was not a single case of Covid-19 among prisoners or jail officials. Even until April 6, the jail had only 19 cases of Covid-19 among prisoners. But in the last one month, Tihar has reported over 300 Covid-19 cases among prisoners. Six prisoners have died of Covid-19 in the last two weeks.Starting this week, the prison department will release around 5000 prisoners as one of the steps to decongest prison complex. The prison administration is preparing a list of nearly 5,000 undertrials who could be released either on interim bail for 90 days or on eight weeks’ parole following a Supreme Court-appointed high-powered committee recommending that the prison be decongested in view of the “alarming” and “threatening” situation of the pandemic in the Capital.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/cops-in-ppe-on-guard-outside-covid-wards-as-city-hospitals-turn-high-security-prisons-101620588675331.html

However, due to lack of vaccines TMC is unable to approve the same. The city did not have any vaccination scheduled on Sunday. Around one lakh citizens are still awaiting their second dose in the city. Over three lakh citizens have been inoculated till now in the city.There are around 700 housing societies that have come forward to conduct vaccinations within their premises. Thane Citizen Foundation (TCF) has prepared an online petition for housing societies to put forth the demand for vaccination centres. “TCF gets the support of 700 housing societies to start a vaccination drive in their premises. All support will be given to the TMC. Some residential complexes like Hiranandani Meadows and Laxminarayan Residency have already started preparations and provisions to convert their clubhouses into inoculation centres. This will save the hassle for many and also help vaccinate as many people as possible systematically. We are only awaiting TMC permission now,” said Kasber Augustine, president, TCF. K Kumar, President, Progressive Thane Residents Association, said, “We have written to the civic body commissioner. There are 20 housing complexes within our vicinity with a population of over 3.5 lakh people. We would like to extend our support to the civic body by providing space at the Vasant Vihar Clubhouse which is centrally located and easily accessible. If our proposal is approved a major population of the city can get vaccinated.” Meanwhile, TMC is reeling under the shortage of vaccination; “We have provisions for 56 centres and can start jumbo centres as well. Plans to come up with Drive-in facilities are also in place. However, there is a shortage of vaccination and our current focus is to provide booster doses to all those who have taken the first dose of the vaccination. If we get ample doses, we shall initiate all of this along with special camps in slum pockets,” said Sandeep Malvi, deputy municipal commissioner, TMC.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/thane-societies-want-to-conduct-vax-drive-tmc-says-no-doses-available-101620588675975.html
10-05-2021||Delhi||Pet boarding facilities inundated with requests from Covid-affected families||With the national capital grappling with an unprecedented surge in Covid-19 cases amid the fourth wave, many individuals and families are turning to boarding facilities for their pets. Owners of pet boarding facilities across the city said there has been a significant increase in the number of requests for taking in pets.Kuldeep Chauhan, owner of Pet Lovers Hut - Dog Boarding Centre, said his facility is receiving requests from people who are down with Covid-19 or are unable to meet the pet’s requirement due to restrictions. “During this time of the year, people leave behind their pets while going for vacations. This time, people are not going anywhere but our facility is full due to requests from Covid-affected individuals and families. There are instances where the owners have died of Covid and their dogs are left with us,” said Chauhan. He said that the number of requests pouring in due to the pandemic is higher this time. “Last year, we did not get this many dogs. This time, there is a stark difference.”Arun Shivakumar, who runs Asha Arun’s pet home boarding, said the facility has been receiving more and more requests from Covid-affected families since last month. “We receive at least ten calls a day from people battling Covid-19. Last year, we did not have any requests from covid patients in April-May,” said Shivakumar.He said he also received requests from people who want to give up their dogs for adoption as they can’t take care of them due to Covid-19. “My wife and I have conducted counselling sessions with such pet parents to make them understand that Covid is temporary,” said Shivakumar.Also read | 13.3k more Covid-19 cases in Delhi: Fewest in 27 daysNandita Sikka, CEO, Heal Your Paws, a facility located at Sainik Farms, also echoed similar sentiments. “I have been getting a lot of requests from people who are unable to step out of their houses and take their dogs for walks due to concerns arising out of Covid-19. We are taking care of dogs whose owners are Covid positive or are busy in covid-related duties,” said Sikka.In view of the prevailing situation, board facility owners have also adopted additional precautionary measures. Sikka said the staff at the facility have been tested for Covid and are taking extra sanitization measures. Other facilities have introduced mandatory sanitisation of pets.“We have introduced some changes in the processes that we undertake while admitting a new member to the boarding facility. We have created a designated spot at the entrance of the facility where owners are asked to tie the dog. Following that, our caretaker gives the dog a bath, only after which he can enter the kennel. We are not holding any interaction with the pet parents in the current situation,” said Chauhan.He said while most people are upfront and inform the facility if Covid is the reason behind the boarding request, some people do conceal information. “At least three families did not inform us that they had Covid. To avoid such incidents, we introduced the additional layer of sanitization process at the entrance,” said Chauhan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/pet-boarding-facilities-inundated-with-requests-from-covid-affected-families-101620588674761.html

On Sunday, the state Covid task force members interacted with 700 private doctors from Mumbai to clear doubts raised by them over the Covid treatment protocol. Last week, similar interaction was held with 300 private doctors from Mumbai.“Family doctors play an important role. If they guide the patients at the initial stage, it will be helpful to curb the virus spread,” Thackeray said during the virtual meeting held on Sunday. “If the doctors keep a check on the treatment of patients in home isolation and update ward officers regularly, the civic body can make treatment management of patients in a proper way,’’ Thackeray added.He added that family doctors can give a lot of mental support to patients initially. “Family doctors can identify symptoms and check whether the patient is asymptomatic or needs hospitalisation. Family doctors should focus on patients in home isolation take a call so that they can be shifted to hospitals on time if required,” he said. Amid the shortage of doctors in the city, Thackeray also appealed to private doctors to register themselves in the Covid Care Centers and jumbo field hospitals in their vicinity and visit the places for consultation.Dr Pradeep Vyas, additional chief secretary (health), Covid task force head Dr Sanjay Oak, and task force member Dr Shashank Joshi and Dr Rahul Pandit, along with Dr TP Lahane, director-general of the directorate of medical education and research interacted with these private doctors, resolved their queries, answered their doubts on the treatment protocol for Covid patients. The doctors were also told to keep an eye out for children and infants developing symptoms such as fever, cold, diarrhoea, loss of appetite, etc.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-cm-launches-majha-doctor-initiative-to-involve-family-doctors-in-fight-against-covid-101620588614690.html
10-05-2021||Delhi||Regulate supply of Covid-19 vaccine shots: Delhi CM Kejriwal writes to health minister Harsh Vardhan||Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Sunday wrote to Union health minister Harsh Vardhan and asked that the Centre regulate the supply of Covid-19 vaccines to the states while ensuring that they receive enough doses to inoculate all their residents, even as he urged that the Serum Institute of India (SII) and Bharat Biotech — the two firms manufacturing vaccines in India — be directed to increase supplies to Delhi between May and July.“The central government should make available to the states the requisite number of vaccines to enable vaccination of all its citizens. The central government should actively monitor and supervise the manufacture of vaccines by private parties so that supplies in adequate quantity are made to all state governments and this crucial aspect is not left to the discretion of the private manufacturers,” read Kejriwal’s letter, a copy of which HT has seen.The letter comes a day after Kejriwal, in a digital press briefing, said Delhi only had enough Covid-19 vaccine stocks to last five to six days, and urged the Centre and manufacturers to expedite supplies, so that “every adult in the national capital can be inoculated within three months.”Spokespersons of the Union health ministry did not respond to requests for a comment.In his letter, Kejriwal also said the Delhi government has approached Dr Reddy’s Labs for the Russian-made Sputnik V, the third vaccine approved for use in India.Dr Reddy’s Labs, which is conducting clinical trials in India on behalf of the makers of Sputnik V, received the national regulator’s emergency use approval for the jab last month. The company will import the vaccine for use in India.In his letter, Kejriwal also appealed that vaccines be priced uniformly, saying that the current model incentivises private manufacturers to “prioritise supplies” to private hospitals over state governments. He also flagged glitches in the CoWIN portal, leading to problems booking slots and urged the Centre to allow states to develop their own registration systems.Covishield, manufactured by SII, and Covaxin, produced by Bharat Biotech, are available to the Centre at ₹150 a dose. However, Covishield is sold to states for ₹300 a dose, while Covaxin is sold at ₹600.Spokespersons of neither SII nor Bharat Biotech responded to requests seeking comments.Also read | Sisodia hits out at Centre for jab exportsTo private hospitals, Covishield is available at ₹600 per dose, and Covaxin for ₹1,200.On May 2, the Supreme Court asked the central government about differential Covid-19 vaccine pricing. The current vaccination policy would “result in a detriment to the right to public health,” said the apex court, and maintained that the policy be “revisited”. The top court asked the Union government to consider procuring vaccines for all the states at the same price, which will then be liable to lift the allocated quantities, and respond by May 10.The Centre in an affidavit on Sunday night turned down the Supreme Court’s suggestion.Kejriwal’s letter to Vardhan further said: “We are procuring the required number of vaccines and providing them free of cost at the government centres. We have already placed supply orders with Bharat Biotech and Serum Institute (SII) and have approached Reddy’s labs for Sputnik vaccines.”The first consignment carrying 150,000 doses of the Russian Sputnik V vaccine landed in Hyderabad, Dr Reddy’s labs announced on May 1.“Delhi has a population of around 20 million, out of which 15 million are aged above 18 years (eligible for vaccines). Vaccinating all of them would need 30 million doses. We have received roughly five million doses so far. Therefore, we need about 25 million additional doses. But we are not able to receive supplies as per our requirement and even get firm delivery schedules. As the third wave is also anticipated soon, we want to complete vaccination of all people living in Delhi within three months,” the CM’s letter to Vardhan said.Till May 8, Delhi administered around 3.90 million doses of vaccines to people aged over 45 years and around 299,000 doses to people aged between 18-44 years, for whom the drive opened on May 1, the letter said.The letter also read, “To complete it (vaccination of all adults) in three months, we would need 2.3 million doses per month from government of India channel during the three months of May to July 2021 (for the 45+ beneficiaries). Delhi has around 9.2 million people in 18-45 age group I urge you to direct Serum Institute and Bharat Biotech to increase their monthly supplies to Delhi to 6 million doses per month during May to July 2021.”“Convergence of sincere efforts of the government of India, states and private sector is essential to ensure faster vaccination. But such convergence is getting constrained by the continued glitches in the CoWin app. These glitches are leading to most people spending valuable time for getting registered or for booking vaccine appointments. Also, a large number of people are not tech savvy to be able to register themselves. As we plan to expand vaccination for the 18-45 age group, such glitches should not be allowed to deprive people of vaccination. Hence, I request you to allow states to develop their separate apps or develop mechanisms other than apps to manage vaccination in their sites,” said the letter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/regulate-supply-of-covid-vaccine-shots-cm-kejriwal-writes-to-health-min-harsh-vardhan-101620588554733.html
10-05-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai’s case positivity rate down to 7.34%, says BMC||With the decline in Covid-19 cases, the city has also witnessed a drop in the number of citizens under home quarantined. The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) data shows that there is a 16% drop from 627,000 persons who were home quarantined on April 10 to 525,000, as of May 07. The city’s daily positivity rate was as low as 7% on Sunday as compared to around 25% in the first week of April.According to BMC officials, one of the reasons for patients under home quarantine going down is owing to the drop in the number of cases from high-rises, where maximum patients were home quarantined. As per the BMC data, 789 buildings and 9,785 floors were sealed on April 6, while 617 buildings and 8,658 floors, were reported to be sealed as of May 6. According to civic body officials, this is one indicator of the cases going down in the city. The high-rises in the city have been contributing over 85% of the daily cases in the second wave that started in the city from around February 10.A closer look at the data of home quarantine citizens reveals the number of citizens under home isolation had gone as low as around one lakh in February, however, with the second wave the number drastically went up. Meanwhile, on Sunday, the city reported 2,395 cases followed by 68 deaths, taking the tally to 675,630 and toll to 13,781. The city’s recovery rate is 90.11% with 608,866 recoveries. The city’s mortality rate is 2.03% with 51,165 active cases. The city reported 32,590 tests on Sunday wherein 7.34% were positive. The city’s former hot spot Dharavi reported 13 cases on Sunday, taking the total to 6,623. There are 755 active cases in Dharavi and 5,540 discharges.Reacting to the fall of patients under home isolation, Dr Siddarth Paliwal, city-based physician said, “The number of patients under home isolation does not reveal the number of active Covid-19 cases, but yes, it is an indicator of the intensity of spread. Currently, we have over 525,000 citizens under home isolation whereas our active cases are less than 100,000. Hence, these also include high-risk contacts, those under isolation post-recovery etc.”‘Allegations about under-reporting baseless’BMC denies Fadnavis allegations on under-reporting Covid casualtiesThe Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) on Sunday issued a statement, claiming that allegations of the civic body under-reporting Covid-19 deaths were false. Leader of Opposition Devendra Fadnavis on Saturday had alleged that the Mumbai civic body was manipulating data on infection rate and the number of deaths. Fadnavis had said that BMC has put the Covid deaths in the non-Covid deaths category to reduce the number of deaths due to Covid. However, the BMC said, “There have been allegations in the media and social media that a virtual picture is being painted by the BMC regarding the control of Covid infection in the BMC area. The allegations are completely baseless and the municipal administration has categorically denied it.”The BMC in the statement added, “The BMC is recording Covid tests and Covid deaths as per the criteria laid down by the World Health Organization and Indian Institute of Medical Research (ICMR). The administration’s relentless efforts to prevent infection are showing positive results in the Mumbai statistics. The administration aims to achieve ‘Mission Zero’ by gradually controlling the Covid situation. Mumbaikars are also cooperating in this along with all the people’s representatives and as a result, the infection is coming under control. The Supreme Court also praised the Mumbai model.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbais-case-positivity-rate-down-to-7-34-says-bmc-101620588495780.html
10-05-2021||Mumbai||Personal Finance: Financial planning for the pandemic||Many of us have had to face a sudden financial jolt due to unemployment or mounting medical bills on account of the pandemic. It may sound counter-intuitive, but there’s no better time than now to take a hard look at our finances and plan for a more secure future in the face of an uncertain present. Every problem is an opportunity in disguise. This means that notwithstanding the insecurity that this pandemic may have caused in terms of your long-term financial planning, certain necessary steps taken today can still help build financial security. The pandemic and its effect are expected to be prolonged, so it makes sense to implement the following strategies for your financial well-being in both the near and distant future. Build an emergency fund: We may have had to dip into our savings to manage our expenses the past year. However, not many people have an emergency fund in place. Typically, an emergency fund should help you coast through a year. It’s not necessary for this to be in cash. Keep the money in a savings account or in small fixed deposits that can be easily liquidated. Go for a budget makeover: There are many unessential items and services that we spend on. Identify them and curtail them immediately. This will leave you with enough money that you can save. Go through your monthly budget to identify where you can save cash. For example, you can forego travelling in your vehicle every day and carpool to cut down on how much you spend on fuel and parking. Get rid of your debts: Mounting credit card debt is never advisable, especially, because of the high interest rates associated with it. The recent fall in loan interest rates due to the economic fallout can relieve you of credit card debt. You can opt for refinancing your debt by securing a low-interest personal loan to repay your high-interest credit card debt. You can also opt for a credit card balance transfer to lower your credit card debt. Continue with investments: Many people panic after seeing stocks tumble. This has led many people to sell off their investments hurriedly as they see the value of their portfolio decreasing. With the stock market estimated to show an undulating movement due to continued volatility, it has become more important to consider all investments and review them in the light of renewed future goals and retirement plans. Depending on whether you are an aggressive investor or prefer moderate investments, you can continue to set aside your earnings in equity or debt. Refinance your loans: Banks have lowered interest rates on loans more than ever before, thus, allowing you to get rid of your current mortgage. If you had sought loans at floating interest rates, this is the right time to avail the benefit of low-interest loans. Alternatively, you may also consider getting your loans refinanced by taking a loan at a lower interest rate to repay your earlier loan. Atul Monga, CEO and Co-Founder, BASIC Home Loan, an automated platform for home loans in India says, “People should refinance home loan if they had same in the pre-Covid era at an interest rate of 8 or 8.5% or higher. Since they have been repaying the loan over a term of more than two to three years, they would have improved their credit score and should be eligible for a lower interest rate. Presently, banks offer interest rate at an average of around 7% per annum. In this case, refinancing will help reduce the monthly EMI to a larger extent. However, to keep the interest rate low, you should opt for a shorter loan tenure as longer tenure will imply high-interest burden.” Buy insurance: If you already have a health cover, it makes sense to renew with a higher health cover to meet sudden contingencies. You could consider a super top-up insurance plans if hospitalisation bills exceed the sum insured under your base medical insurance policy. Either way, buying a life insurance policy is not a choice anymore, but an imperative. Irrespective of the times that await us, it is important to take control of our finances and have a stronger financial plan in place.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/personal-finance-financial-planning-for-the-pandemic-101620588495219.html

10-05-2021||Mumbai||2.6 million Covid patients provided free treatment, Maharashtra govt tells HC||In an affidavit, the Maharashtra government informed the Aurangabad bench of the Bombay high court (HC) recently that 2,648,827 patients were provided free of cost treatment in Covid Care Centres across the state so far, while 406,749 patients of the 4,49,485 patients who were admitted in private hospitals have been covered by group private health insurance. The state also informed the court that it had 20 packages under the Mahatma Jyotiba Phule Jan Arogya Yojana (MJPJAY) through which free treatment was being offered to citizens from the economically weaker section.The information was provided in public interest litigation (PIL) which claimed that eligible persons were not getting benefits of the schemes, declared by the state through various Government Resolutions (GRs), issued in May 2020. The affidavit has also assured the HC of action being initiated against errant officials who have charged exorbitant amounts from patients eligible for the schemes.A division bench of justice Sanjay Gangapurwala and justice Shrikant Kulkarni, while hearing a PIL filed by Omprakash Shete through advocate AB Girase, was informed by the state that following the April 27 direction of the bench the state had filed the affidavit. The bench had directed the state that Covid-19 patients from weaker sections of society should get all medical facilities to their optimum level and that it was high time the state strictly implemented the MJPJAY.The court had stressed that the authorities should take all possible steps to provide treatment to all patients from weaker sections of society and they should not be deprived of healthcare facilities on financial grounds.On May 7, advocate Girase informed the bench that around 20 to 25 Covid-19 patients living below the poverty line and possessing all necessary documents had been charged around ₹1.34 lakh for treatment and such persons were also denied admission in Covid-19 dedicated hospitals.Additional government pleader SG Karlekar for the state referred to the affidavit and clarified that apart from patients on ventilators, 20 packages have been identified under MJPJAY wherein Covid-19 patients with moderate and severe symptoms could avail treatment. He added that grievances of patients who were charged with exorbitant rates have been registered and show-cause notices were issued to the concerned hospitals.After hearing submissions, the bench observed, “The only problem is about the implementation of the said scheme. In this exceptional time, a greater responsibility would be upon the government and its authorities to implement the benevolent scheme more fruitfully. We would be more concerned with the immediate treatment of such patients.” The bench further observed that eligible persons should not be asked to run from pillar to post and from one hospital to another for getting admitted only because of lack of funds. The court also directed the state government to inform it about the outcome of show-cause notices issued to errant hospitals and posted further hearing to June 22.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/26-million-covid-patients-provided-free-treatment-maharashtra-govt-tells-hc-101620588436167.html
10-05-2021||Mumbai||Discrimination: An unspoken chapter on most campuses||Priyanka Sahoo priyanka.sahoo@htlive.com Mumbai: In 2012, when Riya was pursuing her Masters at Tata Institute of Social Sciences (TISS), Mumbai, she had an assignment to write about her experience with caste discrimination. She scored four out of 10. “I don’t understand how I could get my own experience wrong. So I applied for revaluation and my score changed to 4.5,” said Riya, who now works as a research and advocacy officer at Dalit Women Fight, a group led by Dalit women for supporting survivors of caste atrocities. “The forms of caste discrimination we see now are more subtle and largely of everyday nature. It is a part of the classroom. Caste practices or behaviours, which are discriminatory in nature, are in the form of humour or subtle insults,” said Riya on Saturday during a webinar titled “Get out of the class”: Caste and casteism in our top institutions. The webinar was held after a series of videos of a professor verbally abusing students from marginalised communities went viral. On April 25, video recordings of Seema Singh, an associate professor from the department of Humanities and Social Sciences at the Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur (IIT KGP) emerged on social media. In the videos, which are now under review of the institute, Seema can be heard verbally abusing students purportedly belonging to scheduled caste (SC), scheduled tribes (ST) communities and those with physical disabilities during a preparatory class. The institute has now set up a fact-finding committee with senior faculty members on it. “The committee has submitted its report and we are in the process of acting on the recommendations of the committee,” said Tamal Nath, registrar, IIT Kharagpur. While the videos have led to an uproar among the student community, alumni networks as well as academia, students and experts interviewed by HT said caste discrimination was rampant in college campuses in more subtle forms. In 2013, Mahesh, then 17 years old, reached his dream destination-- the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Kharagpur, to pursue an integrated Master’s course in the Electrical Engineering department. Happy to have been admitted to one of the oldest IITs, he looked forward to meeting like-minded students from all over the country, where his identity as a Scheduled Caste wouldn’t matter. His actual experience, however, was very different. In the first couple of years, Mahesh scored poor marks in some subjects. “I blamed it on myself and even considered that I was not as sharp as others here. Although, by third year I realised that many others with as many marks as I got were clearing subjects and getting promoted, but I was being held back.,” said Mahesh, who was subsequently categorised as an ‘academically weak’ student—a tag that cost him two years of his academic career. “I felt more disappointed in myself. The ‘weak category’ tag appears on all academic information and soon you realise that a majority of the students in these categories belong to SC/ST/OBC/PD. There are no special classes/ tutorials/ help arranged to guide or teach these students. They are just marked out,” said Mahesh. The institute limits the number of credits per course that students, who are academically weak, can go for, unless authorised by the administration. Mahesh’s plea for extra credits, required for his course completion, was turned down six times, despite his parents making a plea with the institute. Without those extra credits, Mahesh couldn’t register for all required courses that he had to complete to get his degree. Due for graduation in 2018, Mahesh eventually graduated in 2020. “Students with equal or lower grade points were allowed to take extra credits. Most of the students disallowed from extra credits were from marginalised communities,” said Mahesh. Many students from SC, ST and Other backward classes (OBC) communities find themselves in the academically weak category and struggle to clear exams. Unable to handle the pressure, many drop out before they can complete their course. According to data revealed by the ministry of education in 2019, almost 48% of students dropping out of IITs in 2017 and 2018 were from reserved categories. Merit debate “What was your rank in the Joint Entrance Exam (JEE)?” is a question that is an essential part of introduction among students. “The first question that fellow students or seniors ask during introduction is what’s your JEE rank. As students admitted to reserved category seats have relatively lower ranks, it is very easy to deduce that we are from marginalised communities,” said an alumnus of IIT Bombay, who managed to complete his dual degree a year later than the due date. “I would often get into debates with my peers, who told me they respected me less because I had been admitted through the quota. They would tell me that I had taken up the seat of a meritorious student instead,” said the alumnus, who now works as a software engineer. “In most leading academic institutions, language becomes a prominent marker for merit. Merit is determined on your fluency in English,” said Avatthi Ramaiah, chairperson - Centre for Study of Social Exclusion and Inclusive Policies, at TISS. It is the subtle and systemic discrimination that is worse, according to Varun Singh, an alumnus of IIT Guwahati. “It took me five attempts to pass a subject. The colleagues that I helped prepare were able to clear the paper, but I wasn’t. On my fourth attempt, I asked the institute for my answersheet and I was denied the same. My professor, unprompted, told me that I shouldn’t worry about fudging of marks because of my caste. It hadn’t even occurred to me until then that my caste was a factor,” he said. “The current education system permeates discrimination in the name of merit. The idea of merit doesn’t take into account the social, emotional, academic, cultural and intellectual gap in students coming from diverse backgrounds,” said Govardhan Wankhede, former professor and dean, School of Education, TISS. Social anxiety For the first two years of her five-year integrated Master’s programme at the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Madras, the student from Kozhikode, did her best to remain invisible on campus. She became the first college goer in the family when she secured an admission to IIT Madras in 2012. “It was an intimidating experience. The campus is huge. Even as I was recovering from culture shock, one of the early learnings for me was people made fun of the way I talked. My peers made fun of my accent when I spoke in English,” said she said. Soon, she started to avoid social events altogether. “The casual remarks and the pressure to fit in started to become too much. I felt alienated. My anxiety started to peak and I was unable to hold conversation with people,” she said, adding she had to seek professional help to manage her anxiety. “In my experience while navigating or pursuing cases of caste discrimination, the war we fight is largely about endlessly explaining what just happened qualifies to be casteist, and why. What we get in return is denial,” said Riya. Students and alumni members that HT interviewed said they were often mocked for their language, clothes and eating habits. They emphasised on an urgent need for sensitising students of all castes and classes towards what constitutes discrimination. “Those who are born in higher caste and class are inherently in a position of social power. This power is used to discriminate. It is therefore necessary to teach students what is discrimination, how it happens, what happens when one makes a discriminatory remark. Students must be made aware of the social and legal consequences of discrimination for both the victim and victimised,” said Wankhede, who served as the liaisons officer for SC/ ST students for two decades. “Students, who raise their voices against discriminatory jokes or remarks, also accused of being ‘too sensitive’. Unsurprisingly, we end up making friends who are from SC and ST categories,” said the student from Kozhikode. “Systemic discrimination at the hands of teachers and friends affects the mental health of students coming from marginalised backgrounds, most of whom are first generation learners. We have seen how students are driven to suicide,” said Ramaiah. In 2016, the death of Rohith Vemula, a student at University of Hyderabad, allegedly by suicide, led to nationwide protests at campuses. In his suicide note, he accused the university’s administration of discrimination. At IIT Bombay, Aniket Ambhore, an SC student, died by suicide in 2014. While Ambhore’s parents have alleged that he was stressed owing to discrimination, a committee at the institute ruled out caste-based discrimination. More recently, Payal Tadvi, a second-year medical student at BYL Nair Hospital in Mumbai, died by suicide allegedly following discrimination at the hands of three colleagues. Students at IITs in their first year take a course in social sciences, but caste is not necessarily a part of these courses. “In the first year, it is necessary to teach students about caste privilege through a compulsory course,” said Ramaiah. DATA SPEAK*In 2019, data released by Ramesh Pokriyal Nishank, in a written reply to the Parliament, showed that of the 2,461 students, who dropped out of IITs in 2017 and 2018:- 371 were from the Scheduled Caste category- 199 from the Scheduled Tribe category- 601 from the Other Backward Classes category,*The government of India’s (GoI) norms require 10% of all seats to be reserved for students from economically weaker sections; 27% for OBC students; 15% for SC students; 7.5% for ST students; and 5% for students with physical disabilities. Quote:“Teachers are required to be upholders of the value system in our society. Through the teachers we prepare tomorrow’s citizens. When a teacher fails miserably, as it was in the recent case, it really hurts the system in the worst possible way and it takes a very long time to heal the wounds of hatred. As a teacher, I am ashamed of this incident at my alma mater,” said Subhasis Chaudhuri, director IIT Bombay.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/discrimination-an-unspoken-chapter-on-most-campuses-101620588374733.html

10-05-2021||Mumbai||HC reprieve till June 14 for jewellers who have not hallmarked gold ornaments||In a temporary reprieve for jewellers, the Bombay high court (HC) has directed the Union Ministry of Consumer Affairs, Food and the Public Distribution to consider the representation by a group of jewellers from Pune by May 15, who have challenged the January 15 order of the Centre which made hallmarking mandatory and prohibited selling and hallmark stamping of gold ornaments of higher purity (more than 22 carat). Meanwhile, the Nagpur bench of the Bombay High Court hearing a similar petition directed the Centre not to take coercive action against any jeweller till June 14 for not hallmarking their jewellery by June 1 as stipulated in the January order. The order reduced the hallmark grades to three and henceforth gold jewellery will be available in grades of 14 carat, 18 carat and 22 carat only. On April 29, a division bench of justice K K Tated and justice Nitin Borkar while hearing the petition filed by Pune Saraf Association through senior advocate Anil Anturkar and advocate Shubham Misar was informed that the January 15 order of the Centre was against Article 19 (1) (g) of the Constitution, which guarantees the right to practice any profession, trade or business. In light of this, the petition sought quashing of the January 15 order or stay on the order pending hearing of the petition. According to the order, jewellers will be able to sell only hallmarked jewellery and artifacts made of 14, 18 and 22 carat gold from June 2021, violations will attract penalty and imprisonment of one year. While arguing against the order, the association submitted that jewellers would suffer losses as they are prohibited from selling gold with high purity. It was argued that gold rings having purity between 23.5 and 24 carat was a source of acquisition of gold for people belonging to all economic classes and the prohibition on sale of 24-carat traditional jewellery would wipe out the cultural heritage of the state. After the court was informed that a representation seeking provision of facilities of assaying and hallmarking centres for all the districts in Maharashtra was pending, the Court asked the centre to decide the same on or before May 15 and also permitted the association to approach the vacation court in the event the decision on their representation was adverse. Meanwhile, a division bench of justice Sunil Shukre and Avinash Gharote at Nagpur directed the Centre not to take any coercive action against jewellers under BIS Act after All India Gems & Jewellery Domestic Council filed a petition through senior advocate Rohan Shah. The petition contended that the new regulation, which is to come into force from June 1, would affect nearly 5 lakh of jewellers in India. The Council argued that 488 districts in India did not have hallmarking centres and as inter district travel was restricted due to Covid it would not be possible for jewellers to get the six thousand crores pieces of jewellery hallmarked by June 1 and would end up being liable for punishment under BIS Act. The bench then directed the centre not to take any coercive steps against jewellers till next date of hearing on June 14. The petition at the Mumbai bench will also be heard on the same day.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/hc-reprieve-till-june-14-for-jewellers-who-have-not-hallmarked-gold-ornaments-101620588255810.html
10-05-2021||Mumbai||Locks on doors, barricades on Covid coaches to stop patients from stepping out in Palghar||The Western Railway (WR) on Saturday evening locked four doors of an isolation coach and put up barricades near few coaches after the government railway police (GRP) complained of Covid patients roaming on platform-3 of the 23 coach Covid Express. The patients were even spotted purchasing eatables from food stalls but were prevented by the GRP, on patrolling duty.A letter by the Dahanu Vaitarna Pravasi Sevabhavi Sanstha(DVPSS) on May 7, highlighted the lacunae in the way arrangements have been made for the patients. At present, there are three patients admitted inside the Covid coach. Around five coaches are made available which will house 90 patients.Senior inspector Yogesh Devre, Palghar GRP, said we found that the patients just open the door and take a stroll and even purchase food items from the food stalls. There are around 10-15 police personnel on patrolling duty, who stop them from stepping out. I have complained to the nodal officer Keshav Tarange and the station master,” said Devre. A few relatives were also seen interacting with the patients and offering them home-cooked snacks, even as the Palghar Municipal Corporation are providing food and drinking water free of charge, said Devre. “I have posted a few policemen on permanent duty before the Covid coaches to prevent patients stepping out,” said Devre.On May 1, the WR parked a 23-car Covid care isolation train at platform 3 at Palghar station, which has a capacity to admit 415 patients.Prathamesh Prabhutondulkar, a member of DVPSS, said, “The platform number 2 and 3 form an island with tracks on either side. While on one side the Covid coaches are parked on platform 3, on the other, local and express long-distance trains make a halt on platform 2, which is used by passengers on essential duties. Also, the patients admitted to isolation coaches share the same foot overbridge that is used by common non-infected people on essential duties. Hence it is a health risk for all, he added, in his letter to the WR.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/locks-on-doors-barricades-on-covid-coaches-to-stop-patients-from-stepping-out-in-palghar-101620588255240.html
10-05-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai: Citizens go outside city for Covid jabs||Even as private hospitals are still struggling with the procurement of Covid-19 vaccines for those above 18 years, the shortage of vials is forcing city-dwellers to book slots for jabs on the outskirts. While it is not illegal, public health officers have requested citizens to refrain from doing so. On May 6, a 28-year-old Kandivli resident travelled 32km to Thane with his 22-year-old sister to get the first shot of Covishield. After trying to book a slot for a jab in the city for five days, he decided to book an appointment in Thane. “My sister is on dialysis for the past two years after she got detected with a chronic kidney disease. Every alternative day, she has to undergo dialysis. So, it was essential that she got the jab at the earliest,” he said. In another instance, a 30-year-old Vasai resident booked appointments at a sub-district hospital in Jawhar, Palghar on May 7. But on May 8, when he along with his 26-year-old wife, went to the centre, the hospital asked outsiders to wait until they inoculated the locals. After immunising the locals, the others were asked to leave. When they resisted, the hospital staffers allegedly misbehaved with them. “Later, when the tehsildar appeared at the vaccination centre, he asked everyone to leave saying vaccines would not be given to outsiders. When one person asked the reason, he threatened to be arrested,” he said. State health minister Rajesh Tope said, “It’s injustice to rural people who are being deprived of the opportunity to get inoculated. People from the city should not do this. There is no need to panic over the limited supply of vaccine doses.” But citizens reasoned saying that it is not illegal to book appointments in other districts or outskirts if slots are available. “Mumbai is a part of Maharashtra and we pay taxes to the government. So, if needy people can find a slot, then they have the right to book it. Within seconds, the slots are getting over. This is so frustrating,” said the Kandivali resident. Pvt hospitals still in the dark From May 1, the Central government allowed private hospitals to inoculate those above 18 years. Of the hundreds of private hospitals in Mumbai, only two — HL Reliance (Girgaum) and Nanavati (Vile Parle) Hospitals – have got vials to inoculate the public above 18 years. Even after nine days of starting the fourth phase of the mass immunization programme, private hospitals in the city are still struggling to procure the vials. Dr Sujit Chatterjee, chief executive officer (CEO), LH Hiranandani Hospital, Powai, said, “We have not been able to get the vaccine from the BMC. We also do not know whom to contact. Nobody seems to have any answers.” He also held a conference call with the Serum Institute of India (SII) where he was informed that it would take them two-three months to supply the vials directly to the private hospitals. “They informed us that they are ramping up the production. Almost 50% of the vials would be given to the Government of India (GOI) and the other 50% vaccines would be provided to the Government of Maharashtra (GOM). If GOM doesn’t give the vaccines, we would have to procure it directly from the manufacturer which would take till the end June/July,” he said. Every day, major hospitals like Lilavati, Bombay and Jaslok Hospitals are getting over 35 queries from young adults about vaccination. “We have kept the infrastructure ready but if we don’t get the vials, we are helpless. Private hospitals can play an integral part in the mass immunisation programme, if we are given the vials,” said Dr V Ravishankar, CEO of Lilavati hospital. Maharashtra has reported the highest number of Covid-19 cases in the country and Mumbai is often considered the epicentre of the pandemic. At a time, when public health officers have already declared a possibility of a third wave in the next four-five months, local politicians have come down heavily on the Central government for their lack of preparedness. “As reported, the Central government has sent 6.6 crore doses of vaccines to 93 countries as a goodwill gesture, but other countries’ Covid-19 load has been far lower than India. The vials were enough to vaccinate all people in Mumbai and Delhi. We wouldn’t have faced any shortage,” said Rais Shaikh, Samajwadi Party (SP) legislator and corporator from Nagpada.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-citizens-go-outside-city-for-covid-jabs-101620588254735.html
10-05-2021||Chandigarh||Labourers’ exodus sets back GMADA’s water project by two more months||Labourers migrating back home in anticipation of longer lockdown has yet again put off Greater Mohali Area Development Authority’s project to bring additional water supply of 5 million gallons daily (MGD) from Phases 5 and 6 of Kajauli waterworks. Already delayed by 18 months due to the pandemic, the workers’ exodus is expected to set the project back by another two months. The project was initially slated to finish by December 2020, but the deadline was pushed to July 31, 2021, and now again to September this year.This, when Mohali is already facing a daily shortage of 10 MGD water, while the demand-supply difference shoots up to 12 MGD in peak summer. Presently, the city gets 10 MGD water from Kajauli waterworks and an equal volume from 75 tubewells.“Around 50% of our workers have gone back to Bihar and Uttar Pradesh fearing a longer lockdown. We don’t expect them to return soon. Earlier, we had 150 labourers to complete the construction of the water treatment plant at Singhpur, but the number has come down to 70,” said Davinder Singh, chief engineer of GMADA.The plant, which is being set up by a Vadodara-based company at a cost of ₹100 crore, was initially also delayed over whether to ready one for 5 MGD or 20 MGD supply, until GMADA decided to go for the second option..Chandigarh, meanwhile, is already getting its share of additional 35 MGD water under Phases 5 and 6 of Kajauli waterworks, which is located on the Bhakra mainline canal near Morinda in Rupnagar district, and caters to the water requirement of Chandigarh, Mohali and Chandimandir.MC councillor Kuljeet Singh Bedi, who had filed a case in the Punjab and Haryana high court regarding the water shortage in Mohali, said, “The project for additional supply is being repeatedly delayed due to lackadaisical attitude of the officials concerned, while the public continues to suffer.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/labourers-exodus-sets-back-gmada-s-water-project-by-two-more-months-101620588196974.html

Patients can apply for the facility through the portal http://oxygenhry.in. Applicants will have to upload a photograph of their oximeter so as to ascertain their oxygen levels and their Aadhaar Card and provide details such as age and address. Panchkula deputy commissioner Mukesh Kumar Ahuja said demands will be verified by a team of officials, who will telephonically contact the patient and simultaneously seek feedback from the doctor to whom a particular sector has been assigned. Thereafter, volunteers of the Red Cross Society and other non governmental organisations (NGOs) will provide an oxygen cylinder to the patient.The DC has also constituted a team of officials, to be monitored by Magistrate Simranjeet Kaur, to assist the Red Cross secretary in refilling the oxygen cylinders. Rate of O2 cylinder fixedAhuja said the rate for refilling oxygen cylinders has been fixed. “A Type B cylinder will cost ₹185 and Type D cylinder ₹325 and an additional 12% goods and service tax will be levied. Liquid oxygen will be provided for ₹17.5 per cubic metre and 12% goods and service tax will be levied. Another ₹50 will be charged as transportation charges.” The DC said, “The introduction of door-to-door oxygen cylinder refill facility will immensely benefit patients in home isolation as their family members need not wait in queue to get the cylinders refilled. Besides, this will also help us keep tabs on those involved in the black marketeering of oxygen cylinders.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/get-doorstep-refill-of-oxygen-in-panchkula-101620588195814.html
10-05-2021||Mumbai||Attending to all calls for help for a year||A 35-year-old man worried about being unable to see his wife and child for months due to lockdown restrictions; a 28-year-old woman locked in with her abusive father in her hometown where she is stuck after she lost her job during the pandemic; an 18-year-old student worried about the status of his exams in a crucial year. These and many other concerned callers have been flooding the helpline numbers for the past one year, in search of much needed help, and this is where free and public helpline numbers like iCall came to the rescue. “Ours is a unique helpline run by professionals and is free of cost. While iCall regularly addresses around 55-57 calls a day, post Covid and lockdown it’s almost double than usual. Soon, we realised that the existing helpline was not able to handle all calls as most were Covid-specific and needed immediate resource mobilisation,” said Dr Aparna Joshi, assistant professor and director, iCall. Initiated in 2012 as part of the Tata Institute of Social Sciences (TISS) Field Action Project, iCall was put in place to fill up the vast vacuum that exists in the field of mental healthcare in the country. “Normally, 40-50% of our callers are repeat callers because we provide long-term support apart from initial support. But with Covid, most callers were those facing psychosocial concerns related to the pandemic and we realised the need for a separate helpline number catering solely to Covid affected people,” added Joshi. Towards the end of March 2020, two new helpline numbers were introduced by iCall—one for general public wanting to share their Covid-related fears and concerns emanating from the lockdown, and the second catering to health and mental health professionals. The first dedicated COVID helpline was supported by the Mariwala Health Foundation that supports iCall’s regular helpline too. Introduced in partnership with the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), the idea behind the second helpline, SWASTHI, for health and mental health professionals was to address concerns of people who were “providing services to others, but were getting completely burnt out as they were also affected by the same trauma that the clients were talking about”. On an average, iCall would address anywhere between 5,000-8,000 calls a year, but between March 2020 and March 2021, the original helpline number addressed over 20,000 calls from across 29 states and union territories. The Covid-specific helpline number received 3,892 calls between April 17 and December 31, 2020. And apart from these, the helpline was also catering to people via emails and responded to nearly 1,500 emails every month last year. “The Covid-specific helpline received maximum calls from the northern and western states and showed that a majority of calls came from the 21-30 age group. The nature of the calls ranged from practical concerns such as access to medicines, health facilities, food, etc to livelihood-related and mental health concerns,” said Joshi, adding the general helpline also received maximum calls with Covid-related anxiety, emotional distress calls, relationship concerns, academic and job-related concerns as well as suicidal ideations. A report on the numbers recently appeared in the Journal of Social and Economic Development highlighted how in the first wave of the pandemic, most calls received by the helpline number were related to the fear of the pandemic, fuelled by low levels of awareness. What made matters worse were constant exposure to media reports of rising number of cases and deaths, leaving individuals worried about their health and safety. Many callers also addressed the problem of a flailing health system which could not support those in need, whereas others highlighted the plight of job losses and the economic slowdown on the livelihoods of individuals which directly affected their mental well-being. “One of the significant themes for which callers sought help from iCall regularly pertained to relationship conflicts, reported by individuals from different age groups including parent-child, intimate, married, long distance and peer relationships. Families, forced to stay together for extended periods, found it difficult to navigate through this enforced togetherness,” highlighted the report. Stranded in the same household with parents, spouses and children led to newer triggers for conflicts. “There has been an increase in cases of family members complaining of lack of personal space as all members are home-bound, leading to higher stress and anxiety disorders among all age groups,” said clinical psychologist, Dr Seema Hingorrany. “In the past one year, more young couples are worried that they are headed towards divorce, whereas youngsters are witnessing domestic violence instances between their parents and this has left many scarred,” she said, adding that more therapists are now resorting to family therapy sessions for such cases. Recently, iCall was recognised and listed as a mental health innovation by the Global Mental Health Innovation Network, giving the helpline workers the much-deserved recognition and accolades. “iCall fills the huge treatment gap that exists in mental health services in the country, especially in covid times. Designed as a free, confidential, multilingual, telephone-based service by trained counsellors, it aligns with the core principle of the UN Sustainable Development Goals—‘leave no one behind’,” said professor Shalini Bharat, director, TISS. She added that as a community connected institute of higher learning, TISS remains committed to innovating services and programs for improving health and wellbeing of people. “The Global Mental Health Innovation Network Award to iCall is a huge reaffirmation of our conviction that educational institutes must remain socially relevant and use knowledge to find solutions to people’s problems.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/attending-to-all-calls-for-help-for-a-year-101620588194692.html

10-05-2021||Mumbai||Senior Air India pilot loses battle to Covid-19||A senior Air India pilot who operated flights under the government’s Vande Bharat Mission (VBM) and cargo flights, lost battle to Covid-19 on Sunday. The 54-year-old, Capt. Amitesh Prasad who operated Boeing 777, was a resident of Kandivli and had last landed in Bangalore on April 15. He, however, complained of symptoms after reaching Mumbai and tested positive on April 20, after which, he was immediately admitted to the hospital. An Air India official said, “His last flight was AI 176, San Francisco, to Bangalore. He landed in India on April 15 and tested positive on April 20 and was moved to the hospital shortly after.” A pilot’s friend said that Capt. Prasad was involved in several cargo flights in the initial stage of the pandemic, flying emergency supplies from China. “He also operated several Vande Bharat flights throughout the pandemic. He breathed his last at 1.30am on Sunday in KJ Somaiya Hospital, Sion,” the pilot said. A statement issued by Indian Pilot’s Guild (IPG) read, “Amitesh was loved by all for his gentle nature. We are blessed to have been able to call him our colleague and friend. Amitesh has faithfully served Air India since December 1995 where he joined Flight Despatch. Over the years he worked hard and made his way to the rank of Commander on the Boeing777 fleet. He was actively involved in flying cargo missions to Shanghai and Guangzhou when the pandemic struck last year. And has been flying Vande Bharat flights to the US and back until he recently fell ill with Covid-19.”Capt. Prasad is succeeded by his wife, who is also undergoing treatment for Covid at the hospital, and his two teenaged children. Air India officials said that the wife is currently stable. Close pilot friends said that Capt. Prasad’s daughter is studying in Canada and his 15-year-old son studying in the city and is currently residing with his relatives. Air India pilots said that the frontliners are not given priority for vaccination, which has been communicated to the management by both the pilots’ unions. While IPG, union of Boeing pilots, wrote to the Air India management on April 28, the Indian Commercial Pilot’s Association, an Airbus pilots union warned to stop work, if the management does not start a vaccination drive and if pilots are not given priority. “He is the second pilot to lose his battle to Covid, in Air India. The previous pilot, however, was not flying while he contracted Covid,” said an Air India official. “We have been risking our lives to fly for the nation. Despite the pandemic claiming lives and difficulty in even getting treatment due to lack of medical infrastructure, the management has not begun vaccination drives. We have been assured that they will conduct the vaccination drive from May 15, however, this should have been done at least a month earlier,” said a senior Air India pilot.“However, in due fairness, after the pilot was admitted, the airline’s medical staff did everything they could, to help Capt. Prasad,” he added. This is not it. Air India also lost its maintenance engineer on Sunday. 41-year-old Johnson Turkey, a Kolkata based engineer also succumbed to Covid-19 on Sunday morning.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/senior-air-india-pilot-loses-battle-to-covid19-101620588135212.html
10-05-2021||Other||1K mangrove trees likely to be cut for six-lane bridge at Navi Mumbai||An estimated 1,000 mangrove trees are proposed to be cut by the Navi Mumbai Municipal Corporation (NMMC) for constructing a six-lane elevated bridge between Airoli and Ghansoli. The trees will be cut to make way for 25 load-bearing pillars. In total, an estimated 5,500 mangrove trees, spread over a 4-hectare area, will be affected by the project, officials familiar with the development confirmed. The proposed bridge will connect Sector 14 in Ghansoli to the Airoli Katai Naka Freeway via Airoli-Mulund Bridge, and will help decongest the Thane Belapur Road. The matter has, for the time being, been deferred by the Maharashtra Coastal Zone Management Authority (MCZMA) for want additional details by the project proponent – NMMC. “The project involves construction of a bridge in the mangrove area along the east bank of Thane creek over a length of 1.05km. As per the approved CZMP (coastal zone management plan), the project falls under CRZ (coastal regulation zone)-I (A) and II areas,” MCZMA observed in its last meeting on April 15, when the matter was considered for CRZ clearance. Part of the project will also cut through 50 metres of the reserve forest buffer zone in Dive village. In a report submitted by NMMC to MCZMA in February, about 810 mangroves trees were slated to be cut for the project, with another 2,640 trees being temporarily affected during the construction phase. However, a subsequent site visit conducted by the forest department’s mangrove cell in March estimated that about 1,000 trees would need to be cut. “As per the report of the mangrove cell, a total number of mangroves affected [will be] about 5,500-6,000 which fall in the alignment of the proposed bridge,” MCZMA observed in its minutes of the meeting. Virender Tiwari, additional principal chief conservator of forests (APCCF), mangrove cell, said, “We have conducted the site visit and a more detailed survey is yet to be done. Given the damage to the mangroves, NMMC will have to seek clearance from the Bombay high court (HC) and also apply for diversion of forest land under the Forest Conservation Act, 1980. The CRZ clearance will be contingent on these compliances.” In light of a September 2018 HC order which barred construction in mangrove areas other than for projects of public interest, MCZMA “decided that NMMC need to submit the explicit note on the public interest involved in the project... accordingly, the matter was deferred for want of said information.” HT reached about to Navi Mumbai municipal commissioner Abhijit Bangar for a comment on the issue but did not receive a response.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/1k-mangrove-trees-likely-to-be-cut-for-six-lane-bridge-at-navi-mumbai-101620588014615.html

Also, a meeting was held on Sunday, regarding this issue at the university.The UT education department has already directed all educational institutions and public libraries in Chandigarh to stay closed till May 31. Last month, in a meeting chaired by the UT education secretary, it was decided that the students who are staying at hostels of PU and colleges be advised to return to their homes.Facilitation committee set upThe varsity has also set up a facilitation committee to help students to return to their homes.

10-05-2021||Other||Where will Congress be in 2024 after poor performance in WB: Sanjay Raut||In a remark that could draw a wedge between state’s two ruling partners, Shiv Sena’s chief spokesperson Sanjay Raut has raised questions on where the Congress will be on a national stage in 2024, following its poor poll performance in West Bengal. While analysing the West Bengal election results in his weekly column RokhThok in Sena mouthpiece Saamana, Raut further said that Prime Minister Narendra Modi can be defeated, but there is no leader to challenge him in Delhi. While batting for a strong leadership, Raut added that key leaders will soon take a decision on forming formidable opposition front. After a brief pause, Raut has reignited the issue of creating a front of opposition parties to take on the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) juggernaut head-on in the 2024 Lok Sabha election. While refraining from naming a leader who could lead the opposition’s front, Raut said that the decision will have to be taken collectively. Earlier, Raut had faced criticism from Congress leaders for backing Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar to become the chairperson of the United Progressive Alliance, which is now headed by Congress president Sonia Gandhi. “In all the state elections, Congress has been left behind. Congress’s Lok Sabha leader Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury said the defeat in Bengal is a “humiliating loss”. In the 290-member Assembly, the Congress and Left parties did not win a single seat. We are happy with [West Bengal chief minister] Mamata’s [Banerjee] victory, but the pain of Congress’s decline is equally strong. Where will Congress be on the national stage in 2024? Has Mamata’s victory given a new direction for the general election in 2024? If the opposition decides to come together, then who would lead it? This must be decided with consensus and Congress will have to give its nod,” Raut wrote in his column. Later in the day, Raut clarified that he did not seek a new leadership and added that Congress party would remain the “soul” of the Opposition front. “Everybody wants to create a front that would challenge the government. The soul of this Opposition front will definitely be Congress. No front can be created without Congress. They got seats in Assam but unfortunately couldn’t come to power. They have had some success in Kerala and Tamil Nadu. But Congress needs to lunge forward.... Congress, which is the largest party in the Opposition, has not won any seat in the West Bengal Assembly election. This is really sad for us. If UPA is strengthened, then Congress will remain the soul of it because it is a national party. I spoke to Pawar saheb about it and soon the leaders will arrive at a decision,” Raut said. Speaking to reporters on Sunday, he said that “whenever Congress fails, they get worried”. When asked who does he propose to lead the Opposition front, Raut retorted, “I have not said anything about new leadership. We all have to sit together and decide a leader; everybody thinks he is the leader, but it not so. And aghadis (coalitions) are not created in this manner. The three parties in Maharashtra decided that their leader is Uddhav Thackeray and it is a model front where three ideologically opposite parties have come together. All parties will have to come together to create such a front on a national level.” According to Raut, BJP is not undefeatable but the challenge is a strong leadership against Narendra Modi. He batted for a strong leadership against Modi and BJP. He said that despite back-to-back losses in the Vidhan Sabha elections, Modi and not BJP, is winning the Lok Sabha election. “This is Modi’s victory, because there is no such leader in Delhi that would challenge him. Until such a leader is made, there will be no contest. Results in West Bengal, Tamil Nadu and Kerala have shown then Modi and Shah can be defeated no matter how much might they put into an election. This means that the idea that Modi is a popular leader to win election is not flawless. The weak leadership and lack of machinery with the Opposition is the political strength of Modi-[home minister Amit] Shah,” he added. Maharashtra Congress president Nana Patole said that they do not pay attention to Raut’s statements about their party. “We do not pay attention to what Raut says; whatever we wanted to tell him [about strengthening UPA], we have done it in the past. We have stopped reading Saamana as well. It is better to ignore things where our leaders or our organisation is being criticised. If somebody thinks that their party can get prominence by pointing finger at another party, they must see that four fingers point back at them,” he said. Meanwhile, Maharashtra BJP spokesperson Keshav Upadhye advised former ally Shiv Sena to look at who they are following. “Congress will respond Sena’s latest criticism. But if they think Congress is doing poorly, then they should see who their ally is,” Upadhye said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/where-will-congress-be-in-2024-after-poor-performance-in-wb-sanjay-raut-101620587956494.html
10-05-2021||Delhi||World’s largest cargo plane, carrying Covid aid from UK, lands at IGI airport||The world’s largest cargo plane touched down at Delhi’s Indira Gandhi International airport on Sunday morning, carrying three oxygen generators and 1,000 ventilators from the UK. Experts said the aircraft, Antonov AN 124-100, had flown into the country even in the past to deliver Delhi Metro wagons, specialist construction equipment and military cargo.The 24-wheeler Russian-made aircraft departed from Belfast airport late on Saturday night and landed at the Delhi airport at 8.30 am on Sunday.On Sunday morning, Delhi customs said in a statement that the medical aid onboard the aircraft was cleared within 25 minutes of its landing.On Sunday afternoon, the British high commission in New Delhi also tweeted: “The UK sends life-saving support for India in the world’s largest cargo plane. Three oxygen generation units arrived in India today. Each capable of producing 500 litres of oxygen per minute. It will help save lives and support India’s healthcare system.”Also read | Variant deepening India’s crisis, says top WHO scientistEach of the three oxygen generation units – the size of 40ft freight containers - produces 500 litres of oxygen per minute, enough for 50 people to use at a time, it said.“Taking forward our comprehensive strategic partnership, consignment of 3 oxygen generators and 1,000 ventilators arrives from the UK... Deeply value the contribution from our close friend,” tweeted MEA spokesperson Arindam Bagchi on Sunday.The Antonov AN 124-100 - the world’s largest air cargo carrier - is 70 metres long and nearly 75 metres wide. The plane, which weighs around 1.8 lakh kilograms, usually has six crew members and two load masters.Aviation experts say the aircraft has flown several times to India in the past, mostly to Chennai, Ahmedabad, Delhi, Mumbai and Calcutta, and has shipped a wide range of cargo, including Delhi Metro wagons, election promotion material, specialist construction equipment and military cargo.Aviation safety expert Mark D Martin said the aircraft’s maximun take of weight (MTOW) comes in close to the Lockheed C5A Galaxy Freighter, which was the largest aircraft till the AN 225 Mriya entered service in 1990.“India has welcomed even more larger aircraft in the past, the Lockheed C5A Galaxy operated by the US Air Force has in the past made several flights to India, transporting critical aid and support equipment needed for the visits of U.S Presidents,” he said.Commenting on Indian airports’ capacity to handle an Antonov 124, Martin said, most airports in India have the ground handling capability to support the AN124 as high loaders are not required and the cargo can be rolled down from the rear clamshell doors. “When the AN 124 came to Ahmedabad, tractors could easily ride in to drop off the cargo. Now in India, fork lifts do that function more efficiently,” Martin said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/worlds-largest-cargo-plane-carrying-covid-aid-from-uk-lands-at-igi-airport-101620587955736.html

While some left around Holi, many went to cast their vote during the state and panchayat elections. But a large number of workers have left since the lockdown was announced on April 19.On Sunday, Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal announced the extension of the lockdown—this is the fourth extension — till May 17 and promised to tighten its enforcement.In the past 10 days, Inamul Haq, a private labour contractor, has helped over 100 construction workers associated with him return home. “The workers wanted to go as they feared a repeat of what happened to them last year during the nationwide lockdown. Given the present situation in Delhi, things are unlikely to normalise anytime soon,” he said.Also read | Covid-19: Metro shut in stricter lockdown across DelhiHaq, too, doesn’t want them to stay back: “Last year, close to 150 of my workers were stuck in Delhi. I took care of their food and stay. But now I can’t do it. I’ll call them back once the situation normalises here.”The slow and gradual reverse migration has slowed down infrastructure projects, once again, in the city. Though construction work is allowed on sites where in-situ arrangement is made for workers, various government agencies say that the work has got affected due to insufficient labour.The Delhi Metro Rail Corporation, which is undertaking work on Phase-4 project, said that the number of workers at their sites has come down from about 4,100 (as on April 18) to around 2,900 in the last week of April.Anuj Dayal, executive director, corporate communications, DMRC, said, “There has been a decrease in the number of workers since the lockdown. Many who left for Holi holidays also haven’t returned. We are hopeful that they will return back with the gradual improvement in the overall Covid scenario. Workers who are currently here are being adequately taken care of with necessary medical care as well.”At the Pragati Maidan redevelopment site, the work is moving at a snail’s pace, as the number of workers has trickled down from 2,500 in March to around 600 now.LC Goyal, chairman and managing director of India Trade Promotion Organisation (ITPO), said that the workers left in batches this time. “While close to 1,000 workers left during Holi and have not returned, some left the city during the recent state elections. Many workers left after the lockdown was announced in April. Today, we are left with 600 workers at the site. As the lockdown in Delhi has been gradually extended, there is uncertainty among workers,” said Goyal.The deadline for the ₹2,700-crore Pragati Maidan redevelopment project was revised last year to March 2022. “We will have to rework the deadlines depending on how fast we can mobilise the workers and resume the full pace of work,” he added.A major part of ITPO or Pragati Maidan redevelopment project is the ₹777-crore traffic regulation project, which is being carried out by the Delhi government’s Public Works Department (Delhi PWD).The construction of a 1.2-km-long tunnel between Purana Qila Road (near Pragati Maidan Mathura Road) and the Ring Road (near Pragati Power Station), and six underground U-turns on Mathura Road and Bhairon Marg are in various stages of completion.However, the spike in Covid-19 cases in Delhi and the lockdown has scared workers, said a senior PWD official. “We had around 500 workers before the lockdown. But now we have 200-odd people. Workers are scared that they will contract the infection, as they work in proximity. Though arrangements have been made for isolation and treatment by contractors, workers are scared. Almost every day we find some workers missing. This has adversely impacted the pace of work,” said the official, requesting anonymity.A PWD official said that the tunnel is almost 95% complete though shortage of labour has affected remaining work.The Central Public Works Department (CPWD), which is the nodal agency for the construction of the new Parliament building and the redevelopment of Central Vista, is also facing a shortage of workers. Though the contractors for the ambitious projects have made arrangements for the stay of labourers, CPWD officials said the pace of work has been affected. The CPWD is also redeveloping four of the seven government residential colonies in south Delhi to provide accommodation for central government employees.A senior CPWD official said, “Labour is not available at sites in enough numbers and this has impacted the pace of work.”Also read | Pet boarding facilities inundated with requests from Covid-affected familiesThe National Highways Authority of India (NHAI), which is constructing the Dwarka expressway project, said that close to 10-15% of workers have left after the lockdown. “The gradual increase in lockdown period has led to fear among the workers. The biggest problem right now is that there is no inflow of new workers, especially skilled labourers. We are trying to build confidence among workers so that they don’t leave. We have made adequate arrangements for them and are making efforts to get those aged 45+ vaccinated. But the fear among workers is palpable,” said an NHAI official.The National Buildings Construction Corporation (NBCC), which is carrying out several infrastructure projects in the city, is also facing problems due to labour shortage at its sites. A senior NBCC India official said, “The fear of the disease is forcing people to return to their home states as they want to be close to their families. So while the work is going on at our sites, the pace of work has definitley slowed down.”NBCC is working on projects such as development of East Kidwai Nagar, Sarojini Nagar and Nauroji Nagar; redevelopment of Pragati Maidan and several government office complexes; and development of Bharat Vandana Park in Dwarka, among other.Meanwhile, construction workers in the unorganised sectors are the worst hit.Thaneshwar Adigaur, secretary of the Delhi Asangathit Nirman Mazdoor Union, said, “Due to the lockdown, they are unable to find work as construction work is allowed only if labourers live on-site. A large number of workers are daily wagers who work as carpenters, masons, plumbers etc. Due to the spike in cases, there is not much work available. People are finding it difficult to make ends meet. While the government has announced financial assistance, there are many who are still not registered with the board (Delhi Building and Other Construction Workers Welfare Board).”Hari Prasad, who has a team of carpenters, plumbers, masons, etc, said that there are no work orders since the lockdown was announced. “A lot of my workers have left, as they were finding it difficult to pay rent and sustain their families. Most of them are daily wagers,” said Prasad.Given the situation at hospitals, Haq said that workers feel that they are safe in their home towns.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/infra-projects-in-delhi-stare-at-delays-amid-labour-shortage-101620587895801.html
10-05-2021||Delhi||GTB hospital doc dies within hours of testing positive for Covid||A 26-year-old doctor at Guru Tegh Bahadur (GBT) Hospital, which has been converted into a designated Covid-19 hospital, died within hours of testing positive for the infection on Sunday, confirmed officials from the hospital administration.Dr Anas Mujahid, a resident of north-east Delhi’s Bhagirathi Vihar who completed his internship after MBBS in January, was working at the hospital’s gynaecology ward as a junior resident since last month.Mujahid was known to be hardworking, the most humble and helpful person among his colleagues and juniors at the University College of Medical Sciences (UCMS) at GTB hospital. He was reporting to duty till Saturday, officials said.According to his colleagues and family members, the discharge slip issued by the hospital mentioned that Mujahid was Covid positive and suffered from “intracranial hemorrhage” (bleeding within the skull, including the brain).His batchmate and colleague Amir Sohail said both of them visited Mujahid’s home for iftar (meal to break the day-long fast during Ramzan) on Saturday evening. “Since last month, we have been staying at a hotel provided by the hospital to all doctors who are currently on Covid duty. While returning back to the hotel from Mujahid’s home, he complained of feeling feverish. He decided to take a rapid antigen test at the fever clinic of the GTB hospital before going to the hotel. He tested positive for Covid-19,” said Sohail.“We were sitting in the clinic only when he suddenly collapsed. I, along with other staff members, rushed him to the casualty ward. He was not responding well. The doctors there sent him for a CT-scan. The report revealed a massive bleeding spot in the brain. He was immediately transferred to the neurological department, where he died around 2:30am,” he added.Sohail said he has been finding it difficult to process his friend’s sudden death. “He worked in the Covid ward last year also and was alright throughout. I was the one who contracted the virus while on duty. He was absolutely fine till Saturday evening. I still cannot believe he left us like that,” he said adding Mujahid had not taken the vaccine shots.Mauz Mujahid, younger brother of the deceased, said the family received a call from the hospital around 10pm on Saturday. “We could not believe what Anas’ friend was saying as he was with us till a few hours ago. My parents and my elder brother immediately rushed to the hospital. Within hours, he left us. Our family is in shock. My parents still can’t accept it even after cremating him,” he said. Mujahid’s father is an Unani doctor. He is survived by his parents, two brothers, and a younger sister.Dr. Mohammad Anas, Mujahid’s junior at the college and hospital and his namesake, said, “He was just one year senior to me. I was in the 2016 batch and he was in 2015. We immediately connected because we shared the same name. He was the most humble person I know. Always so polite and helpful...the entire fraternity is in shock. We cannot believe that a person as young as him could die this way without having any severe symptoms.”A K Jain, dean of UCMS at GTB Hospital, confirmed Mujahid’s death. “I am yet to go through his medical reports. It’s really unfortunate that he is not with us anymore.”Dr. Satendra Singh, a faculty at UCMS at GTB Hospital, said that he got to know about Mujahid’s death on Sunday morning. “It’s a rare case of sudden progression (of Covid-19) and it’s alarming. Generally, we have seen cases of blood clots and internal bleeding in patients with severe Covid symptoms. However, according to his friends, he was fine till Saturday,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/gtb-hospital-doc-dies-within-hours-of-testing-positive-for-covid-101620587894636.html

Thane resident Jigar Jayesh Pandya, 27, and Abu Tahir Afzal Hussain Choudhary, 31, a Mankhurd local, are in police custody till May 12 for the alleged possession of the highly radioactive substance. An NIA team had visited the ATS office to verify the facts. “Now the documents related to the case will be handed over to them for further inquiry. As per the procedure, NIA will approach the court to take custody of both the accused as they are in ATS custody till 12 May,” said an ATS officer. The incident came to light after police inspector Santosh Bhalekar of the Nagpada unit got information about a person planning to sell pieces of uranium illegally. Bhalekar and his team then laid a trap and nabbed Pandya. During interrogation, Pandya revealed that he had got the uranium from Choudhary. Bhalekar then arrested Choudhary on May 5 after questioning several scrap dealers in Mumbai. In the meanwhile, ATS had sent the recovered substance to Bhabha Atomic Research Centre (BARC), Trombay, for chemical analysis. The BARC report confirmed that the seized substance was natural uranium and dangerous to human life. Based on the report, the ATS Kalachowki police station registered a first information report (FIR). “We’ve been interrogating the accused to find out where they had procured the uranium from. It appears that there are many others involved in the case. The uranium is around ₹3 crore per kg in the market,” added the officer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/nia-to-probe-7-kg-uranium-seizure-case-in-mumbai-101620587895185.html
10-05-2021||Other||Maratha quota: Outfits not satisfied with committee of retired judges||Maratha organisations are not satisfied with the Maharashtra government’s decision to form a committee under two retired judges of the Bombay high court (HC) to review the Supreme Court’s (SC) decision and suggest the best alternatives to move forward on the issue.The organisations pointed out that they had also recommended names of legal luminaries who have studied the subject in detail, but the government overlooked their suggestions.Virendra Pawar, one of the convenors from Maratha Kranti Morcha (MKM), said, “This step was expected when the legal battle for reservation was going on in the Apex court. We had suggested names of Dr Sadanand More (scholar), [retired HC judge] BG Kolse Patil and [retired SC judge] PB Sawant’s names to the government, requesting them to use their expertise by appointing them as advisers, but our recommendations were overlooked.”“If the state government is really serious about granting reservation to the Maratha community, they should then consider incorporating us in the OBC (other backward class) quota,” he added.Sanjiv Bhor Patil, president, Shiv Prahar Sangathana, said the state is just passing time.“We have lost our reservation, so now whatever is required to get it back, should be done at the earliest. We would have hit the streets by now but are not doing so because of the pandemic. We want the government to not waste time anymore,” said Patil.Many organisations are planning to hold state-wide virtual agitations by starting social media campaigns against leaders of the political parties.However, Mansing Pawar, one of the convenors of the Maratha Kranti Morcha, termed the state’s move as a positive development. “It’s definitely a positive development as only two authorities in the country — the Supreme Court and President — can provide us reservation. Individual petitioners are also preparing grounds to go for a review but the petition by the state government will make a difference. Thus I would say that it is a much needed step,” Pawar said.Marathas were given 12% and 13% quota in education and government jobs, respectively, under the Socially and Educationally Backward Classes (SEBC) Act, 2018.The Apex court on Wednesday quashed the reservation to the Marathas, stating that people from the community cannot be declared educationally and socially backward just to bring them in the reserved category. The five-judge bench also refused to refer the 1992 Indra Sawhney judgment – that set a 50% cap on reservation – to a larger bench for reconsideration.Following this, the state on Saturday decided to constitute a committee under two retired high court (HC) judges to review the SC verdict and suggest the next course of action. The committee, comprising five-six other members including laws officers, is expected to submit its report in two weeks to the state government.The government also said that they are tapping the option of requesting the Central government to intervene, as the judgment stated that the right to accord the reservation is with the Centre after the 102nd Constitutional amendment.“Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray will write to the President and Prime Minister, requesting them to take the steps required for the reservation. The Centre has time and again clarified that the powers of the states have not been nullified even after the amendment, though the SC order has stated otherwise,” state public works department (PWD) minister Ashok Chavan said on Saturday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/maratha-quota-outfits-not-satisfied-with-committee-of-retired-judges-101620587834641.html
10-05-2021||Chandigarh||Probe marked as SAD claims top posts in MC Kharar amid deferred polls||After the Mohali administration failed to convene elections for president, senior vice-president and vice-president of the Kharar municipal council on May 3 amid Covid curbs, the Shiromani Akali Dal claimed that it had elected its councillors to all three posts the same evening, prompting the sub-divisional magistrate to mark an inquiry into the matter. SAD has elected Jaspreet Kaur as president, Harinder Pal Singh Jolly as senior vice-president and Jasbir Singh Jonny as vice-president. On February 17, the MC elections had resulted in a hung house as Congress bagged 10 of 27 seats, SAD won eight, Aam Aadmi Party one and Independents clinched eight seats. On April 19, violence had broken out during elections for the top posts of the MC after Congress councillors alleged that SAD was luring Independents with money. Some councillors tried to attack the SDM, compelling authorities to postpone the polls to May 3. Kharar constituency SAD in-charge Ranjit Singh Gill said, “We knew that they (the administration) are not going to convene a meeting. Thus, on May 3, we elected our councillors to all three posts around 4.15pm as we had the support of 15 councillors.” “The elections were conducted as per the Punjab Municipal Act. We have sent copies of the election to authorities concerned for notification and should they refuse, we will move court,” he said. As per act, we can conduct elections by appointing one of our councillors as convener. A recording of the meeting has been submitted to the Kharar SDM, Gill added. However, SDM Himanshu Jain said, “Elections on May 3 were postponed in the wake of Covid restrictions. Now, I have received an email regarding the conduct of elections, but I do not know when these elections were held . I have already marked an inquiry and have asked the executive officer of MC to submit a report.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/probe-marked-as-sad-claims-top-posts-in-mc-kharar-amid-deferred-polls-101620587715418.html

Instead of watching TV or social media, that are full of news related to Covid disease and deaths, many have revived their interests in forgotten hobbies like gardening, reading books, listening to music and learning to play musical instruments. Some are flying kites while many others are playing carom online. Retired government employee, Syed Mohd Zaki, 72, a resident of old city area in Rani Mandi, for instance, had been a national level carrom player. As he got busy with job and family, carom took a backseat. Recently his sons downloaded carrom game app in his smartphone. Ever since, Zaki has been busy. “Carrom was my passion once and these days, I play the game online. It helps me beat stress and negative thoughts,” he said. Similarly, Savitri Verma, 75, resident of Gangotri Nagar in Naini area, revived her interest in gardening. These days, she spends her time attending to the plants in her garden. “My garden is greener than before,” she said. “I had a passion for gardening since long but was not able to give attention to it due to responsibilities at home. Now, with not much to do, gardening helps me stay engaged,” she added. Khursheed Akhari, 80, a retired lecturer of Persian and Arabic, now spends most of her time reading religious books while Deepak Srivastava, 50, a resident of Katra area, has begun writing a book. “These days the social media is full of negative news. It was having negative impact on me. I used to feel ill myself. I am a writer so now I quit social media and have started writing a book. Moreover, I have collected about a hundred plants on my terrace and am also pursuing my passion for gardening,” Srivastava said. There are many others like them who have either started learning how to cook new dishes or begun flying kites. Some others have started watching old movies or listening to olden melodies on their smartphones. Senior psychiatrist Dr Rakesh Paswan said diverting attention from negative news is the best way to beat stress and depression. “Engaging in other activities will distract people from social media and other news platforms which are full of news about deaths due to Covid which is leaving negative impact on people’s mind and is affecting their immunity,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/reviving-forgotten-passions-to-beat-covid-stress-101620586754670.html

10-05-2021||Mumbai||Speed bumps ahead for Maharashtra’s vaccination drive||Amid a shortage of Covaxin doses, Maharashtra has received 36,000 doses of the vaccine manufactured by Bharat Biotech, expected to be used for the second dose. The state on Sunday received 703,000 doses of Covishield for inoculation of people over 45 years, which would help the state continue its drive, albeit at a slow pace. Maharashtra also received the 350,000 doses of Covishield it purchased from the Serum Institute of India for vaccination of the 18-44 age group category.On Saturday, the state health department had written a letter to the Centre, urgently seeking Covaxin doses, as over 500,000 people from the age group of above 45 years were due for their second dose. State immunisation officer DN Patil said the state has received “only 36,000 doses of Covaxin” and the state is expecting more in the coming week. “On Sunday, we received 703,000 doses of Covishield and only 36,000 doses of Covaxin for the vaccination of people over age 45. Besides that, we received 350,000 Covishield vaccines, which the state government has purchased for vaccination of people in the 18-44 category. All the doses have been shipped out to various districts and the drive will continue,” Patil said.Over the past three days, the state’s daily vaccination numbers have seen a dip for want of doses. On Thursday, state inoculated 455,109 beneficiaries, followed by 363,765 on Friday. On Saturday, the state inoculated 236,960 beneficiaries. On Sunday, figures on the CoWin portal showed that the state inoculated 109,276 beneficiaries. So far, the state has fully vaccinated 3,350,633 beneficiaries, while 14,710,907 have taken their first shot. Tope on Sunday said the vaccination drive in the state is going on at a “slow pace” due to unavailability of adequate number of doses. He said the state’s priority is to vaccinate the 57.1 million population in the 18-44 category, but wants the Centre to clear the hurdles of permissions to procure foreign vaccines.“Currently, our vaccination drive is going on in a slow pace because vaccines are not being made available. Chief minister has clearly said that Maharashtra has to potential to purchase 120 million doses in one go, but availability is the main issue. The Centre must intervene in this matter and make vaccine doses available for Maharashtra. The vaccination of 18-44 category is crucial as the age group steps out of their homes. If the government gives permission, we can procure Sputnik or other foreign vaccines for the citizens of our state. There are several approvals needed from the Centre,” Tope said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/speed-bumps-ahead-for-maharashtra-s-vaccination-drive-101620585854466.html

So far, only Fortis Hospital and Max Hospital in Mohali have been vaccinating those above the age of 18, as the drive was deferred in government centres amid non-availability of vaccines. Mohali civil surgeon Dr Adarshpal Kaur said, “We will start the vaccination drive at government centres once we get the list of registered construction workers. So far, we have not received the list from any company.” Mohali deputy commissioner Girish Dayalan said it was likely that the inoculation drive for the 18 to 44 age bracket will start in a couple of days, while its registration is on.

He also inspected the hospital.“The 750-bed hospital developed by DRDO is ready. It has 250 ventilator beds, 250 oxygenated beds, and 250 normal beds. It will start functioning from Monday,” he said, addressing media persons at BHU.He thanked Prime Minister Narendra Modi for the setting up of the hospital and ensuring oxygen supply to the state through Oxygen Express trains.Like the rest of the state, the number of Covid-19 positive cases had decreased in Varanasi in the last eight days, he noted. The number of cases fell by 9285 in Varanasi division and there was a decline of about 4500 cases in Varanasi district alone during the same period, he said. While on normal days, there was a requirement of around 400 metric tonnes of oxygen which medical colleges used to meet from air separators and liquid medical oxygen plants, the demand had increased in the state due to the second wave of Covid-19, he said. At present, the state government was ensuring supply of 1000 metric tonnes of oxygen to different areas of the state, he added. He also said, “We are making efforts to increase infrastructure and resources.”The chief minister praised health workers for striving to control and break the chain of the Covid-19 infection.He appealed to people to follow the Covid-19 protocol and get themselves vaccinated, adding that the jabs will be given to people in the 18-44 age group in 11 more districts from Monday in addition to seven districts, including Varanasi, in which beneficiaries in this age group were being inoculated since May 1.Meanwhile, Prof BR Mittal, director of Institute of Medical Sciences-Banaras Hindu University (IMS-BHU) along with a team of senior doctors, visited the Pandit Rajan Mishra Hospital on Sunday.

To give a helping hand to students in Pune city, the Seva Mitra Mandal is giving out meals, twice a day, to 150 students. Several Ganpati mandals in Pune are contributing in various ways to help the needy. The Seva Mitra Mandal is located in Shukrwar peth. “Since the lockdown started we began getting calls from students living in our area. There are hundreds of students living here who have come from other districts for studying. Most are dependent on food messes, but now they cannot afford it. So we decided to start daily meals for students, for lunch and dinner. 150 students are registered with us, who takeaway food parcels from our Ganpati temple,” said Shirish Mohite, Seva Mitra Mandal president. Tushar Katkar, one of the students who food from the mandal, said, “I am from Latur and preparing for competitive exams. I came back to Pune in February with a hope that all things are normalised. I am stuck here and do not have enough money. Seva Mitra Mandal helped me and many other students by giving us food.”Similarly, another Ganpati mandal has come up with a unique idea to help children who are now bored at home watching TV and playing mobile games. Sainath Mitra Mandal on Shivaji road has started an unique concept of “Lockdown library” for children. Books are being delivered to children to to discourage them from screen time.Piyush Shah, president of the mandal, said, “It is summer time. Schools and their online lectures or tests are over and children are at home. Due to lockdown no one goes out unless it is an emergency, and most of the children only watch TV or play mobile games. To distract them and encourage their reading habit we started this initiative of through our Ganpati mandal. There are around 16 Ganpati mandals across Pune city who are working under this initiative. Volunteers give the books at home and children read them. Right from the peth areas, Sinhagad road, Ahmednagar road, Vishrantwadi, Hadapsar, Dhankawadi and Katraj, in all thse areas mandals are working.”“We got 5,000 books from some wholesalers and then we classified books as per the age of the child. Then through the social media platforms we spread the word and started getting a good response. We give the book to a child and then request their parents to give that book to another child after reading the book,” added Shah. Welcoming this initiative, Anshul Anil Mohite, a 12-year-old who got books to read from the library said, “I am so happy to get these books to read. All are story books and in different languages. In the last one year I hardly read any other book apart from my study books. We also get bored at home and only watching TV, now I am looking forward to get more books from the library.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/free-food-library-books-home-delivered-ganpati-mandals-pitch-in-to-make-life-under-lockdown-easier-for-youth-101620569413573.html
10-05-2021||Pune||Sirens, crematoria running non-stop leave Pune residents with “stress fatigue”||PUNE Constant ambulance sirens around hospitals have impacted the lives of residents living in these areas; as has the non-stop running of crematoria in the city. Most residents in these areas keep their balcony doors shut for the whole day and take different routes to go out, if at all. April saw Pune district suffer its highest number of Covid fatalities, 2,938, which subsequently saw an increase in ambulance movement. “On normal days we never used to bother. What has happened now is whenever we switch on the TV, we see ambulances on screen. Also, when you stand on the balcony, we see more than one ambulance. All this annoys us,” said Anil Jagtap who stays near KEM hospital. On Saturday, the Regional Transport Office (RTO) also issued an order for ambulance drivers which read: “In accordance with the complaint of the citizens, ambulance drivers have been instructed to avoid the unnecessary use of horns and sirens to reduce noise pollution. It is affecting the health of the citizens. Sirens should not be used in residential areas, especially at night. Action will be taken against the owner and driver of the ambulance under the Motor Vehicle Act if the rule is violated.” The situation is not different with the residents staying near the crematoria. “Here it is not about the ambulance siren, but the chimney’s emitting continuous smoke from the crematorium. Whenever you look out of the window, the scene repeats itself, every day. My father then keeps repeating, ‘how many people are succumbing every day’,” said Virendra Thorat who stays near Vainkuth crematorium, Navi peth. Ambulance driver Mahesh Surve from Thergaon adds, “We generally consider it our duty. The problem only arises if we discuss it more.” Banking professional Mehul Chavare said,” I have started avoiding passing the Vaikunth crematorium since April. It does not give good start to your day.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/ambulance-sirens-crematoria-running-non-stop-leave-residents-in-these-areas-with-stress-fatigue-101620568873490.html
10-05-2021||Pune||Hospitals in Pune city ramp up preparation, stock-up on medicines in anticipation of Covid’s paediatric 3rd wave||Pune has already begun preparations for the much-anticipated Covid-19 third wave, where children are likely to be the worst affected due. Experts have said that the third wave would affect children the most, as they have not been vaccinated. In addition, children are also vulnerable to Post-Covid Inflammatory Syndrome also known as Paediatric Inflammatory Multisystem Syndrome (PIMS), post recovery. City hospitals, including those under the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC), have begun preparations focused on the paediatric Covid-19 testing and treatment. Dr Aarti Kinikar, senior paediatrician and head of department of the paediatric ward at Sassoon General Hospital said, “We have started preparing for the third wave, where it is anticipated that children would be the most affected. We have identified wards which could be taken over in if the numbers rise, including ICU beds. We have also hired consultants to recruit manpower and stocked medicines and surgicals as required. We hope that the wave doesn’t come.”“Right now we have about 35-40 beds, including ICU beds, scattered across the hospital for paediatrics and OBGYN which would go up to 100 as per our plans. We have identified one floor which is right now being used for paediatric-plus- healthcare workers, but then, if need be, we will dedicate it for paediatrics without compromising on the adult Covid-19 facilities. We are hoping that the adult cases reduce,” Dr Kinikar added.Dr Kinikar also said that Sassoon has a dedicated medical gas pipeline system project which would ensure smooth oxygen supply in case of the third wave. “We are also seeing a rise in the PIMS cases which have started coming in from the past one month. This may suddenly increase in the third wave, like we are seeing in European countries and in America too. If the pattern is the same then we may require separate medicines in addition to the ones we require to treat adult Covid-19 patients.”In April alone, the district saw the highest number of deaths due to Covid-19 since the beginning of the pandemic, which included six fatalities among those aged below 20 years, of the total 2,938 deaths. The PMC is also working on a dedicated Covid hospital for children at the Rajiv Gandhi Hospital facility. Sunil Tingre, MLA from Yerawada, who has funded the project through his MLA funds, said, “Considering the third wave many doctors predicting that it could affect young children as well, a Covid hospital for children is being set up at Bharat Ratna Rajiv Gandhi Hospital in Yerawada. It will be the first children’s hospital in the state. The hospital will have a total capacity of 200 beds. There will be 150 oxygen beds and 50 ICU beds. Rs1 crore has been provided from my MLA fund and also a large amount of funds has been made available under CSR. On Friday, May 7, I inspected the hospital along with additional commissioner Rubal Agarwal. Instructions have been given to complete the work as soon as possible with necessary facilities.”Dr Jitendra Oswal, paediatrician and deputy medical director at Bharati Vidyapeeth hospital, said, “We are ready with a dedicated paediatric Covid unit which would be manned by a paediatrician, and also a Covid-positive mother delivery facility. We have also started newborn-to 18-year old RT PCR and antigen testing facilities. In addition we have a dedicated six-bed Covid PICU and NICU, with a facility of mechanical ventilation.” “We anticipate that the third wave would also see a shocking number of children suffering from post- Covid inflammation, a rare but serious condition which typically surfaces after four-six weeks of the Covid peak. The Pune peak was April 8, with above 7,000 cases and around seven-eight per cent of positive cases were children. Many of these children may have antibody positivity. More children may die of inflammatory syndrome and less from active Covid infection,” Dr Oswal added.Dr Oswal also said that of the 4.893 million Covid-19 cases in Maharashtra, 10 per cent have been reported in those aged less than 20 years and so ,4,89,300 children have tested positive for Covid. He said, “Even if we consider 0.1% will have inflammatory syndrome then we will have 489 children in Maharashtra alone, and if not recognized early then they are likely to die. Many paediatricians may not be aware of the diagnosis and treatment of this condition and so we need expert manpower and also special drugs like IV immunoglobulin, plus Methylprednisolone in most, and Tocilizumab in a few cases which have to be stocked.” Dr Pradeep Suryavanshi, a paediatrician in the city, said, “At Sahyadri hospital we have had about 11 newborns who tested positive in the second wave and we also had two rare and interesting cases of newborn Covid cases, One case with convulsions and one case with heart failure.Both responded to steroids. We have put forward our study for publication in international journals. We have also had 67 Covid-19 positive kids suffer from PIMS and the common symptoms included fever, rash, breathing problems, hypotension and loose motions. Unfortunately, we had one death in these 67 cases.” Dos and don’ts to protect children from Covid-191. Don’t go outside - garden/ play area2. Less screen time3.

But it’s got to be done in a way that is cautious… we have just got to monitor the Indian variant, other variants,” said Johnson.He was joined at the briefing by Professor Chris Whitty, the Chief Medical Officer for England, who in his update on the pandemic circulation said that one of three subtypes of the Indian variant was of “some concern” as it showed a rise in numbers “sharply” in some parts of the UK from very low levels.“So that has to be monitored very carefully,” said Whitty.The Indian variant subtype B.1.617.2, which was found to be at least as highly transmissible as the dominant Kent variant in England, was designated as a VOC by PHE last week after over 500 cases were found in parts of England. It is among a list of variants, including South African and Brazilian variants, currently being monitored as VOCs in Britain.Under the eased lockdown rules from next week, people from different households so far able to meet only outdoors will be able to meet in indoor settings as up to six people or two households will be able to meet indoors and up to 30 people outdoors.From May 17 – the penultimate mark for a complete end to lockdown scheduled for June 21, the Stay in the UK restriction will be lifted and people will be able to travel for overnight stays and to green list countries. The unlock from next Monday will mean indoor hospitality can reopen and indoor entertainment can resume, including cinemas, museums, and children’s play areas.All remaining outdoor entertainment can reopen, such as outdoor cinemas and performances. Some larger events will be able to take place, including conferences, theatre and concert performances, and sports events. Restrictions on the number of attendees will remain in place.“The public can make informed, personal decisions on close contact, such as hugging, with their friends and family. Close contact continues to carry a risk of catching or spreading Covid-19, and people must consider the risk to themselves and to others. Covid-secure rules remain for the workplace and businesses, such as in shops and hospitality,” Downing Street said.Face coverings will no longer be needed in classrooms or for students in communal areas in secondary schools and colleges. Twice weekly home testing will remain in place to control infection rates. All remaining university students will be eligible to return to in-person teaching and learning from May 17, and should get tested twice a week upon return.Up to 30 people will now be able to attend weddings, receptions, and commemorative events including wakes, as well as standalone life-cycle events.These can take place outdoors or at any indoor Covid secure venue that is permitted to open. The number of people able to attend a funeral will be determined by the number that can be safely accommodated in the venue with social distancing in place.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/indian-variant-got-to-be-monitored-says-boris-johnson-as-uk-lockdown-eases-101620668169715.html

The organizers, Indian owners of a Dubai helium factory, shifted production to oxygen when the latest surge in virus cases hit India.As calls for help back home grew, the factory enlisted the help of the main Hindu temple based in the UAE's capital of Abu Dhabi, BAPS Shri Swaminarayan Mandir, to send oxygen supplies. COVID-19 patients are suffocating in India's capital, New Delhi, and other cities because of the shortage.Hindu spiritual leaders, dressed in saffron robes, came to bless the oxygen before sending it out, showering rose petals on the shipment and marking the cylinders with traditional orange dye.The UAE’s economy is powered by millions of foreign workers from Southeast Asia. Indian citizens make up nearly 30% of the population.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hindu-temple-in-uae-ships-oxygen-aid-to-covid-hit-india-101620666697721.html
10-05-2021||World||Biden admin to revive short-term work programme for foreign entrepreneurs||The Biden administration announced on Monday it will revive a short-term work programme for foreign entrepreneurs that former president Donald Trump had wanted to kill.The International Entrepreneur rule was proposed by then president Barack Obama in his final days in office - on January 17, 2017. The Trump administration was opposed to it and delayed it from going into effect, but a court vacated the delay and ordered the US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) to continue the programme. But it was clear to everyone, it was in Trump’s crosshairs.Under the programme, foreign entrepreneurs are allowed to set up start-ups in the United States over a period of five years; the company must get at least $250,000 in US venture capital and employ at 10 people.The work permit comes under the authority of the US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) to grant “parole”, which is different from a standard US visa. It allows a maximum of three persons for every start-up, to work in the US. Their families can join them, and spouses can seek work authorisation; but their children cannot.“Immigrants in the United States have a long history of entrepreneurship, hard work, and creativity, and their contributions to this nation are incredibly valuable,” said acting USCIS director Tracy Renaud. “The International Entrepreneur parole programme goes hand-in-hand with our nation’s spirit of welcoming entrepreneurship and USCIS encourages those who are eligible to take advantage of the programme.”“After four years of Trump-era obstruction, the International Entrepreneur Rule is finally coming to life,” tweeted Doug Rand, who had worked on immigration in the Obama White House. “It’s a pathway designed for entrepreneurs from abroad to create start-ups & jobs in the US.”President Biden has overturned or allowed to lapse many of former president Trump’s restrictive immigrant and non-immigrant visa programmes, including the suspension of Green Card (permanent residency). He has also proposed an ambitious legislation overhauling the immigration system, which, however, has no prospect of being enacted in its entirety.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-admin-to-revive-short-term-work-programme-for-foreign-entrepreneurs-101620666319495.html

Clinical testing started in Japan in March and if approved, it will be a new effective addition to Japan’s Covid-19 treatment, Kato said.A cocktail of two virus neutralizing antibodies casirivimab and imdevimab are synthetically manufactured copies of antibodies that the body produces after an infection.

10-05-2021||World||Despite highest birth rate, Shenzhen shows challenge of reversing China's demographic decline||From her four-bedroom flat in an affluent Shenzhen neighbourhood Sharpay Huang, 28-years-old and four months pregnant, is already weighing up how long to wait before having a second child.After graduating from a US college, starting a banking career and getting married, her confidence is typical of many young professionals in the thriving southern technology hub."About half the people I know from high school are married, and most of them have kids or are planning to have kids," she said.While Huang's enthusiasm would be welcomed by policymakers eager to reverse a sharp decline in China's birth rate, she is the exception rather than the rule.Shenzhen may have the highest birth rate among major cities in the country, but Yi Fuxian, a specialist in China's demographics at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, estimates it is less than half the 2.1 children per woman needed to maintain the population long term.If such a birth rate is elusive for China's "miracle" city, known as the birthplace of China's economic explosion and now the entrepreneurial home of high tech, it does not bode well for other cities that lack Shenzhen's resources.China's demographic decline, a legacy of its four-decades-long one-child policy, is a source of rising concern to officials. Like in other fast-greying countries, it puts more onus on the working-age population to support the economy.While the government is keen to reverse the decline, economists say a drop in the number of marriages and a rise in divorces, a lack of government financial support for new parents, together with a long-term slowdown in economic growth, have made reversing the slide in the birth rate difficult.The birth rate dropped an alarming 15% last year as China battled the Covid-19 outbreak, which emerged late in 2019.The government plans to announce details on Tuesday of last year's once-in-a-decade census. On April 29, it quashed reports the census would reveal China's first population decline in 50 years, saying the population continued to grow.'MODEL' METROPOLISShenzhen government figures in 2019 showed it had the highest birth rate among China's major cities with 21.7 babies for every 10,000 of its 13.44 million population. That's in part because a large proportion of its population are of childbearing age.But Shenzhen is struggling to meet many of the aspirations of would-be parents.Its education system is stretched. Fewer than half of 16 year-olds can find a public school place. There are similar shortages of primary school spots in some areas after the number of primary school students doubled between 2015 and 2019.Ren Zhengfei, the founder of Shenzhen-based tech giant Huawei Technologies, has said a lack of school places makes it hard to tempt company staff posted overseas back to the city.Shenzhen is crammed into 2,000 sq km (770 sq miles) - a third of Shanghai and an eighth of Beijing – so it is difficult to find room for more schools, Nie Xinping, a top city official said in December.The local government nevertheless has plans to add an extra 740,000 school places by 2025, up from 2.3 million in 2019."The government has worked hard, first catching up with building nurseries, then primary schools, now high schools – we're trying to catch this generation as it gets older," said a researcher with a government-affiliated think tank, who declined to be identified as he was not authorised to speak to the media.Shenzhen's education situation reflects wider challenges for parents across the country, reckons Zhiwei Zhang, the Shenzhen-based chief economist at Pinpoint Asset Management."Without effective reform on education, it would be difficult to alleviate parents' anxiety and improve the replacement rate, even in a city like Shenzhen with great economic prosperity and other public services," he said.High living costs and the highest housing prices relative to income of any city in China also weigh on wannabe parents in Shenzhen. Other major cities like Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou have experienced substantial rises in house prices too.The Shenzhen city government declined to comment.Yi expects the high cost of raising children in Shenzhen to push births down."Many young people are unable to get married," he said. "It is difficult for young couples to raise one child, let alone raise two children."Quan Quan, a 33-year-old masseuse in Shenzhen, illustrates Yi's point. She leaves her eight-year old daughter with her parents in her hometown near the central city of Chongqing, 1,400 km away.Quan's experience is typical of millions of workers across China who do not have access to local government services, such as free state schooling for their children, because authorities control the number of residency permits to limit pressure on local resources."Her teachers are good back home, and life is cheaper there, but of course it can't compare with Shenzhen, it's like heaven and earth," she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/shenzhen-has-highest-birth-rate-among-major-chinese-cities-but-101620664352867.html
10-05-2021||World||US pipeline hackers say their aim is money, not mayhem||The ransomware group accused of crippling the leading U.S. fuel pipeline operator said on Monday that its goal was to make money and not sow mayhem, a statement that experts saw as a sign the cybercriminals' scheme had gone farther than they had intended.The FBI accused the group that calls itself DarkSide of a digital extortion attempt that prompted Colonial Pipeline to shut down its network, potentially causing extraordinary disruption as gasoline deliveries dry up.In a statement on Monday, Colonial said it expected to "substantially" restore operational service by the end of the week.The terse news release posted to DarkSide's website early on Monday did not directly mention Colonial Pipeline but, under the heading "About the latest news," it noted that "our goal is to make money, and not creating problems for society."The statement did not say how much money the hackers were seeking. Colonial Pipeline did not immediately offer comment on the hackers' statement. The hackers have yet to return repeated Reuters requests to their website for further comment.DarkSide's statement said its hackers would launch checks on fellow cybercriminals "to avoid social consequences in the future." It added the group was "apolitical" and that observers "do not need to tie us" with any particular government.The statement, which had several spelling and grammatical errors, appeared geared toward lowering the political temperature around one of the most disruptive digital ransom schemes ever reported.Some security experts interpreted the statement as an indication that the DarkSide hackers were now trying to put some distance between themselves and the chaos they had unleashed."This isn't the first time a threat group has gotten in over their heads," said Lior Div, the co-founder and chief executive of Boston-based security company Cybereason.He said that ransomware groups like DarkSide depended on being able to squeeze their victims discreetly, without attracting too much law enforcement scrutiny."The global backlash is hurting their business," said Div.

10-05-2021||World||US state attorneys general urge Facebook to cancel plans for Instagram for younger kids||A group of 40 state attorneys general on Monday urged Facebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg to abandon plans to launch a version of Instagram for children under the age of 13."Use of social media can be detrimental to the health and well-being of children, who are not equipped to navigate the challenges of having a social media account," the officials said in a letter."Further, Facebook has historically failed to protect the welfare of children on its platforms," they said.The letter also signed by the attorneys general of the District of Columbia and three U.S. territories.A Facebook spokesman said the company has "just started exploring a version of Instagram for kids" and said it was committing "to not showing ads in any Instagram experience we develop for people under the age of 13".The company said it agreed any version of the photo-sharing app Instagram "must prioritize their safety and privacy, and we will consult with experts in child development, child safety and mental health, and privacy advocates to inform it".The bipartisan letter, which was signed by the attorneys general of New York, Texas, California, Massachusetts, Nebraska, Michigan, Ohio, Utah, Vermont, Kentucky and others said "it appears that Facebook is not responding to a need, but instead creating one".Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey said on Twitter that a children's Instagram "is a shameful attempt to exploit and profit off vulnerable people".The letter said media reports from 2019 showed that Facebook’s Messenger Kids app, intended for kids between the ages of six and 12, "contained a significant design flaw that allowed children to circumvent restrictions on online interactions and join group chats with strangers that were not previously approved by the children’s parents".Last month, the Campaign for a Commercial-Free Childhood also called on Zuckerberg not to create a kids version, saying it would put them at "great risk."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-state-ags-urge-facebook-to-cancel-plans-for-instagram-for-younger-kids-101620663436281.html
10-05-2021||World||Hundreds of bodies of Covid-19 victims still stored in New York's refrigerated trucks||New York City is still using refrigerated trucks to store bodies of coronavirus victims, more than a year after they were first set up as temporary morgues as deaths surged at the height of the pandemic.The city’s medical examiner’s office said Friday that 750 bodies are being kept in long-term storage in refrigerated trailers at a Brooklyn pier while family members sort out plans for their final resting places.Dina Maniotis, a deputy commissioner with the Office of Chief Medical Examiner, told a city council committee on Wednesday that many of the bodies held at the 39th Street Pier could end up buried in the city’s potter’s field on Hart Island.In April 2020, the city shortened the amount of time it would hold unclaimed remains to 14 days before burying them on Hart Island. At the time, officials said, they were exploring the option of interring unclaimed remains on the island temporarily so they could be moved later on.Mark Desire, a spokesperson for the medical examiner’s office, said permanent burial on Hart Island is an option for the next-of-kin of Covid-19 victims whose bodies remain in refrigerated trucks.“Long term storage was created at the height of the pandemic to ensure that families could lay their loved ones to rest as they see fit,” Desire said. “With sensitivity and compassion, we continue to work with individual families on a case by case basis during their period of mourning.The non-profit news website The City reported on the matter this week. The website noted that between 500 and about 800 bodies have been kept in cold storage at any given time since April 2020.Those figures were based on estimates by the medical examiner’s office compiled by the website and Columbia University’s Stabile Center for Investigative Reporting.The Federal Emergency Management Agency sent 85 refrigerated trucks to serve as temporary morgues last year as Covid-19 deaths overwhelmed the city’s permanent morgues and filled storage spaces in many hospitals to capacity.Many were parked outside hospitals and workers in protective gear used forklifts to place bodies inside in what became a grim, daily ritual.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hundreds-of-bodies-of-covid-19-victims-still-in-new-york-s-refrigerated-trucks-101620660542303.html
10-05-2021||World||Air raid sirens, explosions heard in Jerusalem amid tensions||Explosions have been heard in Jerusalem after air raid sirens sounded.The sirens came Monday, shortly after the Hamas militant group in Gaza had set a deadline for Israel to remove its security forces from the Al-Aqsa Mosque compound.Abu Obeida, spokesman for Hamas’ military wing, said the rocket attack was a response to what he called Israeli “crimes and aggression” in Jerusalem. “This is a message the enemy has to understand well,” he said.He threatened more attacks if Israel again invades the Al-Aqsa compound or carries out evictions of Palestinian families in a neighborhood of east Jerusalem.The sounds of outgoing rocket fire were heard in Gaza shortly before the sirens went off. Later, a new barrage of rockets was heard.There were no immediate reports of injuries or damage.THIS IS A BREAKING NEWS STORY. AP's earlier report is below:Israeli police firing tear gas, stun grenades and rubber bullets clashed with stone-throwing Palestinians at a flashpoint Jerusalem holy site on Monday, the latest in a series of confrontations that threatened to push the contested city toward wider conflict.In an apparent attempt to avoid further confrontation, Israeli authorities changed the planned route of a march by ultranationalist Jews through the Muslim Quarter of the Old City. The marchers were ordered to avoid the area and sent on a different route circumventing the Muslim Quarter on their way to the Western Wall, the holiest site where Jews can pray.But tensions remained high after Monday morning's violence.More than a dozen tear gas canisters and stun grenades landed in the Al-Aqsa Mosque, one of Islam's holiest sites, as police and protesters faced off inside the walled compound that surrounds it, said an Associated Press photographer at the scene. Smoke rose in front of the mosque and the iconic golden-domed shrine on the site, and rocks littered the nearby plaza. Inside one area of the compound, shoes and debris lay scattered over ornate carpets.More than 305 Palestinians were hurt, including 228 who went to hospitals and clinics for treatment, according to the Palestinian Red Crescent. Seven of the injured were in serious condition. Police said 21 officers were hurt, including three who were hospitalized. Israeli paramedics said seven Israeli civilians were also hurt.The confrontation was the latest after weeks of mounting tensions between Palestinians and Israeli troops in the Old City of Jerusalem, the emotional center of their conflict. There have been almost nightly clashes during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, already a time of heightened religious sensitivities.Most recently, the tensions have been fueled by the planned eviction of dozens of Palestinians from the Sheikh Jarrah neighborhood of east Jerusalem where Israeli settlers have waged a lengthy legal battle to take over properties. Monday was expected to be particularly tense since Israelis mark it as Jerusalem Day to celebrate their capture of east Jerusalem in the 1967 Mideast war.On Monday, two anti-Arab members of Israel's parliament, surrounded by an entourage and police, pushed through a line of protesters in the Sheikh Jarrah neighborhood. Several Arab members of parliament were among those trying to stop Betzalel Smotrich and Itamar Ben Gvir, amid shouting and jostling. At one point during the scrum, the protesters pounded on the sides of a dumpster, and one man yelled at Smotrich in Arabic, “Get out of here, you dog!”Smotrich and Ben Gvir eventually got to the other side of a police barricade and entered a house already inhabited by settlers.Over the past few days, hundreds of Palestinians and several dozen police officers have been hurt in clashes in and around the Old City, including the sacred compound, which is known to Jews as the Temple Mount and to Muslims as the Noble Sanctuary. The compound which has been the trigger for rounds of Israel-Palestinian violence in the past, is Islam’s third-holiest site and considered Judaism’s holiest.An AP photographer at the scene said that early Monday morning, protesters had barricaded gates to the walled compound with wooden boards and scrap metal. Sometime after 7. a.m., clashes erupted, with those inside throwing stones at police deployed outside. Police entered the compound, firing tear gas, rubber-coated steel pellets and stun grenades.At some point during the morning about 400 people, both young protesters and older worshippers, were inside the carpeted Al-Aqsa Mosque. Police fired tear gas and stun grenades into the mosque.Police said protesters hurled stones at officers and onto an adjoining roadway near the Western Wall, where thousands of Israeli Jews had gathered to pray.After several days of Jerusalem confrontations, Israel has come under growing international criticism for its heavy-handed actions at the site, particularly during Ramadan.The U.N. Security Council scheduled closed consultations on the situation Monday.Late Sunday, the U.S. National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan spoke to his Israeli counterpart, Meir Ben-Shabbat. A White House statement said that Sullivan called on Israel to “pursue appropriate measures to ensure calm” and expressed the U.S.’s “serious concerns” about the ongoing violence and planned evictions.Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu pushed back against the criticism Monday, saying Israel is determined to ensure the rights of worship for all and that this “requires from time to time stand up and stand strong as Israeli police and our security forces are doing now.”Ofir Gendelman, a spokesman for Netanyahu, claimed in a tweet that “extremist Palestinians planned well in advance to carry out riots” at the holy site, sharing photos of mounds of stones and wooden barricades inside the compound.Ayman Odeh, a leading Arab politician in Israel, blamed the violence on Israel’s discriminatory policies toward the Palestinians and said it had provoked the violence. “Wherever you find occupation, you will find resistance,” he said at a news conference in Sheikh Jarrah.In other violence, Palestinian protesters hurled rocks at an Israeli vehicle driving just outside the Old City walls. The driver later told public broadcaster Kan that his windows were smashed by stones and pepper spray shot into the car. CCTV footage released by the police showed a crowd surrounding the car and pelting it with rocks when it swerved off the road and into a stone barrier and a bystander.Police said two passengers were injured.The day began with police announcing that Jews would be barred from visiting the holy site on Jerusalem Day, which is marked with a flag-waving parade through the Old City that is widely perceived by Palestinians as a provocative display in the contested city.But just as the parade was about to begin, police said they were altering the route at the instruction of political leaders. Several thousand people, many of them from Jewish settlements in the West Bank, were participating.In the 1967 war in which Israel captured east Jerusalem, it also took the West Bank and Gaza Strip. It later annexed east Jerusalem and considers the entire city its capital. The Palestinians seek all three areas for a future state, with east Jerusalem as their capital.The recent round of violence began when Israel blocked off a popular spot where Muslims traditionally gather each night during Ramadan at the end of their daylong fast. Israel later removed the restrictions, but clashes quickly resumed amid tensions over the planned eviction of Palestinians from Sheikh Jarrah.Israel’s Supreme Court postponed a key ruling Monday that could have forced dozens of Palestinians from their homes, citing the “circumstances.”The tensions in Jerusalem have threatened to reverberate throughout the region.Palestinian militants in the Gaza Strip have fired several barrages of rockets into Israel, and protesters allied with the ruling Hamas militant group have launched dozens of incendiary balloons into Israel, setting off fires across the southern part of the country.Hamas issued an ultimatum, giving Israel until 6 p.m. to remove its forces from the mosque compound and Sheikh Jarrah and release Palestinians detained in the latest clashes. It was not immediately clear what Hamas planned to do if its demands weren't met.In response, COGAT, the Israeli Defense Ministry organ responsible for crossings with the Gaza Strip, announced Monday that it was closing the Erez crossing to all but humanitarian and exceptional cases until further notice.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/air-raid-sirens-explosions-heard-in-jerusalem-amid-tensions-101620660265602.html

All you need to know||The US Navy on Sunday announced that they seized a huge cache of weapons from a small ship in the international waters of the North Arabian Sea. The Navy said that the guided-missile cruiser USS Monterey (CG 61) and US Coast Guard Advanced Interdiction Team (AIT) discovered the illicit arms shipment, wrapped in green plastic, on a stateless dhow during a routine flag verification boarding on May 6.The scale of the find came into focus after the weapons were laid out on the deck of the US warship in a two-day operation. The massive arms haul covered much of the rear deck of the 567-foot (173-meter) USS Monterey, which was visible in the photographs shared by the US Navy.“The cache of weapons included dozens of advanced Russian-made anti-tank guided missiles, thousands of Chinese Type 56 assault rifles, and hundreds of PKM machine guns, sniper rifles and rocket-propelled grenades launchers. Other weapon components included advanced optical sights,” the Navy’s Mideast-based 5th Fleet said in a statement.The Navy further stated that the dhow was assessed for seaworthiness following the removal of all illicit cargo and its crew was released after questioning. While the 5th Fleet said the original source and intended destination of the material are currently under investigation, an American defence official told The Associated Press that the initial probe found the vessel came from Iran, indicating that the cargo was likely bound to Yemen.Yemen has been marred with internal conflicts for years in which the factions, including the Houthi rebels, are backed by external forces like Iran, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. Around 130,000 people have been killed in the ongoing civil war and at least 3.65 million people have been displaced since March 2015, according to the UN refugee agency, making it one of the biggest humanitarian crises.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-navy-massive-arms-haul-covered-rear-deck-of-567-foot-warship-all-you-need-to-know-101620658665802.html

Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's press aide Fahrettin Altun wrote on Twitter."To humanity, we say: It's time to put this apartheid state in its place!"Erdogan himself had on Saturday called Israel a "cruel terrorist state" that was attacking Palestinians "in a savage manner devoid of ethics".Relations between Israel and Turkey have been strained since a Turkish NGO oversaw a flotilla of ships that tried to break Israel's blockade of the Gaza Strip in 2010.Hundreds of people demonstrated in support of Palestinians on Sunday evening outside Israel's consulate in Istanbul.The Turkish police did not intervene despite a ban on large public gatherings in place because of the coronavirus pandemic.A range of top Turkish officials took to Twitter on Monday to denounce Israel's actions.Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said those "who do not speak out against this atrocity should not talk about (the) Middle East Peace Process".The four members of the Middle East Quartet involved in the stalled process -- the US, Russia, the EU and the UN -- on Saturday expressed "deep concern" over the violence and called on "Israeli authorities to exercise restraint".||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/turkey-demands-end-to-israel-s-heinous-cruel-attacks-101620638475355.html

"We haven't seen any response from their side so far, so we are moving forward with the issue, as we were, in the court," he said.UK Club said the reduced amount proposed had not been reflected in SCA's claim filed at court."The Ever Given's owners still have not been provided with evidence that would support a claim of this size, which remains exceptionally large. The Ever Given's interests continue to negotiate in good faith with the SCA," it added.An Egyptian economic court is due to hold a hearing on May 22 to consider the SCA claim for what it describes as losses due to the blockage and costs for dislodging the ship, SCA sources said.An Egyptian investigation into the incident found no wrongdoing by the SCA or its pilots, the sources said, without elaborating.One source said the court could authorise the SCA to auction off the ship if the owner rejected any ruling to compensate the canal authority. Rabie has also mentioned such an outcome.An Egyptian court rejected an appeal by Shoei Kisen against the Ever Given's detention earlier this month.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/insurer-of-ever-given-that-blocked-suez-canal-says-reduced-claim-still-high-101620654332247.html
10-05-2021||World||Vaccine maker BioNTech says no need to waive patents||The head of German pharmaceutical company BioNTech said Monday that there is no need to waive patents on coronavirus vaccines because manufacturers will be able to produce enough shots to supply the world over the coming year.Ugur Sahin, the chief executive of BioNTech, rejected the US-backed proposal to temporarily lift some intellectual property rights for vaccines in order to boost global supply during the ongoing pandemic.In a call with investors announcing the company's first-quarter net profit of 1.13 billion euros ($1.37 billion), Sahin said BioNTech and its US partner Pfizer had already delivered vaccines to more than 90 countries and more than doubled its forecast production capacity for the year.“We have now scaled the manufacturing capacity up to 3 billion doses in 2021, and more than 40% of these doses are expected to go to middle- and low-income countries,” Sahin said.Waiving patents would not ease supply shortages in the coming months, he said, citing the complexity of producing the mRNA-based shot his company developed last year.Sahin said his company is working to further expand its manufacturing network with its own sites, such as one now planned in Singapore, and through cooperation with other manufacturers to ensure greater supply while maintaining the quality of the vaccine. But he also noted that rival manufacturers have their own shots either on the market already or in the pipeline."We believe, together with the other vaccine developers, in the next 9 to 12 months, that there will be more than enough vaccine produced and there is absolutely no need for waiving patents,” he said.BioNTech's estimated revenues surged to over 2 billion euros for the period from January to March, compared with just 28 million euros in the same period last year, after it launched the first widely used vaccine against Covid-19 together with Pfizer, which holds the market and distribution rights in much of the world.The Mainz-based company said its revenues included over 1.75 billion euros in gross profits from vaccine sales in Pfizer's territories, and almost 200 million from sales to customers in its region. Based on current orders for some 1.8 billion doses, it expects full-year revenues of 12.4 billion euros in 2021.BioNTech shares rose by more than 7% to $196.60 in early trading Monday on Nasdaq.The results are a significant turnaround for the company, which made a net loss of 53 million euros in the first quarter of 2020.Early last year as the pandemic began, BioNTech pivoted from researching treatments for cancer to developing a vaccine against Covid-19. Like its rival Moderna, the company's vaccine uses mRNA technology to prime the body's immune system to attack the virus.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/vaccine-maker-biontech-says-no-need-to-waive-patents-101620658130906.html

"Seasonal influenza and Covid-19 combination vaccines will likely be critical to combating emerging Covid-19 variants," said Russell Wilson, the executive vice president and NanoFlu general manager of Novavax.Hamsters that received the combined vaccine had heightened levels of Covid-19 antibodies two weeks after the first immunization, which increased significantly after a second dose, compared to animals that received the Covid-19 vaccine, NVX-CoV2373, alone, the company said.Novavax said it expects to start clinical studies of the combined vaccine by the end of 2021.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/novavax-combined-influenza-covid-19-vaccine-shows-promise-in-animal-study-101620654364973.html
10-05-2021||World||Britain's PM Boris Johnson faces investigation over overseas trip rules||Prime Minister Boris Johnson is being investigated by the U.K. Parliament’s standards regulator amid claims he may have broken the rules on declaring a luxury holiday to the Caribbean.The premier and his partner traveled to the island of Mustique over the New Year in 2020 and questions have been raised in the British media over whether he properly registered payments toward the trip.Now Kathryn Stone, the parliamentary commissioner for standards, has confirmed she’s formally investigating whether Johnson broke the rules over the holiday.Johnson is already facing a series of inquiries into whether he has broken rules, with a number of them focusing on how he funded a lavish refurbishment of his official Downing Street apartment.The main opposition Labour party has repeatedly attacked Johnson over these arrangements. Yet voters don’t seem to care. In last week’s elections Johnson’s Conservatives performed better than expected while Labour slipped up.Under Parliamentary rules, MPs are required to register in a public report significant donations and gifts, including foreign visits which have not been paid for entirely from their own funds or by the government.Johnson last year registered Carphone Warehouse co-founder David Ross as having given him 15,000 pounds ($21,000) worth of “accommodation for a private holiday for my partner and me.”Ross at first said he hadn’t paid for the holiday but later clarified that the register was accurate and that he had “facilitated accommodation.” Labour then wrote to Stone requesting an investigation.“Another day, another investigation into Boris Johnson for more sleaze and dodgy dealings,” Angela Rayner, Labour’s deputy leader, said on Monday. “The public have a right to know who paid for Boris Johnson’s luxury Caribbean holiday and the renovation of his flat. Most importantly, we need to know what these donors were promised or expected in return for their generosity.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/britains-pm-boris-johnson-faces-investigation-over-overseas-trip-rules-101620645898756.html
10-05-2021||World||Cautious cuddling? England to OK hugs as lockdown eases||In England, it's going to be time to hug again.British Prime Minister Boris Johnson is expected to give the go-ahead for that much-missed human contact when he announces the next round of lockdown easing later Monday in the wake of a sharp fall in new coronavirus infections.The UK is now recording around 2,000 new coronavirus cases a day, compared with a daily peak of nearly 70,000 in January. Daily deaths have also plummeted with only two recorded on Sunday.The country's alert level was also lowered to level three from four on Monday following a “consistent” fall in cases, hospital admissions and deaths. This means that transmission of the virus is no longer deemed to be high or rising exponentially, though still being in general circulation.While hugs between households will be allowed again beginning May 17, Johnson is expected to stress that they should be done with care, given concerns about new virus variants that could bypass some of the immunity provided by Britain's successful vaccination campaign.Johnson is also expected to confirm that different households will be able to mix indoors in homes as well as in pubs and restaurants. However, the gatherings are to be capped at six people or two different households if that is higher. The limits on outdoor gatherings are expected to be raised to 30 people.Indoor entertainment activities such as cinemas, soft play areas, adult group sports, exercise classes and hotels are also expected to reopen.Since the lockdown started to be eased in recent weeks as part of a plan the government insists is being driven by “data, not dates,” the mixing of households was only allowed outdoors, such as in a garden or restaurant patio, provided that social distancing was followed.“I think it’s what most people have missed, that intimate contact with family and friends, and entertaining, having people in your own house, meeting outdoors," Health Minister Nadine Dorries said.The government has allowed some foreign travel to start on May 17 but only a handful of destinations are deemed safe enough to ditch the 10-day quarantine requirements upon return. Portugal and Iceland now have no quarantine requirements but other popular destinations such as France, Italy, Spain and Greece will still require quarantining and a series of coronavirus tests.Similar restrictions are being eased in the other parts of the UK — Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland — following a sharp fall in new infections as a result of a long winter lockdown and the rapid rollout of vaccines.Although the UK has recorded Europe's highest coronavirus death toll, with more than 127,500 dead, new infections have dropped dramatically. In addition, the success of Britain's vaccine rollout has raised hopes that this easing will not see the same virus resurgence that happened last fall following a lifting of restrictions during the summer.Around 53% of the British population have received one dose of vaccine while more than a quarter have had two jabs — one of the speediest vaccine rollouts in the world.The ensuing round of lockdown easing is expected on June 21. The hope is that all other limits on social contacts will be lifted then.Though the coronavirus backdrop is clearly much improved, there are concerns that the government is being overly hasty with lifting the restrictions on social contact at a time when some parts of the world, such as India, are in the midst of a huge resurgence of the virus, and the vaccine rollout still has a way to go.Gurch Randhawa, a professor of diversity in public health at the University of Bedfordshire, is one who's wary, and cautioned about potential mixed messaging coming from the government.“It is no doubt tempting to relax social distancing, offer the glimmer of a much needed hug, and lift restrictions on international travel, but this could be a big mistake at this stage of the Covid-19 pandemic," he said.“As a minimum, the government should be advising only those have received both vaccination doses to be hugging each other, and even, a short hug, with faces directed away from each other to minimize risk of Covid-19 transmission,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/cautious-cuddling-england-to-ok-hugs-as-lockdown-eases-101620653009599.html

10-05-2021||World||Indian coronavirus variant found in Thai travelers from Pakistan||Health authorities in Thailand said Monday they have confirmed the country’s first cases of the Indian variant of the coronavirus, in a Thai woman and her 4-year-old son who have been in state quarantine since arriving from Pakistan.The finding comes as Thailand battles a new wave of the coronavirus that began at the beginning of April, originating in upmarket entertainment venues in Bangkok and spawning clusters in several crowded slum communities. Many of the recent cases involve the British variant of the virus, which is more infectious than the original form found last year.Thailand banned travelers from India, other than Thai citizens, starting on May 1 in response to a massive outbreak of Covid-19 cases in the South Asian nation that began in early April. India has reported more than 22.6 million infections, second only to the United States, and more than 246,000 deaths. Both figures are widely believed to be undercounts.Thailand extended the entry ban to foreigners visiting from Pakistan, Bangladesh and Nepal on Monday in an effort to keep the Indian variant from spreading, Thai Foreign Ministry spokesperson Tanee Sangrat said.Apisamai Srirangsan, a deputy spokesperson for the government’s Center for Covid-19 Situation Administration, said separately that Thai authorities are also worried about people who cross into Thailand illegally, mostly from neighboring Cambodia and Myanmar.Apisamai said the Indian variant was found in a pregnant 42-year-old woman who arrived on April 24 with three sons. She and her 4-year-old were staying in the same room under state quarantine. The two other sons, ages 6 and 8, stayed in another room and tested negative.Thailand on Monday announced 1,630 new cases, bringing its confirmed total to 85,005 since the pandemic began. There were 22 new deaths, for a total of 421.About one-third of the reported cases in the latest wave were found in Bangkok, where daily increases have declined to 565 on Monday from 980 on Sunday and a record 1,112 on Saturday.New clusters continue to be discovered in Bangkok, not only in crowded communities, but also at markets and department stores.Other clusters have been found among migrant workers at factories in two provinces near Bangkok.In the eastern province of Chanthaburi, a gem mining center, nearly 100 cases were found among African gem traders, the newspaper Thai Rath reported, citing the provincial health office. The governor this past weekend ordered the closure of gem and amulets markets, it said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/indian-coronavirus-variant-found-in-thai-travelers-from-pakistan-101620652467603.html
10-05-2021||World||Biden reverses Trump's decision, protects gay and transgender in health care||The US will protect gay and transgender people against sex discrimination in health care, the Biden administration announced Monday, reversing a Trump-era policy that sought to narrow the scope of legal rights in sensitive situations involving medical care.The action by the Department of Health and Human Services affirms that federal laws forbidding sex discrimination in health care also protect gay and transgender people. The Trump administration had defined “sex” to mean gender assigned at birth, thereby excluding transgender people from the law's umbrella of protection.“Fear of discrimination can lead individuals to forgo care, which can have serious negative health consequences," HHS Secretary Xavier Becerra said in a statement. “Everyone — including LGBTQ people — should be able to access health care, free from discrimination or interference, period.”Becerra said the Biden administration policy will bring HHS into line with a landmark Supreme Court decision last year in a workplace discrimination case, which established that federal laws against sex discrimination on the job also protect gay and transgender people.Despite that ruling, the Trump administration proceeded to try to narrow the legal protections against health care discrimination, issuing rules that narrowly defined “sex” as biological gender. A federal judge had blocked those rules from taking effect, although Trump administration officials argued that as a legal matter health care discrimination was a separate issue from the employment case the Supreme Court decided.Monday's action means that the HHS Office for Civil Rights will again investigate complaints of sex discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity. Hospitals, clinics and other medical providers can face government sanctions for violations of the law.The Biden administration action essentially restores policy established during the Obama years. The Affordable Care Act included a prohibition on sex discrimination in health care and the Obama administration had interpreted that to apply to gay and transgender people as well. It relied on a broad understanding of sex shaped by a person’s inner sense of being male, female, neither or a combination.Behind the dispute over rights for transgender people in particular is a medically recognized condition called “gender dysphoria” — discomfort or distress caused by a discrepancy between the gender that a person identifies as and the gender assigned at birth. Consequences can include severe depression. Treatment can range from gender confirmation surgery and hormones to people changing their outward appearance by adopting a different hairstyle or clothing.Medical groups and civil rights organizations generally support broader legal protections for gay and transgender people, while social and religious conservatives sought to narrow their scope.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-reverses-trump-s-decision-protects-gay-and-transgender-in-health-care-101620650598708.html
10-05-2021||World||Nepal Prime Minister K P Sharma Oli loses vote of confidence in parliament||Nepal Prime Minister K P Sharma Oli lost a trust vote in the House of Representatives on Monday, in a fresh setback to the embattled premier seeking to tighten his grip on power after the CPN (Maoist Centre) led by Pushpakamal Dahal ‘Prachanda’ withdrew support to his government.Prime Minister Oli secured 93 votes in the lower house of parliament during a special session convened on the directives of President Bidya Devi Bhandari.Oli, 69, required at least 136 votes in the 275-member House of Representatives to win the confidence motion as four members are currently under suspension. A total of 124 members voted against the confidence motion while 15 members stayed neutral, Speaker Agni Sapkota announced. The session was attended by 232 lawmakers."As the votes cast in favour of the motion fell short to achieve a majority of the existing strength of the House of Representatives, I hereby declare that the prime minister’s motion to seek a vote of confidence has been rejected,” Sapkota announced before adjourning the House.With this, Prime Minister Oli is automatically relieved from his post as per Article 100 (3).Some 28 Lawmakers belonging to Oli’s rival faction led by Madhav Nepal-Jhala Nath Khanal abstained during the voting.The main Opposition Nepali Congress and the Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist Centre), which control 61 and 49 votes, respectively, voted against Oli’s trust motion.The Janata Samajbadi Party, which has 32 votes, however, was divided. The Mahantha Thakur-led faction stayed neutral while the Upendra Yadav-led group voted against Oli.After its alliance Nepal Communist Party Maoist Centre led by Prachanda withdrew its support to the government last week, Oli’s government was reduced to a minority one.After losing the Vote of Confidence, the Prime Minister is automatically removed from his post and now the new coalition government will be formed as per the constitutional process, said senior Nepali Congress leader Prakash Man Singh.Senior leader of CPN-Maoist Ganesh Shah said that Oli should immediately resign from the post and pave way for the formation of an alternative government.The CPN-Maoist will join hands with the Nepali Congress and other parties who voted against Oli to form a coalition government at the earliest, he said.Nepal plunged into a political crisis on December 20 last year after President Bhandari dissolved the House and announced fresh elections on April 30 and May 10 at the recommendation of Prime Minister Oli, amidst a tussle for power within the ruling Nepal Communist Party (NCP).Oli's move to dissolve the House sparked protests from a large section of the NCP led by his rival 'Prachanda'.In February, the apex court reinstated the dissolved House of Representatives, in a setback to Oli who was preparing for snap polls.Oli repeatedly defended his move to dissolve the House of Representatives, saying some leaders of his party were attempting to form a "parallel government".Oli, who joined politics as a student activist in his teenage and spent 14 years in jail for opposing the now-abolished monarchy, became Nepal's Prime Minister for a second time in 2018 as a joint candidate of the Left alliance.The alliance between the CPN (Unified Marxist–Leninist) and Pushpa Kamal Dahal ‘Prachana’-led CPN (Maoist Centre) won a majority in the House of Representatives and in six of the seven provincial assemblies in the 2017 elections. After their victory, the two parties formally merged in May 2018.However, the NCP, formed after the merger between Oli-led CPN-UML and 'Prachanda'-led CPN (Maoist Centre) in May 2018, split following the power tussle between the two leaders. ‘Prachanda’-led faction withdrew its support to the Oli government last wek, reducing it to a minority one.Known for his pro-China stance, Oli had earlier served as the country's prime minister from October 11, 2015 to August 3, 2016 during which Kathmandu's ties with New Delhi had strained.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nepal-prime-minister-oli-loses-vote-of-confidence-in-parliament-101620650130627.html
10-05-2021||World||Explained: What's behind the Israeli-Palestinian clashes in Jerusalem?||For weeks now, Palestinian protesters and Israeli police have clashed on a daily basis in and around Jerusalem's Old City, home to major religious sites sacred to Jews, Christians and Muslims and the emotional epicenter of the Middle East conflict.Jerusalem has been the scene of violent confrontations between Jews and Arabs for 100 years and remains one of the most bitterly contested cities on earth. The latest clashes began a month ago with an Israeli move to block some Palestinian gatherings at the beginning of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, already a time of heightened religious sensitivities. After those restrictions eased, tensions over a plan to evict dozens of Palestinians from an east Jerusalem neighborhood continued to fuel confrontations.On Monday, stun grenades echoed across a holy hilltop compound, and hundreds of Palestinians were hurt in clashes between stone-throwing protesters and police firing tear gas and rubber bullets. Police were also injured.Here's a look at why Jerusalem always seems to be on edge — and what set off the latest round of violence.Capital of two peoplesIsrael views Jerusalem as its “unified, eternal” capital. It had captured east Jerusalem, which includes the Old City, in the 1967 Mideast war, along with the West Bank and Gaza. Palestinians want those territories for their future state, with east Jerusalem serving as their eventual capital. But Israel annexed the eastern part of the city in a move not recognized internationally.The fate of east Jerusalem has been one of the thorniest issues in the peace process, which ground to a halt more than a decade ago.Israelis on Monday were set to mark Jerusalem Day, a national holiday celebrating the annexation. In past years, thousands of Israelis — mainly religious nationalists — have marched through the Old City, including the densely populated Muslim Quarter, in a display considered provocative by many Palestinians.In recent days, hard-line Israelis have staged other events in east Jerusalem, leading to scattered, violent altercations with Palestinians.___The holy hilltopMonday's clashes took place in and around the Al-Aqsa Mosque in the Old City. The mosque is the third-holiest site in Islam and sits on a sprawling plateau that is also home to the iconic golden Dome of the Rock. Muslims refer to the compound as the Noble Sanctuary.The walled plateau is also the holiest site for Jews, who refer to it as the Temple Mount, because it was the location of biblical temples. Romans destroyed the Second Temple in 70 A.D., with only the Western Wall remaining. The mosques were built centuries later.Neighboring Jordan serves as the custodian of the site, which is operated by an Islamic endowment known as the Waqf. The site is open to tourists during certain times but only Muslims are allowed to pray there. The Western Wall is the holiest site where Jews can pray.In recent years, groups of religious and nationalist Jews escorted by police have been visiting the compound in greater numbers and holding prayers in defiance of rules established after 1967 by Israel, Jordan and Muslim religious authorities. The Palestinians view the frequent visits and attempted prayers by Jews as a provocation, and it often ignites scuffles or more serious violence.Some Israelis say the site should be open to all worshippers. The Palestinians refuse, fearing that Israel will eventually take over the site or partition it. Israeli officials say they have no intention of changing the status quo.___Discriminatory policiesJews born in east Jerusalem are Israeli citizens, while Palestinians from east Jerusalem are granted a form of permanent residency that can be revoked if they live outside the city for an extended period. They can apply for citizenship, but it's a long and uncertain process and most choose not to because they don't recognize Israeli control.Israel has built Jewish settlements in east Jerusalem that are home to some 220,000 people. It has severely limited the growth of Palestinian neighborhoods, leading to overcrowding and the unauthorized construction of thousands of homes that are at risk of demolition.The Israeli rights group B'Tselem and the New York-based Human Rights Watch cited the discriminatory policies in east Jerusalem in recent reports arguing that Israel is guilty of the crime of apartheid. Israel rejects those allegations, saying Jerusalem residents are treated equally.___Threatened evictionsThe recent nightly clashes began at the start of Ramadan, when Israeli police placed barriers outside the Old City’s Damascus Gate, a popular gathering place after the evening prayers during the holy month when Muslims fast from dawn to dusk. They later removed the barriers, but then protests escalated over the threatened eviction of dozens of Palestinian families from the east Jerusalem neighborhood of Sheikh Jarrah.The families have been embroiled in a long legal battle with ideological Jewish settlers who seek to acquire property in crowded Palestinian neighborhoods just outside the Old City. Israel portrays it as a private real-estate dispute, but the families' plight has attracted global attention.___Wider unrestClashes in Jerusalem, and particularly in Al-Aqsa, often reverberate across the region.The Palestinian militant group Hamas, which rules Gaza, has called for a new intifada, or uprising, like the one triggered by an Israeli politician's visit to Al-Aqsa in 2000. Gaza militants have fired rockets and balloons with incendiary devices attached to them in support of the protesters as an informal cease-fire with Israel has started to fray.Protests have been held in the occupied West Bank and in Arab communities inside Israel. A series of deadly shootings in the West Bank last week has also heightened tensions.Jordan and other Arab nations that have friendly ties with Israel have condemned its crackdown on the protests, while Israel's archenemy Iran has encouraged Palestinian attacks. The U.S. and the EU have condemned the violence and expressed concern about the evictions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/explained-what-s-behind-the-clashes-in-jerusalem-101620648588230.html
10-05-2021||World||Palestinians stone Israeli car, which crashes, as Jerusalem seethes||On a busy street outside Jerusalem's walled Old City on Monday, a group of Palestinians pelted an Israeli car with rocks in a moment of violence captured on CCTV video.When it was over, the driver stood, an improvised bandage on his head and blood on his shirt, next to his wrecked car, guarded by a policeman with his pistol drawn. One of the attackers, who was hit by the vehicle, had already limped away.Palestinians accused the motorist of a deliberate ramming. Police say the driver lost control of the car.The incident took place as hundreds of Palestinians clashed with Israeli police outside al-Aqsa mosque in the Old City in violence that coincided with Jerusalem Day, when Israel celebrates its capture of East Jerusalem in the 1967 Arab-Israeli war.The Palestinian Red Crescent Society said more than 275 Palestinians were injured in the general violence. Police said 12 officers were hurt.The CCTV footage, which police released on Twitter, began with Palestinians milling around slow-moving traffic, apparently trying to spot Israeli drivers, and then converging on a white car.One of the Palestinians briefly opened a door of the vehicle as it backed away, rocks pelting its bonnet.The car then swerved back into the junction, striking one of the stone-throwers, throwing him backwards, and pinioning itself on a pavement barricade, the CCTV video showed.Several Palestinians rushed up to lob rocks at the driver and a passenger, who could be seen gesticulating through the window. The stone-thrower struck by the vehicle quickly got to his feet and limped off, helped by other Palestinians.Twenty-five seconds after the collision, an Israeli police officer arrived and fired his pistol in the air to disperse the crowd."Move back! Move back!" the policeman ordered, pointing his gun, while also appearing to warn the driver, who spat at the Palestinians, to stay next to the wrecked car."If you don't want trouble, get him out of here," a male voice can be heard responding.Interviewed on Israel's N12 news site, the driver said: "We tried to flee and our car ended up almost overturning."Police said he and a passenger were lightly hurt in the incident.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/palestinians-stone-israeli-car-which-crashes-as-jerusalem-seethes-101620648578186.html

10-05-2021||World||Second-biggest cryptocurrency Ethereum breaks $4,000 to hit record high||Cryptocurrency ethereum broke $4,000 for the first time on Monday, climbing to a new peak for a third day in a row on bets it may find new uses, although some analysts said it was overvalued at current levels.Ethereum, the second-largest coin by market capitalisation, jumped more than 6% to just below $4,175, and was last up around 2%.It has soared this year, fuelled by expectations of wider use, based in part on its role in decentralised finance - "DeFi" - platforms that facilitate crypto-denominated lending outside traditional banking.An upcoming technical change to its software seen as reducing its supply has also provided a boost, while new institutional investors in the crypto sector have warmed to it amid a tepid quarter so far for bitcoin."(Crypto has) got a lot more institutional involvement than people who haven't followed the market believe," said Chris Weston, head of research at brokerage Pepperstone."And everyone's been in ethereum. It's not a meme joke coin, it actually has some application use," he added, referring to its role in DeFi.But some analysts said ethereum's increasing valuation was not underpinned by data of how widely it is used."The continued divergence of its price relative to network activity raise questions about its valuation," J.P. Morgan analysts wrote in a report to clients dated May 7.Factors such as the number of active digital addresses in its network would be more consistent with a price of around $1,000, the U.S. bank said.In the crypto world, the terms "ethereum" and "ether" have become synonymous. Technically, ethereum is the blockchain network in which applications are embedded, while ether is the token or currency that enables or drives the use of these applications.ALTCOINSBitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency, rose to a three-week high above $59,600 on Monday. Dogecoin, a recent outperformer, stabilised after losses on Sunday after comments by Tesla Inc chief Elon Musk on the Saturday Night Live TV show, where he said it was a "hustle".Smaller cryptocurrencies, like Dogecoin, known as "altcoins," have been in demand in the past few weeks, pushing bitcoin's share of the overall $2.5 trillion digital currency market to its lowest in around two years.Dogecoin, which began as a social media joke in 2013, is up more than 700% in the last month.It was last trading at $0.51, after tumbling 38% in the last 24 hours on Musk's comments. It later steadied after Musk's commercial rocket company SpaceX said it would accept the meme-inspired cryptocurrency dogecoin as payment.The meme-based coin has become the fourth-largest digital currency, with a market capitalisation of $69 billion, according to CoinMarketCap. It hit a record high on Thursday above $0.73.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/secondbiggest-cryptocurrency-ethereum-breaks-4-000-to-hit-record-high-101620647295143.html

He hurled vulgarities and racial slurs at her," Kaur said in a widely circulated Instagram post."My mum responded with a 'God bless you' and the guy kicked her in the chest. My mum landed on her back and hurt herself," she said.The man, whose identity is not yet known, ran away while the woman was left shaken and bleeding.Kaur said her mother brisk walks to work as a form of daily exercise, but the incident has left her "afraid of taking a walk in her own country".A report has been lodged and investigations are underway, police said.According to Singapore's health ministry guidelines, all people in the island nation aged six and above are required to wear masks as part of the safety measures against Covid-19 when outside their homes. They may remove their mask while engaging in outdoor or strenuous exercise, including brisk walking or walking up hilly terrain, but must put it back on after exercising.Those walking at a normal pace are required to wear a mask.The attack on Nita came days after a similar incident reportedly took place at Pasir Ris area on May 2, when a man was caught on camera shouting at a family of Indian expatriates and accusing them of spreading Covid-19.The online video shows that the man, believed to be a Singaporean, used derogatory terms against the family of four and asked them to "go back" and said they were "spreading the virus here", the Straits Times newspaper reported.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/singapore-man-kicks-indian-origin-woman-for-not-wearing-mask-during-walk-hurls-racial-slurs-101620643262641.html

The country’s economy is heavily dependent on tourism revenue.The peak climbing season is usually between April and early June before the monsoon sets in.A team of Tibetan mountaineering guides will set up the separation line at the peak before climbers attempt to reach the summit from the Chinese side, official news agency, Xinhua, reported.The report did not make it clear how the separation line will be drawn and defined or what it will be made of.It’s likely that mountaineers climbing the north side of Everest from China will be prohibited from crossing the line or coming into contact with anyone or any objects on the Nepalese, side.A group of 21 Chinese nationals are en route to the summit on the Tibetan side, Xinhua reported.Though imported cases are reported daily, China has curbed the domestic transmission of Covid-19 infection. Nepal, however, has seen a surge in the outbreak with record new infections and deaths in recent days.Most major cities and towns in the Himalayan country between India and China are under lockdown and all domestic and international flights are grounded.In December, China and Nepal jointly announced that the mountain was 8848.86 metres or 29031.69 feet tall.Chinese President Xi Jinping and his Nepalese counterpart Bidya Devi Bhandari jointly announced the new height of the tallest mountain in the world through an exchange of letters.Until then, Nepal had recognised the height of the mountain as 8,848 metres as measured by the Survey of India in 1954.The announcement marked the end of a debate between Beijing and Kathmandu over a “three-metre” height difference the two neighbours had on the mountain’s height.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-to-set-up-covid-19-separation-line-on-mt-everest-101620643758262.html

In January, Washington banned the import of cotton and tomato products from Xinjiang over allegations of forced labour.Beijing denies the accusations and describes the camps as vocational training centres to combat religious extremism.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-foreign-ministry-says-planned-un-event-on-xinjiang-an-insult-101620640156411.html

But amid a push to get as many people inoculated as possible, the government decided to allow doctors' offices to vaccinate any adults with it -- putting aside a priority system under which the oldest and most vulnerable have been vaccinated first.Health Minister Jens Spahn said authorities decided Monday to take the same approach with the Johnson & Johnson vaccine, about which there are similar concerns. He estimated that 5 to 6 million over-60s in Germany still need to be vaccinated and that should be concluded by early June.Spahn said the largest deliveries from Johnson & Johnson, more than 10 million doses, are expected in June or July.Germany has now given nearly one-third of the population at least one vaccine shot.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/germany-clears-j-j-astrazeneca-jabs-for-all-adults-101620641419401.html

Staff sounded alarm after a week||Authorities in eastern China were still hunting for the last of three leopards that escaped from a safari park, officials said Monday, while the park was facing criticism for concealing the breakout for nearly a week.The three leopards from the Hangzhou Safari Park were spotted by villagers as early as May 1, according to the state-owned Global Times newspaper. However, the safari park only reported the missing leopards and alerted the public on Saturday.Two of the leopards have already been captured, and are in good health, officials said. It is unclear how the leopards managed to escape.Efforts to capture the last leopard were ongoing as of Sunday night, according to a statement posted Monday by the Hangzhou local government on its official WeChat account.Those searching for the animal were using equipment such as drones as well as hunting dogs.The leopard was spotted by a drone early Sunday, but fled when people attempted to approach it, according to the Global Times.The delay in announcing the escape sparked criticism that the safari park had put people at risk, especially since the leopards were at large over the five-day Labor Day holidays in China with hordes of tourists visiting the city of Hangzhou. Hangzhou is one of China’s most popular tourist cities, famed for its tea plantations and the scenic West Lake.Authorities are investigating the cause of the leopards’ escape and have questioned the personnel in charge at the safari park.The safari park said it was “sincerely sorry” for not announcing the incident sooner, according to a statement on its Weibo microblogging account Saturday. As the young leopards were believed to be less aggressive, the park said it did not make the announcement to prevent causing panic among the public.The safari park has been temporarily closed while it reviews safety and management issues.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/3-leopards-escaped-a-zoo-in-china-staff-sounded-alarm-after-a-week-101620638835181.html

And once again, South Africa is waging a struggle that puts global solidarity to the test," he said.Ramaphosa said South Africa was one of only five countries on the African continent able to manufacture vaccines and that there was a need for new capacity to be built.South Africa has ordered enough Covid-19 vaccines for 46 million of its 60 million people via bilateral deals with Johnson & Johnson (J&J) and Pfizer. The J&J shots will be made locally by Aspen Pharmacare.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/south-africa-warns-of-vaccine-apartheid-if-rich-countries-hog-covid-19-shots-101620636858380.html

It’s also planning to place high-resolution, night-capable cameras to monitor activities around islands claimed by the Philippines, he said.“Our objective is to drive away Chinese maritime militia and other Chinese vessels from our exclusive economic zone,” Sobejana told CNN Philippines Monday.China can resolve the dispute with the Philippines through their “common consensus to have dialogue and consultation,” Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said at a regular press briefing Monday in Beijing, when asked about the Philippine military’s plan. Certain people are stirring up the issue, she added, without elaborating.Tensions between the Philippines and China in the disputed waters have escalated over the past weeks, with Manila protesting and asking Chinese vessels to leave the area. Still, Duterte has maintained a friendly tone, calling China a “benefactor” as the Philippines sources coronavirus vaccines from Beijing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/philippines-plans-military-hub-in-south-china-sea-sea-cameras-amid-china-row-101620637654174.html

10-05-2021||World||'Vaccine tourists' fly from abroad for injections on US beach||A long line of people snaked across the sand of Miami Beach, Florida, as dozens of travelers from Latin America waited their turn at a pop-up coronavirus vaccination booth.Sweating under the Sunday afternoon sun, visitors checked into an online system -- no proof of residence required -- and soon after received a free, single-dose Johnson & Johnson vaccine and a vaccination card.People had come from all over Latin America -- Ecuador, El Salvador, Venezuela -- where the vaccine rollout has been slow and hampered by supply shortages."In my country, (Covid-19) is getting out of hand and there's not much chance we'll have access to the vaccine soon," Maria Bonilla, who arrived Saturday from Honduras, told AFP.The 40-year-old accountant flew in with her parents, aged 63 and 73. The three of them stood in line, wearing masks. "We had to make the decision to look for a solution outside the country," Bonilla said.Blanca Diaz, 50, who arrived Friday from Mexico, came to the same conclusion: "They are just starting to vaccinate older people," she said of her home country.The rush to find a vaccine has been accompanied by a sharp surge in airfares. Flights from Buenos Aires to Miami, which usually cost around $1,000, have jumped to $2,000 in May.Bonilla is acutely aware of her privilege to be able to travel with her parents to get vaccinated. "It's unfortunate. It already creates this division that some of us have access to health and others do not," she said.Miami Beach city commissioner David Richardson, a Democrat, who oversaw the facility, told AFP he has mixed feelings about the vaccine tourists."I think we, the United States government, should help as many people as possible," he said."My only concern is that it seems that the people who can afford to buy an airfare can come to the United States and get a vaccine now."And what about the poor people in South America?" Richardson asked, urging the US government to send vaccines overseas "so that everybody can have access to the vaccine, not just the people who can afford to come here."- Easing requirements -On Sunday, the pop-up vaccination booth inoculated 175 people with the Johnson & Johnson shot, the brand favored by tourists because it requires only one dose.This is the second weekend that the booth has been set up on the beach, and it will be back for the next few weekends.Richardson said he was authorized Sunday morning to provide vaccines to anyone over age 18.In theory, Florida vaccinates state residents or people who indicate -- verbally -- that they offer a service in-state. As of 10 days ago, it is no longer necessary to provide documented proof of residence.This easing of requirements was implemented to encourage undocumented residents to get vaccinated -- but it also has encouraged vaccine tourists.Since January, wealthy Latin Americans have been creatively circumventing the now-eliminated residency requirement.They would show bank statements for accounts with a US address, or temporary rental contracts -- even with Airbnb -- could be immediately canceled once they had been vaccinated.More than nine million people -- out of a total of 21.5 million residents -- have had at least one dose of the vaccine in Florida, according to the US health department."At this point, the people that haven't been vaccinated is certainly not because a lack of supply or a lack of availability," Florida Governor Ron DeSantis said last week.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/vaccine-tourists-fly-from-abroad-for-injections-on-us-beach-101620636361146.html
10-05-2021||World||Yuan jumps to 3-year high as China’s economy outpaces peers||The onshore yuan advanced to its strongest level since 2018 as it defied attempts by the central bank to slow its gains amid an improving outlook for China’s economy.The currency rose as much as 0.3% to 6.4114 a dollar, the strongest since June 2018, after breaching its previous year-to-date high of 6.4245 reached in January. The move follows a slump in the greenback on Friday after U.S. jobs data missed economists’ estimates.The yuan’s ascent comes even after the central bank tried to cap its gains by setting the daily fix at a weaker-than-expected level on Monday. China’s currency has climbed 1.8% this year to outperform all its Asian peers, and a rapid appreciation threatens to erode the competitiveness of the nation’s exports.“The yuan will continue to strengthen, as apart from a weaker dollar, the Chinese currency is also being supported by capital inflows and large trade surplus,” said Tommy Ong, managing director for treasury and markets at DBS Hong Kong Ltd. “The PBOC will likely use the fixing to slow the gains but it won’t use direct intervention.”The yuan’s rise mirrors the Chinese economy’s gains, where surging exports and retail sales are in stark contrast to the uneven recovery seen in the U.S. and the euro zone. Gross domestic product climbed 18.3% in the first quarter from a year earlier, powered by a jump in consumer spending.Apart from the dollar, the yuan also strengthened against a basket of its trading partners’ currencies. The CFETS RMB Index, which tracks the yuan versus 24 peers, is close to the highest level since 2018.Chinese banks, including joint-stock and state lenders, boosted purchases of the dollar after the yuan advanced rapidly on Monday afternoon, traders said. The transactions helped to stabilize the exchange rate, according to the traders, who asked not to be named as they aren’t authorized to comment on the market publicly.“While the broad dollar declines are certainly supportive of Asian currencies, the yuan has become even more attractive because of its strong data and effective Covid-19 containment measures,” said Fiona Lim, senior currency analyst at Malayan Banking Berhad in Singapore. The onshore yuan will advance to 6.36 in the coming 12 months, she added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/yuan-jumps-to-3-year-high-as-china-s-economy-outpaces-peers-101620636913875.html
10-05-2021||World||Gates marriage 'irretrievably broken' since 2019 over Epstein link: Report||Melinda French Gates began working with divorce lawyers well over a year before her split with Bill Gates was announced last week, partly over concerns about her husband’s dealings with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, according to the Wall Street Journal.The 56-year-old spoke with attorneys from several firms as early as October 2019, saying the marriage was “irretrievably broken,” the Journal reported Sunday, citing documents and people familiar with the matter. Her unease about her ex-husband’s ties to Epstein dates back to at least 2013, the paper said.The New York Times reported in October 2019 that the billionaire had met with Epstein several times, and once stayed late at his New York townhouse. A spokeswoman for Microsoft Corp. co-founder said at the time that the meetings had centered on philanthropy. Epstein had died in jail two months prior while awaiting trial on federal charges related to sex trafficking.The divorce was negotiated during the pandemic, involving legal teams working with a mediator to divide their fortune, which the Bloomberg Billionaires Index pegs at $145 billion.The couple said that they plan on remaining co-chairs and trustees of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. Billionaire Warren Buffett serves as the foundation’s third trustee. All three have vowed to give away the vast majority of their wealth.In the days after the split was announced, a holding company that Bill Gates created transferred equity stakes in four different companies, worth more than $2 billion in aggregate, to Melinda French Gates, Bloomberg News has reported. The bulk of it is from about 14.1 million shares in Canadian National Railway Co.Days before he died in a New York jail, Epstein named a little-known biotech venture capitalist named Boris Nikolic as backup executor of his will. Nikolic had worked as a science adviser to Bill Gates and more recently funded more than a dozen firms in gene editing and other health technologies.In an emailed statement at the time, Nikolic told Bloomberg that Epstein had not consulted him about the will and that he had no intention to fulfill the duties.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/gates-marriage-irretrievably-broken-since-2019-over-epstein-link-report-101620636367092.html
10-05-2021||World||South Korean police summon activist over anti- North Korean propaganda leaflets||South Korean police on Monday summoned an activist who said he flew hundreds of thousands of anti-North Korean propaganda leaflets toward the North by balloon in defiance of a new law that criminalizes such activities.The questioning of Park Sang-hak, a well-known North Korean defector, came hours after President Moon Jae-in in a televised speech issued apparent criticism of Park without naming him, saying it’s “never desirable” to dampen relations with North Korea by violating inter-Korean agreements and South Korean laws.South Korea has faced criticism over the anti-leafleting law, which some human rights advocates see as an attack on democratic freedoms and efforts to break the North’s information blockage. Moon stressed, however, that his government has “no choice but to strictly enforce laws.”Police searched Park’s office last week after he announced that his group had launched balloons carrying 500,000 leaflets, 5,000 one-dollar bills and 500 booklets about South Korea’s economic riches across the border during April 25-29.Park’s action would be the first known violation of the law, which took effect in March and punishes anti-North Korean leafletting with up to three years in prison or a fine of 30 million won ($27,000).Officials at the Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency refused to confirm any details from the questioning or whether they were pushing for Park’s arrest.Park said his actions were aimed at informing North Koreans of the harsh realities of their country's authoritarian regime and claimed other activists would continue to launch leaflets across the border even if he goes to jail.“What do they even think (anti-North Korean) leaflets are? Do they have poisonous pills inside? Do they have bombs inside?” a visibly frustrated Park told reporters after arriving at the police agency.He said in North Korea “we were taught that South Korea was a colony of US imperialists and hell on Earth. What we are doing is writing letters (to the North) while living here, telling the truth through the leaflets.”North Korea is extremely sensitive to outside criticism about its leadership, and Park’s announcement drew vitriol from Kim Yo Jong, the powerful sister of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un who handles inter-Korean affairs. She said in a statement released through state media that the leafletting was an “intolerable provocation” and that her government would look into corresponding measures.In 2014, North Korean soldiers at the border fired toward balloons flying toward their territory, prompting South Korean troops to return fire.Seoul’s anti-leafletting law was fiercely debated during a video conference hearing called by US lawmakers last month, where US Rep. Chris Smith of New Jersey accused Seoul of retreating from its “longstanding commitment to human rights vis-à-vis North Korea and China, ostensibly in the cause of fostering better relations or achieving nuclear nonproliferation.”South Korean lawyer Jeon Sumi, who was among the panelists defending the law, criticized the leaflets’ “hyper aggressive” language toward North Korea’s leadership and insisted that flying them unnecessarily provokes the North and endangers the safety of South Koreans living in border areas.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/south-korean-police-summon-activist-over-anti-north-korean-propaganda-leaflets-101620636370954.html

10-05-2021||World||Pakistan to introduce 'new' rules to meet FATF demands: Report||Pakistan, keen to exit from the grey list of the FATF, is set to introduce new rules relating to anti-money laundering cases and change the prosecution process to meet its remaining tough conditions, a media report said on Monday.Pakistan was put on the grey list by the Paris-based Financial Action Task Force (FATF), the global watchdog for money laundering and terror financing in June 2018 and the country has been struggling to come out of it.The Dawn newspaper reported that the changes being made also include the transfer of investigations and prosecution of anti-money laundering (AML) cases from police, provincial anti-corruption establishments (ACEs) and other similar agencies to specialised agencies.This is part of two sets of rules including the AML (Forfeited Properties Management) Rules 2021 and the AML (Referral) Rules 2021 under the National Policy Statement on Follow the Money approved by the federal Cabinet meeting a few days ago, the report said.These rules and related notifications for certain changes in the existing schedule of Anti-Money Laundering Act 2010 (AMLA) would come into force immediately to be followed by the appointment of administrators and special public prosecutors for implementation.Based on these measures, the FATF would conclude if Pakistan has complied with three outstanding benchmarks, out of 27, that blocked its exit from the grey list in February this year.Several review meetings of the FATF are scheduled to begin in the second week of June, culminating in the next FATF plenary on June 21-25.The three outstanding action points (out of a total of 27) include (i) demonstrating that terrorist financing (TF) investigations and prosecutions target persons and entities acting on behalf or at the directive of the designated persons or entities.Demonstrating that TF prosecutions result in effective, proportionate, and dissuasive sanctions; and (iii) demonstrating effective implementation of targeted financial sanctions against all designated terrorists, particularly those acting for them or on their behalf.Now, the government has decided to appoint dozens of administrators with the powers to confiscate, receive, manage, rent out, auction, transfer or dispose of or take all other measures to preserve the value of the properties and perishable or non-perishable assets to be confiscated under the AML 2010 rules or court orders.The AML (Forfeited Properties Management) Rules 2021 specify how the inventories would be measured, described or defined, protected, and evaluated for auction and how to complete all processes, the report said.The Anti-Money Laundering (Referral) Rules, 2021 are being introduced to enable transfer of the cases from one set of investigation agencies to another.The Cabinet was explained that based on the outcomes of the mutual evaluation, Pakistan was placed by Asia Pacific Group (APG) in the (Expedited) Enhanced Follow Up process which requires the country to submit its follow up report almost every quarter to the APG to provide it with an update on the progress made.These follow up reports (FURs) provide Pakistan a chance to request an upgrade in ratings of recommendations which have been earlier rated as ‘partially compliant’ and ‘non-compliant’ and where subsequently significant progress has since been made.So far, Pakistan has submitted three FURs in February and October 2020 and February 2021. Of these FURs, only one report had been adopted by the APG in which Pakistan was re-rated in Recommendation No 29 (Financial Intelligence Unit) from ‘partially compliant’ to ‘compliant’.In the remaining two FURs, Pakistan had requested for re-rating in 27 recommendations, analysis of which is being conducted by the APG and the same will be adopted within this month.Pakistan also has to issue a “National Policy Statement on Follow the Money (NPSFM)”, the report said.Because of this statement and rules, Pakistan’s compliance with FATF recommendations in Post Observation Period Report (POPR) would further improve with corresponding enhancement in the ratings or effectiveness of the FATF’s relevant Immediate Outcomes, it said.Pakistan’s POPR would be reviewed by the FATF’s Asia-Pacific Joint Group (A-PJG), and based on the report of this group, the FATF would decide further course of action on Pakistan’s progress on the POPR in its plenary scheduled during June 21-25, it added.

These bottles often get buried in avalanches or are abandoned on the mountain slopes at the end of the expedition."We appeal to climbers and sherpas to bring back their empty bottles wherever possible as they can be refilled and used for the treatment of the coronavirus patients who are in dire needs," Gurung told Reuters.On Sunday, Nepal reported a daily increase of 8,777 infections, 30 times the number recorded on April 9. The total caseload stands at 394,667 and 3,720 deaths, according to government data.Many private and community hospitals in Kathmandu have said they are unable to take any more patients due to lack of oxygen. There was a shortage of both the gas and canisters."We need about 25,000 oxygen cylinders immediately to save people from dying. This is our urgent need," Samir Kumar Adhikari, a health ministry official said."We also need oxygen plants, compressors and ICU beds urgently," Adhikari said. Nepal has asked China to send 20,000 cylinders, some of which will be airlifted to meet urgent needs, another official said.China has pledged to provide oxygen cylinders, ventilators and other medical supplies, Health and Population Minister Hridayesh Tripathi said.Nepal has only 1,600 intensive care beds and fewer than 600 ventilators for its population of 30 million with just 0.7 doctors per 100,000 people, according to ActionAid Nepal.Prakash Thapa, a doctor at the Bheri hospital in Nepalgunj, in southwest Nepal bordering India, said patients were sleeping on the floor and corridors."We are somehow managing so far but it will be difficult to take any more patients,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nepal-urges-everest-climbers-to-bring-back-empty-oxygen-tanks-for-covid-19-patients-101620633165587.html

10-05-2021||World||Premiers of Canadian provinces, leaders to raise Covid-19 funds for India||Premiers of Canadian provinces, mayors of cities and other leaders from across the country will join over 80 Indo-Canadian organisations for a major “oxygen” fundraiser next Sunday for procuring and sending critical equipment required in India to combat the raging Covid-19 crisis there.The virtual fund-raiser will be held on May 16 and among those who have confirmed their participation are the premiers of the provinces of Ontario and Saskatchewan, Doug Ford and Scott Moe, respectively. Also on board are the mayors of Brampton and Mississauga, Patrick Brown and Bonnie Crombie. The event is being coordinated by the Indo-Canadian Chamber of Commerce or ICCC, and it has partnered with 82 other community organisation for the Marathon - Oxygen for India fund-raiser, which is scheduled to go on for four-and-a-half hours.Vijay Thomas, president of ICCC, said that their target is to raise $ 2 million Canadian dollars at least, to purchase oxygen concentrators and generators to be dispatched to India.Thomas said that Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and several federal cabinet ministers have also been invited to participate in the fundraiser, though their confirmations are still awaited. “We have also invited every premier from coast-to-coast and hope to get 50 Canadian leaders to join us,” he said.The objective is to “raise awareness among Canadians at large about the situation on India and that Canada stands by India just as India stood by Canada when it needed vaccines”, he said.With its partner organisations, ICCC has already bought 2,000 oxygen concentrators so far, of which 200 have already reached India, and 1,500 are in transit, while the remainder are being processed.“We are looking at oxygen generators for small and mid-size hospitals to power beds and have them reach as quickly as possible since time is of essence,” Thomas said.To fashion “as wide an alliance as possible” for this purpose, ICCC is working with Indian associations across cities like Montreal and Vancouver, and community groups dedicated to regions or states like those for Haryana, Rajasthan and Goa, among others.While the Indo-Canadian community makes these efforts, the Canadian government has sent 25,000 vials of the anti-viral remdesivir as well as 50 ventilators to India, with another 300 ventilators likely to leave Canada soon. In addition, the federal government has provided $10 million Canadian dollars to the Canadian Red Cross, which is working with the Indian Red Cross Society.Provincial governments have also stepped in to help. Ontario shipped off 3,000 ventilators on Friday, as the province’s premier Doug Ford tweeted, “I am very proud to help our friends in need.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/premiers-of-canadian-provinces-leaders-to-raise-covid-19-funds-for-india-101620624197437.html

10-05-2021||World||Gangster executed outside Vancouver airport||An Indo-Canadian gangster was executed by suspected rivals outside the main terminal of the Vancouver International Airport or YVR on Sunday afternoon, with the suspects firing upon pursuing police while fleeing.While the victim has not been formally named by investigators, the Vancouver Sun identified him as Karman Singh Grewal, 28, who had a long history of being associated with gangs in the region. At a press conference at the airport late on Sunday, Sgt Frank Jang, spokesperson for the Integrated Homicide Investigation Team, said the execution-style killing was “linked to ongoing gang conflict” that has marked the region in recent times.The Vancouver Sun also reported Grewal was “very close” to gangster Jimi Sandhu, who was deported to India in 2016.The shooting occurred at around 3pm on Sunday afternoon outside the main terminal of the airport, from where flights depart for national and international destinations. The airport remained open with “restricted access.” Chief superintendent Will Ng of the Richmond Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) told reporters that the murder was “targeted and carried out in broad daylight” and that “this generation of gangsters is taking things to another level”.Trains to the Sea Island in Richmond, a suburb of Vancouver, where the airport is located, were temporarily halted as was traffic from a tunnel and bridges leading to it.The Richmond detachment of RCMP tweeted that officers intercepted the getaway vehicle and were shot at by the suspects. While the officers were not hurt, the suspects escaped. What is believed to be their vehicle was found torched in the nearby township of Surrey.In a statement released on Sunday evening, the airport authorities said, “RCMP responded to a police incident at Vancouver International Airport outside the main terminal today. It has since been contained. Our thoughts are with those impacted by today’s incident. The airport is open and safe for airport workers and those who need to travel.”Gangland activity has been on the rise in the area in recent weeks. Four confirmed killings have been reported there over the past three weeks. These gangs have a strong Indo-Canadian presence as well, as one significant figure among them, Harb Dhaliwal, was gunned down outside a restaurant in Vancouver on the evening of April 17.CBC News described the airport incident as the “the most brazen shooting yet in Metro Vancouver’s latest spurt of gun violence”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/gangster-executed-outside-vancouver-airport-101620622877298.html

Two supermarket staff members were among those injured.Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said the motivation for the attack had not been established but police didn't have any evidence to suggest it was domestic terrorism.“Needless to say that such an attack is hugely concerning, and I do want to acknowledge the really early reports of courageous acts by bystanders who have taken action in order to protect those around them,” Ardern said. “Our thoughts are with all those affected by this attack.”Ardern said five people had been taken to Dunedin Hospital with stab wounds or related injuries. Their conditions were not immediately available.People in the store at the time told local media that it was a chaotic scene as people began screaming and running toward the exits. They said some brave shoppers had tried to stop the man and pin him down.“We are shocked and devastated by the events in our Dunedin Central Store this afternoon,” Countdown said in a statement. “Our priority right now is our injured team members and caring for our wider team in the wake of this extremely traumatic event. We are deeply upset that customers who tried to help our team members were also injured.”Police said they would be releasing more details on the incident later on Monday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/5-injured-in-stabbing-attack-at-new-zealand-supermarket-suspect-arrested-101620621539777.html
10-05-2021||World||Myanmar poet dies in detention, body returned with organs missing||Myanmar poet Khet Thi, whose works declare resistance to the ruling junta, died in detention overnight and his body was returned with the organs removed, his family said on Sunday.A spokesman for the junta did not answer calls to request comment on the death of Khet Thi, who had penned the line "They shoot in the head, but they don't know the revolution is in the heart." His Facebook page said he was 45.Khet Thi's wife said both of them were taken for interrogation on Saturday by armed soldiers and police in the central town of Shwebo, in the Sagaing region - a centre of resistance to the coup in which elected leader Aung San Suu Kyi was ousted."I was interrogated. So was he. They said he was at the interrogation centre. But he didn't come back, only his body," his wife Chaw Su told BBC Burmese language news in tears from Monywa, around 100 km (60 miles) away by road."They called me in the morning and told me to meet him at the hospital in Monywa. I thought it was just for a broken arm or something ... But when I arrived here, he was at the morgue and his internal organs were taken out," she said.She had been told at the hospital he had a heart problem, but had not bothered to read the death certificate because she was sure it would not be true, Chaw Su said. Reuters was unable to reach the hospital for comment.Chaw Su said the army had planned to bury him but that she pleaded with them for the body. She did not say how she knew her husband's organs had been removed."He died at the hospital after being tortured in the interrogation centre," the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners activist group said in a bulletin that put the toll of civilians killed since the coup at 780.The group, which monitors details of killings, did not identify the source of its information.OTHER POETS DIEDKhet Thi was at least the third poet to die during protests since the Feb. 1 coup.Khet Thi had been a friend of K Za Win, 39, a poet who was shot dead during a protest in Monywa in early March.Cultural figures and celebrities have been prominent supporters of opposition to the coup with protests daily in different parts of the Southeast Asian country in spite of the killings and thousands of arrests.Khet Thi had been an engineer before quitting his job in 2012 to focus on his poetry and to support himself by making and selling ice cream and cakes."I don't want to be a hero, I don't want to be a martyr, I don't want to be a weakling, I don't want to be a fool," he wrote two weeks after the coup. "I don't want to support injustice. If I have only a minute to live, I want my conscience to be clean for that minute."More recently, he wrote that he was a guitar player, a cake baker and a poet - not someone who could fire a gun. But he implied his attitude was changing."My people are being shot and I can only throw back poems," he wrote. "But when you are sure your voice is not enough, then you need to choose a gun carefully. I will shoot."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/myanmar-poet-dies-in-detention-body-returned-with-organs-missing-101620616708672.html

10-05-2021||World||US government working to aid top fuel pipeline operator after cyberattack||The White House was working closely with top US fuel pipeline operator Colonial Pipeline on Sunday to help it recover from a ransomware attack that forced the company to shut a critical fuel network supplying populous eastern states.The attack is one of the most disruptive digital ransom schemes reported and has prompted calls from American lawmakers to strengthen protections for critical US energy infrastructure from hacking attacks.Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo said the pipeline fix was a top priority for the Biden administration and Washington was working to avoid more severe fuel supply disruptions by helping Colonial restart as quickly as possible its more than 5,500-mile (8,850 km) pipeline network from Texas to New Jersey."It's an all hands on deck effort right now," Raimondo said on CBS' "Face the Nation" program. "We are working closely with the company, state and local officials, to make sure that they get back up to normal operations as quickly as possible and there aren't disruptions in supply."Colonial said on Sunday its main fuel lines remain offline but some smaller lines between terminals and delivery points are now operational. Neither Raimondo nor the company gave an estimate for a full restart date and Colonial declined further comment on Sunday.US gasoline futures jumped more than 3% to $2.217 a gallon, the highest since May 2018, as trading opened for the week and market participants reacted to the closure.Colonial transports roughly 2.5 million barrels per day of gasoline and other fuels from refiners on the Gulf Coast to consumers in the mid-Atlantic and southeastern United States.Its extensive pipeline network serves major US airports, including Atlanta's Hartsfield Jackson Airport, the world's busiest by passenger traffic.A Charlotte Douglas International Airport spokesperson said the airport had supply on-hand and was "monitoring the situation closely," adding that the complex is supplied by another major pipeline as well as Colonial.Retail fuel experts including the American Automobile Association said an outage lasting several days could have significant impacts on regional fuel supplies, particularly in the southeastern United States.During previous Colonial outages, retail prices in southeastern states have risen substantially.Offices of governors in several of the US states most vulnerable to fuel shortages - including Tennessee, Georgia and Maryland - were not immediately available for comment.CYBERCRIMINALS SUSPECTEDWhile the US government investigation is in the early stages, a former US official and three industry sources said the hackers are suspected to be a professional cybercriminal group called DarkSide.DarkSide is one of many ransomware gangs extorting victims while avoiding targets in post-Soviet states. The groups gain access to private networks, encrypt files using software, and often also steal data.They demand payment to decrypt the files and increasingly ask for additional money not to publish stolen content.In the Colonial attack, the hackers took more than 100 gigabytes of data, according to a person familiar with the incident.As the FBI and other government agencies worked with private companies to respond, the cloud computing system the hackers used to collect the stolen data was taken offline Saturday, the person said.Colonial's data did not appear to have been transferred from that system anywhere else, potentially limiting the hackers' leverage to extort or further embarrass the company.Cybersecurity firm FireEye is among those dealing with the attack, industry sources said. FireEye declined to comment. Colonial said it was working with a "leading, third-party cybersecurity firm," but did not name the firm.Messages left with the DarkSide hackers were not immediately returned. The group's dark website, where hackers regularly post data about victims, made no reference to Colonial Pipeline.Colonial declined to comment on whether DarkSide hackers were involved in the attack, when the breach occurred or what ransom they demanded.BIDEN BRIEFED ON HACKPresident Joe Biden was briefed on the cyberattack on Saturday morning, the White House said, adding that the government was working to try to help the company restore operations and prevent supply disruptions.US Senator Bill Cassidy, a Republican from Louisiana who sits on the Energy Committee, said lawmakers are prepared to work more with privately held critical infrastructure companies to guard against cyberattacks."The implication for this, for our national security, cannot be overstated. And I promise you, this is something that Republicans and Democrats can work together on," he said on NBC's "Meet the Press."Another fuel pipeline serving the same regions carries a third of what Colonial does. Any prolonged outage would require tankers to transport fuels from the US Gulf Coast to East Coast ports.The Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration is issuing a temporary hours of service exemption to truckers transporting refined products to 17 southern and east coast states including Alabama, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, New Jersey and New York.Complicating the fallback plans, according to one industry source familiar with the federal response, was that the ranks of fuel-truck drivers for the main road transportation companies, which could pick up some of the pipeline volume, are down by 25% or more because of coronavirus infections.Oil refining companies contacted by Reuters over the weekend said their operations had not yet been impacted. Some were working to find alternative transport for customers.The privately held, Georgia-based company is owned by CDPQ Colonial Partners L.P., IFM (US) Colonial Pipeline 2 LLC, KKR-Keats Pipeline Investors L.P., Koch Capital Investments Company LLC and Shell Midstream Operating LLC.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-government-working-to-aid-top-fuel-pipeline-operator-after-cyberattack-101620609901944.html
10-05-2021||World||Former doctor at Russian hospital that treated opposition leader Navalny goes 'missing'||The former chief physician of the Siberian hospital, where Russian opposition leader Alexey Navalny was treated immediately after he was poisoned with a nerve agent last year, has gone missing.Local police in Omsk told TASS that Alexander Murakhovsky, Health Minister of the region, was reported missing on Saturday after leaving a hunting base in a forest on an all-terrain vehicle on Friday and has not been seen since, CNN reported.In a statement, the regional Interior Ministry of Omsk said police officers were searching for a man who had gone missing in the Bolsheukovsky district, without naming the physician."On May 8, 2021, the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Russia for the Omsk Region received a message that in the village of Pospelovo, Bolsheukovsky District, a resident of Omsk, born in 1971, left the hunting base on an ATV going to the forest. For about a day, the acquaintances of the disappeared made independent attempts to find the man, after which they reported the incident to the police," the statement said.The Ministry said that search operations underway were complicated by the difficult terrain and the presence of wetlands.Murakhovsky was promoted to the position of Health Minister of the Omsk region after his handling of Navalny's hospitalisation last year, CNN reported citing TASS.He was the chief doctor at Omsk emergency hospital number 1 when Navalny was admitted to the acute poisoning unit of the hospital on August 20, 2020, after falling ill on a plane heading from Siberia to Moscow.Murakhovsky had then told the media that the main working diagnosis for the Kremlin critic was "a metabolic disorder which caused a sharp drop in blood sugar", CNN reported.Navalny had ridiculed the promotion of Murakhovsky to Omsk regional health minister, saying: "You lie, fake test results, are ready to please the bosses in any way - you get an award and a promotion."In February this year, a senior doctor of the hospital, Sergey Maximishin, suddenly died at the age of 55. Rustam Agishev - another top doctor who worked at the hospital, also died in March, although it is not clear if Agishev had anything to do with Navalny's treatment.Russian President Vladimir Putin has denied any role in Navalny's poisoning, and prison officials say they are providing adequate care.The Kremlin critic went on hunger strike on March 31 while in prison to demand medical care, but ended it last week when he was finally given medical attention.Russia has brought several cases against Navalny, which he and his supporters say are trumped up.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/former-doctor-at-russian-hospital-that-treated-opposition-leader-navalny-goes-missing-101620607710052.html
10-05-2021||World||Taliban declare three-day Afghan ceasefire for Eid holiday||The Taliban on Monday declared a three-day ceasefire across Afghanistan to mark this week's Eid al-Fitr holiday, just two days after being blamed for killing more than 50 people -- mostly young girls -- in a bomb attack outside a school in the capital.The ceasefire offer comes as the United States continues to pull out its last 2,500 troops from the violence-wracked country despite faltering peace efforts between the Taliban and Afghan government to end a decades-long war."Mujahideen of the Islamic Emirate are instructed to halt all offensive operations against the enemy countrywide from the first till the third day of Eid," a statement released by the Taliban said."But if the enemy conducts any assault or attack against you during these days, stand ready to robustly protect and defend yourselves and your territory," it added.Eid al-Fitr marks the end of the Muslim fasting month of Ramadan, and the holiday begins according to the sighting of the new moon. The Taliban declared similar ceasefires last year to mark Islamic holidays.The government usually reciprocates with a truce. Fraidon Khawzon, spokesman for chief negotiator Abdullah Abdullah, said early Monday: "We welcome the announcement....the Islamic republic is also ready and will announce soon."'Bodies piled on top of each other' The latest offer comes after the government blamed the Taliban for Saturday's attack outside a girls' school in Dasht-e-Barchi, a suburb of the capital largely populated by the Shiite Hazara community, which is often targeted by extremist Sunni Islamist militants.A series of blasts outside the school -- when residents were shopping ahead of the holiday -- killed more than 50 people and wounded over 100.It was the deadliest attack in more than a year.The Taliban, who denied responsibility, had earlier issued a statement saying the nation needed to "safeguard and look after educational centres and institutions".On Sunday, relatives buried the dead at a hilltop site known as "Martyrs Cemetery", where victims of attacks against the Hazara community are laid to rest.Hazaras are Shiite Muslims and considered heretics by extremist Sunnis. Sunni Muslims make up the majority of the Afghan population.Bodies in wooden coffins were lowered into graves one by one by mourners still in a state of shock and fear, an AFP photographer said."I rushed to the scene (after the blasts) and found myself in the middle of bodies, their hands and heads cut off and bones smashed," said Mohammad Taqi, a resident of Dasht-e-Barchi, whose two daughters were students at the school but escaped the attack."All of them were girls. Their bodies piled on top of each other."Books and school bags belonging to the victims still lay scattered at the site of the attack.The Taliban insist they have not carried out attacks in Kabul since February last year, when they signed a deal with Washington that paved the way for peace talks and withdrawal of the remaining US troops.But the group has clashed daily with Afghan forces in the rugged countryside even as the US military reduces its presence.Taliban chief warns USThe United States was supposed to have pulled all forces out by May 1 as agreed with the Taliban last year, but Washington pushed back the date to September 11 -- a move that angered the insurgents.The leader of the Taliban, Hibatullah Akhundzada, reiterated in a message released ahead of Eid that any delay in withdrawing the troops was a "violation" of that deal."If America again fails to live up to its commitments, then the world must bear witness and hold America accountable for all the consequences," Akhundzada warned in Sunday's message.Afghan President Ashraf Ghani has declared a day of national mourning for Tuesday."This savage group does not have the power to confront security forces on the battlefield, and instead targets with brutality and barbarism public facilities and the girls' school," he said in a statement.Saturday's blasts drew widespread global condemnation.Pope Francis called it "an inhumane action", while Iran blamed the jihadist Islamic State.India, meanwhile, called for the dismantling of "terrorist sanctuaries" and a ceasefire to boost peace efforts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taliban-declare-three-day-afghan-ceasefire-for-eid-holiday-101620605241663.html

There is no better person to build momentum for further change as we approach the COP26 climate summit in November,” said Prime Minister Boris Johnson.Johnson, who is keen to burnish his environmental credentials, has said he will push leaders at the G7 summit he will chair to make firm climate commitments.Attenborough said COP26 had to succeed.“There could not be a more important moment that we should have international agreement. The epidemic has shown us how crucial it is to find agreement among nations if we are to solve such worldwide problems," he said.In February, Attenborough told the U.N. Security Council that climate change is the biggest security threat that modern humans have ever faced.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/britain-names-sir-david-attenborough-as-people-s-advocate-ahead-of-key-climate-summit-101620606391947.html

Israeli police said 17 of its officers were wounded.The previous night more than 220 people, again mostly Palestinians, were hurt as police stormed Al-Aqsa, saying Palestinians had thrown rocks and fireworks at officers.Four Arab countries that normalised ties with Israel over the past year - the UAE, Bahrain, Morocco and Sudan - all condemned Israel’s actions and voiced support for the Palestinians.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/weekend-of-clashes-in-jerusalem-s-old-city-bibi-vows-to-impose-order-after-chaos-101620606399527.html

A small group of adults stood nearby, some of them audibly sobbing, along with a small child.Freddie Marquez, 33, said his mother-in-law was one of the victims and that he was at the party but left around 10:30 p.m. on Saturday.Some time after midnight, he received a call from the son of one of the women at the party, who was crying on the phone."Somebody came in and shot everybody," Marquez said, relating what he had been told on the phone.SPATE OF MASS SHOOTINGSThe massacre was the latest in a resurgence of mass shootings in the United States after such occurrences seemed to recede during the height of coronavirus pandemic restrictions.Among the incidents this year was one in Boulder, Colorado, where a 21-year-old man has been charged with killing 10 people in a March 22 shooting spree at a supermarket about 30 miles (50 km) northwest of Denver. That came less than a week after another 21-year-old gunman was accused of killing eight people at three Atlanta-area day spas.Colorado was also the state where two other deadly rampages took place, both in the Denver area: the 1999 shooting at Columbine High School that killed 15 people including the two perpetrators, and the 2012 shooting in an Aurora movie theater that killed 12 people and wounded about 70. The Aurora shooter is serving a life sentence.The recent shootings have revived the gun control debate, with Democratic President Joe Biden calling them a "national embarrassment" and calling for new legislation from Congress.But he faces serious opposition from gun rights advocates including Republicans and some Democrats who cite the U.S. Constitution's protection of gun ownership rights.Colorado Springs Police Chief Vince Niski said that "my heart breaks for the families" in Sunday's attack and promised to support them."My vow to this community and to the families who have lost someone today, is that this department will do everything we can to find you the answers you deserve and be here for you with an unwavering support," Niski said in the police statement.Police said they withheld releasing details of the shooting for several hours "in order to properly and respectfully notify family members of the deceased and ensure support was in place."The names of the victims will be released later, the statement said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/7-killed-at-colorado-birthday-party-shooting-children-survive-101620605230762.html

10-05-2021||World||Colonial Pipeline hack: What we know so far||Ransom-seeking hackers have broken into Colonial Pipeline, prompting the company to shut one of America's major arteries for fuel delivery.Here is a look at what we know, and what we don't, about one of the most disruptive digital shakedown efforts to hit a US company.Who is involved ? Alpharetta, Georgia-based Colonial Pipeline and the US government have both blamed ransomware for the massive outage, pointing the finger at cybercriminal gangs who routinely hold data and computer networks hostage in exchange for digital currency payments.There is no official word on which group is believed to have carried out the intrusion - and attributing malicious activity online can be extremely difficult - but a former US official and three industry sources told Reuters a group dubbed "DarkSide" was among the suspects. If so, that would lay the responsibility on a new but professional group of criminals believed to be operating out of the former Soviet republics.Cybersecurity FireEye is involved with the incident response, according to three industry sources.How bad is it ?Ransomware can deal catastrophic damage to an organization's network by locking away critical data or even wrecking computers beyond repair. But the effect on the actual nuts and bolts of energy companies' operations varies.A destructive cyberattack on Saudi Aramco in 2012 crippled the oil giant's computer network but left production more-or-less unscathed. By contrast, a more recent ransomware incident at Norsk Hydro temporarily pushed the aluminum maker to switch away from automated production at its smelters.Experts say the severity of the Colonial case will depend on whether the ransomware made its way into the company's operational technology network, which interfaces with the pipeline itself. Earlier this year, US government officials announced that an intrusion at an unnamed natural gas compression plant that spilled over into its operational technology network forced a two-day shut down of its entire pipeline.Colonial has not given any public indication as to the reach of the ransomware outbreak, but Robert M. Lee, chief executive of cybersecurity firm Dragos, said he believed Colonial's operations network was shut down proactively "to make sure that nothing spread into those systems."He said that will hopefully translate to "a temporary outage versus something that would be more sustained."What happens next ?US government officials are working with Colonial to help it recover while scrambling to avoid more severe fuel supply disruptions should the outage continue.Colonial's pipeline network serves major US airports, including Atlanta's Hartsfield Jackson Airport, the world's busiest by passenger traffic, and experts say regional fuel supplies could be impacted if the pipeline stays shut."A one-to-two-day outage is really a minor inconvenience," said Andrew Lipow, president of Lipow Oil Associates. But by day four or five, he said, "we could see a much greater widespread impact through large areas throughout the mid-Atlantic and the southeast."Whether the pipeline stays shut that long in turn depends on how deeply the hackers penetrated Colonial's network - and how soon cybersecurity experts can pull them out.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/colonial-pipeline-hack-what-we-know-so-far-101620597705085.html

10-05-2021||World||Variant deepening India’s crisis, says top WHO scientist||Covid-19 variant spreading in India is more contagious and may be dodging vaccine protections, contributing to the country’s explosive outbreak, the World Health Organization’s (WHO) chief scientist has said.In an interview with AFP, Soumya Swaminathan warned that “the epidemiological features that we see in India today do indicate that it’s an extremely rapidly spreading variant”.Swaminathan said the B.1.617 variant of Covid-19, which was first detected in India last October, was a contributing factor to the catastrophe unfolding in India. “There have been many accelerators that are fed into this,” the 62-year-old said, stressing that “a more rapidly spreading virus is one of them”.The WHO recently listed B.1.617 as a “variant of interest”. But so far, it has stopped short of adding it to its list of “variant of concern (VOC)”.Some national health authorities, including in the US and Britain, said they consider B.1.617 a VOC, and Swaminathan said she expected the WHO to soon follow suit. “B 1.617 is likely to be a variant of concern because it has some mutations that increase transmission, and which also potentially could make (it) resistant to antibodies that are generated by vaccination or by natural infection,” she said.SA, UK and B’desh detect cases of Indian variantSouth Africa, Britain and Bangladesh have all detected more cases of the Indian variant. South Africa’s health ministry said four cases have been recorded in the country. Seven cases of the Indian variant have been found in the UK’s Bedfordshire county. In Bangladesh, it was detected as the country’s first case of the variant first identified in India.EU does not renew order for AstraZeneca vaccineThe EU Commission did not renew its order for AstraZeneca’s Covid-19 vaccine, the EU’s internal market commissioner said on Sunday. “We have not renewed the order for after June. We’ll see what will happen next,” Thierry Breton said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/variant-deepening-india-s-crisis-says-top-who-scientist-101620590227454.html

10-05-2021||World||EU launches conference to debate its future with citizens||French President Emmanuel Macron on Sunday expressed hope that Europe would rediscover the path of “great projects, great ambitions and great dreams” as the European Union launched a wide consultation process meant to design the shape of the bloc's future.Macron spoke as part of Europe Day, the inaugural event of the Conference on the Future of Europe in the French city of Strasbourg.“What Europe do we want in 10 years, 15 years from now?,” Macron asked in his opening speech, calling on people to debate all major issues, from the bloc’s borders to new institutions, cultural projects, education and the fight against climate change.The process also aims at bringing the EU's complex decision-making closer to its 450 million citizens.While advocating for Europe’s democratic model, based on solidarity, Macron acknowledged that “we’ve seen that sometimes Europe didn’t go fast enough and maybe didn’t have enough ambition.”He called on Europeans to get inspired by the United States to rediscover ways to “shape the future and move fast.”The pandemic has shown that the EU lacked the effective tools to react quickly to a continent-wide emergency. The bloc was notably criticized at the beginning of the year for its vaccination campaign starting slower compared to the U.S. and the United Kingdom.“The pandemic has been traumatic ... and like all trauma we need to find a way of talk about it if we want to move beyond it," European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said. “And there’s no better way to do that than by offering prospective, hope and the ability to change things for the better."The process is meant to allow “young people in particular to have their say” about Europe's future, she said.A digital platform and series of conference-related events will enable people to share their views on changes and improvements they wish for the EU.The conference's plenary will be composed of representatives from the European Parliament, member states, the European Commission, as well as representatives from all national parliaments, social partners, the civil society and panels of citizens.European Parliament President David Sassoli said “as we are about to rebuild our economies and our societies on new foundations ... it is even more crucial and urgent to listen to our fellow citizens, to feel their needs, their expectations in terms of assistance, jobs, dignity, security and prosperity.”The conference is expected to reach conclusions to provide guidance on the future of Europe by spring 2022.Meanwhile, Macron hoped the European Parliament will be able to hold its next plenary session in June in Strasbourg, its official seat. European lawmakers didn’t return to the French city since February last year because of the virus crisis.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/eu-launches-conference-to-debate-its-future-with-citizens-101620585325140.html

10-05-2021||India||Madras HC tells Centre to augment oxygen supply to Tamil Nadu amid rising demand||The Madras High Court on Monday said that it was necessary to take urgent measures to augment oxygen supply to Tamil Nadu and think of a plan B.“It is necessary that immediate urgent measures be taken, both to augment the supply of oxygen in the state, vaccines and drugs to both the state and the Union territory (Puducherry),” the court stated.The bench of Chief Justice Sanjib Banerjee and Justice Senthilkumar Ramamoorthy made the observations in the suo motu plea taken up by the court to monitor Covid-19 second wave preparedness in Tamil Nadu and Puducherry.The court observed that until a national task force is formed as ordered by the Supreme Court on May 6, it is the Union government’s responsibility to ensure a continuous supply of oxygen and drugs to states and union territories. The court also asked Additional Solicitor General, R Sankaranarayanan, to take up the issue with the Centre.During the hearing, newly appointed state advocate general R Shunmughasundaram submitted that Tamil Nadu’s demand about a week ago was for 475 MT of oxygen daily. On May 8, the Centre allocated a daily quota of 419 MT, this includes 40 MT supply from Palakkad in Kerala till May 12.But the state’s assessment is that the oxygen demand will rise to 800 MT “within the next few days”, the court noted. The court also added that it has been reported in the media that the locals have stopped vehicles carrying oxygen from Palakkad towards Coimbatore and the neighbouring areas in view of the perceived shortage of oxygen supply in Kerala.“The state and the Centre should find ways of effective supply to the south-western region of the state since supply from Sriperumbudur or elsewhere in north or central Tamil Nadu may be logistically difficult to reach the south-western part of the state and, at any rate, less efficient than ensuring supply from neighbouring Palakkad which is about 40 kilometres away,” the court said.It was also submitted to the court that the Sterlite facility in Thoothukudi district, which was allowed to be re-opened by the Supreme Court for the sole purpose of producing oxygen, may begin production this week with an anticipated 40 MT per day as initial supply.With present allocation and rising demand, the court said that it was necessary to think of a plan B and explore options such as oxygen generators being set up by the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) at short notice.As experts warn of a third wave, the court said, “it is necessary to be over-prepared and not require the resources being put to use rather than being unprepared and rue for not having garnered additional resources. The object of the exercise is to prepare for the worst and hope that the worst does not hit us.”The bench however observed that the lockdown in Tamil Nadu from May 10-24 will taper cases. It also noted that as the new government is being formed in the state, most key officials have been transferred except health secretary J Radhakrishnan to ensure continuing measures to fight the pandemic.The court said that though the state has augmented bed availability, “Both Tamil Nadu and Puducherry seem to be crying out for the requisite supply of drugs and vaccines.” Due to lack of doses, the state hasn’t rolled out vaccination for the 18-45 age group. “Learned ASG has assured to take up the case of both the state and the union territory with the Centre, at least till such time that the National Task Force set up by the Supreme Court order gets down to the nitty-gritty of the allocation and the like,” the court said in its orders.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/madras-hc-tells-centre-to-augment-oxygen-supply-to-tamil-nadu-amid-rising-demand-101620666139461.html

The four regions, namely the Pondicherry region, Karaikal, Yanam and Mahe region are at different locations, geographically separated from each other.Puducherry has various rivers and tributaries. There are five rivers in Puducherry district, seven in Karaikal district, two in Mahé district and one in Yanam district drain into the sea, but none originates within the territory, the ministry said.Puducherry has 84 irrigation tanks and more than 500 ponds which are the lifeline for groundwater recharging systems, drinking water and agriculture.Puducherry has been consistently working towards de-silting of ponds and rejuvenation of its local water bodies, which is crucial for drinking water supply schemes, it added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/puducherry-achieves-100-tap-water-connection-in-rural-areas-under-jjm-101620662973437.html
10-05-2021||India||Regular ivermectin use may cut risk of contracting Covid-19: Study||Regular use of the oral antiparasitic drug ivermectin may significantly reduce the risk of contracting Covid-19, according to a review of available data by researchers who claim the medicine can help end the pandemic.The research, published in the May-June issue of the American Journal of Therapeutics, is the most comprehensive review of the available data on ivermectin taken from clinical, in vitro, animal, and real-world studies, its authors said."We conducted the most comprehensive review of the available data on ivermectin," said Pierre Kory, president and chief medical officer of the Front Line Covid-19 Critical Care Alliance (FLCCC), a group of medical and scientific experts, which led the study."We applied the gold standard to qualify the data reviewed before concluding that ivermectin can end this pandemic," Kory said in a statement.Ivermectin is an oral drug is used as a prescription medication to treat parasitic infections.A focus of the study was on the 27 controlled trials available in January 2021, 15 of which were randomised controlled trials (RCT's).The authors found large, statistically significant reduction in mortality, time to recovery and viral clearance in Covid-19 patients treated with ivermectin.To evaluate the efficacy of ivermectin in preventing Covid-19, three RCT's and five observational controlled trials including almost 2,500 patients were analysed.All studies reported that ivermectin significantly reduces the risk of contracting Covid-19 when used regularly, the authors said.Many regions around the world now recognise that ivermectin is a powerful prophylaxis and treatment for Covid-19, the researchers said.The results as seen in this latest study demonstrate that the ivermectin distribution campaigns repeatedly led to "rapid population-wide decreases in morbidity and mortality," they said."Our latest research shows, once again, that when the totality of the evidence is examined, there is no doubt that ivermectin is highly effective as a safe prophylaxis and treatment for Covid-19," said Paul E. Marik, founding member of the FLCCC and Chief, Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine at Eastern Virginia Medical School in the US."We are calling on regional public health authorities and medical professionals around the world to demand that ivermectin be included in their standard of care right away so we can end this pandemic once and for all," Marik added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/regular-ivermectin-use-may-cut-risk-of-contracting-covid-19-study-101620664096285.html
10-05-2021||India||Edappadi Palaniswami is AIADMK’s leader in Tamil Nadu assembly||After a power tussle between former Tamil Nadu chief minister Edappadi Palaniswami and senior AIADMK leader O Panneerselvam on Monday, the former was chosen as the AIADMK’s legislative party leader in effect making him the Leader of Opposition in Tamil Nadu.After losing the assembly elections, this is the next best post for an outgoing chief minister and Palaniswami has now sealed his position in the AIADMK for now and future. The party needed to finalise its decision today as the newly elected lawmakers are to take oath on Tuesday.This was the second meeting as the party wasn’t able to arrive at a consensus when it previously met on Friday. After a three-hour meeting on Monday, at the party office in Chennai, there was no press briefing but AIADMK announced on Twitter that they have chosen Palaniswami as the opposition leader. It was followed by a statement signed by both Edappadi Palaniswami and Panneerselvam.The duo has been managing affairs of the party and government since J Jayalalithaa’s death in office in December 2016. The dual leadership arrangement is where Palaniswami was chief minister and joint coordinator of the AIADMK while Pannerselvam was his deputy chief minister and coordinator of the party. However, simmering tension between the duo has come up now and then over important decisions over the position.Inside the meeting, senior leader KP Munusamy announced Edappadi Palaniswami as the opposition leader to the newly-elected MLAs. “It is a unanimous decision of the new MLAs, senior leaders without any dissent,” said one of AIADMK’s founding members C Ponnaiyan.But the scenes outside the party office were different, as there was heavy police deployment and it had swelled up with opposing cadre who supported the two leaders. This crowd was there despite Tamil Nadu going into full lockdown from Monday up to May 24. The party had informed the police of their meeting that was decided last week.In the previous meeting, the newly-elected MLAs were seated on the first floor of the party office while seniors, along with Palaniswami and Panneerselvam discussed matters on the ground floor. When asked if there was no dissent why the previous meeting was inconclusive, Ponnaiyan said, “There was no actual problem, it was created by the media. Besides choosing the opposition leader, we had to discuss our electoral debacle. Our performance in the north and south regions isn’t appreciable.”The poll performance had given Palaniswami the upper hand as he and former top ministers hail from the western region where the party performed its best with more number of MLAs being elected. Pannerselvam hails from the south. In what was seen as Pannerselvam’s show of strength, he had attended chief minister MK Stalin’s swearing-in last Friday before the meeting and they ate a table together along with Governor Banwarilal Purohit, former chief secretary Rajeev Ranjan and other senior DMK leaders.A new MLA from the south’s Usilampatti constituency, P Ayyapan said that they agreed to the leadership’s decision. “I’m from his (Panneerselvam) region. He hadn’t come to us for our support in this matter. He didn’t say he wants the post,” said Ayyapan. “It’s the cadre outside who are shouting slogans and leaving.”However, issues had been brewing over who would become the leader of opposition. A former AIADMK minister who didn’t wish to be quoted said, “It is only natural and expected that both leaders had their own support base who put forth their points. We have resolved this now.”This is the second time that Pannerselvam has given up an important post despite putting up a fight initially. In October 2020, after more than a week of MLAs shuttling between the two leaders, Pannerselvam broke the suspense and announced the party’s decision to field Palaniswami as the chief ministerial candidate.The party has deftly ousted VK Sasikala and her nephew TTV Dhinakaran in 2017. While they wanted to reclaim the AIADMK, Sasikala announced that she was keeping away ahead of the elections and Dhinakaran’s Amma Makkal Munnetra Kazhagam (AMMK) didn’t win any seat but played spoiler for AIADMK in 21 seats. For now, the party says that there will be no deflection.Meanwhile, Rajya Sabha MPs Munusamy and R Vaithilingam have resigned since they have won as MLAs from Vepanahalli and Orathanadu constituencies in the recently concluded elections. During the campaign, AIADMK’s RS MP Mohamed John died of a cardiac arrest and with that three upper house seats from Tamil Nadu are vacant.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/aiadmk-chooses-edappadi-palaniswami-as-leader-of-opposition-in-tamil-nadu-assembly-101620662719178.html

The decision has been taken in the wake of alleged violence against party leaders and workers in the state, officials said.In X-category security cover, three to five armed personnel accompany the protecteee round the clock depending on the threat perception.The Union home ministry approved the security cover after taking into cognisance a report prepared by central security agencies and the inputs of a high-level team of officers that was sent to the state by the ministry in the wake of post-poll violence against the workers of the BJP, news agency PTI reported.Several BJP leaders were already put under VIP security protection during campaigning for the assembly elections. After the fresh order, all 77 MLAs of the BJP have now been brought under central security cover.Suvendu Adhikari, who has been chosen as the leader of opposition in West Bengal Assembly, is already under Z-category protection by CRPF while four more BJP leaders have Y-category security cover.The BJP has emerged as the main opposition party in the state, winning 77 seats in the 294-member house in the recently concluded polls where the Trinamool Congress (TMC) led by chief minister Mamata Banerjee formed the government.Violence has been reported in several parts of West Bengal after the results of the assembly elections were declared on May 2. The BJP alleged that nine of its party workers were killed in the post-poll violence. However, the TMC has denied the allegations.On May 7, a four-member team deputed by the Union home ministry visited the Diamond Harbour area of West Bengal's South 24 Parganas district to assess the ground situation.Meanwhile, the West Bengal government on Monday told a Calcutta high court bench that there has been no post-poll political violence in the state since May 9 and assured that all steps will be taken to ensure peace in future.The five-judge bench was hearing a Public Interest Litigation (PIL) filed by a lawyer and directed that all steps be taken in this regard by May 17 and posted the matter for hearing on May 18.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/61-bjp-mlas-in-bengal-get-x-category-security-cisf-cover-post-poll-violence-101620662287568.html
10-05-2021||India||Covid mutation in India 'variant of concern', says WHO||A Covid-19 variant spreading in India, which is facing an explosive outbreak, appears to be more contagious and has been classified as being "of concern", the World Health Organization said Monday.The UN health agency said the B.1.617 variant of Covid-19 first found in India last October seemed to be transmitting more easily than the original version of the virus, and might possibly have some increased resistance to vaccine protections."There is some available information to suggest increased transmissibility of the B.1.617," Maria Van Kerkove, the WHO's lead on Covid-19, told reporters, also pointing to early studies "suggesting that there is some reduced neutralisation"."As such we are classifying this as a variant of concern at the global level," she said, adding that more details would be provided in the WHO's weekly epidemiological update on Tuesday.India, suffering from one of the worst outbreaks in the world, reported nearly 370,000 fresh infections and more than 3,700 new deaths on Monday.The devastating wave has overwhelmed India's healthcare system, and experts have said official figures for cases and fatalities are much lower than the actual numbers.It has for some time been feared that B.1.617 -- which counts several sub-lineages with slightly different mutations and characteristics -- might be contributing to the alarming spread.But until now, WHO has listed it merely as a "variant of interest".Now it will be added to the list containing three other variants of Covid-19 -- those first detected in Britain, Brazil and South Africa -- which the WHO has classified as being "of concern".They are seen as more dangerous than the original version of the virus by being more transmissible, deadly or able to get past vaccine protections.When it comes to the B.1.617 variant, Van Kerkove stressed that for the time being "we don't have anything to suggest that our diagnostics or therapeutics and our vaccines don't work".The WHO's chief scientist Soumya Swaminathan agreed."What we know now is that the vaccines work, the diagnostics work, the same treatments that are used for the regular virus work," she told the news conference."So there's really no need to change any of those, and in fact... people should go ahead and get whatever vaccine is available to them and that they are eligible for."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-mutation-in-india-variant-of-concern-says-who-101620662031983.html

So the state should be allowed to procure all 150 metric tonne produced at Kanjikode plant (in Palakkad),” Pinarayi Vijayan said in his letter to PM Modi.Kerala’s main oxygen producing unit run by a private company, Inox Air Products, was also catering to demand for oxygen in two neighbouring states, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu. Pinarayi Vijayan said Kerala has been sending 40 metric tonnes of oxygen to Tamil Nadu daily in line with the directions of the central committee on oxygen pool.Vijayan said this would have to stop in view of the surge in Covid cases in Kerala.In the last 24 hours, according to the state government, Kerala has reported 27,487 fresh Covid cases, leading the active caseload to rise to 4,19,726. This is the third highest, next only to Maharashtra and Karnataka. Kerala’s 14 districts have reported a test positivity rate (TPR) of 26.5%.Pinarayi Vijayan, who had been reluctant to restrict movement in the state, reluctantly ordered a week-long lockdown till May 16 due to the spike in Covid cases.The chief minister told reporters that Kerala’s active Covid cases are estimated to cross 600,000 by next week and estimated that the state would need 450 MT to meet the demand from patients in the state.Kerala has been an oxygen surplus state and helped other states meet the growing demand for oxygen. It needed just about 80 MT but produced about 219 MT in big and small units. But this was before a virulent strain of the Covid started spreading in the state. Pinarayi Vijayan said the increase in cases had already led its buffer stock to dip to 86 MT.Instead, Vijayan asked PM Modi to send more cryogenic tankers to transport oxygen to hospitals and Covid centres in the state. The chief minister last week had asked PM Modi to help the state with imported oxygen concentrators and ventilators.At the same time, Pinarayi Vijayan said the state government has also started a vigorous exercise to check oxygen wastage. As part of this exercise, technical teams will visit all generating and filling stations.“There is no let up in the situation. In 72 panchayats, the TPR is above 50% and in 300, it is above 30%. Cases are surging in Kannur, Ernakulam and Thiruvananthapuram districts. We have to strengthen lockdown to keep fatality down,” Vijayan said.Kerala has, however, managed to control the number of deaths. Despite a high load of active cases, the state has the lowest case fatality rates due to Covid-19 in the country: 0.4% against the national average of 1.4%. Experts have mostly attributed the lower fatality rate to the state’s health infrastructure.Pinarayi Vijayan said his government will strengthen it further and hire more doctors, nurses and paramedical staff and ask retired health workers to return to work. The jail department has released 560 prisoners on parole in line with the Supreme Court’s orders to control its spread in jails.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/wont-be-able-to-send-oxygen-to-others-kerala-s-pinarayi-vijayan-tells-pm-modi-101620661819244.html

10-05-2021||India||Deadly 'black fungus' found in India's Covid-19 patients||The Indian government has told doctors to look out for signs of mucormycosis or "black fungus" in Covid-19 patients as hospitals report a rise in cases of the rare but potentially fatal infection.The state-run Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) said at the weekend that doctors treating Covid-19 patients, diabetics and those with compromised immune systems should watch for early symptoms including sinus pain or nasal blockage on one side of the face, one-sided headache, swelling or numbness, toothache and loosening of teeth.The disease, which can lead to blackening or discolouration over the nose, blurred or double vision, chest pain, breathing difficulties and coughing blood, is strongly linked to diabetes. And diabetes can in turn be exacerbated by steroids such as dexamethasone, used to treat severe Covid-19."There have been cases reported in several other countries - including the UK, U.S., France, Austria, Brazil and Mexico, but the volume is much bigger in India," said David Denning, a professor at Britain's Manchester University and an expert at the Global Action Fund for Fungal Infections (GAFFI) charity."And one of the reasons is lots and lots of diabetes, and lots of poorly controlled diabetes."India has not published national data on mucormycosis but has said there is no major outbreak. Media reports have pointed to cases in Maharashtra and its capital Mumbai, and Gujarat.Aparna Mukherjee, a scientist at ICMR, said: "It's not something to panic about, but you have to be aware of when to seek consultation."But it is a complication that India's overwhelmed hospitals, desperately short of beds as well as the oxygen needed for severely ill Covid-19 patients, could do without.Arunaloke Chakrabarti, head of the Center of Advanced Research in Medical Mycology in the Indian city of Chandigarh and an adviser to GAFFI, said that even before Covid-19, mucormycosis was more common in India than in most countries, "partly because of the millions who have diabetes".He said serious cases might require specific antifungal therapy and several operations.P Suresh, head of opthalmology at Fortis Hospital in Mulund, Mumbai, said his hospital had treated at least 10 such patients in the past two weeks, roughly twice as many as in the entire year before the pandemic.All had been infected with Covid-19 and most were diabetic or had received immunosuppressant drugs. Some had died, and some had lost their eyesight, he said. Other doctors spoke of a similar surge in cases."Previously if I saw one patient a year, I now see about one a week," said Nishant Kumar, a consultant ophthalmologist at Hinduja hospital in Mumbai, noting the potential for contamination of oxygen pipes and humidifiers in hospitals.Denning called it a "triple whammy". "You've got a high rate of mucormycosis, you've got a lot of steroids - maybe too much - being used, and then you've got diabetes which is not being well controlled or managed."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/deadly-black-fungus-found-in-india-s-covid-19-patients-101620658023360.html

Now, amid the second wave of Covid-19 pandemic raging across the country, the party has decided to defer the polls once again.“In view of the nationwide emergent conditions prevailing on account of unprecedented Corona pandemic, the CWC was unanimous that all our energies should be channelized towards saving every life and helping every Covid affected person. CWC, therefore, unanimously resolved to defer the elections temporarily in the midst of these challenging times,” read the CWC resolution.Also read: Convene special Parliament session on Covid, Congress to President KovindCongress chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala said, “the election has been deferred for two to three months” but at least two other party insiders said that polls would not happen till the covid subsides.In her opening remarks, Congress president Sonia Gandhi mentioned the internal polls and said, “There is another important issue on which I would like your guidance. When we met on January 22nd, we had decided that the process for electing a Congress President would be completed by end-June. The election authority chairperson, Madhusudan Mistri ji, has prepared a schedule.”The Mistri panel had proposed that the elections would be held in the last week of June. But leaders, including Rajasthan chief minister Ashok Gehlot, argued that this is time to hold party polls.In the meet, Congress also decided to form state-level committees to analyse the results of assembly elections in Assam, West Bengal and Kerala.

We are in the business of transport. We have to move freight and people. Around 1,000 cases are reported daily. We have our hospitals. We have augmented the number of beds, we have built oxygen plants in rail hospitals. We take care of our staff…,” he said at a press conference on Monday.“As of now, we have 4,000 beds currently occupied by staff and their families. Our effort is to see that they recover quickly. As of yesterday, 1952 rail employees have died due to Covid-19 since March last year,” he added.With a workforce of nearly 1.3 million, the Indian railways is one of the largest employers in the world.Last week, railways’ union - the All India Railwaymenś Federation - wrote to railway minister Piyush Goyal demanding compensation at par with frontline workers for railwaymen who lost their lives while working amid the Covid-19 crisis.In the letter, they said that these personnel deserved ₹50 lakh as compensation, the same as that announced for frontline workers, and not ₹25 lakh which is paid to them.In the letter, Shiva Gopal Mishra, general secretary of the All India Railwaymenś Federation, said that while more than one lakh have been infected by the virus, 65,000 have recovered and joined their duties while 1,500 have lost their lives due to the coronavirus disease.Sharma said that the Railways was concerned about the safety of all railwaymen and took all necessary steps to minimise their exposure.Speaking on the Oxygen Express, Sharma said that the Railways has delivered nearly 4700 tonnes of liquid medical oxygen (LMO) in more than 295 tankers to various states across the country since April 19.On Sunday, Oxygen Express delivered a record 831 tonnes of LMO, a record for one single day. So far, 75 Oxygen Express´ have already completed their journey.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/over-1900-personnel-succumbed-to-covid-19-since-last-year-railway-board-chairman-101620657438788.html
10-05-2021||India||Convene special Parliament session on Covid, Congress to President Kovind||Congress MP Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury on Monday asked President Ram Nath Kovind to convene a special session of Parliament to discuss the Covid pandemic and come up with steps to ease the suffering of people.The senior Baharampur Lok Sabha member’s letter to President Kovind comes at a time the second wave of coronavirus disease continues to rage across the country. On Sunday, the country had reported over 366,000 fresh cases, pushing the number of active Covid cases to 3.7 million and severely straining the health sector.The infection, according to official records, has led to over 2,46,116 deaths but most experts agree that a large number of deaths have gone unreported.“In this critical situation I would urge your kind conscience to convene a special (Covid crisis) session of Parliament because India consists of a number of constituencies and each member of Parliament representing his/her constituency from the respective state has some say about the condition of people therein and in order to find a way to ease the lives of suffering people,” Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury, who heads the Congress party in the Lok Sabha said.“Corona pandemic in the country is in a grave situation and you must be well informed about the exact scenario. In this critical situation I would urge your kind conscience to convene a special (Covid crisis) session of Parliament,” the lawmaker said in his letter to President Kovind.Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury added that the session was needed as “India consists of a number of constituencies and each Member of Parliament represents his/her constituency from respective State has some say about the condition of people therein and in order to find a way to ease lives of suffering people”.Many opposition leaders have also demanded that parliament should hold a special sitting and that this should be held virtually.To be sure, the power to convene a session of Parliament rests with the government. The decision to convene the session has to be taken by the Cabinet Committee on Parliamentary Affairs headed by defence minister Rajnath Singh. The presidential notification follows the cabinet committee’s decisions.India does not have a fixed parliamentary calendar. By convention, Parliament meets for three sessions in a year- the Budget Session, the Monsoon Session and the Winter Session. A special session is when the Parliament meets outside the normal legislative sessions. Special sessions can be convened to complete an unfinished task or to address special topics, or emergencies such as war or natural disaster.In April, Shiv Sena’s Rajya Sabha Sanjay Raut had also demanded a two-day session on Covid-19, underlining that the second wave of coronavirus cases had led to “an unprecedented and almost a war-like situation”.“Utmost confusion and tension everywhere. No beds, no oxygen and no vaccination as well. It’s nothing but total chaos. A special session of parliament for at least two days should be called to discuss the situation.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/convene-special-parliament-session-on-covid-congress-to-president-kovind-101620655398878.html

These equipment were airlifted from Israel and reached India on Sunday night.So far, the government of Israel has sent a total of 60 tonnes of medical supplies, three oxygen generators, 1710 oxygen concentrators and 420 ventilators to India.“The State of Israel is happy to stand solidly side by side with India as a true friend and a strategic partner in this hour of need. In the last few days, we have successfully airlifted three different consignments of life-saving medical supplies to India. This includes 60 tonnes of advanced medical equipment and several oxygen concentrators. More consignments carrying further medical aid will arrive for the people of India in coming days. The friendship between both countries is strong and collaboration during the Covid-19 crisis will only make it stronger,” said Dr Ron Malka, ambassador of Israel to India.The medical aid arrived in three different consignments on May 4, May 7 and May 9 via Indian Air Force (IAF) aircrafts and a commercial flight.The Israeli ministry of foreign affairs along with the National Security Council, health ministry, finance ministry, and control centre, together with full coordination with the Indian government through the Indian embassy in Israel made the delivery of the medical aid possible.In the first outbreak of Covid-19 in Israel, India had helped Israel, and within this framework approved the air delivery of masks, gloves, and raw materials for medications to Israel, and also helped arrange the repatriation of its citizens.Israel responded by reciprocating the significant gesture.The IAF has deployed 42 transport aircraft for Covid-19 relief tasks, including 12 heavy lift and 30 medium-lift aircraft."IAF has deployed 42 transport aircraft for Covid relief tasks including 12 heavy lift and 30 medium lift aircraft.

10-05-2021||India||Users not accepting privacy terms to face limited functionality: WhatsApp||WhatsApp will not delete any account for not accepting its new privacy update, but users not agreeing to the controversial terms after "several weeks" will not be able to access their chat list, and eventually, will not be able to answer incoming phone or video calls over the app.Last week, the Facebook-owned company had said users not accepting its privacy policy update by its May 15 deadline will not face deletion or lose functionality of their accounts on the said date.WhatsApp, on its website, said it is continuing to remind those who haven't had the chance to review and accept the terms, and after a period of several weeks, "the reminder (that) people receive will eventually become persistent".It, however, did not divulge the timelines set for these reminders.Explaining the course of action after 'persistent' reminders are sent to users, WhatsApp said: “At that time, you'll encounter limited functionality on WhatsApp until you accept the updates”.“This will not happen to all users at the same time. You won't be able to access your chat list, but you can still answer incoming phone and video calls. If you have notifications enabled, you can tap on them to read or respond to a message or call back a missed phone or video call,” it said.The messaging platform said after a few weeks of limited functionality, users, who still won't accept the terms, “won't be able to receive incoming calls or notifications and WhatsApp will stop sending messages and calls to your phone”.WhatsApp said it won't delete the users' accounts if they haven't accepted the update but highlighted that its existing policy related to inactive users will apply.WhatsApp accounts are generally deleted after 120 days of inactivity, wherein inactivity refers to users not connecting to the messaging platform.While the company did not respond to specific queries around these reminders, how long they will run and other modalities, a WhatsApp spokesperson said: “We'll continue to provide reminders to those users within WhatsApp in the weeks to come”.“We've spent the last several months providing more information about our update to users around the world. In that time, the majority of people who have received it have accepted the update and WhatsApp continues to grow."However, for those that have not yet had a chance to do so, their accounts will not be deleted or lose functionality on May 15,” the spokesperson said.WhatsApp had faced severe backlash over user concerns that data was being shared with parent company, Facebook.The company has not clarified the reason behind the decision for easing the May 15 deadline for acceptance of the privacy policy update, nor divulged the number of users who have agreed to the terms so far.In January this year, WhatsApp had informed users about the changes in its terms of service and public policy through an in-app notification. Users were initially given time till February 8 to agree to the new terms in order to continue using the platform.According to WhatsApp, the key updates include more information about its service and how it processes user data; how businesses can use Facebook hosted services to store and manage their WhatsApp chats; and how WhatsApp partners with Facebook to offer integrations across the company products.WhatsApp has insisted that the acceptance of the privacy policy update does not expand its ability to share user data with Facebook.However, user backlash over WhatsApp's alleged sharing of user information with Facebook had forced the messaging platform to postpone the February deadline to May 15.India is the biggest market for WhatsApp, and the platform -- as per government data -- has 53 crore users in the country.India remains a critical market for Internet companies like Facebook with its large population base and burgeoning Internet adoption.The country is the world's second-largest telecom market and the biggest consumer of data.Following the criticism faced by WhatsApp earlier this year, the popularity of rivals like Telegram and Signal surged as users thronged to these platforms.WhatsApp, in the past, has said it is open to answering any questions from the government on privacy and that it will continue to explain to users that their messages are end-to-end encrypted.It had also sought to assuage user concerns through blog posts and tweets by its Global Head Will Cathcart and even full-page ads in leading dailies in India.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/users-not-accepting-privacy-terms-to-face-limited-functionality-whatsapp-101620652496951.html
10-05-2021||India||Google testing new feature in Maps to enable sharing info on beds, medical O2||Google on Monday said it is testing a new feature in Maps that enables people to ask about and share local information on availability of beds and medical oxygen in select locations.This is part of the tech giant's efforts to support the relief efforts amid the deadly second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic."...we're testing a new feature using the Q&A function in Maps that enables people to ask about and share local information on availability of beds and medical oxygen in select locations. As this will be user generated content and not provided by authorised sources, it may be required to verify the accuracy and freshness of the information before utilizing it," it said.As India reels under the impact of the second wave, hospitals in several states are reeling under a shortage of medical oxygen and beds.Social media timelines are filled with SOS calls with people looking for oxygen cylinders, hospital beds, plasma donors, and ventilators.Google said its teams are focused on three priority areas - ensuring people can access the latest and most authoritative information; amplifying vital safety and vaccination messages; and providing financial backing for affected communities, health authorities and other organisations.Searches on the COVID-19 vaccine displays key information around side effects, effectiveness, and registration details, while treatment-related queries surface guidance from ministry resources. On YouTube it is surfacing authoritative information in a set of playlists, about vaccines, preventing the spread of COVID-19, and facts from experts on COVID-19 care.In addition to showing 2,500 testing centers on Search and Maps, Google is now sharing the locations of over 23,000 vaccination centres nationwide, in English and eight Indian languages, it said."And we're continuing to work closely with the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare to make more vaccination center information available to users throughout India...we're using our channels to help extend the reach of health information campaigns," it added.The company said it has been running an internal donation campaign to raise funds for non-profit organisations, including GiveIndia, Charities Aid Foundation India, GOONJ, and United Way of Mumbai.This campaign has raised over USD 4.6 million ( ₹33 crore) to date, and continues to generate much-needed support for relief efforts.Google has also rolled out a COVID Aid campaign on Google Pay, wherein people can donate to non-profit organisations like GiveIndia, Charities Aid Foundation, Goonj, Save the Children, Seeds, UNICEF India (National NGOs) and United Way towards COVID relief work.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/google-testing-new-feature-in-maps-to-enable-sharing-info-on-beds-medical-o2-101620650863919.html
10-05-2021||India||Tackling Covid-19: Centre spotlights efforts to boost oxygen availability||The Centre said on Monday that it has taken a number of initiatives to enhance availability of oxygen, its distribution and storage infrastructure. In a release, the government said that the steps included augmenting the entire oxygen supply chain."Oxygen availability has been enhanced by increase in production capacity and production, setting up of pressure swing adsorption (PSA) plants, import of liquid medical oxygen (LMO) from overseas, and procurement of oxygen concentrators," the government said.It added that a digital tracking system has been setup of for real time monitoring.Talking about increasing the production, the government said that oxygen production has increased from 5700 MT per day in August last year to 9,446 MT per day in May this year."Commensurate with the increase in production and demand, LMO sale in the country has also increased from about 1,300 MT/day in March’ 21 to 8,920 MT/day on 6th May," the government said. It added that the sale of LMO grew more than five-fold - from 1559 MT per day on March 31, 2021 to over 8,000 MT per day by May 3, 2021.Talking about capacity enhancement plans, the government said that supply of oxygen for non-essential industrial purposes has been prohibited from April 22, resulting in about 1,000 MT of additional oxygen availability. "Additional capacity expansion of 630 MT/day is also planned by steel sector."Thousands of PSA plants are also being set up under PM-Cares through the Union health ministry, the government added.Apart from this, ministry of external affairs is actively assisting in securing sources of oxygen from abroad, the Centre said, adding that procurement of one lakh oxygen concentrators has been sanctioned under PM-Cares fund.The government's response came after the Congress Working Committee (CWC) passed a resolution on Monday, slamming the handling of Covid-19 pandemic by the Centre. It said that the government has put the burden of vaccination on the states.Many states have pointed to issues in oxygen supply, urging the Centre to increase their quota of oxygen to save lives of Covid-19 patients. The Centre said that it used the formula of Union health ministry to estimate oxygen requirement for each state in line with active cases there, and maximum efforts were made to align oxygen allocation to the estimated demand for each state."Oxygen allocation to states/UTs is dynamic in nature, based on requirement as per health ministry norms, and consultation with states/UTs, manufacturers and other stakeholders. There is a mismatch between producing and consuming states, and equity among states to be maintained," said the Centre. The government said that one-third of the production is concentrated in East India, while nearly 60% of demand for oxygen is in North and South India, resulting in transportation challenges.The Supreme Court had recently appointed a 12-member task force to look into the issue of oxygen supply.

It also said that former prime minister Manmohan Singh had suggested ways to increase vaccine supplies and coverage in a letter to PM Modi last month, but was given a reply by Union health minister Harsh Vardhan in most undignified manner.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/congress-adhir-ranjan-writes-to-president-kovind-seeks-parliament-session-over-covid-19-crisis-101620643585363.html

And Dolo is charged ₹30-40 each. We won’t allow this loot,” said the court.The court took up the issue suo motu after a 28-year-old man posted a video on social media narrating his bitter experience at a private hospital in Aluva in Kochi. Many such complaints of heavy billing were reported from various parts of the state. Also Read | Cong to form state-level panels to analyse assembly poll resultsThe state government informed the court that a case has been registered against the hospital and a fee structure was fixed for various services in private hospitals. “As per the new order, price of the general ward for a day would be ₹2,645, includes registration, bed, diagnosis, oxygen, nursing and doctor fees and other services,” the government counsel informed the court. But expenses of costly medicines such as Remdesivir will be charged separately. He also informed the court that a penalty of ten times the rate will be imposed in case of overcharging. The counsel appearing for private hospitals opposed the capping and said they were also working under trying conditions.“Because of the pandemic, you are having 100% occupancy. Normally it will be 50-60%. Learn to average our costs,” the court said. It also lauded the government initiative to bring a fee structure to check exploitation in hospitals.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-caps-private-hospital-treatment-fees-after-hc-rap-101620650298598.html
10-05-2021||India||Mamata Banerjee retains six portfolios, inducts 20 new ministers in her Cabinet||West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee retained six portfolios while inducting 20 new faces in her 43-member new Cabinet. Meanwhile, the Bharatiya Janata Party on Monday elected Suvendu Adhikari as the Leader of the Opposition. While the ruling Trinamool Congress returned to power for the third time with a thumping victory by winning 213 out of the 292 seats, party chief Banerjee lost to her protégé-turned adversary Adhikari by less than 2,000 votes at Nandigram in east Midnapore district. “We have inducted 20 new ministers in the Cabinet. There are nine women ministers (including Banerjee), seven ministers representing minority community and four each from SC and ST communities,” Banerjee said. There are 24 ministers of Cabinet rank, 10 ministers of state with independent charge, and nine other ministers of state.She retained some of the most important portfolios such as home and hills affairs, health and family welfare, land and land reforms, personnel and administrative reforms and information and cultural affairs. . Among the new ministers is former finance minister Amit Mitra. Even though he didn’t contest the elections because of his poor health, he was sworn in as finance minister. Among the new faces are former IPS officer Humayun Kabir and ex-cricketer Manoj Tiwari. Though the TMC had fielded several Tollywood actors and nearly all of them won, none were inducted in the Cabinet. Also Read | Cong to form state-level panels to analyse assembly poll resultsThe chief minister also made some important changes in the Cabinet. Jyotipriyo Mullick, who was the food and supplies minister, was made the forest and renewable sources minister. It was during Mullick’s tenure that the TMC had to face allegations of ration scam. Firhad Hakim was given transport and housing, while minister of state for health Chandrima Bhattacharya was given the additional charge of urban development. Bratya Basu retained the ministries of school and higher education. Leader of the Opposition Suvendu Adhikari said, “As the main Opposition party in the assembly, our first priority would be to ensure that there is no violence and to establish democracy. We would attend the sessions and raise our voice against injustice and torture.” The chief minister, however, said, “Nothing has happened in Bengal. Bengal is peaceful. There was one only genocide which took place at Sitalkuchi (where central forces had shot dead four persons).” Soon after, Banerjee held the first Cabinet meeting where she hinted that her government would rather not impose any lockdown despite the rise in Covid-19 cases. “We have imposed multiple restrictions. Without imposing a total lockdown, I urge people to behave as if there is a lockdown. If you impose total lockdown, people won’t be able to earn a living. There are many poor people who depend on daily wages,” she said. With Eid scheduled later this week, members of the Calcutta Khilafat Committee have decided not to hold prayers on Red Road, where over 200,000 people easily gather every year. The state has also put on a cap of 50 people on religious and cultural gatherings.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mamata-banerjee-retains-six-portfolios-inducts-20-new-ministers-in-her-cabinet-101620649878797.html

In the resolution passed after the meeting, the CWC called the second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic "a grave calamity and direct consequence of the Modi government’s indifference, insensitivity and incompetence"."It is the direct result of the central government’s willful disregard of scientific advice, its premature declaration of victory over the pandemic (that turned out to be just the first wave), and its unwillingness and inability to plan in advance in spite of warnings sounded not only by public health experts but also by the standing committee of Parliament concerned," the CWC further said in the resolution.Attacking the Centre over insufficient vaccine supply, the CWC resolution said the Modi government denies the hard facts. It also said that former prime minister Manmohan Singh had suggested ways to increase vaccine supplies and coverage in a letter to PM Modi last month, but was given a reply by Union health minister Harsh Vardhan in most undignified manner."The CWC noted with concern that the data on Covid deaths is horribly wrong and afflicted by massive non-reporting of deaths. The solution lies in facing the challenge and stopping the casualties from Covid-19 and not in concealing the truth by burying the data on deaths and infections," the CWC resolution said.It also slammed the Central Vista project, calling it "personal vanity project of the Prime Minister" which is leading to criminal waste of money. "This is the height of callousness and insensitivity as also an insult to the people of the country," the CWC said."The Congress Working Committee is of the firm belief that this a time for showing an unwavering sense of national unity, purpose and resolve. In order that it may become a reality, the Prime Minister must atone for his mistakes and commit to serving the people instead of carrying on with personal agenda, oblivious to the suffering all around," it further said.Earlier, addressing the CWC, Congress president Sonia Gandhi alleged that the Centre has abdicated its responsibility and left Covid-19 vaccination to states."Modi government has abdicated its responsibility and left vaccination to states. It would have been financially more equitable for the Centre to provide free vaccine to all," she said.India recorded 3,66,161 new coronavirus cases in the last 24 hours, as per the Union health ministry update on Monday morning. With this, the cumulative count of the cases has gone up to 2,26,62,575.As many as 3,754 people succumbed to the disease in the country in the last 24 hours, taking the cumulative death toll to 2,46,116.

The drive is part of a multi-pronged strategy to fight the second wave of the disease, believed to be more lethal and infectious than the first one last year.“We need a huge thrust on information dissemination regarding Covid and counter[ing] the misinformation. On the instructions of Lt Governor, Manoj Sinha, we have also started a phone-in programme where specialist doctors will provide information to the general public. A mass social media campaign has also been launched to educate [the] public about the Dos and Don’ts in the Pandemic,” said Dr Shafqat Khan, the officer on special duty (OSD) in the Health and Medical Education Department. He said the government’s target audience were mild cases under treatment in home isolation.“This is turning into a success story,” Dr Khad added referring to the perceived success of the program.“The efforts are to amplify the [correct] message as there is a lot of misinformation spreading within the community about the disease,” said Dr Salim Khan, the head of department (HoD) of Social and Preventive Medicine at the Government Medical College (GMC) Srinagar. He is also the nodal officer for Covid-19 at the hospital.Till Sunday evening, Jammu and Kashmir’s Covid infection toll had reached 216,932 including 2,726 deaths.

10-05-2021||India||CWC meeting: Congress to form state-level panels to analyse poll results in Assam, Bengal and Kerala||The Congress has decided to form state-level committees to analyse the results of assembly elections in Assam, West Bengal and Kerala. The decision was taken at the Congress Working Committee (CWC) meeting.At the meeting, the party leaders noted that in Assam, the difference of vote share between Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and Congress alliance was very narrow. The BJP was able to retain power in Assam by defeating Congress-led 'Mahajot'; Himanta Biswa Sarma took oth as 15th chief minister of the state on Monday.The CWC meeting was convened to analyse the election results and review the party's performance in the recently-concluded assembly polls. All the Congress leaders present at the CWC meeting maintained that the need of the hour is to maintain unity.Addressing the CWC, Congress president Sonia Gandhi said the party has to take note of its serious setbacks in assembly polls, and face the reality to draw the right lessons and put its house in order.The Congress fared poorly in the assembly elections, drawing a blank in West Bengal and failing to win back power in Kerala and Assam, besides losing Puducherry. The party only came to power with the help of its ally - MK Stalin-led Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) - in Tamil Nadu."These will yield uncomfortable lessons, but if we do not face up to the reality, if we do not look the facts in the face, we will not draw the right lessons," she noted.The Congress chief asked the party general secretaries and in-charges of states where it lost to spell out clearly and frankly the reasons for the party's defeat.The Congress lost the Arunachal Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh, Odisha and Haryana elections in 2019 and the Delhi and Bihar polls last year.It only won in Jharkhand along with its ally Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM).Monday's deliberations were meant to help the Congress prepare for the next round of assembly elections in Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, Uttarakhand, Goa and Manipur.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/congress-forms-state-level-committees-to-analyse-assam-bengal-kerala-debacle-101620643427397.html
10-05-2021||India||Himanta promises pro-active govt; says Covid-19 control in Assam top priority||Assam’s new chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma on Monday assured people of the state a pro-active government that will work for them round the clock. “You will see a pro-active government which will be there for you at 12am, at 5am and also at 2pm. We will try and resolve all pending issues and seek blessings of the people of Assam,” Sarma told journalists during his first press conference after taking oath earlier in the day. He said the first Cabinet meeting will take place on Tuesday and on agenda would be the prevailing Covid-19 situation in the state. “Daily cases in Assam have crossed 5,000. The situation in Assam will affect other N-E states as well,” he said. The chief minister assured that all the promises made by the BJP and its allies in their election manifesto will be fulfilled. “We saw peace and development in the past five years. I appeal to the remaining outlawed armed outfits in Assam to join the peace talks. I would make a special request to leader of United Liberation Front of Asom-Independent (ULFA-I) Paresh Baruah to shun violence and join talks for permanent peace in the state.” Also Read | Himanta Biswa Sarma takes oath as Assam’s 15th CM; 13 ministers also sworn inSarma said that as promised by the BJP in its poll manifesto, the state government would seek re-verification of the National Register of Citizens (NRC). The document that lists Indian citizens in Assam was released in 2019 with exclusion of names of 1.9 million applicants. BJP has termed it as faulty saying while many genuine citizens got left out, those with dubious credentials managed to get enlisted. “Our view on NRC is very clear. We want 20% re-verification of the list in districts bordering Bangladesh and 10% re-verification in other districts. If after that, the NRC is found to be correct, the state government would accept it and take the process forward. But if the NRC is found faulty after re-verification, we would want the Supreme Court to view this issue critically,” Sarma said. On the issue of granting scheduled tribe (ST) status to Ahoms, Koch-Rajbongshis, Moran, Motok, Sutias and tea-tribe, Sarma said that the state government would try and resolve the issue through talks and without affecting the rights of tribes already under the ST ambit. Reacting to concerns about Assam’s financial situation, Sarma, who held the finance portfolio in the previous government, said the state has nearly ₹7,000 cr in its treasury and stressed there is no cause of concern as the state’s fiscal health is among the best in the country. Sarma assured that his government would enact laws on “love jihad” and “land jihad”. Love jihad is a term used by some Hindu groups to describe relationships between Muslim men and Hindu women.

Law and order being a state subject all state governments must ensure special teams at state, district and taluka levels to mercilessly clamp down on any illegal hoarding or black marketing and send a clear message that trading in human miseries shall not be tolerated under any circumstances,” the Centre has said in its affidavit.It said that enforcement actions have been taken in 157 cases across the country, which include lodging of FIRs and arresting those involved in such activities.A bench headed by Justice D Y Chandrachud, which is hearing a suo motu case for ensuring distribution of essential supplies and services during the pandemic, had on April 30 flagged the issue of black marketing of drugs.In its affidavit filed in the top court, the Centre has said that sale and distribution of drugs are regulated under the Drugs and Cosmetics Act, 1940 and the Drugs Rules, 1945 by the state licensing authorities (SLAs) appointed by the state governments.“DCGI has taken a number of measures to check any hoarding and black marketing of drugs. DCGI had instructed all state drugs controllers (SDCs) on April 10, 2021 to conduct special investigation drive to prevent hoarding/black marketing on Remdesivir in the country and action taken is being followed up by the CDSCO (Central Drugs Standards Control Organisation) regularly,” it said.“On April 24, 21, DCGI had communicated to all the SDCs that there should be zero tolerance to any kind of hoarding/black marketing of drugs and again asked to instruct their enforcement staff to keep strict vigil at the sensitive places and to take stringent action against black marketing/ hoarding of drugs,” it said.It said CDSCO has also collected information from the SDCs regarding details of the enforcement actions taken in this regard.“The enforcement actions have been taken in 157 cases in various places across the country, which include actions like filing cases/ lodging FIRs, arresting people involved in such activities, etc,” the affidavit said.The apex court, in its April 30 order, had said that black marketing of critical Covid-19 drugs and oxygen was a condemnable attempt to exploit peoples' misery.It had directed the Centre to consider constituting a special team to identify and prosecute such offenders.The apex court had also noted that several critical drugs such as Remdesivir and Tocilizumab, were being sold at significantly inflated prices or in fake form."This is a condemnable attempt to exploit peoples' misery and profit from their helplessness," the apex court had said."In order to clamp down on this practice, the Central Government can consider constituting a special team to identify and prosecute those who: (a) sell medical grade oxygen/Covid-19 medicines at exorbitant prices; and (b) sell fake substances and recover the concerning substances," it had said.The Centre had earlier told the top court that hoarding or black marketing is a serious menace and heinous offence apart from being an unpardonable act of trading in human miseries.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/states-must-ensure-special-teams-to-mercilessly-clamp-down-on-black-marketing-of-drugs-centre-tells-sc-101620640234212.html
10-05-2021||India||Jammu and Kashmir to hire retired doctors, deploy MBBS students for Covid care||Jammu and Kashmir government has decided to re-employ retired doctors and deploy final year MBBS students to deal with the shortage of medical staff amid the surging Covid-19 cases following lieutenant governor Manoj Sinha’s advice to the same effect. Earlier this month, the administration extended services of existing medical staff at some government facilities till the end of the year to mitigate the manpower crisis.“Hire interns and final year medical students to increase the manpower in the health sector,” Sinha told the principals of government medical colleges and the chief medical officers in the union territory last week.On Sunday, the government called upon the health institutions across the UT to utilise the services of final year MBBS students for services like telephonic consultations and monitoring of mild Covid-19 cases after due orientation under the supervision of faculty members.Mission director National Health Mission, Choudhary Mohammad Yasin, wrote to the principals of government medical colleges of Jammu and Srinagar besides Sher-I-Kashmir Medical College and Hospital Bemina, asking them to pay a monthly stipend of ₹5,000 to all such final year MBBS students, under Covid-19 Emergency Response Package (ECRP) 2021-22.“The stipend will be [paid] to those who work for at least 100 days for Covid care in accordance with the notification issued by Union Ministry for Health and Family Welfare,” he said. The Central government has announced several incentives including preference in government jobs for medical students who opt for Covid duty for at least 100 days.As many as 5,190 fresh infections and 54 Covid-19 deaths were reported in Jammu and Kashmir on Sunday, taking the overall death toll to 2,726 and the total cases to over 216,000. 444 people have died this month alone in the UT.President of J&K’s employees’ joint action committee (EJAC), Rafique Rather hailed the step as the one that “will prove helpful to a great extent in containing Covid-19”.A doctor said that doctors who had left government service were also ready to help if given an opportunity. “Many such doctors have volunteered to join back at this time of crisis. It will be better than only taking retired doctors back in service,” he said on condition of anonymity.On May 03, the Jammu and Kashmir administration had announced the decision to extend the tenure of retiring doctors till the end of the year and also provide monetary incentives to all the healthcare workers directly dealing with Coronavirus patients.The incentive, to be paid for a period of three months initially, will be ₹10,000 per month for resident doctors, PGs and medical officers; ₹7,000 per month for nursing and paramedical staff, and ₹5,000 per month for drivers, sweepers and attendants.LG Sinha also granted extension up to 31st December, 2021 to faculty members, consultants, doctors working in SKIMs at Soura and Bemina and government medical colleges and health departments who were going to retire between May, 2021 and November, 2021.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jammu-and-kashmir-to-hire-retired-doctors-deploy-mbbs-students-for-covid-care-101620640398494.html

"I urge ULFA(I) commander-in-chief Paresh Baruah to abjure violence and come to the discussion table. Both the parties will have to come forward for peace talks," said the Assam chief minister.I urge ULFA – Independent commander-in-chief, Paresh Baruah to come forward for peace talks. Both the parties will have to come forward for peace talks: Assam CM Himanta Biswa Sarma pic.twitter.com/bysNTgPsQhFormed in 1979 with the aim of creating a sovereign Assam, the United Liberation Front of Asom (ULFA) is the biggest militant outfit in Assam, seeking to establish an independent state for its indigenous people with armed conflict. Although banned by the Indian government in 1990 citing terrorist threat, the organisation had clearly marked its 'military' and 'political' wings, with Paresh Baruah heading the former as 'commander-in-chief'. A faction led by former ULFA chairman Arabinda Rajkhowa joined the peace process in 2011, but Baruah who renamed his faction as ULFA (Independent) has rebuffed all offers of talks to date.Also Read: ULFA-I chief Paresh Baruah says talks possible only on sovereigntyLast month, the banned outfit abducted three employees of the Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) from its Lakwa oil rig in the Sivasagar district along the Assam-Nagaland border. Following this, security forces ramped up their counter-insurgency operations, killing a top ULFA(I) commander and arresting one of his aides, thwarting the outfit's plan to carry out more such "high-profile kidnappings". Two of the abducted employees have been rescued since, while the search is on for the third.Also Read: Assam Police gun down ULFA-I commander, nab his aidePolice have arrested over a dozen persons in connection with the Sivasagar incident, including an Assam Police constable who was among the five persons who abducted the ONGC employees.

Although Baruah had said, in a telephonic interview to a local Assamese news channel in Guwahati last year, that the ULFA(I) would only join talks with the Centre if sovereignty is the main agenda, it remains to be seen how Assam chief minister Himanta Biswa Sarma's new appeal is responded to, considering the banned outfit's stated 'one-point agenda'.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/assam-cm-urges-ulfa-i-chief-paresh-baruah-to-abjure-violence-join-peace-talks-101620637043064.html

They have been served notice under Section 160 of the CrPC and asked to appear at the CID headquarters on Tuesday.Last week, the investigating officer of the Mathabhanga police station was questioned by the sleuths of the West Bengal CID which is probing the deaths of five persons in firing by the CISF personnel during fourth phase of assembly election.A special investigating team (SIT) under DIG CID Kalyan Mukhopadhyay has been formed to carry out the investigation in the case.The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), meanwhile, called it politically motivated. "The CID's action is politically motivated. They have no right to summon CISF personnel," BJP general secretary, Kailash Vijayvargiya said. Party leader Suvendu Adhikari, who defeated Mamata Banerjee in Nandigram, said the CID is doing it on the directions of Mamata Banerjee.A day after taking oath as chief minister for the third consecutive term, Mamata Banerjee said on May 6 that her government will provide jobs of home guard to one family member each of all five persons killed in Sitalkuchi.The five people were killed at Sitalkuchi in two separate incidents on April 10. In the first incident, an 18-year-old first-time voter was shot dead by miscreants, while in the other central forces shot dead four people allegedly in self-defence.The incident had drawn protests and criticism from the ruling Trinamool Congress (TMC). The TMC held demonstrations across the state to protest the firing incident. Several TMC activists wore black badges and demanded the resignation of Union home minister Amit Shah.The Election Commission, however, had said that that the security forces had to open fire in self-defence. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) had referred to the firing incident multiple times to issue veiled threats against the TMC during the poll campaign.The Superintendent of Police of Cooch Behar Debasish Dhar was suspended after the incident.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/west-bengal-cid-probing-sitalkuchi-violence-serves-notice-to-6-cisf-officials-101620639235613.html

10-05-2021||India||NCP calls for 'one nation, one policy' to tackle Covid-19||The ruling NCP and Congress in Maharashtra on Monday hit out at the Centre over its handling of the Covid-19 situation in the country and called for "one nation, one policy" to fight the pandemic.State Minority Affairs Minister and NCP leader Nawab Malik also demanded that the Narendra Modi government convene an all-party meeting to chalk out the policy."The coronavirus cannot be eradicated only through advertisements at a time when there is a need to work out 'one nation, one policy' considering the current Covid-19 situation in the country," a statement said quoting Malik.He claimed the situation in Uttar Pradesh and Bihar was such that the last rites of Covid-19 victims were being performed in rivers instead of crematoriums."The Covid-19 pandemic cannot be tackled until there is one policy for the country. The Modi government should call an all-party meeting to decide the policy," he said.There is no doubt in anyone's mind that "the Centre is not able to handle the Covid-19 situation," he claimed.Malik also referred to the constitution of a 12-member National Task Force of top medical experts by the Supreme Court to formulate a methodology for oxygen allocation to states and Union Territories and to facilitate a public health response to the pandemic."The Centre is not carrying out works which it is supposed to. So, these are being carried out by court orders. This means the (central) government is falling short of discharging its duty," the NCP leader alleged.Maharashtra Revenue Minister and senior Congress leader Balasaheb Thorat targeted the Centre over its vaccination programme, saying it has unfortunately been proved that the Modi government "does not have" any proper policy and planning to inoculate people."The Centre earlier talked about successfully tackling the first wave (of COVID-19)...(but) the way elections were held, the way Kumbh Mela was organised...the entire country is suffering consequences of the same," Thorat told reporters here."The central government, its leadership, Prime Minister Narendra Modi ji are completely responsible for it, he claimed.The SC had to intervene and form the task force, Thorat noted, and asked what exactly was the Centre doing."It is being seen that it (the Centre) is not serious about anything," he claimed.Thorat also claimed that adequate number of vaccine doses were not being made available to states to inoculate people in the age group of 18 to 44 years.He charged the Centre with not giving permission to foreign players willing to provide vaccines to India.Thorat also demanded that the Centre allow states to develop their own apps for people to register for vaccination.The Shiv Sena, which shares power in Maharashtra with the NCP and Congress, also hit out at the Centre, saying the SC took the step of forming the task force considering the Covid-19 situation, but "those ruling the country are engaged in politics".They were busy in appointing chief minister of Assam (after the recently held Assembly polls) and "in conspiring" to not let the Trinamool Congress-led government in West Bengal do its work, an editorial in the Sena mouthpiece 'Saamana' alleged without naming the BJP or its leaders."At such a time, what should the people, who are about to die, do? Who is their saviour?" it asked.The Supreme Court's heart melted and it formed the national task force of 12 experts, the editorial noted."This committee should now pump life into the collapsed health care system," it said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ncp-calls-for-one-nation-one-policy-to-tackle-covid19-101620637397589.html

The state unit of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) claimed that the wedding was that of Markam's nephew where all Covid-19 protocols were violated.BJP's state vice president Lata Usendi even claimed that Markam was also present at the wedding. The screenshots from the video, posted on Twitter by news agency ANI, show a large number of people roaming around freely at the ceremony.The Congress MLA, however, rubbished all the allegations. "Lata Usendi has alleged that I got my nephew married off like that. She can look at my lineage. Everyone is connected to everyone in villages, it's not right to call everyone my nephew. If Covid norms are violated, the administration can take action," ANI quoted Markam as saying.Chhattisgarh is among the states which account for 82.89 per cent of India's total active cases, according to Union health ministry.

As healthcare is very poor in the area, we refer the mild and the serious cases to government medical college at Nagpur,” says Rajesh Thakare, a social worker from Ramtek village.Private and government hospitals in rural Nagpur have a combined capacity of 2,100 Covid beds at a time when over 2,000 new cases and 25 deaths are being reported daily in the area as per official health bulletins, overwhelming the rural infrastructure.Dr Ratan Roy, a well-known physician from Kamptee blames lack of awareness among the rural population as the major problem.“If a patient tests positive, they start fighting and allege that the reports are false and we are forcefully trying to send patients to Covid care centres and home quarantine,” says Dr Roy.Their ignorance is also behind the refusal to adhere to Covid-19 appropriate behaviour and submit to timely testing apart from the inability to identify symptoms of the disease, which makes timely treatment difficult.Divisional commissioner Dr Sanjiv Kumar points out that unlike the behaviour seen during the complete lockdown in the first wave of the disease, people are now congregating in violation of the restrictions and behaving as if the Coronavirus is no longer a threat. “In rural Nagpur, people can be easily spotted in crowded areas without masks or face coverings,” he said.Kumar however says the situation has improved with the scarcity of hospital beds and oxygen witnessed till last week easing out a bit. “...Now the situation has improved, and we are trying hard to accommodate almost all patients with medicines and oxygen,” he said.The chief executive officer (CEO) of Nagpur Zilla Parishad, Yogesh Kumbhejkar claimed the district body had tried to ramp up the health infrastructure and recruited nurses on contract basis. The administration was also trying to give a leg-up to the vaccination drive. Besides, ASHA workers were asked to monitor Covid patients under home isolation.Officials believe the second wave of the disease built up slowly this year with 1,793 positive cases and 51 deaths registered in the district in January at 7.66% monthly positivity rate and 2.84% case fatality rate (CFR). The monthly positivity rate and the CFR further dropped to 1.16 and 5.07% respectively in February, leading to lowering of the guard.In March, positive cases suddenly jumped to 19,077 with 241 deaths at 1.26% CFR and 16.49% test positivity rate (TPR), indicating a high rate of infection among those tested. The floodgates well and truly opened up in April with 50,447 positive cases and 549 deaths at 24.89% TPR and 1.29% CFR.Nagpur district collector Ravindra Thakre says increased testing, social gatherings such as weddings, gram panchayat elections and non compliance to containment measures such social distancing and wearing of masks were among the chief reasons for the unprecedented Covid spike seen in Nagpur.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid19-second-wave-overwhelms-nagpur-spills-over-to-rural-areas-101620637038551.html

Speaking to reporters after the ceremony in Kolkata, Dhankhar said, "Retributive violence, acts of arson, loot now have graduated to intimidation and extortion. This is worrisome," news agency ANI reported."We are in a deep crisis in the state," Dhankhar also said while referring to the alleged violence in which at least 16 people from various political parties were reportedly killed since May 2. The death toll was announced by Banerjee on May 6.The governor who has been an old rival and a vocal critic of Banerjee, also announced that he would visit the violence-affected areas and he has informed the state government about the same. "As part of my constitutional duty, I've decided to visit affected parts of the state and asked the government to make arrangements." "Unfortunately, their response hasn't been very responsive," Dhankhar added.Dhankhar then said that he will go ahead with the visit and make arrangements by himself in the coming days.Further criticising Banerjee, Dhankhar said that people are being made to pay with their lives for exercising their franchise in the recently concluded assembly elections. "If your vote becomes a cause of your death or property destruction, if it leads to arson, then that signals the end of democracy," he said.Taking a swipe at Banerjee's earlier statement in which she claimed that West Bengal is peaceful and there is no violence, Dhankhar said, "I expect the state government to engage in soul searching, address grim ground reality and book the culprits who have chosen to tarnish our democratic fabric."Clashes were reported from several places in Bengal following the declaration of assembly election results on May 2. In the recently concluded assembly elections, Trinamool Congress secured a thumping majority by securing 213 of the 292 assembly seats.However, Banerjee herself lost from Nandigram, a hotbed of Bengal politics. She was defeated by TMC's former leader and now in Bharatiya Janata Party, Suvendu Adhikari.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/soulsearching-needed-says-governor-after-mamata-claims-bengal-is-peaceful-101620635637213.html

Highlighting the fact that Congress failed to dislodge the incumbent governments in Kerala and Assam, and drew a complete blank in West Bengal, Gandhi said that she will set up a small group to "candidly understand" the underlying causes behind the party's dismal performance. "These will yield uncomfortable lessons, but if we do not look the facts in the face, we will not draw the right lessons," she said in a CWC meeting.The crucial meeting of the Congress Working Committee (CWC) was convened to deliberate and introspect on the party's performance in the latest elections. The Congress fared poorly, drawing a blank in West Bengal and failing to win back power in Kerala and Assam, besides losing Puducherry. The party only came to power with the help of its ally -- the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) -- in Tamil Nadu. "To say that we are deeply disappointed is to make an understatement," Sonia Gandhi noted while addressing the crucial meeting of the top Congress body.The Congress chief also raised the matter of electing a new party president. "When we met on January 22, we had decided that the process for electing a Congress president would be completed by end-June. The election authority chairperson, Mr. Madhusudan Mistri, has prepared a schedule. Mr. Venugopal will read it out to you after our discussion on Covid-19 and the election results," she said.The chief ministers of the grand old party were invited to speak first on the Covid-19 situation. Following their address, general secretaries for the aforementioned states -- Jitender Singh for Assam, Tariq Anwar for Kerala, Dinesh Gundurao (in-charge of Tamil Nadu and Puducherry), and Jitin Prasada for West Bengal - were then invited to make their presentations."I expect them to brief us very frankly on our performance in their respective states. We want them to tell us why we performed well below expectation.

The world's largest Covid-19 care centre admitted patients referred by 11 hospitals in Delhi, including All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Safdarjung, Medanta and Max Hospital.The facility is 1,700 feet long, 700 feet wide and has 200 enclosures with 50 beds each. Today, the facility has grown into a 500-bed centre with oxygen support for patients suffering from Covid-19.During the first wave of the pandemic, between June and February 2021, the SPCCC admitted 12,057 patients and treated them under its care. By the time the centre was shut, in late February, when cases started dipping, as many as 11,657 people were cured of the virus and discharged, while 338 patients were referred to other hospitals.While the Delhi government provides administrative support, the ITBP is operating the centre with volunteers from the religious sect of Radha Soami Beas, who help them in its day-to-day functioning.Their volunteers have been working round-the-clock and tirelessly to provide free meals to not just the patients but also the doctors, paramedics, healthcare workers, ITBP personnel at the facility and the frontline workers.“On a daily basis 250 volunteers are preparing four meals a day – from Karra early in the morning, to breakfast, lunch, the evening tea and dinner – for every soul inside the Covid care centre,” said an office-bearer of the Radha Soami Satsang Beas in Chhatarpur on Monday.Between March and August 2020, the organisation had sent 135,000 food packets for Covid-19 patients and their caregivers, he informed, adding that the Satsang runs on charity and donations by individuals.ITBP once again proactively formulated its Covid-19 management strategies and under the guidance of ITBP director general SS Deswal took additional steps to contain the situation and help the healthcare system fight with the second wave of the deadly infection in the country.The Chhawla camp started functioning as a major covid care arrangement for ITBP in the national capital region on April 14. It initially began with 50 beds, some with oxygen support. The serving and retired ITBP personnel, their family members and persons from other CAPFs, CPOs and other sister organisations are being treated at the facility.Till Sunday, this centre had admitted 147 patients out of which 75 were discharged after treatment while at least 59 patients are under treatment at the moment.When the second wave of the coronavirus struck the country, the ITBP pressed into action and reopened the Chhatarpur centre on April 22 this year with 500 oxygenated beds. Till Monday, the Chhatarpur centre admitted 1,037 patients and discharged 504 of them.This centre is proving to be a great relief to the Delhi Covid19 patient care management which is providing uninterrupted oxygen to the patients and treating them with all possible medical aid.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/from-himvir-to-corona-warrriors-itbp-shows-the-way-101620631815984.html

10-05-2021||India||Covid-19 cases dip from peak, calls for shutdown rise||Calls grew for India to impose a nationwide lockdown as new coronavirus cases and deaths held close to record highs on Monday, increasing pressure on the government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi.The 366,161 new infections and 3,754 deaths reported by the health ministry were off a little from recent peaks, taking India's tally to 22.66 million with 246,116 deaths. As many hospitals grapple with an acute shortage of oxygen and beds while morgues and crematoriums overflow, experts have said India's actual figures could be far higher than reported.Sunday's 1.47 million tests for Covid-19 were this month's lowest yet, data from the state-run Indian Council of Medical Research showed. The figure compared with a daily average of 1.7 million for the first eight days of May.The number of positive results from the tests was not immediately clear, however.Many states have imposed strict lockdowns over the last month while others have placed curbs on movement and shut cinemas, restaurants, pubs and shopping malls.But pressure is mounting on Modi to announce a nationwide lockdown as he did during the first wave of infections last year.He is battling criticism for allowing huge gatherings at a religious festival and holding large election rallies during the past two months even as cases surged."A failure of governance of epic and historic proportions," Vipin Narang, a political science professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in the United States, said on Twitter.Sonia Gandhi, the chief of the main opposition Congress party, blamed the government for abdicating its responsibility by leaving vaccinations to states, Reuters partner ANI said on Twitter.Delhi's health minister said the city was running out of vaccines, with just three to four days of supplies remaining of AstraZeneca's vaccine, made by the Serum Institute of India and branded Covishield, the NDTV news channel reported.By Sunday, the world's largest vaccine-producing nation had fully vaccinated just over 34.3 million, or only 2.5%, of its population of about 1.35 billion, government data shows. SHUT DOWN NEEDEDOn Sunday, top White House coronavirus adviser Dr. Anthony Fauci said he had advised Indian authorities they needed to shut down."You’ve got to shut down," Fauci said on ABC's "This Week" television show. "I believe several of the Indian states have already done that, but you need to break the chain of transmission. And one of the ways to do that is to shut down."The Indian Medical Association (IMA) has also called for a "complete, well-planned, pre-announced" lockdown.New Delhi, the capital, entered a fourth week of lockdown, with tougher curbs such as the shutdown of the suburban rail network, while residents scrambled for scarce hospital beds and oxygen supplies."This is not the time to be lenient," Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal said on Sunday."This phase is so tough, this wave is so dangerous, so many people are dying...the priority at this hour is to save lives," he said in a televised address.Late on Sunday, the northern state of Uttarakhand said it would impose curfew from Tuesday until May 18, just days after mass religious gatherings held in the state became virus super spreading events.Shops selling essential food items will stay open for some hours in the morning, while malls, gyms, theatres, bars and liquor shops are among the enterprises that will be shut, the government said.Measures announced by India's central bank last week for relief to lenders and borrowers during the new devastating wave of infections will only delay the stress for financial institutions, Fitch Ratings said.Fitch said disruptions could persist longer and spread further than its baseline case scenario, especially in case of more regional lockdowns or one nationwide, adding that a drop in April-May activity would delay recovery.Organisers of the popular and lucrative Indian Premier League (IPL) cricket tournament conceded the remaining games would have to be played overseas after having suspended the contest over the virus this month.Global support, in the form of oxygen cylinders and concentrators, ventilators and other medical gear, has poured in.On Monday, U.S. company Eli Lilly and Co said it signed licensing deals with Indian drugmakers, such as Cipla Ltd, Lupin and Sun Pharma to make and sell its arthritis drug baricitinib for the treatment of Covid-19 patients.India's drug regulator has approved the drug for restricted emergency use in combination with remdesivir for hospitalised adult sufferers requiring oxygen.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid19-cases-dip-from-peak-calls-for-shutdown-rise-101620630466239.html
10-05-2021||India||Outpouring of support from US for India, Covid-19 help touches USD half a billion||Less than a fortnight after President Joe Biden in his conversation with Prime Minister Narendra Modi pledged his country’s steadfast support for the people of India, America has responded with an unprecedented financial assistance worth nearly USD half a billion.Biden spoke at length with Modi last month and conveyed solidarity with India in its fight against the viral disease. He assured the prime minister that the US and India will work closely together in the fight against Covid-19."Just as India sent assistance to the United States as our hospitals were strained early in the pandemic, we are determined to help India in its time of need," Biden had said in a tweet.Reflecting an overwhelming support for a "natural ally", the entire country not only the administration, but also the corporate sector which created a global task force, as well as Americans and Indian-Americans have opened their coffers for India.This half a billion dollars includes USD 100 million pledged by the Biden administration, USD 70 million by pharma major Pfizer and 450,000 Remdesivir doses, the governmental purchase price of each of which in the US is USD 390.Thousands of oxygen concentrators and plane loads of life saving drugs and health care equipment are flying off the United States for India almost every day.Several companies like Boeing and Mastercard have announced financial assistance worth USD 10 million each, Google has pledged USD 18 million, which the Global Task Force that comprises CEOs of top American companies have already pledged USD 30 million worth of life saving equipment.Describing it as a “Berlin Life Moment”, Mukesh Aghi of US India Strategic and Partnership Forum (USISPF), told PTI he expects the assistance to touch almost USD 1 billion by the end of the month. “It is emotional for the diaspora, almost everyone has someone who has been touched by COVID-19,” he said.Nisha Desai Biswal, president of US India Business Council (USIBC) said, “The outpouring of support from the United States over the past two weeks was a spontaneous mass mobilisation of support for the Indian people from across the America government, business community and diaspora community and the American people.”“It is unprecedented, and it reflects both the deep bonds between our two countries and the gratitude that Americans feel for the role India played in supporting the United States when we were experiencing our COVID surge last year,” she said.However, given the “speed and severity” that have overwhelmed the capacity of hospitals and local authorities, more assistance will be needed and for a sustained period of timescale of the pandemic, Biswal said.People of the country and the Diaspora too have come out in large numbers. Indian-American Vinod Khosla has committed USD 10 million, top corporate leader John T Chambers has promised USD 1 million.For the first time in its history, Sewa International has raised USD 15 million; American Association of Physicians of Indian Origin (AAPI) (USD 3.6 million), Indiaspora (USD 2.5) million and Jai Shetty has raised USD 4 million.“There has been overwhelming support and offers of assistance from the US Government, private sector, diaspora and the American public at large. In fact, in my interactions in recent days, the US interlocutors across the board ask me, ‘tell us what more we can do for India’”, India’s ambassador to the US Taranjit Singh Sandhu told PTI.“They recall with fondness the help India gave. These are reflective of strong partnership and close people to people ties between our both nations. We deeply appreciate these gestures. We will continue to engage with the US in our collective fight against the pandemic,” he said.Among other major financial contributions announced include Procter and Gamble (USD 6.7 million); Merck (USD 5 million), Walmart (USD 2 million), Salesforce (USD 2.4 million), and Caterpillar (USD 3.4 million). Companies like Deloittee have announced to 12,000 oxygen concentrators to India.While Microsoft is partnering with the US government in providing aid and oxygen, FedEx and UPS have taken up the mantle of taking care of the transportation of life saving health care equipment like oxygen cylinders, ventilators and oxygen concentrators to India.On Sunday, Indian-Americans from Tamil Nadu including eminent philanthropist M R Rangaswami, held a “Help Tamil Nadu Breathe” to raise USD 1.5 million in few hours.“This is an incredible outpouring of generosity, which people have come to expect from America. When the world has a crisis, beyond politics, beyond dispute America steps up,” Rangaswami said.“It is comforting to see US cargo jets with much needed medical supplies landing at the Delhi airport regularly,” said Karun Rishi, president of the USA-India Chambers of Commerce.Noting that the stakes are very high for the entire world, he said India’s success or failure to come out of this once in a century crisis will have a direct impact throughout the world.Echoing Biswal, Rishi said that more needs to be done.“The scale of assistance to India needs to increase and speeded up. To make some reasonable impact to tide over this crisis, India may need between USD 25-USD 50 billion in assistance in the form of vaccines, technology transfer, increasing vaccines and therapeutics manufacturing capacity, medical equipment and public health measures,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/outpouring-of-support-from-us-for-india-covid-help-touches-usd-half-a-billion-101620627988812.html
10-05-2021||India||Natasha Narwal, jailed anti-CAA activist, granted interim bail after father dies of Covid-19||Jailed Pinjra Tod activist Natasha Narwal was granted a three-week interim bail by the Delhi high court on Monday to conduct the last rites of her father, Mahavir Narwal, who passed away of coronavirus disease (Covid-19) a day ago.

It was noted that the hospital, where Mahavir Narwal breathed his last at 6pm last evening, has kept the body, waiting for Natasha to return and receive the same. There is no one else in the family to perform the last rites and cremation, the court noted, highlighting that Natasha's brother Aakash is in isolation himself."In view of the circumstances elaborated here, and in the interest of justice, we are of the view that the release of the applicant is imperative in this hour of grief and personal loss and in the facts and circumstances of the case," the Delhi high court bench noted.The Delhi police did not resist the bail plea. However, Natasha has been directed to furnish a personal bond in the sum of ₹50,000 to the satisfaction of the jail superintendent and her phone number to the SHO special cell of the Delhi Police and the Rohtak Police, under whose jurisdiction the last rites of Mahavir Narwal are to be performed.Moreover, Natasha Narwal was also asked not to "tweet anything" and to maintain radio silence for the duration of her interim relief.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/natasha-narwal-jailed-activist-granted-interim-bail-after-father-dies-of-covid-101620628079392.html

Gagandeep Singh Bedi’s transfer is among the first bureaucratic reshuffle after the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) formed the new government. Bedi took charge on Sunday and will now be spearheading the Covid-19 control in Chennai which has the highest caseload in the state. When asked about his immediate focus, he said it would be to break the Covid chain in the city. “Our immediate and broad focus is to reduce the positivity rate,” he said. “We want to ensure good coordination between the local body and health department so that we make more oxygen beds available for people. Of course, we will follow other developments, but our first focus is tackling Covid.”Also Read | TN government urges industries to produce medical oxygen under CSR schemeBedi has been associated with disaster management. He is known for his work as collector of Cuddalore district that was ravaged after the Tsunami in 2004. He was also Cuddalore district monitoring officer for Covid-19. In the transfer order, Chief Secretary Irai Anbu said Bedi’s post will be equivalent in status and responsibilities to the cadre post of principal secretary-cum-commissioner.Prakash’s new posting is yet to be announced. He took over as civic chief in February 2019. Prakash and his team of young deputy commissioners from the health and revenue department are known for their work during the pandemic. They increased testing, introduced volunteers to help those in quarantine and put in place a system that has been brought back to address the second wave. Besides, Covid-19, under Prakash’s tenure, solid waste management was decentralised, and a new private operator was given the contract. The pedestrian plaza, which had been in the pipeline for several years, was completed last year. Since urban local body elections haven’t been conducted in the state since 2017, there is no elected council so Bedi also becomes de-facto special officer for the corporation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/focus-on-reducing-covid-positivity-rate-chennai-s-new-corporation-chief-101620623417521.html

They've got to get their resources, not only from within, but also from without."Calling for global cooperation, Fauci said, other countries also "need to chip in to be able to get either supply to the Indians to make their own vaccines or to get vaccines donated."Alos Read | ‘No doubt’ US has undercounted its Covid-19 deaths: Anthony FauciIndia is struggling with an unprecedented second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic with more than 400,000 cases being registered daily in the past few days.

He is currently serving as the director of the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.Speaking further on India's Covid-19 situation, Fauci said big companies should scale up manufacturing of Covid-19 vaccines in a way that India gets "literally hundreds of millions of doses."Speaking on ways that India can tackle the raging second wave of Covid-19 in which the daily number of covid-19 cases has soared as high as 400,000, Fauci said India should build makeshift hospitals like what China did a year ago. "You've got to get that. You can't have people out in the street not having a hospital bed," said the chief medical adviser to US President Joe Biden in an interview with ABC News.Calling India's situation "tragic" and said, "the oxygen situation is something that was really critical. I mean, to have people not have oxygen is really tragic."Further speaking, Fauci underlined the need for a countrywide lockdown to curb the spread of Covid-19. On May 1 as well, Fauci called for a complete lockdown as an immediate step to break the chain of transmission in the country."You've got to shut down. I believe several of the Indian states have already done that, but you need to break the chain of transmission. And one of the ways to do that is to shut down," said Fauci on Sunday.As of Sunday morning, that country has a caseload of 22,662,575 and the death toll stood at 246,116. After the United States, India is the second worst-hit country by the Covid-19 in terms of confirmed cases. It is followed by Brazil at three, France at four and Turkey at fifth number.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/vaccination-only-long-term-solution-for-india-s-worsening-covid-crisis-dr-fauci-101620622709120.html

10-05-2021||India||Greenpiece: The need to focus on indoor air||Irrespective of economic background, it is high time people start thinking about indoor air quality, because we spend so much time indoors now. We focus on outdoor air, but forget how toxic indoor air is-even in a fancy home. Why breathe in all that pollution?In most homes, people burn agarbattis or camphor. Both these intensify pollution with health impact. We think they purify the air -- a cultural construct. Today, science is telling us to stop it.Many people have taken to rugs all over their home. It’s a great dust vault. And dust is nothing but collection of chemical particles, many very toxic. We breathe those too.Sometimes, we use electric mosquito repellents-the particles stay on. Wood polish, some PVC materials and many other products might harm us silently. When we spend more time at home, we are increasing our exposure, and that of our children. Many use solid fuels, the source of some of the deadliest air pollution. Most of this impacts women and infants, reducing their live span.With working from home being the new normal, more people will have to spend time inside. If we want to protect ourselves, we must clean up the air inside. Some of this we can do ourselves.But we also need standards and government oversight around indoor products. We need an aggressive campaign for an urbanized Ujjwala model of clean fuel for the poor. But first of all, we must agree that indoor air pollution is also a big problem.(The writer is the founder and director of the Chintan Environmental Research and Action Group)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/greenpiece-the-need-to-focus-on-indoor-air-101620605506241.html

The development comes as the case tally in India surged to 22,662,092, with 366,528 new cases being reported on Sunday.Addressing a meeting to review the Covid-19 situation in the state, Rajasthan chief minister Ashok Gehlot stressed on the need to accelerate the pace of the vaccination drive to arrest the spread of the virus and reduce the fatality rate. “The state will consider importing Covid-19 vaccine to ensure that the residents of Rajasthan are vaccinated at the earliest,” he said at the meeting held on Saturday.Rajasthan recorded 17,921 Covid-19 cases and 159 deaths on Sunday that pushed the infection tally to 756,707 and toll to 5,665, according to the HT dashboard.Over 13.9 million people, including around 275,000 between 18 and 44 years, have received the first and second dose of the vaccines in Rajasthan so far. The state, which has a population of around 7.50 crore, requires additional 6.50 crore vaccines (for the first dose).Also read | 1.8mn in 18-44 yrs age group have received first jab, says govt dataThe Maharashtra government, too, has started talks with foreign vaccine manufacturers to boost the speed of the inoculation drive in the 18-44 category. However, clearances from the Centre continue to remain a hurdle for the government to procure stock from outside the country, said officials.On Sunday, state health minister Rajesh Tope said:. “Currently our vaccination drive is going on at a slow pace because vaccines are not being made available. Chief minister has clearly said that Maharashtra has the potential to purchase 120 million doses in one go, but availability is the main issue. The Centre must intervene in this matter and make vaccine doses available for Maharashtra. The vaccination of 18-44 category is crucial as the age group steps out of their homes. If the government gives permission, we can procure Sputnik or other foreign vaccines for the citizens of our state. There are several approvals needed from Centre,” Tope said.Tope earlier revealed that the state government is currently in talks with the Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF), Russia’s sovereign wealth fund that helped finance vaccine Sputnik V, to purchase doses. “We are trying to get the stock available with them,” Tope said on May 7.Maharashtra recorded 572 Covid-19 fatalities and 48,401 fresh cases on Sunday that pushed the death toll to 75,849 and the infection tally to 5,101,737, according to the HT dashboard.

The four labour codes already passed by Parliament, and the national jobs and social economic survey results were expected to be the base of such a policy.“We have put the four surveys on hold as the surging covid-19 makes it almost impossible to do the household surveys,” said DPS Negi, director-general of labour bureau.“We are talking to our expert committee on how to incorporate the new realities in these surveys. It’s a difficult situation, and sending our field workers to houses and offices will have a huge implication on their health and well-being. Second, no one will entertain surveyors at their homes during a second wave,” said Negi, who is also the chief labour commissioner (central).Also read | India Inc’s wait to vaccinate staff gets longerAccording to the Union labour ministry, the migrants’ survey will be the first such study of “the socioeconomic and working conditions of migrant workers” and shall “also assess the impact of Covid-19 on migrant workers”.The survey of domestic workers expects to capture the socio-economic condition, the job preference and impact of the pandemic on their economic status.While the transport sector survey was supposed to capture the jobs created by the industry, including by taxi aggregators, the one on professionals was supposed to capture the employment generation and potential of tens of thousands of professionals, including advocates, doctors and chartered accountants.The surveys were supposed to be released by November. On March 31, labour minister Santosh Gangwar said the surveys will “generate highly useful data for effective policymaking in the field of labour and employment”.The study of the labour market, including gig workers, will help the government formulate a comprehensive employment policy for both formal and informal segments and design social security and welfare measures. Besides, there has been a growing demand for a national policy on employment to formalize the large informal sector, implement social security for unorganised workers, and formulate welfare schemes for low-income households.Negi said the labour bureau is hopeful of restarting the process in a couple of months once the situation improves, allowing them to resume fieldwork. The surveys are crucial as they could provide a holistic picture of the employment market and the socioeconomic condition of migrants and other informal workers, who have drawn global attention following the massive reverse migration and job losses they faced after the national lockdown of 2020.The first wave of the Covid-19 pandemic pushed an estimated 230 million Indians to poverty, according to a survey by Azim Premji University. The survey suggested authorities focus on rural jobs and direct cash transfer to the poor. The second wave has, however, further strained the labour market. According to the Centre for Monitoring India Economy, at least 7.35 million jobs were lost in April, including some 2.84 million salaried jobs in rural India.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/government-suspends-key-nationwide-surveys-amid-raging-covid-19-2nd-wave-101620602602749.html

10-05-2021||India||Covid-19: What you need to know today||I’ve mostly worked from office since March 2020, apart from a few weeks last April (and, of course, apart from Wednesdays when I work on the best weekend section across newspapers in India, HT Wknd, and prefer to do so from home). I kept the AC off in my room in the office; wore two masks; used a sanitiser as often as I could (I used to do this even before the pandemic, especially after shaking hands, even if the person with whom I’d shaken hands was still in the room); avoided crowded conference rooms (even in January and February when everyone else seemed to think they were fine); and showered the minute I returned home. I must have taken an RT-PCR test more than a few times — once to travel, another time to meet with and interview the finance minister, and the rest of the times to make sure I was not infected after contact with someone who went on to test Covid-positive. I was careful. I knew the science.But I also knew that the probability was always against me.On the night of April 17, a Saturday, I was working in the study when I realised I’d left something I needed in the bedroom upstairs — and I found that I just couldn’t walk up the stairs.The next morning, I woke up with fever, and isolated immediately. But I could smell, my throat was fine, and I wasn’t experiencing any difficulty breathing.Monday was worse, but I managed to get tested — a technician came home and took a sample. It was a bad time to fall ill. Maybe it was because my fever was rising, but I remember that as the day when things started going south in Delhi and some other parts of India. Through the day, I received calls from people seeking help. We (it was mostly my colleagues) managed to help some; for others, we could do nothing. The calls continued through the night as my fever continued to rise (despite double strength Tylenol). When I last checked it just before dropping off, it was close to 103 degrees.On Tuesday, when I woke up, I realised I’d lost my sense of smell. By then, I’d acquired a cough (a wet one, strangely enough, but this is not entirely unknown among Covid patients). The results, which came in a few hours later, confirmed that I was indeed Covid-positive. A colleague put me in touch with a doctor for a virtual consultation. He recommended a blood test (to check base levels, so that a subsequent test could highlight so-called inflammatory markers that would guide the course of treatment). I had anticipated this and already booked a test with a lab (they assured me a phlebotomist would come by later that evening to draw a sample).The doctor also sent me a prescription on WhatsApp; the company doctor reviewed the prescription and said he’d feel more comfortable if I took a dose of steroids in addition. The medicines were not available in my neighbourhood, but another colleague found them for me (in Faridabad). Eventually, I chose to have favipiravir (a drug found effective in China in early 2020, but which subsequent tests found largely ineffective; I decided to take it because it is an antiviral that is believed to act against a wide variety of RNA viruses, and the one that causes Covid-19 is an RNA virus), the antibiotics (I did have a very bad throat, the kind for which my GP loves prescribing antibiotics, although I know this isn’t good practice), the fever medication, and the vitamins (which couldn’t hurt). I skipped the ivermectin (I know this doesn’t work at all) and the steroids.By Wednesday, my fever was below 100 and my throat felt a little better. Calls from people seeking help — the utter sense of despair from hearing grown men cry on the phone, amplified by one’s own inability to help — continued through the day; Delhi was short of tests, medicines, oxygen, hospital beds, and ventilators. People wanted help with remdesivir and plasma. Both were being prescribed indiscriminately by doctors. The first works only in early stages of infection , and on people who need supplemental oxygen (not mechanical ventilation). The second doesn’t work, usually — it is next to impossible to find plasma with the required concentration of antibodies. Oxygen, of course, helped, but there wasn’t enough of it to be had in Delhi. The few people I’d helped find hospital beds, for themselves and theirs, sent back messages: some were better, others had passed on to the great beyond.I was lucky. The fact that I had taken a first dose of the vaccine, I believe, helped me (I cannot take the second dose for at least two months now). I continued to write this column through my brief illness, but I did little else. By Friday, the fever had broken. By Monday, I was back at work (although I was still in isolation in my study).My blood oxygen level never went below 98 the entire time. The two blood tests I took, a week apart (Day 1 and Day 8), came back with normal and almost identical readings.Three weeks on, I am almost back to normal, although I am still very tired, and have persistent body ache and joint pain. But I plan to resume running sometime this week.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid19what-you-need-to-know-today-101620594650261.html

10-05-2021||India||Himanta Biswa Sarma’s political acumen, oratory played key role in BJP’s Assam win||Ever since he joined the Tarun Gogoi-led Congress government in 2001 as a minister of state after his first electoral victory, Himanta Biswa Sarma had always been seen by many as someone who would reach the chief minister’s chair in due course. On Sunday, that expectation came true as Sarma pipped incumbent Sarbananda Sonowal to be unanimously selected as the legislature party leader of BJP, which secured 60 seats in the recently concluded assembly polls to return to power in Assam for a second consecutive term. As a seasoned politician, Sarma never made his ambitions for the top post public. But ever since he quit the Congress cabinet of Gogoi in 2015 after differences with the CM promoting his son Gaurav, the perception was strong that he joined the BJP in order to fulfil his political goals. Sonowal led the BJP to an electoral victory, but the high command had to give the CM’s chair to Sarma as he was the one who galvanized mass support for the party and also had the support of two-third of the new BJP legislators. The 52-year-old has been a key figure in Assam politics for two decades now. But Sarma, who joined the BJP six years ago, has had a meteoric rise in the saffron party and his influence is not restricted to Assam but seen across the region. Sarma’s political acumen and oratory played a key role in BJP winning 60 of the total 126 seats in 2016 and forming the party’s first government in Assam with alliance partners Asom Gana Parishad and Bodoland Peoples’ Front. Despite being new to the party, Sarma was given four crucial departments-health, education, finance and public works-in the Sonowal cabinet. As convener of North East Democratic Alliance (NEDA), a BJP-led front of anti-Congress parties in northeast, Sarma shares a close rapport with senior politicians in all seven states of the region. His role was crucial in BJP forming governments in Arunachal Pradesh, Manipur and Tripura and becoming part of the ruling coalition in Nagaland and Meghalaya. Sarma hasn’t had a clean slate and there were accusations about his involvement in the Louis Berger scam and the Sharada Group ponzi scheme. But he has been able to override them and play a key role in the BJP, a party that once targeted him on the accusations. Over the past five years, Sarma has made a mark beyond the region and become a known face across the country---a rarity for politicians from the northeast. He is consulted by the BJP leadership for any issue concerning Assam and the region and most often than not his suggestions are accepted. Due to his position in the Assam cabinet and in NEDA, Sarma’s stature grew to such extent that he was sometimes mistaken by some from outside the region as the CM instead of Sonowal. An astute politician, Sarma had never tried to compete with Sonowal for the top post and there is a cordial relationship between the two, at least in public. In 2019 ahead of the general elections, Sarma had indicated his intentions to leave state politics and shift base to New Delhi where he could play a bigger role. But the BJP leadership decided against it. However, in a rare gesture, then BJP president Amit Shah issued a statement that the party needed Sarma’s services in the poll campaign in northeast and could not afford to have him restricted to just one seat. Sarma has been representing the Jalukbari seat continuously since 2001 and this time too that party gave him ticket from the seat. With the BJP high command not projecting a CM face for this election, rumours were abound that Sarma could be given that role. Sarma has been the brain behind most of the social welfare schemes on the Sonowal government like ₹830 per month to 2.2 million households, cash incentives and grants to various sections of society. But his role as health minister in the past year, when he supervised setting up of large Covid care centres, boosting infrastructure at hospitals and personally visiting quarantine centres to keep tab on care being provided to those infected have earned him headlines as well as admiration even from his critics. For this election, Sarma specifically targeted the Congress and its alliance partner All India United Democratic Front (AIUDF), the two main opposition parties in Assam which formed a grand alliance along with former BJP ally Bodoland Peoples Front. Terming AIUDF as an important factor in this election, Sarma has accused its chief, perfume baron and Lok Sabha MP Badruddin Ajmal, as being the enemy of Assam and Assamese culture. He has openly stated that BJP doesn’t need votes of ‘Miyas’ (Bengali speaking Muslims from erstwhile East Pakistan). Besides politics and governance, Sarma is interested in sports and is an author. He has penned four books till date, the latest released in February ahead of the assembly polls. He is the president of Badminton Association of India (BAI). Sarma’s wife Riniki Bhuyan Sarma is the chairperson and managing director of Pride East Entertainment that owns several TV channels, a daily newspaper and magazine. The couple has a son and daughter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/himanta-biswa-sarma-s-political-acumen-oratory-played-key-role-in-bjp-s-assam-win-101620590415383.html
10-05-2021||India||As jabs arrive, Karnataka set to vaccinate 18+ from today||The Karnataka government on Sunday said that it would open up vaccination for people between the age groups of 18-44 from Monday in public hospitals and medical college hospitals after it received fresh stocks. “Starting Monday, Covid-19 vaccination will be provided for citizens aged between 18 and 44 years at K C General Hospital, Jayanagar General Hospital, Sir C V Raman General Hospital, Government Medical Colleges, ESI Hospitals and NIMHANS in Bengaluru,” K Sudhakar, Karnataka’s minister for health, family welfare and medical education said in a statement. The number of vaccination centres would be increased as and when more vaccines are available, the minister added. All such centres providing vaccination for the 18-44 age group would have an exclusive session site earmarked for them, he said,adding the shots would be given only to those who have registered and scheduled an appointment on the Co-Win portal.The announcement comes at a time when vaccine shortages continue to haunt the southern state and its capital, Bengaluru, that remain firmly under the grip of the Covid-19 pandemic.“In the order placed by Karnataka Govt to procure 20 million doses of Covishield, we received 3.5 lakh (three and a half thousand doses) on Saturday night taking the total delivery to 6.5 lakh (six and half thousand doses). So far, GoI has supplied 1,10,49,470 doses including 99,58,190 doses of Covishield & 10,91,280 doses of Covaxin,” Sudhakar said in a post on Twitter.Karnataka has seen a shortage of vaccines in recent days that has impacted its vaccination drive, which is its biggest strategy to contain the Covid surge in the state.Though Karnataka had opened vaccination to persons between 18-44 on May 1, it was more symbolic than operational due to the shortage of vaccines in the state.According to government estimates, there are around 30.26 million persons in the state between 18-44 and to vaccinate all of them with both doses, it would require 60.52 million doses.“In order to fulfill this requirement (the) state government has already placed orders for 20 million doses of Covishield and 10 million doses of Covaxin. Serum Institute which manufactures Covishield has already supplied six and half thousand doses of vaccine. More consignments will be delivered by May second or third week,” Sudhakar said on Sunday. Vaccine shortages have been reported across India’s IT capital and other districts of the state with “no vaccine” boards dangling outside major hospitals in Bengaluru.Karnataka has so far vaccinated 10,521,773 persons. However, only 20,46,015 out of this have received both doses, according to government data, which makes it less than 5% of the state’s population of around 60.5 million.The daily vaccination numbers have also shown a sharp decline with the shortages as only 32,590 were vaccinated on on Sunday till 3.30pm, according to the daily bulletin of the state health department, which is just over 10% of the state’s own target to inoculate around 300,000 persons per day.Bengaluru recorded 20,897 new infections in the 24 hours on Sunday that takes its active case count to 350,370. Meanwhile, the other districts of Karnataka continue to see a surge and the state recorded 47,930 new infections that takes the active caseload to 5,64,485, one of the highest in the country. Bengaluru accounted for 280 out of the 490 fatalities, according to the daily bulletin of the health department.Private hospitals, barring Manipal and Apollo, have run out of stock ever since the Yediyurappa-led government asked them to procure vaccines on their own from May 1 and even took back stocks, according to multiple persons aware of the developments. The state has so far inoculated only 10,627 persons between 18-44 years of age.The shortage of vaccines has also added to the challenges of the BS Yediyurappa-led state government that is accused of neglecting warnings by a government appointed- technical advisory committee (TAC) in November about the imminent second wave of infections and required preparedness to tackle the same.With the health infrastructure collapsing in Bengaluru and other parts of the state and country, government’s are banking on vaccination to reduce the chance of hospitalisation and severity for those infected by Covid-19.“#LargestVaccineDrive . GoI has so far provided 17.56 Crore(175 million)+ #COVID19Vaccine doses to States & UTs for free. 72 Lakh (7.2 million) + doses are still available in stock with them. 46 Lakh(4.6 million)+ doses to be sent to States/UTs in the next 3 days,” Dr Harsh Vardhan, union minister for health & family welfare, science & tech, earth sciences, said in a post on Twitter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/as-jabs-arrive-karnataka-set-to-vaccinate-18-from-today-101620587654653.html
10-05-2021||India||Online campaign in B’luru takes on ‘hate politics’||A select group of individuals in Bengaluru on Sunday launched a social media campaign to smother out any politics or fueling of hate during the pandemic and instead focus on providing aid and relief. The campaign #NammooraEllaruNammavaru (everyone in our city is our people), which has seen a significant amount of response online, is being used even by legislators with hashtags like #HatespeechbeDa (no hate speech), which was posted on Twitter on Sunday by Sowmya Reddy, the Congress legislator from Jayanagar assembly constituency. The campaign kicks off days after Bengaluru South member of parliament, Tejasvi Surya and at least three other legislators from the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)--Satish Reddy, Ravi Subramanya and Uday Garudachar--barged into the war room in the south zone and made communally provocative comments against Muslims working there. Though Surya claimed to have entered the war room to expose a huge “bribe for bed scam”, the entire episode was alleged to have a communal twist as the BJP MP named 16 Muslims working in the facility. Subramanya, also Tejaswi’s uncle, questioned if the war room was a “madarasa”. “We are working together without looking at caste creed, oxygen, bed booking, cremation, food. Politicians are trying to fuel hate. We do not want hate, we want oxygen. We do not want dirty politics, we want hospital beds,” Vinay Sreenivasa, advocate and activist said on Sunday. A twitter handle called @BlrForLove was also created as a platform to get the government to focus more on finding solutions for the raging pandemic than deflecting away from it. Bengaluru is showing signs of plateauing as it registered 20897 new infections in the 24 hours on Sunday that takes its active case count to 350,370. Meanwhile, the other districts of Karnataka continue to see a surge and the state recorded 47,930 new infections that takes the active caseload to 564,485, one of the highest in the country. Bengaluru accounted for 280 out of the 490 fatalities, according to the daily bulletin of the health department on Sunday. Social media has played an active role in the ongoing Covid-19 second wave as it has become the most used platform to highlight the plight of patients, seek help or make public any apathy on the administration’s part. With most of Bengaluru’s hospital beds full, relatives of coronavirus (Covid-19) infected persons have used social media platforms to seek help in securing beds, oxygen, medicines and even ambulances to ferry the dead. For those seeking oxygen, there is also a twitter handle, @oxygenblr where verified information about oxygen supplies in Bengaluru is posted on a regular basis.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/online-campaign-in-b-luru-takes-on-hate-politics-101620587595742.html
10-05-2021||India||A week after poll results, Assam gets a new CM; Sarma pips Sonowal to top post||Ending a week-long suspense and speculations, Himanta Biswa Sarma was named on Sunday as the next chief minister of Assam, pipping incumbent Sarbananda Sonowal to the top post. The decision was taken at the first legislature party meeting of the 60 newly elected MLAs of Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) held at the state assembly after days of backroom lobbying in Guwahati and official meetings in Delhi following announcement of results of the assembly election on May 2. Sarma’s name as BJP’s legislature party leader was announced by Union agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar who along with party’s national general secretary Arun Singh, were the central observers for the meeting. Sarma’s name for the post was proposed by Sonowal and seconded by BJP state president Ranjeet Kumar Dass. It was also supported by newly elected MLA from Halflong, Nandita Golosa. “I asked other MLAs if they had any other names in mind. No other name was suggested. Since the name of Sarma, a senior minister in our state government was the only one that was proposed, he is unanimously chosen as the legislature party leader,” Tomar told after the meeting. On Saturday, two main claimants to the top post, Sonowal and senior minister Sarma were summoned by the party leadership to Delhi where they had several rounds of meetings with BJP national president JP Nadda and others. Both leaders returned to Guwahati late on Saturday night in the same flight. BJP office bearers in the know of the developments said that the leadership decided in Sarma’s favour after the discussions. Sonowal, who was part of the first Narendra Modi government at the Centre, is likely to be accommodated in the Union cabinet again at a later date. The formality of announcing Sarma (52) as the next CM took place in the presence of Tomar and Singh. Another national general secretary BL Santosh and party in-charge for Assam Baijayant Jay Panda were also present. “With fragrance of Assam in my heart and and love of my wonderful people in my veins, I offer my deepest gratitude to you all. I would not been what I am had it not been for your pious faith in me. On this day, I vow to work with and for each one of you with greater passion,” Sarma tweeted. In the BJP legislature party meeting, Sarma praised Sonowal for proposing his name for the CM post and thanked him for giving him several important responsibilities that allowed him (Sarma) to work for the people of Assam. “I am confident Sarma will lead the state efficiently. I am also sure that with his long political expertise, in coming days he will be able to make Assam one of the leading states in India,” Sonowal said in the meeting. Both Sarma and Sonowal later went together to Raj Bhawan where the former formally staked his claim to form the next government. The oath taking ceremony will be held at noon on Monday in which few ministers from allies Asom Gana Parishad and United Peoples’ Party Liberal are also expected to be sworn in. “Many congratulations to Himanta Biswa Sarma on being elected as the next chief minister of Assam. Our only vision must be to work in tandem to make Assam one of the most developed states in India,” Assam Congress president Ripun Bora tweeted. Earlier on Sunday morning, Sonowal went to Raj Bhawan where he submitted his resignation to Governor Jagdish Mukhi before proceeding with Sarma in the same vehicle to take part in the meeting of newly elected legislators. Sunday’s development marks a major landmark in Sarma’s sharp rise within BJP, a party which he joined in 2015 after parting ways with then Congress chief minister Tarun Gogoi, in whose cabinet he was a minister for three consecutive terms since 2001. Sarma played a crucial role in BJP forming its first government in Assam in 2016 and was allotted four important ministries--finance, health, education and public works department (PWD)-in the Sonowal cabinet. As convenor of North East Democratic Alliance (NEDA), the conglomeration of anti-Congress regional parties in northeast, Sarma was also responsible for BJP forming governments in Arunachal Pradesh, Manipur and Tripura and becoming part of the ruling coalition in Nagaland and Meghalaya in the past few years. Despite criticism from some, Sarma earned mass support with the way he handled the Covid19 crisis visiting patients in hospitals, overseeing setting up of Covid care centres and ensuring proper care for those infected. He carried forward that goodwill during the assembly election campaign addressing rallies in all parts of the state and conducting road shows where thousands turned up to watch him. Sarma also exercised lot of influence in the selection of candidates and actively campaigned for most ensuring another return to power for BJP. Sources say, he enjoys support of at least 40 of the new MLAs, a big reason which tilted the balance in his favour for the CM’s post. “Sarma is the most aggressive voice of Hindutva in Assam politics. He helped in polarization of votes in this election by targeting Badruddin Ajmal’s party All India United Democratic Front (AIUDF) and Congress for their poll tie-up. Sarma was also the one who conceptualized and implemented competitive populist schemes that helped BJP reach out to all sections of voters,” said Akhil Ranjan Dutta, professor of political science in Gauhati University. “Sarma’s elevation to the CM’s post shows the BJP leadership is keeping an eye on the 2024 Lok Sabha poll. As convenor of NEDA, he would play a crucial role in BJP’s fortunes in Assam and all other states in northeast,” he added. The delay in announcement of a CM’s name and formation of the next government despite a clear mandate at a time when the state is witnessing a rapid rise in new Covid19 cases and deaths had led to criticism of BJP by opposition parties and experts. Assam assembly has a total of 126 seats.

We will have to get official confirmation of the same on Monday morning,” Shivu Nayak, the manager of Crystal Info system and services, the agency that hires the workforce for the south zone war room said.One senior official from the BBMP said that those who were under suspension were “neither government employees nor BBMP employees” and hence there was no question of hiring or reinstating them.The 16 persons were kept on hold after the allegations were levelled by the BJP leaders in full view of the war room personnel and the video of which went viral online.Subramanya, the BJP legislator from Basavanagudi in Bengaluru, was heard questioning if the war room was a “madarasa” for hiring these Muslim personnel. The incident garnered severe criticism for the communally provocative statements made by the BJP leaders.Post the incident, Surya had revisited the war room and apologised for the distress caused to the workers and even said that he would file a police complaint against those who leaked their personal numbers online, according to at least two persons aware of the developments.Surya has denied any reference to an apology. After the allegations were levelled, the police took over the case and these personnel were subjected to intense questioning even though law enforcement authorities denied that the 16 were asked to be at the station.Reddy, who accompanied Surya, has been accused of running the scam after his close aides were questioned in the case.“We have received a call that we will receive a letter stating that we can rejoin work,” said one of the 16 persons who was named in the list. He requested anonymity.Nayak said that the company runs several projects in other zones like East and Rajarajeshwarinagar as well in other organisations and the 16 persons can be placed in any one of these sites.Meanwhile, the police have continued to crackdown on people who continue to sell hospital beds in the black market as Bengaluru’s health infrastructure crumbles due to the higher number of infections.“Investigation in bed scam case had revealed irregular bed booking in 3 hospitals..enquiry of hospital staff, arogyamitra is being done..further is investigation on,” Sandeep Patil, Joint Commissioner (Crime) said on Sunday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/16-muslim-covid-warriors-likely-to-be-reinstated-101620587474714.html
10-05-2021||India||Single-use plastic resurfaces in B’luru amid pandemic||Bengaluru For well over a year now, Single Use Plastic (SUP) has made a resurgence of sorts in Bengaluru and other urban centres in India on account of the Covid- 19 pandemic, making it harder to reverse the dependence on the extremely polluting products, officials said.Though the total generation of waste in Bengaluru, one of India’s largest cities, has come down by as much as 30-40%, the proportion of SUP has seen an increase in the last one year as individual safety, hygiene, health and paranoia over fear of contracting Covid-19 has forced people to depend on products like plastic cups, cutlery, carry bags, packaged drinking water and other items that are extremely hazardous to the environment.The reduction of total waste is on account of closure of marriage halls, small hotels and other businesses that produce a large amount of bulk waste.“Since most of the factories like make irrigation pipes, cement and asphalting works are not operational, SUP is now ending up back in landfills,” said one official of the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP), requesting anonymity.The official cited above said that though the quantity of waste generated has come down to around 3000 MT per day from around 5000 MT, the proportion of SUP remains the same, if not more.He said that solid or dry waste accounts for 80% of the total waste generated in India’s IT capital, of which over 5% or around 120-150 MT is SUP. In broader terms, anything below 50 microns is considered single use, according to the All India Plastic Manufacturers Association (AIPMA), which said that the definition is dependent on the end consumer.Waste segregation remains just a slogan in Bengaluru as the sight of small neighbourhoods throwing garbage in one corner of the street is still a common sight. This, despite, innovative ideas like painting pictures of deities, cleanliness messages and even installing CCTV cameras.Most city corporations are already in a bind over the rising amount of bio-hazardous waste mixed up with regular home-generated waste such as masks, face shields and other protective gear used for safeguard against Covid-19. City corporations are already in a fix over face masks, shields, protective gear and other hazardous waste finding their way into regular piles of garbage, which enhances the risk of the infection spreading, especially for pourakarmikas or civic workers, whose demands for better safety gear remains unfulfilled.With poor recycling facilities and the Covid-19 induced lockdown that has stalled several sectors from functioning, the piling waste threatens to add to the spiralling health crisis.At least one landfill, Mavallipura, in Bengaluru has now been turned into a mass-crematorium as Covid-19 tightens its grip on India’s IT capital. The BBMP also banned SUP around five years ago and this was the highlight of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s 2019 Independence Day speech. With more e-commerce activities, plastic that comes home often ends up being discarded, officials and others said. The pressure on civic authorities has gone up many folds during the pandemic and garbage collection has not been a priority, especially in Bengaluru, which was well renowned for its waste management--or mismanagement.“If you see 2019-20 and 2020-21 figures, SUP consumption has gone up by 14-16%,” Anil Reddy, the Vice President (South) of the AIPMA told Hindustan Times.He said that a considerable amount of this SUP is used for medical purposes like making PPE kits, masks and food packets for relief efforts, medicines and industrial packaging.He, however, said that industrial packaging has come down due to slowdown and lockdown.“Almost all industries were running on maximum 40-60% capacity. Whereas SUP, which is used for medical purposes and others, have operated with 100% capacity,” he said.Manufacturers said that India’s per capita consumption of plastic is around 10.4 kgs per annum as against 18 kgs in Singapore, 22 kgs in China and 34 kgs in the USA.They said that raising awareness was more important than banning SUP.Several large retailers in the country also use SUP to sell packaged goods.Plastic manufacturers say that khullad paper bags are being portrayed as the solution, but these may be more hazardous to the environment as it is made from topsoil and wood pulp.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/singleuse-plastic-resurfaces-in-b-luru-amid-pandemic-101620587414617.html

10-05-2021||India||Rohtak: 4 linked to farm group booked for rape||Six people were booked on Sunday in connection with the rape of a 25-year-old woman from West Bengal, who later died of Covid-19 at a private hospital in Jhajjar’s Bahadurgarh, the police said.According to a complaint lodged by the victim’s father at Bahadurgarh police station, the accused worked with ‘Kisan social army’, the IT cell of farmers’ group protesting against the three central farm laws passed in September last year.“I was pressurised that if I wanted to take my daughter’s body, I would have to give a statement that she died of Covid,” the deceased’s father said in his FIR.The police have identified the accused as Anil Malik, Anup Singh, Ankush Sangwan, Jagdish Barad and two women Kavita Arya and Yogita Suhag.“The victim came to Tikri from West Bengal on April 11 to join the protest. On April 25, she was admitted to a private hospital in Bahadurgarh after her condition worsened. The doctors found infection in her lungs and she later tested positive (for Covid-19). She breathed her last in the hospital on April 30. The charges are serious against the four farm leaders and two women volunteers, who are quite active in the farm agitation,” said the SHO Vijay Kumar.The accused, meanwhile, alleged that the victim died of Covid 10 days ago and the police are trying to frame them in a fake case.“ The police are trying to defame us and we are ready to face the probe. The government is making every attempt to defame us,” one of the four accused men said.Suhag, who is among the six persons booked in the case, tweeted, “I was the whistleblower and not an accused in the sexual assault that happened at Tikri. I had raised the issue, that is why you are hearing it. Otherwise, the issue would also have been suppressed like many others.”In a press statement, the Samyukt Kisan morcha (SKM) extended their support to the victim and said asserted that they will not tolerate assault against any woman taking part in the farm agitation.“ We removed the tents and banners of the Kisan Social army four days ago when the incident came to light. This social media handle was never part of our farm agitation and we have announced their boycott. We had earlier told the woman’s family that we are standing by them in this fight,” the statement read.A special investigation team (SIT), being headed by a deputy superintendent Pawan Sharma, will further probe the entire incident, the SHO added.“ We will launch a thorough probe and investigate the case.”The police have registered a case under sections 365 (kidnapping ), 342 (Punishment for wrongful confinement), 354 (Any man who assaults or uses criminal force to any woman or abets such act with the intention of disrobing or compelling her to be naked, shall be punished with) , 376-D (gang-rape), 506(criminal intimidation), 120-B (cheating) of the Indian Penal Code.Several farmers have been protesting against the farm laws at border points of Delhi, including Tikri and Singhu, since November last year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rohtak-4-linked-to-farm-group-booked-for-rape-101620587054580.html
10-05-2021||India||TN government urges industries to produce medical oxygen under CSR scheme||The Tamil Nadu government on Sunday made an appeal to various industries in the state to produce medical oxygen under the CSR scheme, following a surge in Covid-19 infections in the state. Industries Minister Thangam Thennarasu said the government has requested JSW, Chennai Petroleum Corporation Ltd (CPCL), Tamil Nadu Newsprint and Papers Ltd (TNPL) and other entities to expedite measures towards producing medical oxygen in view of an increase in demand. Tamil Nadu on Sunday recorded an all time high of 28,897 new Covid-19 cases, pushing the caseload to 13,80,259 while 236 deaths in the last 24 hours took the toll to 15,648. Thennarasu said the state government proposed to set up a facility to accommodate 300 beds equipped with oxygen support, with the help of CPCL. "We have also asked companies like Hyundai Motor India, NLC India Ltd to take steps to produce medical oxygen," he added. To a query, he said the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) was planning to set up four oxygen plants in Tamil Nadu while NLC India was mulling establishing three. Earlier, Chief Minister M K Stalin interacted with industry leaders at a meeting and explained about the measures taken by his government to control the virus spread. He sought their cooperation for the two-week full lockdown, an official release said.

10-05-2021||India||Renowned sculptor and Rajya Sabha MP Raghunath Mohapatra succumbs to Covid-19||Renowned sculptor and Rajya Sabha MP from Odisha Raghunath Mohapatra who was planning to build a replica of the Sun Temple at Konark, on Sunday succumbed to Covid-19 at AIIMS Bhubaneswar where he was being treated for the last two weeks. Mohapatra, 78, had turned critical and was in the ICU after having tested positive for coronavirus.“Mohapatra’s condition deteriorated this afternoon and he passed away at 3.49 PM,” said AIIMS Bhubaneswar medical superintendent Sachidanand Mohanty. Mohapatra’s two sons, Prashant and Jasobant are also in a critical condition and undergoing treatment at AIIMS after testing positive for Covid-19. Prime Minister Narendra Modi earlier this week had spoken to Jasobant to inquire about their health.Leader of opposition and senior BJP leader Pradipta Naik too is in the ICU at AIIMS Bhubaneswar after testing positive for Covid-19.Condoling the death of Mohapatra, Prime Minister Narendra Modi tweeted: “Saddened by the demise of MP Shri Raghunath Mohapatra Ji. He made pioneering contributions to the world of art, architecture and culture. He will be remembered for his contributions towards popularising traditional crafts. My thoughts are with his family and admirers. Om Shanti.”Nominated to the Rajya Sabha in July 2018 for his contribution to the world of arts, Mohapatra is considered a master of stone carving who had deep knowledge of the traditional style of sculpting of Odisha temple architecture. Mohapatra’s ancestors were said to be involved in the building of the Sun Temple at Konark, a world heritage structure and the Jagannath Temple in Puri.Hailing from a family of illustrious sculptors, Mohapatra started sculpting at an early age. He studied till about class 3, but had become an authority in sculpting at a young age. At the age of 22, he won a national award.In 1974 he came into prominence by creating a six-foot-tall grey sandstone statue of the Sun God, which is now displayed in the Central Hall of Parliament. His other works include a wooden image of Buddha at the Buddha Temple, Paris, two white Dholpuri stone lamps in the Prime Minister’s office, the decorative central circle and pillars in Park Street, Kolkata and a 15-feet-high Mukteswar gate in red sandstone at Surajkund, Haryana. He also worked for the preservation of the Jagannath Temple in Puri.His other works include two 15-feet-tall Buddha statutes in white sandstone at the historic Dhauligiri Santi Stupa near Bhubaneswar, a gigantic lotus of 30 feet x 30 feet in a single black granite stone at former PM Rajiv Gandhi’s samadhi at Vir Bhumi, and three 20-feet-high statues of Buddha in white sandstone at the Buddhist Monastery, Ladakh.In Bhubaneswar, the 15-feet-high Konark horse installed at the Master Canteen square and 12 ft tall Konark Horse at Barabati Stadium, Cuttack are famous landmarks of the twin cities. He was the main sculptor of Emami Jagannath Temple (Balasore) and Maa Taratarini Temple (Ganjam). He also sculpted the Viswarupa Bishnu Statue at Narayana Heart Hospital, Bangalore.Among his most ambitious venture was a “second Sun Temple” called Aditya Narayan Mandir on the outskirts of Bhubaneswar to give people a glimpse of the true glory of the original Sun Temple. He believed that the second Sun temple, once completed would allow future generations to know more about the original Sun Temple built in the 13th century.The current Sun temple at Konark is actually Jagamohan or frontal portion. Historians believe that the main temple has been destroyed due to vagaries of nature.In 1980, he sculpted a 14-feet-high Konark wheel in red sandstone at the India International Trade Fair which is now displayed at the Ashoka Hotel, New Delhi. He had set up a school in Bhubaneswar where he has trained more than 2,000 students.He was awarded the Padma Shri in 1976, Padma Bhushan in 2001, and Padma Vibhushan in 2013.Since 1963, he has served as a senior instructor and superintendent of the Handicraft Training and Designing Center of the Government of Odisha. In 2000, he was nominated as a member of the Indian Council for Cultural Relations by the Ministry of External Affairs, Government of India. Currently, he was a member of the Lalit Kala Academy and President of the Bhubaneswar branch of the All India Viswakarma Mahasangha.Mohapatra unsuccessfully contested the Rajya Sabha polls in February 2014 as a BJD-backed independent candidate. Though BJP had extended support to his candidature, he could not make it. The seat was won by Ranjib Biswal of Congress.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/renowned-sculptor-and-rajya-sabha-mp-raghunath-mohapatra-succumbs-to-covid19-101620586515402.html
10-05-2021||India||Narada sting operation: Governor allows CBI to prosecute 3 TMC MLAs||West Bengal governor Jagdeep Dhankhar has accorded prosecution sanction to the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) against three Trinamool Congress (TMC) MLAs — Madan Mitra, Subrata Mukherjee and Firhad Hakim — and one former party leader Suvon Chatterjee in the 2016 Narada sting operation case, a development which will empower the central agency to file a charge sheet against all four of them, people familiar with the development said.Mukherjee and Hakim are set to take oath as ministers in the Mamata Banarejee cabinet on Monday. Last week, Mitra won the assembly election from the Kamarhati seat in West Bengal.Besides the governor’s sanction against the three TMC legislators and Chatterjee, now a Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader, the ministry of home affairs (MHA) granted sanction against a 2004 batch promoted IPS officer SMH Mirza in the case. Mirza was arrested by CBI in September 2019.TMC MP Saugata Roy said: “I cannot comment on it. It’s a legal matter”.The officials cited above said the central agency had sent a request against the four state leaders in January this year after completion of its investigation.A statement issued by the Raj Bhavan in Kolkata on Sunday said: “Governor of West Bengal accorded sanction for prosecution in respect of Firhad Hakim, Subrata Mukherjee, Madan Mitra and Suvon Chatterjee, for the reason that all of them at the relevant time of commission of crime were holding the position of ministers in the government of West Bengal.”The governor’s office added that he is the competent authority to accord prosecution sanction against ministers in the state.“The impression generated in some quarters of media that sanction has come to be accorded because these persons at the relevant time were members of the West Bengal Legislative Assembly is factually untenable. The premise of the sanction as indicated is that these persons at the relevant point of time of commission of crime were holding the position of ministers in government of West Bengal,” the Raj Bhavan statement added.The case pertains to a controversy that erupted ahead of the 2016 assembly elections after Narada News portal uploaded a series of videos purportedly showing a number of high-profile TMC leaders receiving money in exchange for favours to a fictitious company.In April 2017, CBI registered a First Information Report (FIR) against 12 TMC leaders based on orders by the Calcutta high court.Dhankhar’s sanction to prosecute the three TMC MLAs and Chatterjee comes even as CBI’s request to prosecute three MPs of the ruling party — Saugata Roy, Prasun Banerjee and Kakoli Ghosh Dastidar — and former TMC parliamentarian Suvendu Adhikari, who joined the BJP and fought and won the Nandigram seat against Mamata Banerjee, is pending with the Lok Sabha speaker since April 2019.According to Section 19 of the Prevention of Corruption Act, prosecution sanction is mandatory before filing a charge sheet against a public servant else the courts will not take cognisance of the charges.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/narada-sting-operation-guv-allows-cbi-to-prosecute-3-tmcmlas-101620586334532.html
10-05-2021||India||Himanta Biswa Sarma: From BJP’s key strategist in northeast to Assam CM||Ever since he joined the Tarun Gogoi-led Congress government in 2001 as a minister after his first electoral victory, Himanta Biswa Sarma was always seen by many as someone who would reach the chief minister’s chair in due course.On Sunday, that expectation came true as Sarma pipped incumbent Sarbananda Sonowal to be unanimously selected as the legislature party leader of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which secured 60 seats in the recently concluded assembly polls to return to power in Assam for a second consecutive term.As a seasoned politician, Sarma never made his ambitions for the top post public. But ever since he quit the Congress cabinet of Gogoi in 2015 after differences with the CM over purportedly promoting his son Gaurav, the perception was strong that he joined the BJP in order to fulfil his political goals.Sonowal led the BJP to an electoral victory, but the BJP high command had to give the CM’s chair to Sarma as he was the one who galvanised mass support for the party and also had the support of two-third of the new BJP legislators, people in the party with knowledge of the matter said.The 52-year-old has been a key figure in Assam’s politics for two decades now. But Sarma, who joined the BJP six years ago, has had a meteoric rise in the saffron party and his influence is not restricted to Assam but seen across the region.Also read | Himanta Biswa Sarma to take over as next Assam chief ministerSarma’s political acumen and oratorical skills played a key role in the BJP winning 60 of the total 126 seats in 2016 and forming the party’s first government in Assam with alliance partners Asom Gana Parishad and Bodoland Peoples’ Front. Despite being new to the party, Sarma was given four crucial departments -- health, education, finance and public works -- in the Sonowal cabinet.As convener of the North East Democratic Alliance (NEDA), a BJP-led front of anti-Congress parties in the North-east, Sarma shares a close rapport with senior politicians in all seven states of the region. His role was crucial in the BJP forming governments in Arunachal Pradesh, Manipur and Tripura and becoming part of the ruling coalition in Nagaland and Meghalaya.Sarma hasn’t had a clean slate and there were accusations about his involvement in the Louis Berger scam and the Saradha Group fraud scheme. But he has been able to override them and play a key role in the BJP, a party that once targeted him on these accusations.Over the past five years, Sarma has made a mark beyond the region and become a known face across the country -- a traditional rarity for politicians from the North-east. He is consulted by the BJP leadership for any issue concerning Assam and the region and more often than not, his suggestions are accepted.Due to his position in the Assam cabinet and in NEDA, Sarma’s stature grew to such extent that he was sometimes mistaken by some from outside the region as the CM instead of Sonowal. An astute politician, Sarma never tried to compete with Sonowal for the top post and there is a cordial relationship between the two, at least in public.In 2019, ahead of the general elections, Sarma had indicated his intentions to leave state politics and shift base to New Delhi, where he could play a bigger role. But the BJP leadership decided against it. However, in a rare gesture, then BJP president Amit Shah issued a statement that the party needed Sarma’s services in the poll campaign in the North-east and could not afford to have him restricted to just one seat.Sarma has been representing the Jalukbari seat continuously since 2001 and this time, too, the party gave him the ticket from the seat. With the BJP high command not projecting a CM face for this election, rumours were abound that Sarma could be given that role.Sarma has been the brain behind most of the social welfare schemes of the Sonowal government such as ₹830 per month to 2.2 million households and cash incentives and grants to various sections of society. But his role as health minister in the past year, when he supervised setting up of large Covid care centres, boosting infrastructure at hospitals and personally visiting quarantine centres to keep tabs on care being provided to those infected have earned him headlines as well as admiration even from his critics.For this election, Sarma specifically targeted the Congress and its alliance partner All India United Democratic Front (AIUDF), the two main opposition parties in Assam which formed a grand alliance along with former BJP ally Bodoland Peoples Front.Terming the AIUDF as an important factor in this election, Sarma accused its chief, perfume baron and Lok Sabha MP Badruddin Ajmal, as being the enemy of Assam and Assamese culture. He has openly stated that the BJP doesn’t need votes of ‘miyas’ (Bengali-speaking Muslims from erstwhile East Pakistan).Besides politics and governance, Sarma is interested in sports and is an author. He has penned four books till date, the latest released in February ahead of the assembly polls. He is also the president of the Badminton Association of India (BAI).Sarma’s wife Riniki Bhuyan Sarma is the chairperson and managing director of Pride East Entertainment that owns several TV channels, a daily newspaper and a magazine. The couple has a son and daughter.“Sarma’s elevation to the CM’s post was coming for some time and he was working towards it by delivering the goods for the party time and again. He already had a stronghold in the BJP and over time, managed to become a brand himself that cuts across party and community lines,” Kaustubh Deka, professor of political science in Dibrugarh University, said.“After the poll debacle in West Bengal, the BJP leadership realized the importance of having strong regional leaders and also listen to local voices. That’s the reason why instead of imposing a leader, it decided to go with ground realities and even override the so-called opposition by RSS to Sarma’s elevation to the top post,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/himanta-biswa-sarma-from-bjp-s-key-strategist-in-northeast-to-assam-cm-101620586214553.html
10-05-2021||India||NIA begins probe against top Maoist commander||The National Investigation Agency (NIA) has launched a probe against Madvi Hidma, commander of Battalion-I of Maoist’s People’s Liberation Guerilla Army (PLGA), in connection with the seizure of a cache of explosive materials, including 900 detonators, used for planting Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs) to target security forces, people familiar with the development said.Hidma is the mastermind behind last month’s U-shaped ambush on security forces in Chhattisgarh’s Bijapur district in which 22 security personnel were killed.The officials cited above said that Hidma, who also goes by names Hidmal and Iduma, was booked in a matter related to the arrest of two ‘Maoist couriers’ – Muthu Nagaraju and Kommaraju Kanakaiah – by a routine patrolling team of Telangana Police and Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) on February 18. The duo was carrying 400 electrical detonators, 500 non-electrical detonators, 400 gelatin sticks and 549 metres of fuse wire in bags and was heading towards a forest in Chhattisgarh when they were caught.Also read | NIA takes over case involving recovery of uranium worth ₹21 crore“During interrogation, they disclosed that they are sympathisers of CPI (Maoists) and were instructed by Hidma to collect the explosives,” an officer said, preferring anonymity. According to details accessed by HT, Hidma has been named as an accused in the NIA FIR, registered last week under the explosives act among others.Officials said the whopping cache of explosives was recovered around the time when Maoists begin their Tactical Counter Offensive Campaign (TCOC), from February to May every year. As part of TCOC, Maoist cadres are mobilised across the country, and then they carry out attacks on security forces and government establishments in order to kill them and loot their weapons. The targets also include patrolling parties, destroying railway tracks, police stations and schools among others.Hidma, a strategist in guerilla warfare, has been the face behind Maoists’ TCOC every year for the past 15-16 years. He has planned and executed some of the deadliest ambushes on security forces, including the 2017 Burkapal attack in which 24 CRPF personnel were killed, 2013 Jheerum Ghati ambush in which 27 people, including Congress leaders, were killed and 2010 Dantewada ambush in which 76 lost their lives.There is already a reward of close to ₹40 lakh on him by different police departments and central agencies.Former Director General of CRPF, K Durga Prasad, said: “Hidma is basically the muscle-power of Jantana Sarkar of Maoists. He rose in the ranks of Maoists because of his military skills. Since he is a tribal, he has a good network of informants in the villages and people inside trust him more because the local administration is not visible. Honestly, the administration’s lack of planning and understanding of the terrain and needs of villagers is the reason why Hidma is more successful than us in the jungles of Chhattisgarh.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nia-begins-probe-against-top-maoist-commander-101620586094520.html

After Maharashtra and Karnataka, Kerala has been reporting the maximum number of Covid-19 cases in the country. According to the Union health ministry data, out of the 20 worst-affected districts six are from the state. In some of the districts like Ernakulam, the TPR is above 32 per cent. The special task force comprising volunteers and others have increased their surveillance on patients who are in home care and isolation to monitor their condition.

10-05-2021||India||1.8mn in 18-44 yrs age group have received first jab, says govt data||Close to 1.8 million people between ages 18 and 44 have received their first Covid-19 vaccine shot, government data showed on Sunday, even as states are making efforts to widen their immunisation drives by procuring more doses for this age group.The inoculation numbers are yet to pick up, with the central government maintaining that the vaccination process in this age group will smoothen once the vaccine supply chain improves in coming weeks.“Our first priority is 45-plus category as it is this population group that runs the maximum risk of developing serious disease. For the rest of the adult population group, the service was opened as part of expanding the coverage to phase-3 level. As supplies (vaccine) get better, more slots will open up,” a central government official said on condition of anonymity.About 180 million Covid-19 vaccine doses have been administered in the country so far. “Ten states account for 66.78% of the cumulative doses given so far in the country,” Union health ministry said in a statement.Also read | PM Modi takes stock of Covid-19 crisis, strategy in 4 statesThere has been a massive surge in the number of new Covid-19 cases over the past few weeks, and the global community has come to the aid of the Indian government as the country’s health care delivery system is stretched thin.As per recent government data, nearly 500,000 Covid-19 positive cases currently are in intensive care units (ICUs), with over 170,000 people on ventilator support at various hospitals across the country, with many more seriously ill patients in need of hospital beds.Many countries began sending essential medical supplies to help India strengthen its clinical management capacity for effective management of hospitalised Covid-19 patients.Since April 27, when shipments started arriving, 6,738 oxygen concentrators; 3,856 oxygen cylinders; 16 oxygen generation plants; 4,668 ventilators or Bi PAP machines; and about 300,000 remdesivir vials have either been delivered or dispatched cumulatively.On Saturday, the government received oxygen concentrators (2,404), antiviral drug remdesivir (25,000 vials), ventilators (218) and testing kits (692,208) from Canada, Thailand, The Netherlands, Austria, Czech Republic, Israel, US, Japan, Malaysia, Gilead, Salesforce and the Indian community in Thailand.“A dedicated Coordination Cell has been created in the Union Health Ministry to coordinate the receipt and allocation of foreign COVID relief material as grants, aid and donations. This Cell started functioning from 26th April 2021. A Standard Operating Procedure has been framed and implemented by the Health Ministry since 2nd May, 2021,” said the health ministry statement.Most of the material is being sent to tertiary care hospitals in states, as these hospitals see maximum Covid-19 caseload, and mostly severely ill patients.“I thank all for sending foreign aid in the form of essential medical equipment -- ventilators, oxygen cylinders, and oxygen concentrators, to fight the huge surge of Covid-19 cases,” said Dr Randeep Guleria, director, All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), Delhi.AIIMS is also one of the two hospitals in Delhi to have installed DRDO’s oxygen generation plant that is designed for a flow rate of 1,000 liters per minute. The system caters to 190 patients at a flow rate of 5 litres per minute. The other hospital where the plant has been installed is New Delhi’s Dr Ram Manohar Lohia Hospital.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/18mn-in-18-44-yrs-age-group-have-received-first-jab-says-govt-data-101620585375105.html
10-05-2021||India||Heatwave conditions won’t set in till May 18: IMD||An unusually high number of western disturbances (WD) in March, April and now in May has subdued the searing heat normally felt in April and May, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) has said, adding that similar conditions are likely to persist till around May 18.“There was no heatwave in May till now. We are not expecting heatwave conditions to set in till May 18. On May 10, 11 and 12, rain and thunderstorms are likely over northwest India under the influence of an intense western disturbance. It has rained almost continuously in many parts of the country in April. There were cloudy skies and strong winds over north India also, which didn’t allow the maximum temperatures to rise. In central and peninsular India, there is wind discontinuity which is bringing intermittent thunderstorm activity and cool winds,” RK Jenamani, senior scientist, national weather forecasting centre, said.There were seven western disturbances which moved across western Himalayan region in March against the normal of four WDs. Of these, three were very active, bringing rainfall, snowfall and thunderstorm to the region. April saw nine WDs move across western Himalayan region against the normal of four to five WDs. Four of them were active and moved as cyclonic circulations, bringing rain and thunderstorms to the hills and plains. There were two WDs in May and another expected to impact the region from Tuesday.In March, severe heatwave was recorded over west Rajasthan and heatwave conditions over east Rajasthan, Odisha, Gangetic West Bengal, coastal Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu. In April, however, the heatwave was occasional and for shorter periods over smaller pockets. This is mainly because of wet spells over the western Himalayan region and adjoining plains of northwest India and central India on many days due to the movement of WDs. No heatwave was recorded in May, according to the weather body.Jenamani added that with the likely arrival of monsoon over Kerala on June 1, further heatwave conditions are unlikely over Peninsular India. “Over north India, May-end and beginning of June can be very hot. But we can’t tell now. It depends on what weather systems develop.”The average maximum, minimum and mean temperature in April was 34.52 degree C, 22.33 degree C and 28.42 degree C, respectively, against the normal of 33.94 degree C, 22.15 degree C and 28.04 degree C based on the average for 1981-2010 period.In March, the maximum, minimum and mean temperature was 32.65 degree C, 19.95 degree C and 26.30 degree C, respectively, against the normal of 31.24 degree C, 18.87 degree C and 25.06 degree C.A fresh western disturbance is likely to affect western Himalayan region and plains of northwest India from May 11 onwards. Under the influence of this WD and its interaction with easterly winds and moisture feed from Arabian Sea, fairly widespread rainfall or thundershowers are very likely over western Himalayan region and isolated rainfall/thunderstorms is likely over plains of northwest India on May 11 and 12 with maximum intensity on May 12 and 13. Isolated heavy rainfall is also likely over Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand on May 12 and 13.Under the influence of strengthening of lower level south-westerly winds and its confluence with lower-level westerlies, fairly widespread rainfall/thunderstorm activity is also likely over northeastern states and West Bengal; and scattered rain/thundershower over remaining parts of east India during the next four to five days.Due to a north-south trough (area of low pressure)/wind discontinuity from southwest Madhya Pradesh to Karnataka coast, light/moderate rain/thunder is very likely over Kerala, Mahe, Lakshadweep and Karnataka and isolated rain over rest of south Peninsular India during the next four to five days. No heatwave conditions are likely over any part of the country during this period.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/heatwave-conditions-won-t-set-in-till-may-18imd-101620585374495.html

It gave 6.5 crore doses to them. Around 1 lakh people have died of Covid during the second wave in India. If not exported, these vaccines could have saved the lives of these people," the Deputy Chief Minister said.He said that other countries also follow international treaties, but they did not export vaccines and prioritised their own people."Some people in Central government would say that we are bound by international treaties. US, France and European countries also follow these treaties but none of them prioritized other countries. Only we gave vaccines to others when our own people were dying," Sisodia said."Was it (export of vaccines to other countries) done just to improve the image of Central government and earn accolades from some other countries? I request the Central government to vaccinate everyone in the country before exporting vaccines," he added.Earlier today, he also tweeted about the matter and said the Delhi government has approved a budget of 600 crores to buy vaccines but there is a shortage of vaccines with manufacturers."It is a good thing to worry about the world, but the countries of America, Canada, Europe, are starting to arrange vaccines for their people first from around the world. Only France exported 1 lakh vaccines last month. Our central government has donated 6.6 crore since March," he tweeted."The Delhi government has approved a budget of 600 crores to buy vaccines for the people of Delhi. Many more states are also prepared in this way. But the vaccine is not available. Because from March till now, the central government has showered favour on 93 countries including Arab countries and exported 6.6 crore vaccines," Sisodia said in another tweet.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid19-delhi-s-deputy-cm-manish-sisodia-urges-centre-to-vaccinate-indians-first-before-exporting-vaccines-101620584569029.html

Punjab has been battling a surge in Covid cases and recorded 8,436 cases and 191 deaths on Sunday, taking its total tally to 442,125 and 10,506.Amarinder asked Modi to raise the state’s total quota of oxygen to 300 metric tonne (MT) amid an increase in hospitalisation, officials said.An official statement said the chief minister informed Modi that “the state has a high mortality count, and hospitalisation in Level 2 and 3 facilities (both government and private) has seen a sharp surge over the past three weeks, pushing up the oxygen demand”.The CM informed Modi that from 197 MT on April 22, the demand for oxygen had risen to 295.5 MT in the state on May 8 with the shortage of O2 tankers making the situation worse, the statement said.The chief minister hoped that the Centre would take immediate steps to supplement oxygen supplies and ensure vaccine doses were sent on priority to help the Punjab government effectively manage the situation, an official statement said. The state is set to start the vaccination of those in the 18-44 year age group from Monday.Also read | Regulate supply of Covid-19 vaccine shots: Delhi CM Kejriwal writes to health minister Harsh VardhanSpeaking on condition of anonymity, an official said that Punjab health secretary Hussan Lal, in a letter to the additional secretary in the Union health ministry noted that while the state has taken several steps to ensure judicious use of oxygen by hospitals, in line with the advisory of government of India, the growing demand for the life-saving gas necessitated an increase in allocation.The Prime Minister has been holding a series of talks with the CM and lieutenant governors across the country to assess the ground situation and take stock of the states’ demands.Karnataka chief minister BS Yediyurappa apprised Modi of the Covid situation in the state during their conversation, officials said. “They spoke about Covid-19 situation in the state and took stock of the situation,” said one of the two officials at chief minister’s office.Karnataka, which remains firmly in the grip of Covid, recorded 47,930 new cases on Sunday.On May 5, while hearing a public interest litigation, the Karnataka high court noted that the projected requirement of oxygen in the state was 1,471 MT per day as on April 30, 2021, whereas the Centre had agreed to enhance it from 862 MT to only 962 MT per day. The high court then directed the Karnataka government to submit a representation to the Union government while ordering that till this representation was considered, the Centre will supply 1200 MT of oxygen per day to the state. The Centre challenged this order in the Supreme Court but the top court turned down its plea on May 7.Uttarakhand chief minister Tirath Singh Rawat, who received criticism from health experts after the state held mahakumbh amid the pandemic, said he updated the PM about the Covid situation the state. Uttarakhand recorded 5,890 fresh infections and 180 deaths on Sunday. “Prime Minister Narendra Modi called up for an update on Covid cases in Uttarakhand. I apprised him with the present situation,” Rawat said in a tweet.Till late on Sunday, the office of Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar did not issue a statement about the matters discussed between the PM and Kumar during the telephonic conversation over the pandemic.“ The PM had talked with the CM on the Covid situation in the state. There were discussions on it ,”said a senior bureaucrat, wishing anonymity.Principal secretary to the chief minister, Deepak Kumar, did not comment about the meeting, or what issues were discussed.However, in a series of tweets later on Sunday, the CM exhorted people to come together to fight against the Covid-19 pandemic by adopting appropriate behaviour and extending support to the government. He also thanked the frontline workers for patiently working hard in this times of pandemic.The state recorded 11,259 fresh infections and 67 deaths on Sunday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-takes-stock-of-covid-crisis-strategy-in-4-states-101620585254510.html
10-05-2021||India||Quarry work illegal, high-level probe ordered in Kadapa blast||The Andhra Pradesh government on Sunday formed a multi-department panel to conduct a high-level probe into the Kadappa quarry explosion, where 10 labourers were killed, after preliminary probe by revenue authorities suggested that the leaseholder of the quarry had no permission to use explosives for mining activities in the area.Kadapa district collector C Hari Kiran made the observation in his report to the state government submitted on Sunday. Based on his report, the state government ordered the probe by a multi-departmental panel comprising officials of five different departments, including mine, geology, industries and revenue and sought another report in five days.“The committee headed by the district joint collector has been asked to submit a report to the government within five days. Stringent action would be taken against the leaseholders of the limestone quarry as per the law, as prima facie it was proved that he had not followed any safety precautions in using the explosives,” state minister of mines and geology Peddireddy Ramachandra Reddy told reporters in Vijayawada.The minister also announced an ex gratia of ₹10 lakh each to the kin of the deceased who were killed during the blast while unloading detonators from a vehicle at a limestone quarry.The incident happened at Tirumalakonda hillocks on the outskirts of Mamillapalli village of Kalasapadu block at around 10 am on Saturday.Also read | 10 killed in explosion at limestone quarry in Andhra“We shall also make the mine operator pay additional compensation to the victims’ families as per the Labour Act. Operators of other mines have also been alerted to ensure all safety measures are taken to prevent such blasts in the future,” Reddy said.In his report to principal secretary (mines and geology) Gopala Krishna Dwivedi, Kiran said the explosion took place at the limestone mine extending over 30.696 hectares in Survey Nos. 1 and 133. The original leaseholder of the mine is C Kasturi Bai, wife of C Ramachandraiah, legislative council member of YSR Congress party, but the general power of attorney was given to one C Nageshwar Reddy of Chechaiahgaripalli village for a period of 10 years.“Reddy was doing quarry operations illegally during this pandemic situation, knowing that the department officials were appointed as nodal officers for Covid-19 duties and there were holidays for the weekend. He illegally brought the explosive material to the quarry in a car and the explosion took place at the time of unloading due to negligence and lack of proper precautions in handling the material,” the collector said.While Reddy continues to hold the permission for mining till November 2021, he did not have the permission to use and transport detonators for mining activity from the competent authority.“During raids conducted by the mines and geology department for three days in October 2019, it was found that Reddy had been conducting underground mining operations without appointment of statutory employees. He also excavated excess quantities of barytes (a variety of limestone) beyond the annual approved quantity,” the collector said.Kiran also pointed out that Reddy was conducting quarry operations and excavated thousands of tonnes of minerals without environmental clearance and forest approval. The quarry operations were also not in accordance with the approved scheme of mining.The collector pointed out that in August 2020, the assistant director of mines and geology department of Kadapa had recommended suspension of quarry operations as Reddy had violated all norms. Accordingly, the director of the department had issued show cause notice to the lease holder asking why no action should be initiated against him.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/quarry-work-illegal-high-level-probe-ordered-in-kadapa-blast-101620584594951.html

The NIA has re-registered the case and started the investigation, the spokesperson added.Thane resident Jigar Jayesh Pandya, 27, and Abu Tahir Afzal Hussain Choudhary, 31, a Mankhurd local, are in police custody till May 12 for the alleged possession of the highly radioactive substance.Also read | NIA begins probe against top Maoist commanderEarlier, an NIA team had visited the ATS office, and after verifying facts, took over the case. “Now the documents related to the case will be handed over to them for further inquiry. As per the procedure, NIA will approach the court to take custody of both the accused as they are in ATS custody till May 12,” said an ATS officer.The incident came to light after police inspector Santosh Bhalekar of the Nagpada unit got information about a person planning to sell pieces of uranium illegally. Bhalekar and his team then laid a trap and nabbed Pandya. During interrogation, Pandya revealed that he had got the uranium from Choudhary. Bhalekar then arrested Choudhary on May 5 after questioning several scrap dealers in Mumbai.Meanwhile, ATS had sent the recovered substance to Bhabha Atomic Research Centre (BARC), Trombay, for chemical analysis. The BARC report confirmed that the seized substance was natural uranium and dangerous to human life.“We have been interrogating the accused to find out where they had procured the uranium from. It appears that there are several others involved in the case.

The five-judge bench also refused to refer the 1992 Indra Sawhney judgment, setting a 50% cap on reservation to a larger bench for reconsideration.Virendra Pawar, one of the convenors from Maratha Kranti Morcha (MKM) said, “It [formation of the committee] was expected when the legal battle for reservation was going on in the apex court. We had suggested names such as Dr Sadanand More (scholar), BG Kolse Patil (retired high court justice) and PB Sawant (retired Supreme court judge) to the government requesting them to use their expertise by appointing them as advisers but our suggestions were overlooked.”“If the state government is really serious about granting reservation to the Maratha community they should consider incorporating us in the OBC quota,” he added.Also read | Maharashtra to set up panel to study SC order on Maratha reservationSanjiv Bhor Patil, president, Shiv Prahar Sangathana said the state is just passing the time. “We have lost our reservation quota so now whatever is required to get it back, should be done at the earliest. We would have hit the streets by now but not doing so because of the pandemic. We want the government not to waste the time anymore.”However, a few Maratha leaders termed the constitution of the expert committee as a “positive development”. Mansing Pawar, one of the convenors of the MKM said, “It [the move] is definitely a positive development as only two authorities in the country — the Supreme Court and President — can provide us reservation. Individual petitioners are also preparing grounds to go for a review but the petition by the state government will make a difference. Thus, I would say it is a much needed step.”The state government on Saturday decided to constitute a committee under two retired high court (HC) judges to review the recent apex court verdict and suggest the next course of action. The committee, comprising five-six other members including laws officers, is expected to submit its report in two weeks to the state government.Marathas were given 12% and 13% quota in education and government jobs, respectively, under the Socially and Educationally Backward Classes (SEBC) Act, 2018.The state government on Saturday also said that they are tapping the option of requesting the central government to intervene, as the judgment stated that the right to accord the reservation is with the Centre after the 102nd Constitutional amendment.“Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray will write to the President and prime minister, requesting them to take steps required for the reservation. The Centre has time and again clarified that the powers of the states have not been nullified even after the amendment, though the SC order has stated otherwise,” Ashok Chavan, Public Works Department (PWD) minister said on Saturday.Many of the organisations are also planning to hold statewide virtual agitations by starting social media campaigns against leaders from the political parties in the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-verdict-on-quota-maratha-leaders-voice-discontent-over-panel-101620584534451.html

This demand could increase substantially in the days ahead considering the obvious possibilities, for which it is necessary to keep a reasonable buffer,” he added in the letter dated May 8.“The doses required for vaccination of persons between the age group of 18 to 44 is 2.6 crore for which orders have been placed by the state government. Out of this, 30 lakh doses are required by May 21 but the supplies may not match this demand unless ensured by the central government. Similarly, for vaccination of those at 45 and above, 1.6crore doses are required for double dose vaccination against which only 40.50 lakh doses have been received by the state government through govt. of India,” Kumar wrote.Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh on Saturday reiterated that violation of the weekend lockdown in Punjab will not be allowed given the Covid-19 situation. Kumar praised the Punjab CM’s leadership, saying that he took “timely initiatives to contain the pandemic in the state”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/former-minister-ashwani-kumar-urges-pm-to-raise-supply-of-oxygen-vaccine-to-punjab-101620584414461.html
10-05-2021||India||Saudi Arabia backs India-Pakistan dialogue||New Delhi Saudi Arabia has welcomed the decision by India and Pakistan to observe a ceasefire along the Line of Control (LoC) and backed a dialogue between the South Asian rivals to address all outstanding issues, including the Kashmir dispute.The kingdom’s position was articulated in a joint statement issued by Pakistan and Saudi Arabia late on Saturday after a meeting between Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and visiting Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan. It came against the backdrop of speculation about the role being played by Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) to foster dialogue between New Delhi and Islamabad.Khan was on an official visit to Saudi Arabia from May 7 to 9. Pakistan Army chief Gen Qamar Bajwa too visited Saudi Arabia last week. Both Bajwa and Khan held meetings with the Saudi crown prince and the talks were seen as part of Pakistan’s efforts to normalise strained relations with Saudi Arabia.The joint statement said the Saudi crown prince “welcomed the recent understanding reached between the military authorities of Pakistan and India regarding ceasefire at the Line of Control (LoC), which is based on a 2003 understanding between Pakistan and India”.It added that Saudi Arabia and Pakistan “emphasised the importance of dialogue between Pakistan and India to resolve the outstanding issues between the two countries, especially Jammu and Kashmir dispute, to ensure peace and stability in the region”.However, a separate readout issued by the Saudi side on the meeting between Khan and the crown prince made no mention of India or the Kashmir issue.There was no immediate response from Indian officials to the joint statement.There has been speculation about the role played by Saudi Arabia and the UAE to reduce tensions between India and Pakistan since the 2019 Pulwama suicide bombing, which triggered a tense military standoff.The UAE envoy to the US, Yousef Al Otaiba, confirmed last month that his country played a role in bringing together India and Pakistan for talks aimed at calming tensions over the Kashmir issue and getting bilateral ties “back to a healthy level”. It is understood that senior Indian and Pakistani security officials have met in London and Dubai for secret talks in recent months.The surprise decision by the Indian and Pakistani armies to recommit themselves to the 2003 ceasefire on the LoC from February 25 is seen as the outcome of these contacts.During the Pakistani prime minister’s visit to Saudi Arabia, the two sides reviewed all aspects of bilateral cooperation and discussed regional and international issues. They agreed to intensify contacts and cooperation between government officials and the private sector, and the crown prince assured Khan of Saudi Arabia’s continued support for his vision to transform Pakistan into a modern welfare state.Both sides also expressed satisfaction at cooperation in military and security ties, and agreed to augment collaboration to achieve mutually agreed goals, the joint statement said.The two sides said an “inclusive, broad-based and comprehensive political settlement” is the only way forward in Afghanistan. They also signed several agreements on establishing a Saudi-Pakistan Supreme Coordination Council, combating illicit trafficking in narcotics and drugs and financing projects in energy, hydropower, infrastructure and transport and communication.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/saudi-arabia-backs-india-pak-dialogue-101620584294432.html

In capital New Delhi, which has struggled to contain the Covid-19 outbreak, many experts suspect the official death and case numbers are a gross underestimate. A top World Health Organization (WHO) scientist said yesterday that the Covid-19 variant, which has been spreading in India, is more contagious and may be dodging vaccine protections.An editorial in the medical journal Lancet has blamed the central government for the ongoing coronavirus crisis in India, holding it responsible for “allowing superspreader” religious and political events and slowing down the vaccination campaign.Covid-19 dashboard:Total cases: 22,296,414Total deaths: 242,362Active cases: 3,736,648Recovered patients: 18,317,404Recovery rate: 81.90%Follow all the updates here:70% of total revenue collected on vaccines go to states: Anurag ThakurFrom GST collected on vaccine, half is earned by Centre & other half by States. 41% of Centre’s collections get devolved to States.

10-05-2021||Today's||Climate crisis: Be the Indian elephant||The global financial crisis of 2008 endorsed Nassim Taleb’s theory of black swans, high-impact events, the rarity of which makes it difficult to calculate their probability. People tend to ignore the signs until it is too late. Later, Michele Wucker published The Gray Rhino, arguing that many obvious and highly probable threats (grey rhinos) are also disregarded. What do these metaphors teach us about how we respond to the pandemic — and the climate crisis?As a once-in-a-century occurrence, the Covid-19 pandemic was indeed a black swan. Of course, it is prudent to invest in public health infrastructure. But it is hard to predict the onset or origins of a pandemic of this scale. Over the past year, however, this black swan has metamorphosed into a grey rhino, with second and third waves in many countries, overwhelming health systems, administrative capacity and community resilience. It is no longer unpredictable or low-probability. The appropriate response should be to prepare for the worst, even as we hope for the best.Also Read | Centre spotlights efforts to boost oxygen availabilityThe pandemic offers four lessons that could inform how we prepare for the climate crisis. First, political borders cannot stop planetary risks. The origins of the virus may have been in China, but no country is immune. Climate risks are no different. Their nature varies by geography: Drier conditions in Southeast Asia and South America, wetter days and more flooding in northern and eastern Europe, more intense hurricanes in the Caribbean and cyclones in South Asia. The systemic risks transcend boundaries — increasing transboundary water stress, falling farm yields in one region impacting food prices elsewhere, spread of vector-borne diseases, or human security concerns, resulting in environmental refugees.Second, like the pandemic, climate shocks come not at once, but in waves. The probability of climate risks increases with time. A failure of the monsoons in one year compounds when rainfall is below normal for three or four years in a row. Severe heat stress can swamp hospital infrastructure. But it can also undermine electricity grid stability, causing far worse damage to economic activity.Third, some are more vulnerable than others. Daily wage earners, migrant workers, industrial labour and people with co-morbidities have suffered the most during the pandemic. Vulnerability is a function of exposure to hazards and one’s capacity to adapt. Resilience, by converse, draws on income and wealth, social safety nets, administrative efficiency, and access to timely warnings. In the case of the climate crisis, vulnerability extends beyond communities to large infrastructure.Fourth, the more dynamic your economy, the more you have to lose. The need to restore economic activity demands that there is also a readiness to respond to pandemic aftershocks. Ignoring the risks can jeopardise economic recovery. Similarly, the climate crisis will impact the world’s engines of growth badly. As Swiss Re estimated recently, the global economy will be 11-14% smaller by mid-century than if there had been no warming at all. Fast-growing Asia should be particularly worried — Gross Domestic Product will be 14.9-20.4% lower. Factoring in the increased the severity of unknown unknowns, 2.6°C of warming by 2050 could make India’s economy 27% smaller than in the no-warming scenario.Also Read | Arvind Kejriwal explains how Delhi is preparing for next wave of Covid-19These lessons must translate into action. First, create a Climate Risk Commission with statutory authority to analyse and report on climate risks on a periodic basis. Like the finance commission, it must consult with not just climate experts but also state governments, academia, industry, the media and civil society. The commission’s report should be tabled and debated in Parliament.Second, prepare for climate shocks with decentralised capacity. The national and state disaster management agencies are a start. Similar structures are needed at district levels. Decentralised infrastructure, from distributed power sources, distributed water storage, revamped primary health centres (using off-grid power), or nature-based solutions to reduce coastal floods can greatly boost community resilience.Third, assess critical vulnerabilities for hard infrastructure. This is not limited to reducing physical losses to power plants, bridges, airports, or telecom infrastructure. India must understand financial risks. The Reserve Bank of India should demand regular reporting of climate risks in the lending portfolios of banks. The Securities and Exchange Board of India must mandate the same from listed companies. There is a need to assess risks to legacy investments in coal, ongoing investments in natural gas, and exposure to supply chain risks for critical minerals needed for low-carbon technologies.Finally, India needs a restructured economy, which values and monetises the preservation of natural capital, invests in sectors that are both low-carbon and employment-intensive, and creates an ecosystem to stimulate innovation (batteries, green hydrogen, carbon sequestration, regenerative agriculture, sustainable freight and transport, among others).The tragedy of the pandemic will be aggravated if we do not heed its lessons. Not every crisis needs be a black swan, if we analyse data and anticipate risks. It is worse to ignore the known dangers of grey rhinos. As the climate crisis unfolds, perhaps what is needed is not a swan or a rhino but an Indian elephant, whose long memory can remind us of times when we were unprepared.Arunabha Ghosh is CEO, Council on Energy, Environment and Water The views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/climate-crisis-be-the-indian-elephant-101620652579039.html
10-05-2021||Today's||A new chapter for the TRIPS waiver proposal||October 2 has considerable salience for India. Harnessing Mahatma Gandhi’s global appeal, Indian diplomacy, at times, signals global initiatives linked to his date of birth.In 2007, at India’s behest, the United Nations (UN) designated October 2 as International Day of Non-Violence. On October 2, 2016, India deposited its instrument of ratification of the Paris Agreement on Climate Change. Last year, on October 2, India paired with South Africa and submitted to the World Trade Organization (WTO) a proposal for a waiver so that, while responding to the pandemic, members do not have to implement, apply and enforce certain provisions of the Trade Related Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) Agreement.The idea was that a short-term waiver would allow countries to ramp up the production of medical products, including vaccines, therapeutics and equipment required to treat Covid-19. The hope was that it would result in “fair, equitable and affordable access” and, thereby, save lives. The proposal gathered the co-sponsorship of 60 states and the support of more than 100 states, besides a large swathe of civil society across the globe. However, it was only after the Joe Biden administration expressed support, on May 5, 2021, for waiving intellectual property rights for Covid-19 vaccines that the prospects of the initiative have brightened.Also Read | Pope Francis backs waivers on intellectual property rights for vaccinesRewind to October 2, 2020. The Covid-19 pandemic had then been raging for more than eight months, and 38 million people had been infected. A million lives were already lost. Most economies were in dire straits. Despite the pandemic endangering lives and livelihoods, vaccine nationalism was reigning. Although WTO requirements stipulate an outcome in 90 days, the waiver proposal did not even move to text-based negotiations — the normal format of serious multilateral consideration.The European Union (EU), United Kingdom (UK), Canada, Japan and Switzerland, including, of course the Donald Trump administration, as well as Brazil and Singapore, were staunchly opposed to the proposal. They argued that available tools such as voluntary licensing or the COVAX initiative and existing TRIPS “flexibilities” such as compulsory licensing were adequate to address the issue, and that intellectual property rights were not an impediment to increased production of medical requirements. Instead, they cited constraints such as export restrictions and limited availability of raw materials, as well as, a paucity of manufacturing capacities as having a more adverse impact than patent protections on the world’s ability to increase vaccine production. They pointed out that if and when such issues were addressed, the complex technological processes were not amenable to easy replication without considerable hand-holding.Fast forward to May. The death toll from Covid-19 exceeds three million. The number of infected has gone beyond 150 million. Existing tools have not proved adequate in containing the virus in many geographies. In less than five months of 2021, 1.4 million people have died, while during the whole of 2020 there were 1.8 million deaths. This year, the virus is projected to wreak more havoc than last year.Also Read | Canadian MPs ask Trudeau to drop opposition to TRIPS waiverAll this was happening while the Biden administration was considering how to effectuate a pre-election commitment, which candidate Biden said was “the humane thing in the world to do”. Burgeoning grassroots advocacy ensured support among Democratic members of Congress. However, the conventional wisdom was that the United States (US) would not take a position opposed by its powerful pharmaceuticals lobby.It was the devastating second wave of Covid-19 in India that was a factor in bringing the subject back on the global agenda. Prime Minister Narendra Modi, in a telephone conversation with Biden on April 26, was among the few who were reported to have raised it at the highest level, even as the US inter-departmental process was underway. According to reliable reports, influential members of the Biden administration were opposed. However, the argument that seems to have prevailed was that it was a low-risk option to meet a popular election commitment and also to secure a diplomatic gain for the Biden administration, which had come under fire for not exporting more vaccines and failing to respond quickly enough to the unfolding crisis in India.The US decision has provided a second wind to the waiver proposal. A revised submission by India and South Africa, accommodating some concerns, is on the cards. For example, the US is willing to waive patents on vaccines, while the initial proposal included much more. Countries such as Brazil and New Zealand have shifted to support the US as has the Gates Foundation. The UK, Canada and Japan, who usually follow the US lead, are quiet. The EU, remains skeptical and willing only to “discuss” proposals as influential European leaders remain opposed.There is still a long way ahead. The time frame for the start, let alone the end, of the negotiations is uncertain. Given the consensual nature of any outcome, it may leave much to be desired. An outcome, if any, will not come in time to address the current situation. However, public health is now a primary long-term concern for India.We need to leverage diplomatic ties to enhance health infrastructure beyond obtaining relief supplies. India has the potential to absorb health-related international opportunities for the benefit of its people and to offer them as global public goods also. Hence, as we did with the EU, pursuing a revitalised waiver proposal with greater zest than before with Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa (BRICS), Quad and G20 makes sense, even if we fall short. On this, the majority of 164 members of the WTO and global public opinion are on our side. Translating such goodwill into an internationally acceptable agreement is the challenge ahead not only for Indian diplomacy but also for the multilateral system which needs to demonstrate the ability to facilitate delivery of global public goods.Syed Akbaruddin is a retired diplomatThe views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/a-new-chapter-for-the-trips-waiver-proposal-101620651498686.html
10-05-2021||Today's||Covid-19: For the BJP sangathan, it is time to deliver on seva||As India grappled with the Covid-19 pandemic in March 2020, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leadership had a message for its party functionaries and the estimated 180 million-strong cadre — seva hi sangathan (organisation means service). The message to the party machinery was clear — step out and step up in helping those in need. Targets were set for the party to feed people, distribute masks and sanitisers, and offer whatever help was required.State units of the party, even where the BJP is not in power, competed with each other as they set about distributing food, medicines and essentials to those in need, especially the vulnerable who were left to fend for themselves during the lockdown. Videos and photographs were produced as evidence of the help that ordinary people were accorded by the party.Addressing party workers in June last year, Prime Minister (PM) Narendra Modi referred to the relief work being carried out by the party workers as the biggest “seva yajna”, act of service, in history and also called for documenting this work in all Indian languages.This seva was not entirely altruistic. The work done by a political party during a crisis has a significant impact on its electoral fortunes. For instance, in Bihar, which went to the polls during the pandemic and accounts for the highest percentage of migrant workers, relief work was redoubled. It was used as a balm to placate anger at the apathy that met hundreds of thousands as they undertook a treacherous journey back home on foot, or by paying exorbitant fares to private vehicle-owners during the lockdown between March 25 and May 31 last year.Also Read | PM Modi congratulates new Assam CM Himanta Biswa SarmaThe seva, the BJP claimed, was an endorsement of its unwavering commitment to antodaya — the concept of welfare of the last person in the queue that is at the heart of the party’s ideology. The BJP’s response has been starkly different during the ongoing second wave. Though state leaders have been asked to ensure their booths are Covid-19-free and set up helplines, only a few ministers and youth wing leaders are visible and vocal in facilitating help to people distraught by the lack of essential health services, oxygen and even facilities for last rites. The party behemoth is largely missing from the frontlines.There are no leaders showing up at hospitals; people in rural areas complain that their calls for help are going largely unheeded. It is no surprise then, that in some instances, BJP leaders have been booed in public. With families of BJP workers being affected too, the anger against the government’s failure in mitigating the crisis is mounting. A section of party leaders are, instead, criticising those who have put out complaints about the lack of medical care on social media. They view these complaints as a conspiracy to tarnish the image of the Union government. And their response to any criticism of public policy is acerbic and aggressive. It is pertinent to remember that the PM himself urged his party colleagues to remain unfazed if people came to them with memorandums, complaints, demands and suggestions.Also Read | In Bengal, the story of BJP, TMC and the Dalit and tribal voteInstead of preparing for the second wave, which scientist warned about, the party leadership invested more time first in contesting the assembly polls, particularly in West Bengal, displaying reluctance to call off rallies even as the cases multiplied, and now over the post-poll attacks against its cadre allegedly by the Trinamool Congress. Violence cannot be condoned, but when large parts of the country are being ravaged by the pandemic, made worse by systemic deficiencies, the continued discourse about West Bengal is disconcerting.Social media is flooded with pleas for help. At a time like this, to concentrate on organising pan-India protests against the violence in Bengal or to focus on the government’s image-building could well be read as misplaced priorities. The state has a mechanism to deal with law and order issues; the party can put pressure on the government to prevent the violence from escalating, but it does no one a favour by organising protests in the midst of a pandemic. For the BJP, it is time to revisit the idea of seva hi sangathan.The views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/covid19-for-the-bjp-sangathan-it-is-time-to-deliver-on-seva-101620651019215.html
10-05-2021||Editorials||The Congress must act, now||The Congress Working Committee (CWC) met on Monday to discuss the defeat in the assembly elections, with party president Sonia Gandhi saying that if the party did not “face up to reality”, it would not draw the right lessons. Here is the reality. The Congress got decimated in Bengal, failed to capture power in Kerala and Assam, lost power in Puducherry before the polls and failed to regain it, and is a junior partner in the ruling coalition in Tamil Nadu. To add insult to injury, high-profile defectors who switched ranks have found leadership oppor-tunities in the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) — with Himanta Biswa Sarma (who left the Congress in 2015) now becoming the third former Congress leader (after N Biren Singh in Manipur and Pema Khandu in Arunachal Pradesh) to take over as a BJP chief minister.The setback also comes at a time when the question of leadership remains unresolved. Sonia Gandhi is interim president but wants to give way to Rahul Gandhi. He doesn’t want to be president but is, for all effective purposes, in-charge. A group of dissenters forced the party to commit to a timeline for organisational elections — but while slated for this summer, it has now been deferred due to the second wave of the coronavirus pandemic. And in any case, the dissenters lack a leader with the stature to openly, successfully, challenge the leadership of the Nehru-Gandhi family.Through all of this, the Congress appears to sense an opportunity in the Centre’s mixed record in managing Covid-19. The fact that Rahul Gandhi gave obvious, but sensible, suggestions on the course of the disease, and that party organisations such as the Indian Youth Congress have done a stellar job in providing relief to citizens, gives the party hope that it can shape some of the political narrative around the pandemic. But in the absence of a clear leadership — the key question is not who becomes party president but who becomes the face to take on Narendra Modi in what will once again be a presidential-style contest in 2024 — the party’s ability to rise is doubtful. Supplement this with its weak organisation, the shift in incentives for leaders and workers who can sense political opportunities elsewhere, and the erosion in states where the party’s base was strong, and the nature of the crisis in the Congress becomes clearer. With noise about a possible non-BJP, non-Congress grouping rising, India’s grand old party is once again in a familiar place — the crossroads. Mrs Gandhi’s admission must be followed by action.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/the-congress-must-act-now-101620649578745.html
10-05-2021||Editorials||‘Covid orphans’: Follow due adoption process||As the second wave of Covid-19 engulfed India, several messages started circulating on social media platforms for the adoption of “Covid orphans”, children who have lost both parents to the dreaded disease. Such adoption posts are well-meaning, but they are also illegal, can be detrimental to the child’s well-being, and undermine existing safeguards. Child rights activists have warned that such posts violate Section 80 and 81 of the Juvenile Justice (JJ) Act, 2015, which prohibit offering or receiving children outside the processes laid down under the Act as well as their sale and purchase. Such acts are punishable with three to five years in jail or ₹1 lakh in fine. Last week, the ministry of women and child development (WCD) and National Commission for Protection of Child Rights too wrote to states on measures related to the rehabilitation of such children to ensure safety and prevent trafficking. The WCD ministry has also requested the ministry of health and family welfare that a column may be added to hospital admission forms seeking details of a trustworthy person to whom children can be handed over. This must be implemented without delay.India has a well-established adoption process. The Central Adoption Resource Authority (CARA), a statutory body of the WCD ministry, is the nodal agency for adoption. It regulates the adoption of orphaned, abandoned and surrendered children through its associated or recognised agencies. While the scale of the tragedy must be recognised, delays should be avoided, and processes improved, the adoption process itself must be preserved. Citizens must alert nodal agencies if a child needs help and protection.
