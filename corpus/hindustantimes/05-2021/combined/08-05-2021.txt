08-05-2021||Chandigarh||Wild Buzz: Love for lizards||Positioning water bowls for creatures in scorching summer not only makes for eminent empathy but yields revelatory insights into survival strategies. Worthy of emulation in any home garden, an unexpected interaction between a zoologist’s family and non-venomous garden lizards serves as a beacon of human goodwill and understanding. With a little bit of thoughtful care extended by their human friends, the creatures smartly adapted and triumphed over menacing odds.The reach out between man and the proverbial ‘mini-dragon’ of the gardens evolved at a residential complex in the Thar desert seven km outside the golden city of Jaisalmer. There, the common species of garden lizards (or the much reviled and feared ‘korkirlas’) occupied water bowls put out in native trees by zoology assistant professor Shyam Sunder Meena, when afternoon temperatures soared beyond 48 °C and touched 55 °C. The lizard adaptation astonished Meena. He had no idea lizards would make such good use of the bowls he had placed with the intention to quench the thirst of birds, mammals and insects!“Most creatures turn inactive during peak heat and take shelter under shadows cast by plants or rocks. I return from office in the afternoon, check the bowls and refill them. I discovered that six water bowls were occupied by male lizards for a few hours in the afternoon. They regularly leave their territorial zones and come to the bowls. Under heat duress, the lizards showed a remarkable capacity to equitably share the water opportunity. Under normal conditions, the dominant male is intolerant of the sub-dominant male’s presence but both amicably share the same bowl. The lizards’ primary objective here is to regulate body temperature not to drink water or predate on insects attracted to the water. As the afternoon heat ebbs, male lizards return to contested territories. Some smart female lizards chill outside our kitchen window which lets out the draught from air-conditioners,” Meena told this writer.His children, Vaishnavi, 13, and Khushank, 3, also display compassion, curiosity and love for the lizards. “Khushank is not afraid of lizards. Neither are the lizards as they sense the child means no harm to them. Khushank touches their tails, observes them up close as if they were puppies, and wants to make them his pets. But I told him that they can remain his pets forever in their natural state and he understood,” said Meena.Meena recently tested positive for Covid so Vaishnavi took over the task of keeping the water bowls filled. With a simple camera, Vaishnavi recorded the female lizard digging a hole and laying eggs. With a cell phone, Meena documented courtship rituals and mating as the lizards trust him totally and do not scamper away on his approach. Meena made a video of a frolicking lizard jumping in and out of a bowl enjoying a cooling splash just like skinny kids thronging a village tank! So endearing was the image posted by Meena on social media of cute little Khushank peering at a trusting male lizard — their faith in each other so evident — that it attracted raving comments. A thoughtful one from Dalia Bose: “What a brilliant moment when all comes to a standstill because Truth comes visiting in the form of a child and Nature, both spontaneous, marvellous beings”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/wild-buzz-love-for-lizards-101620498071650.html
08-05-2021||Chandigarh||Witerati :Much ado about O2 and OO||We are navigating a season of strange pandemic paradoxes. Paradoxes that seem so ‘pronounced’ that one may even stumble upon some pronunciations. With pandemic’s second season of Mother’s Day here, one can’t help but talk of certain ‘mothers of invention’, driving pandemic’s paradoxes. At a time when India Quarantining can scarce sniff through its nostrils, the world has, ironically, ‘smelt’ another sort of opportunity. At a time when India Gasping can scarce spell “smell” thanks to a national emergency sparked by O2, some smart brains in the West have churned out an ingenious invention replicating a much-missed smell – OO. The paradox of O2 versus OO. This is nothing but India suffering a scarcity of oxygen, on the one hand, and the rest of the #WorkFromHome world, on the other hand, discontented with a deficit of that daily smell – OO (office odour).Of Ooh-la-la odours Trust the world’s leading capitalist economy to hit upon the idea of capitalising on the woes of #wfh by rolling out scented candles that remind of familiar office-place smells and scents, thanks to American enterprise Eau d’ Office (this makes the paradox pretty pronounced, for it tosses up a problem for us pronunciation challenged, like yours truly, who’ve never really got it right when it comes to pronouncing eau de toilette, eau de cologne et al, and now here comes Eau d’ Office!) What’s a typically American gesture of gifting two exiting colleagues farewell candles created from a confluence of workplace odours – Breakfast Leftovers In Edit Suite 1, Sushi Thursday At The Café, After A 6-Hour Workshop etc – may smack of the fabled Marie Antoinette-sque “Let them eat cake” ring for India Inc. For, ironically, it is one invention idea about which India Inc isn’t in a position to wax eloquent. The curious case of Scentless in Seattle. Of O2 and oximeters Another app that’s proving to be a ‘Mother of Invention’ has to do with not OO, but O2. The other day, when a childhood friend called from Punjab, perched near farm houses lush, she did gush. So alarmed was she that we in the country’s Capital were struggling for not only oxygen cylinders, but also with many a related app and all such crap, that she egged me on, “Arre yaar, why this app-shapp, why not just go walk outdoors and get some fresh air!”OMG, the irony of O2! I was hard put to drive home the point, “Oh dear, you’re forgetting, we live in a polluted metropolis driving a double scarcity -- denizens are facing not only a scarcity of O2 inside (anatomically), but also low O2 outdoors (climatically)!“Hence, the oximeter!” This ground reality of ours spelt the other paradox.Whilst half of India Quarantining finds itself affixed to oxygen cylinders, the rest of the nation looks to be appended to that curious contraption called oximeter. When the world is wired to the oximeter, how can our quintessential quirky couple, Lollita and Lamba ji, not smell an opportunity here! Lollita goggles at Lamba ji flitting in and out of rooms in a state of being fully wired to the world -- his ears encased in earphones, mouth caterwauling casualty bulletins to cronies on the cellphone; and hands clipped to the Oximeter for his latest O2 bulletin. Exasperated by his bleat-bleat from the constant cellphone confabulation and by the beep-beep from his curious contraption, Lollita yanks off his earphones with a yell, “Curfew ... curfew!” Lamba ji gawks, alarmed as much as annoyed at being unplugged. “But the city’s already under curfew?” Lollita delivers the diktat, “You’re being placed under room curfew, lest you become an ‘oxy’ moron!” The curious case of For Whom the (Oximeter) Bells Toll!||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/witerati-much-ado-about-o2-and-oo-101620497109563.html
08-05-2021||Chandigarh||Random forays: Dear doctor, we are truly beholden||Dear doctor, We are truly beholden to you! For your unswerving steadfastness, for your untiring diehard service, for your professional diligence, for your unimaginable sacrifices, for your unflinching valour, for your undaunted courage, for your unruffled calmness, and for your caring humaneness. We know what you are going through, but we cannot fathom the extent of your angst. We cannot feel the ripples of your sweat. We cannot experience the pangs of heart wrenching pathos, that you do, at the sight of patients who are suffering. We cannot imagine the extent of the pressure that you are tackling upon your brave shoulders, in the face of all odds. Neither will we ever be able to understand the helplessness that you feel at often being let down by your own system. Along with you, this letter addresses the millions of other healthcare professionals, hospital administrators, nurses, ward boys, laboratory technicians, helpers, ambulance drivers, attendants, government officials, security forces et al, as also the zillions of lay volunteers, all of whom are the unsung heroes at the pinnacle of this quest to vanquish the dreaded, unseen, virulent foe. To each one you, we the people of the world, bow and pay gratitude in this hour of crisis. At a time when our nation feels hapless and helpless, you are the ones holding the fort, with fortitude, with dedication, with zeal. We are also aware that several people, out of a sense of despair or out of sheer lack of empathy, disparage you and your ilk at times. They shout at and even abuse you, with tempers soaring high. Lives are at stake, after all. Each individual is testy and his at wits end. And there are those who have let you down, from within your own flanks. Those who cannot handle the unending barrage of crossfire or the relentless surge of numbers, sheer numbers, unmanageable numbers. Those few who are unable to hold the torch high, even while a majority of you do. Then there are some who hoard, even plunder, whether within the system, or from the periphery of it. Yet, and this is more true than anything else, you just keep marching on. Even when your family is in tears, your children are howling, your parents are worried to bits, you simply keep soldiering on. You are human, yet super human, somehow. You wipe away your own tears, you swallow the lump in your throat, you shoo away any thought of weakness or frailty. The enemy continues to loom large and plunder those around you, stretching your forces to the hilt. But you make some inroads into enemy territory. You bounce back with renewed bouts of energy, new strategies, newer methodologies. You battle the odds when the odds are stacked against you. And you battle with great spirit and verve. Your smile seldom takes leave from your countenance, albeit under the ubiquitous mask. You somehow manage to summon from the depths of inner reserves, the wherewithal to remain gung-ho, full of hope and energy. You organise your thoughts and words, to assuage the feelings of those who seek strength and solace from you. You are aware that your every word, your every move, is being watched carefully by those who depend upon you and your calibre. You do not flinch even when all and sundry come armed with theories downloaded from God-knows-where, which are supposed to be superior to your know how and experience. Yet, and in the face of all that the raging contagion may throw at you, you are our bedrock. You are actually living the affirmation that Paramahansa Yogananda, author of the Autobiography of a Yogi, gave to the world: “I will stand unshaken, amidst the crash of breaking worlds!” Or, as missionary activist Joshua Graham said, “I survived because the fire inside me burned brighter than the fire around me…” We know too that this dastardly fire will be doused one day. Till then, we pray with all our might, for every one of you, and feel grateful. For your every act of kindness and fearlessness in this hour of tumult, we will forever be truly beholden to you.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/random-forays-dear-doctor-we-are-truly-beholden-101620496689656.html
08-05-2021||Chandigarh||Roundabout: Love, hope in the time of Covid||The debut novel of Gurmeet Karyalvi, a well-known and sensitive writer of Punjabi, opens with the harsh April sunshine of 2020 glaring at the board of Divine Light Public School, which seems wilted like the once dancing dahlia flowers in the school’s garden. Like the flowers, the school seems withered without the ringing laughter of children in smart uniforms, who have not stepped into its gates for many days now. While students, whose smiles and frolic would liven up the building, are nowhere to be found, one finds uniformed policemen deployed there: their faces harsher than before, larger than life and expressionless. This is how, Karyalvi, who was born and brought up, in the village of Karyala near Moga in the Malwa region of Punjab, starts the narrative of his novel Oh Ikki Din (Those Twenty-One Days) where a school has been turned into an isolation centre, as is now the case with most schools and colleges of the city. Officialdom now rules these places of learning and hope. The inmates after putting their belongings in appointed spaces are summoned to the school grounds to listen to essential announcements to be made by SDM sahib. As one holds Gurmeet’s novel in one’s hands looking at its beautiful cover with its distant hills and two masked faces, a woman and a man, looking longingly out of windows at a field of flowers, from which rises a menacing hand with gnarled fingers, many thoughts flit through the mind. This book reaches a year after the scene that the writer conjures takes place amid the first wave of the pandemic. Much has happened since and the people of India have travelled from hope to hopelessness during the brutal second wave, which is playing havoc with lives as Indians struggle to breathe. Sincerity of sensitive prose Readers of literature have revisited several books to make sense of these times from Albert Camus’ The Plague, The Diary Of Anne Frank, penned by an adolescent Jew girl in hiding with her family from the Nazi harbingers of death, as well as Gabriel Garcia Marques’ Love in the Times of Cholera. Yet the writer who tells the saga of 21 days in isolation holds his own with the sincerity of his sensitive prose in one of the first contemporary novels in the Punjabi language on the trying times humanity has been placed in the time of Covid, in spite of strides in development made all over the world. Gurmeet carries with him the name of his village Karyalvi, which is a common tradition in India and more so in Punjab where the writer is often known by the name of the village or town that he is born to. Many prominent writers have taken their villages and towns to heights of fame such as Urdu poet Sahir Ludhianvi, famous writer-editor Gurbax Singh Preetlari or this year’s Sahitya Akademi award winner, veteran Gurdev Singh Rupana. This is just to name a few. There have been instances where a person is known by the name of their poem, story or even a column as in the case of Baldev Singh Sadaknama or the one-story wonder Amar Singh ‘Kabarput’ (gravedigger). Perhaps in times to come one may find people referring to Karyalvi as Oh 21 dinan wala! As it is Kayralvi is an established prose writer with six collections of short stories to his credit, two books of prose set in the days of militancy in Punjab and several plays and stories for children besides penning poetry. However, this is the first novel by this sensitive writer who has struggled against class and caste prejudice to reach where he has. He has done the momentous task of not just making a name for himself but has also endeared himself to readers. Khushwant Bargarhi, founder of People’s Fourm publishing house near Faridkot, which distributes books to people at minimal rates each month, says of Gurmeet: “He is a writer of soil and richly conscious of social reality. His ease with language and a mastery over rural Punjabi idiom has always won the hearts of readers. His greatest gift is that he turns despair into hope.” Telling story of the times How did the seeds of this novel, which paints a vivid picture of officialdom at micro-level yet indicative to the macro-level, in which one has thrown the nation into the killing second wave as battles for power are being fought, get sowed in the writer’s mind? Gurmeet replies: “I work in the government’s welfare department and my wife is a staff nurse, so it was a very close encounter with the management of the pandemic and the plight of the people as they struggled in loneliness, locked indoors during this man-made crisis, which prompted me to record the story of the sad seasons that we are passing through. As a writer, it was my discovery of hope in the hearts of many that egged me further and I wrote it out in a month and a half!’ The characters the writer creates are true to life and the stress of the situation where people wait on mattresses placed at a social distance in the classrooms of the Divine Light Public School. True to life is also the narration of squabbles, discrimination, bureaucratic indifference, fear and despondency but in midst of all this blossoms the unsaid love story of Jinder and Amrit and hope that moves from a character named Anand who holds even in the bleakest of times that life will always triumph over death. nirudutt@gmail.com||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/roundabout-love-hope-in-the-time-of-covid-101620496210572.html
08-05-2021||Kolkata||Dhankar expresses displeasure at not being updated on law and order situation||West Bengal Governor Jagdeep Dhankhar Saturday expressed displeasure at not being updated on the law and order situation in the state with regard to post poll violence by the chief secretary and director general of police (DGP). State Chief Secretary Alapan Bandopadhyay and DGP Virendra called on the governor at Raj Bhavan on Saturday evening being asked by him over the law and order situation in West Bengal. "Unfortunately both came without any paper or reports sought. Directed them to send the same without delay. In a sense disgusted with such stance," Dhankhar tweeted after the officers met him. Maintaining that the home secretary has failed to apprise him on the law and order situation vis a vis the post-poll violence, Dhankhar had asked the chief secretary to see him. Dhankhar had tweeted earlier in the day that the home secretary did not forward reports of the DGP and commissioner of Kolkata Police in this regard. "Chief Secretary @MamataOfficial has been called upon to see me today before 7 PM as ACS Home @HomeBengal failed to impart status report on law and order regarding post poll violence," the governor tweeted. "Such drifting of governance @MamataOfficial from constitutional prescriptions is unfortunate and cannot be overlooked. While the State passes through most severe post poll violence, there is just NO input to the constitutional head. This is least expected," Dhankhar wrote.The West Bengal has been rocked by large scale violence after the bitterly fought state elections. Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee has said that 16 persons of different political parties have lost their lives in clashes after the end of the polls. A four-member team of the union home ministry, tasked with looking into reasons for the post-poll violence in Bengal, had met Dhankhar at Raj Bhawan.\||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/dhankar-expresses-displeasure-at-not-being-updated-on-law-and-order-situation-101620493426688.html

08-05-2021||Pune||Schools demand financial aid to remain afloat||School management and authorities across the city fear that a lack of state support in terms of financial package will adversely affect the schooling system in the city. On the background of parents demanding a reduction of school fees for the forthcoming term and the impending fear of state government crackdown if school fees are not reduced on compassionate ground, school authorities believe a financial package like the one given to other sectors must be provided. The establishments cost like rent, maintenance, payment of salaries to teachers and non-teaching staff has emerged as a cause of concern before schools as they gear up for a fresh academic year starting next month. “With fees trickling and many parents taking undue advantage of government and court orders, schools are struggling to meet their financial obligations.Apart from salaries and maintenance expenditure, we have to provide for technical upgradations too. The government is not giving any concession in electricity bills; at least they should compensate the schools to the tune of fee collection lost if any fee reduction is enforced. Schools will have to maintain their own standard,” said Benjamin Simon, principal, Kline Memorial School. According to Siddhi Mittal, principal of Sanskar Public School, Covid-19 has hit all sections of the society and school is one of them. “We have shut the schools as per the government order and online education is being imparted as per the state rule. We are paying heavy rent for the school, and it is a major challenge to meet the teachers and non-teaching salary and also maintenance plus other expenses. If any school employee contracts infection, we support them with our funds. Now with schools closed, it is only through fees we can keep ourselves afloat otherwise we all are in trouble. Our plea for taking complete fees must be considered on humanitarian grounds and concession can be granted to those in dire trouble,” Mittal said. “We also faced problems regarding rent, loan and infrastructure. We have waived the school fees of some needy and deserving school students as a humanitarian gesture during this tough period and are ready to extend any help needed to parents,” Mittal added. Deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar had ordered strict action against schools who fail to reduce fees on compassionate grounds for parents who are undergoing a severe financial condition.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/schools-demand-financial-aid-to-remain-afloat-101620492608867.html

08-05-2021||Pune||State to conduct drone surveys to promote tourism and monitor encroachment around dams||The Maharashtra water resource department has decided to use drone surveys for tourism planning, encroachment monitoring, asset mapping, and post disaster mapping and planning of mitigation measures among other things. The government has prepared a Model Request for Proposal (MRP) and set a deadline to complete the survey within 22 months after assigning work to agency. The state government has issued an order to carry out the drone surveys in respective divisions. There are more than 3,000 small, medium and large dams spread across the state. According to the water resources department, drone surveys can be helpful for mapping of such locations, generate 3D views and available facilities which can further be put online for promotion of tourism. Currently, most of the activities are performed manually in the conventional manner which is a time-consuming activity. The huge amount of time and human effort are invested in the manual environment which results in a delay at different stages of the project which directly impacts the entire project life cycle. Tourism planning Dams and their surrounding environment naturally provide for a scenic tourism venue. However, considering the location constraints and the land available with the Water Resource Department (WRD), tourism activities would be feasible at select locations only. Drone surveys can be helpful for mapping of such locations, generate 3D views and available facilities which can further be put online for promotion of tourism. This can be a revenue generating activity for the state and monitoring of the activities, adds to safety measures, and prevents encroachment. Increase revenue Rajendra Mohite, chief superintendent engineer of WRD said, “We have good backwater areas which can be utilized for tourism purposes. We can develop tourist spots on the Private public partnership (PPP) model. It will help to get additional revenue to the department.” Mohite added, “Day by Day, the water resources department is facing a manpower crunch. The survey will help to give accurate areas of the dam’s backwater, irrigated and non-irrigated area. In Pune district, Maharashtra Krishna Valley development corporation (MKVDC) carried out a successful drone survey. Every irrigation corporation gets money from water taxes from irrigated and non-irrigated areas. We have to use funds for dam, canal maintenance from these revenue resources. Drone surveys will help to boost revenue as well as keep watch on illegal practices such as water theft, encroachment on rivers.” Integrate data with GIS TN Munde, chief superintendent engineer of Pune water resources division said, “The drone survey will mainly focus on project progress monitoring. It includes an evidence-based project progress monitoring system. The data can then be integrated with GIS for location specific, site specific and works specific services. The GIS tag and geometry enabled video and report data regarding project information and relevant documents.” “Maharashtra Water Resources Department’s (WRD) projects are in areas which can promote tourism, proper planning will help in facilitating tourism as well as protecting the catchment areas and its assets,” he added. The various potential works identified for which WRD intends to use aerial / drone based geospatial technology mapping are such as project progress monitoring of ongoing WRD projects, inspection of safety and health of dams and other irrigation structures, 3D mapping of WRD assets, planning for tourism related activities, water quality monitoring, catchment area management, project irrigation potential analysis, post-disaster mapping and planning of mitigation measures and assessment of crops for irrigation billing. Water quality and encroachments The survey will include finding out illegal sources of irrigation and encroachment. The agency will mark the illegal source of irrigation from the canal, mark the illegal source of irrigation from reservoir, mark the illegal source of irrigation from the river, mark the gaps in canal network, identify and mark the leakages in the canal network and mark the encroachment into the river, reservoirs WRD land and colonies. Drone surveys will be used for assessing water quality. It could monitor water bodies. Remote sensing imageries can be used to measure the qualitative parameters of water bodies such as turbidity, water temperature (WT), pollutants, floating materials, weeds. Drones can map the water surface and aquatic weeds on the dam water surface, map the water turbidity, assess dam environment health, monitor the expansion of the vegetation in the dam over the period.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/state-to-conduct-drone-surveys-to-promote-tourism-and-monitor-encroachment-around-dams-101620492128771.html

Thus, villagers are more prone to rapid infection.”“Most villages in Haryana had been hit by the pandemic and the number of deaths had been mounting steadily. Villages are being neglected completely as doctors and paramedical staff posted in health centres there, have been deputed at hospitals in towns and cities,” said the former minister, who had joined BJP in 2019.Terming management of the pandemic “utterly unsatisfactory and ineffective”, he asked the Centre and the state government to redouble their efforts to meet the challenge posed by the second wave of Covid-19.He said that government should focus on managing the situation and apply all its resources since the situation is extremely critical.“The government had taken the first wave of the pandemic lightly. The health infrastructure was not ramped up and the government stopped consulting health professionals,” he added.“This criminal neglect resulted in the second wave hitting the country. The situation is now out of control and the government seemed helpless and clueless,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/haryanas-rural-areas-hit-by-covid-totally-neglected-sampat-singh-101620491949264.html

Addressing media persons, JMM principal general secretary Supriyo Bhattacharya said instead of pointing fingers towards chief minister Hemant Soren for his statement after the phone call with Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the BJP’s elected representatives from the state should help the government in getting what it requires to fight the pandemic. “Be it providing adequate number of vaccines, essential drugs, oxygen cylinders or installing oxygen plants under PM Cares fund, the state’s requirements are not being fulfilled. We require 4.5 crore doses of vaccines, but till date we have received only 29.83 lakh doses. The Centre made budgetary provision of ₹35,000 crore for vaccination, but now states have been burdened to bear the cost for inoculation of 18-44 age group,” he said. He further said the state received only 29,524 vials of Remdesivir against its demand of 4,28,500 vials till now. The state requisitioned for installation of 21 oxygen plants under PM Cares but were allowed only four of them, work for which was yet to start, the JMM leader claimed. “The BJP has 16 MPs from the state (12 Lok Sabha and four from Rajya Sabha). We only have four MPs, two in each house. They also have 25 MLAs. Instead of getting worked up by what the CM wanted to tell the PM, the BJP’s elected representatives should go to the PM and the health minister and lobby to get what the state deserves. If they are willing to go, we will provide them a charter plane to go to Delhi,” Bhattacharya said. Several BJP leaders, including Union ministers and chief ministers of other states, besides local leaders hit out at CM Hemant Soren for his recent statement on social media platform Twitter, saying that the PM only spoke his ‘mann ki baat’ when he called on Thursday “instead of listening” what the former had to share about the Covid situation in the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ranchi-news/will-provide-charter-plane-if-bjp-leaders-are-willing-to-meet-pm-seek-help-jmm-101620486968472.html

These cases were detected after testing 322,392 samples with positivity rate stood at 13.68%, meaning thereby that to every 100 samples tested, 13.68 returned positive.The lockdown’s second week (April 29-May 5), however, was more stricter as exempted trade activities were allowed only till 2 pm with only exception to medicine shops and petrol pumps.The growth of positive cases dipped this week as the state unearthed 41,626 cases registering a decline of 5.68% in comparison to the previous week, when 44,133 cases were reported. The disease’s positivity rate, however, didn’t go down but jumped to 16.25% from the previous week of 13.68% as the 41,626 odd cases were discovered after testing 256,134 samples.The rising positivity rate, however, is the real cause of concern for the state as it indicates the rapid spread of the infection.The state reported weekly positivity rates of 4.85%, 7.16%, 10.96%, 13.68% and 16.25% respectively in April 1-7, April 8-14, April 15-21, April 22-28 and April 29-May 5.Health experts, however, opined that the lockdown has greatly impacted the fast spread of the infection.Dr Dewesh Kumar, assistant professor of department of preventive and social medicine RIMS, said, “The lockdown has definitely slowed down the spread of the disease. If we see the results of sample tests conducted at RIMS laboratory, we can say that positivity rate has gone down. We had seen positivity rate as high as 45% on April 17, when 278 positive cases were detected after testing 605 samples. This has gradually came down and on Saturday, we saw only 72 samples tested positive out of total 360. Besides, we have noticed that there has been a significant decline in number of people seeking beds and Remdesivir injections. This shows positive trend as the rush in hospitals is gradually waning.”Dr Kumar said, “We should wait for at least one more week to see the real impact as there is three-four days of delay in test reports. Results of samples collected today will come after three-four days. So, a real assessment could be done atleast after three-four weeks.”According to Kumar, the peak of cases has already come in Jharkhand.“I personally feel that the state has attained the peak and now the cases will decline. Due to lockdown, the growth trajectory would remain flat but high number of cases will keeping coming till May end,” he said.Dr Kumar also indicated that there would be a rise in death toll as according to him the peak in deaths come atleast 10 days after the peak of positive cases.”Jharkhand has been witnessing a continuous rise in number of covid-19 deaths since early April. It reported 38, 141, 317, 786 and 951 deaths respectively in April 1-7, April 8-14, April 15-21, April 22-28 and April 29-May 5.According to health department’s covid-19 bulletin of May 8 morning, the state has so far reported 276062 cases including 211270 recoveries, 61177 active cases and 3615 deaths.BOXBefore and after lockdownWeek.

On Friday, Yadav, who had been visiting different parts of the state to expose the lack of preparedness in dealing the Covid situation, visited Amnour in Saran and allegedly found over 30 ambulances with ‘MPLADS-2019’ marked on them. “There are over 30 ambulances here. There were more earlier, but they have been moved. Overall, close to 100 ambulances were parked here. We want to know why they were not being used… this is not about Rudyji or Pappu… this is about people of Bihar. The entire state is reeling under impact of Covid,” Yadav said. A video on social media shows Yadav walking around the parked vehicles, removing tarpaulin covering them. Rudy said the ambulances were lying unused for want of drivers. “There are not 60, 70 or 100 ambulances, but only 20. And they are not being used because we don’t have drivers. Pappu Yadav… you can take all the ambulances, but promise the people of Saran that you will find and employ drivers for all of them,” he said. “These are the ambulances which were returned by the panchayats as they were not in used.” “We have a fleet of 75-80 ambulances of which 50-55 are running. The people of the district have never suffered for want of ambulance. Not many drivers volunteer to drive with a Covid patient. I have written to Saran district magistrate to provide me with drivers,” Rudy said. Yadav, however, hit back. On Saturday, he presented before the media 40 people with their driving licences who were willing to run the ambulances. He alleged that panchayats that did not vote for the MP were asked to return the ambulances. Yadav found support from CPI-ML and the RJD. “This is BJP’s way of development. The matter should be probed,” said CPI-ML state secretary Kunal. “He could have donated (the ambulances) to a hospital or NGO,” RJD spokesperson Mritunjay Tiwari said. The Congress too backed Yadav. AICC media panellist and MLC Prem Chandra Mishra said criminal proceedings should be initiated against Rudy for using the MP fund like his own money. “Discretionary quota fund is managed by the local district authorities and the MP/MLA concerned has no role in deciding the course of purchase or use of the articles purchased from the fund,” said Mishra.“It would expose the nefarious designs of the state government if any action is taken against Yadav for expose the corrupt practices adopted by the BJP leader,” said Mishra.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/pappu-raids-rudy-s-area-for-ambulances-booked-101620486788503.html

There are queues in cremation ghats and graveyards, say those who have performed the last rites of their near and dear ones. While the figures of Covid deaths come mostly from the dedicated Covid government hospitals, figures of death registration from Patna alone points to the growing fatalities, coinciding with the spurt in Covid cases. The incomplete figures of death registration in Patna Municipal Corporation (PMC) area alone in just six days, from May 1 to 6 (till 2.20 pm), stands at 795, of which 512 were male and 283 female. It does not include the figures of Gulbi ghat since April 30. Similarly, the death registration figures of Bans Ghat have not been updated online since April 23, say officials. Anup Kumar Sharma, registrar-cum-chief medical officer, Patna Municipal Corporation (PMC), said updating figures online takes some time. It is not reflected online as to how many of the 795 deaths are Covid-related, though it is supposed to be mentioned in the register manually, but officials say the figures are quite high compared to normal days. “There are six places under PMC for which figures are updated online. They include Pataliputra, Bankipore, Kankarbagh, Nutan Anchal, Patna City and headquarters. Some are pending at present, but the uploaded figures so far show 795 deaths registered in just first six days of the month,” Sharma said. He said that from April 1-30, 1626 deaths were registered online. Of them, 1004 were male and 622 female. According to official health department figures, over 62 people lost their life due to Covid infection in Bihar in the past 24 hours, including 19 in Patna, while 13,455 fresh cases got reported. The official figures put the total death toll in Bihar so far to 3,139. On Tuesday last, the casualty figures had breached 100-mark in the state, as per health department figures. A senior official said that the crematoriums were working round-the-clock and it would be difficult to assess the figures of Covid-related deaths out of the total, considering that many deaths are also taking place at home without proper testing or due to difficulty in admission in hospitals. ”Death registration is poor in India as a whole, and more so in Bihar. Besides, the cause of death is often not confirmed by a medical practitioner if the deaths are reported at home,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/death-registration-in-may-shoots-up-in-patna-101620486728462.html

The samples were collected on Wednesday after owner of Suba Singh poultry farm informed the administration about the mysterious death of 1,500 birds. As the report confirming presence of bird flu arrived on Friday evening, deputy commissioner Varinder Kumar Sharma declared the area within a kilometre of the epicentre as infected zone and 1-10km as surveillance zone. Ordering culling of 90,000 birds at the farm, he also constituted a nine-member committee to oversee the process and ensure that no bird, unprocessed poultry meat, eggs, feed or any other material was taken out from the poultry farm. The committee headed by Khanna additional deputy commissioner Sakatar Singh Bal took stock of the situation at the farm on Saturday. Bal said 20 teams of the animal husbandry department will start the culling operation in two shifts from Sunday. With a target of 4,000-6,000 birds a day, the process should be completed in around three weeks, he added. A highly contagious viral disease, avian influenza has many strains. But, most of them are mild and may only cause low egg production or other mild symptoms among birds. However, some are severe and cause deaths of large number of birds. Generally, people coming in close contact with infected alive or dead birds contract the flu, and it does not usually spread from person to person, according to the World Health Organization, which has also said that there is no evidence that the disease can be spread to people through properly prepared and cooked poultry food.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/bird-flu-detected-at-farm-in-punjab-s-ludhiana-90-000-birds-to-be-culled-101620482769297.html

Banerjee’s comments came at her first speech at the legislative assembly after taking charge as the chief minister of the state for the third time on May 5. “Since the time of TN Seshan, I have seen the ECI working to prevent rigging during polls. Now it is just the opposite. In some places, the rigging was done with the direct help of the poll panel. This is unfortunate and shameful. Elections need to be reformed immediately. I have been fighting for this since 1995. I am once again giving a call for this. Three nominated persons along with a few retired officers are giving transfer orders on paper chits. This should not happen. Else democracy can’t be saved,” Banerjee said. Veteran TMC leader Biman Banerjee took oath as the speaker of the assembly on Saturday. BJP legislators, however, boycotted the session to protest against the poll violence in the state in which at least 16 persons were killed till Thursday. “They aren’t ashamed that people have boycotted them. I can challenge that they (BJP) wouldn’t have won even 30 seats had ECI not directly helped them,” the chief minister said. The Trinamool Congress in the state has been at loggerheads with the ECI with the ruling party repeatedly accusing the poll panel of working at the behest of the BJP-led government at the centre.Poll panel officials in Kolkata refused to comment on the chief minister’s remarks in the assembly. Earlier in March, however, Deputy Election Commissioner Sudeep Jain had written a letter to the TMC chief, asking her to refrain from making accusations against the poll panel. “We will not attend the speaker’s election. We will also not attend the sessions of the House. We will not come to the assembly till our MLAs get full protection... We will only come when our MLAs will be able to walk alongside our workers,” Dilip Ghosh, BJP’s state president had told the media on Friday.Turning her guns at the Bharatiya Janata Party-led Union government, the TMC supremo accused the centre of behaving in a step-motherly attitude while alleging that oxygen produced in the state was being diverted to other states. “They are not being able to accept the people’s mandate and that’s why they are behaving like this. This is not shameful but has also raised a big question on our democracy,” she said. In the recently ended the TMC won for the third consecutive time winning 213 out of the 292 seats where elections were held. The BJP, which had set a target to win more than 200 seats, could manage only 77. “What if Maharashtra says today that we won’t allow vaccines produced in our state to go out? It cannot happen that way. The TMC should think about a larger perspective. This is a crisis period and the centre is helping each and every state to fight the pandemic,” said Jay Prakash Majumdar, BJP’s state vice president.Ministers of the new cabinet would be sworn in on Monday, the chief minister said. The first cabinet meeting would be also held on the same day.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/elections-in-india-need-immediate-reform-mamata-banerjee-101620480128720.html

Cases rose by 4,01,078, bringing the nation's healthcare system to the brink of collapse, with a scarcity of hospital beds, medicines and oxygen.The Adani Group is ramping up its efforts in India's battle against the pandemic."As soon as the second COVID wave hit India, the Adani Group began leveraging its overseas connections to procure hard-to-find supplies of critical essentials like medical oxygen and transportable cryogenic containers," the spokesperson said.It procured 48 cryogenic tanks from leading manufacturers in countries like Saudi Arabia, Thailand, Singapore, Taiwan and UAE.While some of these large cryogenic tanks were shipped in through the group's Mundra Port in Gujarat, others were airlifted into the country with the help of the Indian Air Force, which deployed its biggest transport aircraft for these time-critical operations.These cryogenic tanks are a vital addition to the hardware India sorely needed to manage the medical oxygen requirements of patients across the country.Even as the group continues its relentless search for more of these cryogenic tanks, the tanks imported so far are already in the service of the nation, ferrying precious liquid oxygen round-the-clock from filling centres to wherever it is needed, in accordance with distribution lists and directions from the government."Our rail and road logistics infrastructure is playing a critical role in the efficient last-mile delivery of these life-saving supplies," said the spokesperson. "The Adani Group has also partnered with global oxygen producers like Linde and Air Products to quickly refill and despatch liquid oxygen to all corners of India by the fastest means available."The Adani Group is also sourcing high-throughput oxygen generator plants and oxygen concentrators. Sixteen of these independent oxygen plants and 300 oxygen concentrators will be pressed into service in the next few days.In several states and districts, the group is also refilling and distributing thousands of medical oxygen cylinders every day to augment and fill gaps in the local oxygen supply chain.Subsequently, Adani Ports, announced priority berthing and unloading for vessels carrying COVID-related cargos and waived storage, handling, and vessel-related charges.In Gujarat, where the Adani Group is headquartered, the group has intensified its focus on the provision of direct medical care. To reduce the systemic overload on Ahmedabad's hospital infrastructure, the Adani Foundation has converted the Adani Vidya Mandir school into an emergency COVID Care Centre with oxygen support and catered food.Equipped with doctors, nurses, paramedics and support staff, this first-responder care facility is housing infected and moderately ill COVID patients. Isolating patients when they are at their most infectious will also help to break the chain of infection and significantly curtail the spread of the disease.In Kutch, India's largest district, the battle against COVID is being led from Bhuj by the GAIMS (Gujarat Adani Institute of Medical Sciences), the principal medical facility serving this remote part of western India. The Adani Foundation has upgraded and converted GAIMS into a 100 per cent COVID hospital with all its 800 beds equipped with oxygen support."This hospital has become a medical oasis for the thousands of people in Kutch and its neighbouring districts. We have installed three oxygen plants and a fourth one would be available soon. This is in addition to liquid oxygen supplies being provided by the Adani Group," said Vasant Gadhvi, Director, GAIMS. "Many of our personnel have lost family members to COVID but they have put aside their personal grief to continue working for 12 to 14 hours each day."The Adani Hospital in Mundra has been similarly upgraded into a 100 per cent COVID hospital with an additional CT-scanner installed to diagnose COVID faster. Its bed capacity has been doubled and all its beds have been converted into oxygen beds.This hospital serves not only the people of Mundra but also the residents of 20 neighbouring villages whose medical care alternatives are limited.Within the Adani Group's operations, all employees and their family members have been brought into the Group's free vaccination programme. The Group has also extended its vaccination drive to include the thousands of people living in and around its corporate headquarters at Shantigram in Ahmedabad.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/adani-group-procures-48-oxygen-carrying-tanks-for-fight-against-covid19-101620478926413.html

The court directed the Union health secretary to furnish details about the distribution of Remdesivir, Favipiravir and Tocilizumab and apprise it of reasons why states with a less population and fewer Covid patients were getting more allocation of medicines than Himachal Pradesh. The court directed the state to provide details of the distribution of oxygen for the past two weeks besides its plan to augment the supply. It asked the state to ensure the uploading of real time data on bed availability in each hospital for Covid-19 patients on its web portals besides those of hospitals and also physically display the data outside each hospital daily. Writ petition highlighted lack of oxygen facilities The division bench, comprising justice Tarlok Singh Chauhan and justice Chander Bhusan, passed these orders on a writ petition highlighting the issue of the lack of oxygen facilities at Dr YS Parmar Government Medical College, Nahan, and the non-functioning of 25 ventilators that have been given to the college under the HIM Care Scheme. The court directed the state government to publish the names and locations of the testing centres, hospitals, dedicated Covid health care centres in the media bulletin daily. The bulletin should clearly indicate the availability of total beds, vacant ones, beds with ventilators, oxygen cylinders and beds without any oxygen tank/cylinder in each hospital, dedicated Covid health care centres. State to act tough if private hospitals don’t cooperate The court clarified that if private hospitals refuse to cooperate, or are reluctant to provide Covid test and facilities, the state government shall resort to coercive steps as provided under the Disaster Management Act and Essential Services Maintenance Act. It directed that the state should also consider buying additional CT scan machines. The court directed the state to furnish information regarding bed capacity for Covid-19 facilities in government and private hospitals along with the details of the availability of oxygen (high flow or otherwise). The state was asked to give details of steps taken and proposed to augment the availability of oxygen, meeting both the present and projected requirements.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/explain-bias-in-covid-drug-distribution-hc-to-centre-101620476648415.html

There are around 290 prisoners in the jail which includes some foreigners from Bangladesh, Myanmar and African countries, HT has learnt. Now, most of the inmates will go through Rapid Antigen Test for detecting the Covid-19 virus. Some more are expected to test positive because they are suffering from mild fever and other issues. Superintendent of Karimganj District Jail, Sanjeev Kumar Chetia has confirmed the news. Talking to Hindustan Times, the superintendent said, “It all started when we noticed some of the inmates were suffering from mild fever and other issues. We requested the district health department to test them and find if the inmates are Covid-19 positive. But we have almost 300 inmates and it is not possible to test everyone at the same time. So the district administration started conducting the test in a phased manner. On the first day, 6 people tested positive and yesterday 28 more found infected. Now, this process will go on and the number may increase in the coming days”.Apart from the local prisoners, there are few detained foreigners kept in Karimganj District Jail. It includes Bangladeshis, Myanmar nationals of the Rohingya community, people from African countries like Nigeria, Ghana and Angola. Most of them were arrested while they tried to cross the Indo-Bangladesh international border located along the district. The African Nationals include some women as well. They were arrested because they entered into the Indian territory without any valid document, Chetia said. About the source of the virus, the jail superintendent believes, there are multiple possibilities. He said, “The family members can be one of the sources because the prisoners get a chance to meet their family members often. The family members come to jail almost every week and they bring food and other stuff along with them. This can be one of the sources for the virus to enter inside the jail. We are also trying to find other possibilities so that we can prevent it in future.”Regarding the treatment of covid positive prisoners, he said, “The prisoners who tested positive have been given a place for isolation at the jail premises. They are being given the treatment there, doctors from the district administration are looking after the treatment part. Required medicines are being supplied by the district health department. But if there are issues like oxygen shortage, breathing problem or lung infection, the person will be sent to Covid-19 ICU in Silchar Medical College and Hospitals for better treatment. But there will be strict security arrangements during the entire process.”There was a similar situation in Silchar Central Jail last year. More than a hundred prisoners tested positive in a span of a week in August. Some of them were sent to Silchar Medical College & Hospitals because they were critical and needed treatment in ICU. The district administration arranged proper security arrangement for the treatment of prisoners at SMCH.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/covid19-outbreak-at-assam-s-karimganj-district-jail-34-prisoners-test-positive-101620475209043.html

On Saturday, farmer union activists gathered at various places in the city and adjoining areas, including Goniana. The farmers held protests, but markets remained shut. Unwise to oppose curbs: Beopar Mandal Punjab Pradesh Beopar Mandal president Amit Kapoor denied any talks with farm union leaders to oppose lockdown. “Coronavirus is spreading at an alarming rate, and it is unwise to oppose the restrictions.

08-05-2021||Mumbai||Despite curbs daily average of cases over 50,000 in Maharashtra: Rajesh Tope||Over three weeks have passed since the Maharashtra government imposed strict restrictions to check the spread of coronavirus but the daily average of cases is still over 50,000 which is a matter of concern, state Health Minister Rajesh Tope said on Saturday.Citing the Union government, Tope said Covid-19 cases have dipped in 12 out of the total 36 districts in Maharashtra, but in some other districts, the cases are on a higher side.The lockdown-like curbs announced by Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray came into effect on April 14 that included the ban on inter-city as well as inter-district travel and the closure of non-essential services in the state.These measures, including the weekend restrictions on the movement of people, were later extended till May 15.The state government had allowed groceries, vegetable shops and dairies to remain open only for four hours, between 7 am and 11 am from Monday to Friday and banned home delivery after 8 pm till May 1."The government had introduced lockdown-like measures but the average number of daily cases is still hovering between 50,000 and 60,000. The positivity rate, which is the key factor in deciding the (extent of) outbreak of the pandemic, is still on a higher side," Tope told reporters.The health minister said the government will review the situation and decide on whether to extend these lockdown-like measures or not."The state government is stressing on tracking, tracing and treating Covid-19 patients to curb the outbreak," he added.As of May 7, Maharashtra's Covid-19 tally stood at 49,96,758 while the overall death toll is 74,413. The state had tested 2,89,30,580 samples so far, the health department had said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/despite-curbs-daily-average-of-cases-over-50-000-in-maharashtra-rajesh-tope-101620466290327.html

During the hearing of the PIL on Friday, the HC directed the state government to resume the vaccination for the third phase based on a 1/3 ratio for Antyodaya, BPL and APL categories of people, the official said.In its order on May 4, the HC directed the state government to fix a reasonable ratio of allotment of vaccines for the Antyodaya group along with the BPL and the APL group in terms of vulnerability, chance to spread the disease and the number of eligible persons. In compliance with that order, the state government constituted a high-level committee of secretaries headed by state chief secretary Amitabh Jain, it said.The HC while hearing further on this matter on Friday, justified the state government’s concern towards the poor and directed the committee, constituted under the chief secretary, to submit its recommendation at the earliest, thereafter, the next hearing will be held, the release said.Keeping in view the Covid-19 crisis pandemic and considering the time required for the high-level committee to submit its recommendations, the HC has directed the state government to carry out vaccination under Phase-3 for people under the age group of 18-44 years based on 1/3 ratio for Antyodaya, BPL and APL categories of people, till the committee submits its recommendation, as an interim measure, it said.The state government has decided to establish separate vaccination centres for Antyodaya, BPL and APL groups under phase-3 inoculation drive, it said.At the vaccination centres fixed for Antyodaya and BPL category people, the beneficiaries should visit for vaccination along with ID/documents and ration cards. At the centres for the APL category, people will have to bring IDs mandated by the central government, such as Aadhaar, PAN card and any other valid documents, but they’ll not have to produce ration cards, it said.Since the state government has received 1.5 lakh doses of vaccines as of now for the third phase, the drive will continue till the vaccines are exhausted and will start inoculation again when vaccine doses will be available. Accordingly, notices will be displayed at vaccination centres, it added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/after-hc-order-18-44-age-group-vaccination-to-resume-in-chhattisgarh-101620466207503.html

08-05-2021||Delhi||Second Covid-19 wave leaves pets orphaned||The second wave of the coronavirus pandemic has wreaked havoc. Many animals have been orphaned, losing their humans to the pandemic. As families struggle to cope with the loss of loved ones, these pets suddenly find themselves abandoned.  “There are lots of requests coming in for dog adoptions and foster care as the parents have passed away or are recovering from the infection,” says Anuradha Dogra from Animal Hospital and Shelter, NOIDA. And a few good folks in the city are volunteering to look after such fur babies. One such resident and pet parent to two dogs, Parul Taneja from Faridabad, had put a post on social media willing to foster says, “Ever since I posted, my inbox has been flooded with messages for adoptions where the parents are no more.” But for those who can’t foster and are coming across such incidents, Dogra suggests passing on information of abandoned pets to animal welfare association of the area, and with animal-care volunteers instead of directly posting on social media. She says, “There needs to be thorough check before giving for adoption to avoid going to a breeder, or getting re-abandoned because they are adult dogs—so they need to be aware of the behaviour and temperament.” Another animal-care volunteer, Ruchi Gupta echoes similar sentiment and says, “Alert the RWA and then best is to connect with rescue organisations or volunteers from the area.”However, before approaching organisations, Achal Gupta, founder, Jeffurry’s:The Pet Resort advises to personally reconfirm the details. “There have been a few posts for dog adoptions doing the rounds but instead of simply re-sharing, please ensure and cross-check that the dog is in reality left to nobody as these cases are rare only with couples or individuals,” says Gupta who has had 45-50 dogs in the last few weeks being fostered while the parents were recovering.The grief of losing owners and then getting adopted into a new family can be a traumatic experience as Dr Vivek Arora, veterinary surgeon points out. He says, “The loss of the family members and the presence into a house, new level of hierarchy, confidence and faith into complete new parents – all adds to the pet’s pain.” He furthers adds that the pet could be under stress also due to the overexposure with the owners in the last year as he states, “The last 10-12 months, we did not go out and what was meant to be 6-8 hour contact suddenly became 24 hour contact [between the pet and parent] and then losing them, so the pet takes a little longer to settle and new family needs to be patient.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/second-covid-19-wave-leaves-pets-orphaned-101620462249257.html

Farooq Ahmad, the founder of Help Poor Voluntary Trust, said all of their 300 oxygen machines and cylinders have been pressed into service for the treatment of Covid-19 patients. He added though they are trained to meet any exigencies dealing with the pandemic has been tough. Ahmad said they often get calls for help in the middle of the night invariably for patients with low oxygen levels. “We try to stabilise patients first at home and then shift them to hospitals in our critical care ambulances,” said Ahmad, whose organisation has a fleet of 12 ambulances. Authrout, which helped establish the 100-bed hospital, also has a network of volunteers who have been virtually working non-stop particularly for those in need of oxygen. “We are trying our best to help the people and our helpline is working 24x7. At times, we did not even get to have proper sleep as our phones keep ringing,” said a volunteer of the organisation. Social Reform Organisation (SRO), which was established in 2004 to work for 2005 earthquake victims, has been providing oxygen concentrators, cylinders and medical equipment to Covid-19 patients. Javeed Ahmad Dar, the SRO chairman, said they get around 150 distress calls every 24 hours and have helped provide almost 750-900 patients oxygen support over the last month. The NGO has also provided ambulance service to around 700 patients. “[We are also] providing other relief measures and supplying lifesaving drugs to many Covid patients. We also arranged plasma for many Covid patients...” J&K Yateem Foundation has been providing services, especially in Srinagar and Bandipora districts. “We...[have helped] the poor, needy and the destitute for the last 21 years. ...Covid-19 came up as a new challenge. In the beginning, due to lockdown, daily wagers faced difficult times...[and we provided them] food... Currently, the situation is different...now people ask for oxygen concentrators and we have stepped in to provide this facility too. Due to the non-availability of oxygen concentrators in the market, the organisation could not get more machines. We have 40 machines running and ordered more,” said Javeed Jawaad, one of the volunteers of the foundation. “We even gave oxygen cylinders to the district administration in Bandipora.” Sikh Volunteers Kashmir has been distributing food packets at hospitals and Covid centres. It has also helped conduct 60 cremations across Kashmir and runs a 24x7 helpline for Covid-19 patients. “We have been working for the last year and have procured 24 oxygen machines and 50 cylinders. We arrange medicines, meals and cremations across Kashmir and resources are arranged through voluntary contributions. Our group is being run by doctors and professionals,” said Jagjeet Singh, a volunteer. Falah-u-Darein, a volunteer group established two decades ago in Baramulla to help the poor, too, has stepped in to help Covid-19 patients. “We have 35 oxygen concentrators and 10 cylinders which are all with the patients. We only provide oxygen machines to people on the advice of doctors, which has helped many and there is no crisis in our area,” sayid Asif Aziz, a volunteer of the group. .||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/volunteers-step-in-to-help-deal-with-the-pandemic-in-kashmir-101620460447128.html
08-05-2021||Kolkata||Mamata Banerjee bats for universal Covid-19 vaccine programme||West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee on Saturday criticised the Centre over the Covid-19 vaccination programme and said there should be a universal inoculation programme for everyone throughout the country. " ₹30,000 crores is nothing for the central government... There should be a universal vaccine program for all throughout the country," Banerjee said in the state assembly."Universal vaccination should have been the priority of the Centre, but it's spending ₹50,000 crore on new Parliament building, PM's residence, etc," Banerjee said.Banerjee alleged that the Centre did not work in the last six months. "The Centre did not work in the last six months. Ministers came to Bengal every day to capture it," she added.Banerjee-led Trinamool Congress (TMC) won 213 seats in the just concluded West Bengal Assembly elections. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) garnered 77 seats in the 294-seat state assembly.Banerjee has earlier urged the Centre for free universal vaccination across the country. "The Covid management is my priority. There is a shortage of vaccine supply. Approximately 65% of vaccines being produced in India were already sent overseas. Still, we are vaccinating 50,000 people a day," she added.Banerjee had said that the Centre should provide the Covid-19 vaccine for free to every citizen. ""We have demanded 3 crore vaccine doses from the Centre. I feel the vaccine should be provided free to the 140-crore people of India. I request the Centre to sanction ₹30,000 crore for a vaccine program for all throughout the country. I believe ₹30,000 crore does not matter to the central government. If a portion of the money that they spent in the election was invested for Covid vaccine then the universal vaccination would have already been done," she added.West Bengal on Friday registered its highest single-day spike of 19,216 Covid-19 cases, which pushed the tally to 9,54,282, the health department said. 112 more people succumbed to the infection, taking the total number of fatalities to 12,076, the department said in its bulletin.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/mamata-banerjee-bats-for-universal-covid-19-vaccine-programme-101620456736097.html
08-05-2021||Mumbai||From cradling a baby to monitoring Covid: This Mumbai doctor does it all||The mask digs deep furrows into his face, the shield fogs up his glasses and the PPE suit weighs him down in the humidity. The hours run into one another, uncomfortable and difficult at various levels, but it’s all in a day’s work for Dr Amol Pawar. As the second wave of the pandemic ravages large parts of India, it’s about sweat and tears - quite literally - for millions of healthcare workers at the frontline of the war against Covid-19. They have walked the tightrope between looking after patients and trying to dodge infection for more than a year. And it isn’t ending anytime soon. Pawar, obstetrician and gynaecologist at the Nowrosjee Wadia Maternity Hospital in Mumbai’s Parel locality, is but one face of India’s gravest health crisis yet. Sometimes gently cradling a newborn baby and comforting a patient and other times conferring with colleagues on a particularly difficult case or counselling relatives, the 44-year-old is a familiar figure for regulars at the 450-bed hospital. There are 35 beds in the Covid ward and 15 in the isolation ward. Hundreds of Covid patients have passed through the maternity hospital, which had to include a Covid ward last year in May when cases began rising. “The first case came in mid-April but we transferred the case to the Nair hospital nearby as there were no facilities in our hospital. On May 10, we started a Covid-19 ward. Since then, we’ve seen around 513 cases in this hospital,” Pawar told PTI. Working at least eight hours a day, six days a week and on call 24X7, he wears his discomfort and his responsibilities lightly.  “The eight hours are really packed at the hospital… new admissions, discharges, rounds and monitoring medicines for patients, and now even the vaccination drive. We have to do all this while ensuring we don’t contract the virus,” he said. In September last year, he did. He was admitted to the Seven Hills hospital in Andheri and was there for three weeks. He was on oxygen support for four days and after that got back to work through calls and guidance to his assistant.Pawar, like many of his colleagues, has now been vaccinated. But doctors don’t have the luxury of work-from-home and have to come to work every day. With reports of mutant strains, the tension of the infection is ever present, even for those like Pawar who have had the infection and been inoculated. The day begins with rounds, checking up on patients, visiting the vaccination centre and recording the doses used and stocks left. Sometimes, he lectures students over Zoom as well.In what would a year ago be a scene from some imagined reality or a futuristic sci-fi film and is now par for the course, he and his colleagues don PPE suits, masks and shields for much of the workday. Pawar, like the others, wears the PPE kit over his scrubs for more than three-four hours at a time. “We can’t eat, drink or use the restroom as long as we are wearing it. Add to that the irritation caused by sweat and glasses fogging up,” he said.Watching the coronavirus infection extract its toll on the country, the city and his own patients has been emotionally and physically exhausting and challenging. But also rewarding when patients get well and return home.  “Even if we still have a long way to go in the battle against Covid-19, the gratitude on the faces of those leaving the hospital keeps us going,” said Pawar. “It’s depressing for us doctors to still see that some people are still not following safety precautions. We don’t want to see a rise in the number of patients anymore,” he said. Before the second wave, Wadia Hospital saw only about four to five Covid-19 cases a day. But the numbers spiked this March. “Suddenly in March, there were as many as 52 cases. In April, we had 78 cases. Therefore, we were forced to cancel the study leaves of our resident medical officers (RMOs), some whom have to study in the restroom because their exams are in June,” he said. In addition to his regular duties, Pawar is also the nodal officer of the Covid Vaccination Centre at Wadia. He is involved with procuring, implementing and monitoring of the vaccination programme for Covid-19.Sometimes, in between his various responsibilities of dealing with deliveries, obstetric complications, Covid complexities and updating his case sheets, Pawar takes a short break. And then, when the work day ends he heads home to Thane, 26 km away. There have been days he has to drive back to the hospital in case of an emergency. Otherwise, it’s an evening spent at home before duty beckons again the next morning. Though Mumbai’s cases have dipped in the last few days, Covid cases continue their relentless rise. On Saturday, India recorded 4,187 fatalities and 4.01 lakh cases.Clearly, for Pawar and other healthcare workers across the country, there is no getting off the Covid treadmill yet.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/from-cradling-a-baby-to-monitoring-covid-this-mumbai-doctor-does-it-all-101620458978655.html

He urged the Centre to provide the requisite number of doses.Addressing a press briefing, Kejriwal said, “How many vaccine doses do we need to inoculate all eligible beneficiaries in three months? If I give you an estimate, Delhi’s population is 2 crore. Of this, 1 crore people are in the age group of 18 and 45; 50 lakh below the age of 18 and the rest 50 lakh above the age of 45. Hence, there are almost 1.5 crore people above the age of 18. These 1.5 crore people have to be administered two vaccine doses. Hence, 3 crore doses are needed of which the Delhi government has received 40 lakh doses. We need 2.6 crore more doses and around 80-85 lakh doses are needed per month.”Kejriwal expressed confidence if the Delhi government gets 80-85 lakh doses per month, the vaccination process can be completed within the set target of three months. “To complete vaccination within three months, we need to vaccinate 3 lakh people every day. Currently, we are inoculating 1 lakh people in a day. I request the Centre ensure adequate availability of vaccines to Delhi.” he added.If we get adequate vaccine doses, we can complete vaccination within 3 months. There're 1.5 crore people above 18 years of age in Delhi so we need 3 crore doses. Out of this, Delhi Govt has got only 40 lakh doses so far. We need 2.6 crores more doses: Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal pic.twitter.com/Q21mk0oenZThe chief minister pointed out the current requirement of doses can also go higher as beneficiaries from the NCR region are also coming to Delhi to get inoculated.A day earlier, Kejriwal chaired a high-level meeting on the overall Covid-19 situation in the national capital where he directed officials that all eligible beneficiaries should be vaccinated within three months. District magistrates have been ordered by the chief minister to pay surprise visits to vaccination centres and relief camps to review the preparations.Delhi has so far vaccinated 3,666,694 beneficiaries till now of which 114,657 were administered doses in the last 24 hours.Also Read| Kejriwal instructs officials to ensure availability of beds, oxygen supplyDuring Friday’s meeting, Kejriwal also said that oxygen supply has been improved and urged officials that no infected patient in Delhi should suffer from a shortage of the life-saving gas.“Now that Delhi has received oxygen, no one in Delhi should suffer because of shortage of oxygen. All the hospitals in Delhi should increase their beds and every DM should arrange new oxygen beds in their districts so that no deaths happen due to lack of oxygen in Delhi,” Kejriwal said adding that the hampering of oxygen distribution has to be rectified so that there is no disruption.Also Read| Delhi CM Kejriwal writes to PM Modi, expresses gratitude for supply of oxygenSince last month, several critical patients of the Covid-19 disease lost their lives as hospitals across Delhi were unable to procure oxygen supplies on time or were only able to procure limited supplies which got over very quickly.The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP)-led Delhi government has recently faced criticism for not ensuring adequate availability of oxygen to hospitals and other medical facilities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-still-facing-shortage-of-covid-19-vaccine-doses-says-cm-kejriwal-101620453521240.html
08-05-2021||Lucknow||Mission Oxygen: UP launches project to install oxygen generators in every district||To increase the oxygen supply in Uttar Pradesh amid Covid-19 pandemic, the excise and sugar industry and sugarcane development department of the UP government has started the process of installing oxygen generators across the state for the patients, it announced in a statement on Saturday.The department officials have shortlisted 75 districts where the plants will be installed in various hospitals. The work has begun in 27 districts already, "while the remaining districts will get those soon," the official release stated.So far, the work is complete in Saharanpur, Prayagraj, Fatehpur, Pratapgarh, Aligarh, Etah and Hathras. It also includes Sitapur, Kasganj, Badaun, Barabanki, Ayodhya, Shamli among others."Through the combined efforts of the Excise, Sugar Industry and Sugarcane Development Department, about 30 units of Excise Department and 45 sugar mills have ensured that in every district, there is at least one community health centre or district hospital with 35-45 beds having full-time oxygen supply through oxygen generators," it also said.The hospitals for the task will be chosen by the district magistrate and chief central officer.The project will see an investment of about ₹50-60 lakh per hospital, according to the statement. A letter to Air India has also been written, asking the airline to airlift these machines and deliver them to the hospitals as soon as possible.Covid-19 is wreaking havoc in Uttar Pradesh as it has spread beyond big cities into the towns and villages in India's most populous state. On Friday, the state reported 28,076 new Covid-19 cases, 33,117 discharges and 372 deaths.The devastating Covid-19 wave has triggered a severe shortage of oxygen cylinders families of the patients are facing a hard time to even find key medicines.On Friday, the Allahabad High Court sought the status of the Covid-19 situation in the countryside from the Uttar Pradesh government and also the measures it is considering to curb the surge in the spread of the infection there.On the vaccination drive in the state, a Bench comprising Justice Siddharth Verma and Justice Ajit Kumar, asked the government about a policy so that all people of the state can be inoculated in the next three to four months.The next hearing in this matter will take place on May 11.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/mission-oxygen-up-launches-project-to-install-oxygen-generators-in-every-district-101620455136979.html

This is only applicable for tourists,” Sawant said.The announcement came after the Bombay High Court at Goa on Thursday said that it was “not justified” that Goa is not insisting upon Covid-19 negative certificates from people seeking to visit the state.“Based on this unrestricted entry, Goa is touted as one of the few tourist destinations where all is well. This is neither fair to the populace in Goa already suffering from the overstretched medical infrastructure nor to the unsuspecting tourists who have to very often avail of the overstretched facilities at a great price,” the court said. It added the government should come up with restrictions. The court said that it was unfair to the state’s population that Goa being a tourist destination was being cited as a reason for not making it mandatory for having negative tests on arrival.Goa was reluctant to put restrictions on tourist arrivals fearing it would damage the tourism industry following a bad year due to a harsh Covid-19 induced lockdown in 2020.Goa had the highest positivity rate among states (48.5%) the first week of May.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/covid-negative-certificates-or-proof-of-jab-must-for-tourists-entering-goa-101620450486151.html

08-05-2021||Chandigarh||Ahead of farmers' protest, Punjab CM orders strict enforcement of lockdown curbs||Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh on Friday directed the state DGP to strictly enforce the weekend lockdown and deal stringently with any violation, ahead of farmers' proposed protest against it.The chief minister authorised the deputy commissioners to impose new and harsher restrictions, as needed, but made it clear that no dilution of the existing curbs will be allowed.On the farmers' unions protest against the lockdown, Amarinder Singh asserted that the Kisan Morcha, a body of 32 farmers unions, cannot dictate terms to the state government.Thirty-two farmer unions from Punjab, which have been agitating against central farm laws, had on Wednesday said they will hold street protests against the coronavirus lockdown on May 8 and urged people to defy the restrictions.Addressing a press conference at the Singhu border protest site near Delhi, farmer leader Balbir Singh Rajewal alleged the government has imposed a lockdown to hide its failure in handling the coronavirus situation and wants to weaken the farmers' movement.“The 32 farmer unions of Punjab have decided to protest against the lockdown on May 8 (in Punjab) where our field workers will come out on streets and ask people to open their shops and not follow the lockdown,” he had said.Like several other states reeling from the Covid surge, Punjab has imposed extensive curbs, in addition to measures like a weekend lockdown and night curfew till May 15.Amarinder Singh said if any shops are opened in violation of the restrictions, the owners will be prosecuted.The chief minister authorised the DCs to take any decision on opening of non-essential shops or private officers on rotation, after taking the local MLAs and other stakeholders into confidence.However, the DCs cannot impose any restrictions on inter-district movement, he said, underlining the need to allow free flow of people and goods on the highway network of the state.The new curbs, if any, and the opening of shops on rotation will come into effect from Monday, he said.Responding to DGP Dinkar Gupta's remarks that various districts wanted to adopt different models for phased opening of shops, the chief minister said the decision on working out the local systems rests with the DCs.Taking serious note of the spike in cases in the Malwa region of the state, the chief ministers asked Chief Secretary Vini Mahajan to examine the possibility of re-employing the volunteers deployed last year and also to get rapid antigen tests done on all residents in the villages.He stressed the need to control the fatality rate, which was 2.1 per cent as of May 6.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ahead-of-farmers-protest-punjab-cm-orders-strict-enforcement-of-lockdown-curbs-101620432028556.html
08-05-2021||Lucknow||Testing limited to urban clusters in Uttar Pradesh?||Have states been testing enough to curb the spread of the second wave of Covid-19 in India? An HT analysis suggests that while current positivity rates are high enough across states to require increased testing, a low positivity rate earlier, or when it comes in the future, may not always be a wholesome indicator of adequate testing (not unless it comes after a long plateau or a gradual decline).The World Health Organisation (WHO) considers a prolonged positivity rate of under 5% to be the threshold at which the Covid-19 infections in an area can be said to be under control. No major state in India had a positivity rate of 5% or less on average in the week ending May 4. This underlines the need for all states to test more.However, four weeks ago, five of India’s 19 major states had an average positivity rate less than 5%. These were — in increasing order of positivity rates — Assam, Telangana, Bihar, Gujarat and Odisha. The state that came next was Uttar Pradesh, with a positivity rate of 5.8%. This is at odds with anecdotal reports from the state at the time that spoke of people finding it difficult to get tested. At 13.2%, even in the week ending May 4, the average positivity rate in the state was lower compared to most states: it was, in fact, the fifth lowest among 19 major states. Why have official numbers from the state not reflected what ground reports suggest? (See maps)One reason for UP’s official numbers showing testing as adequate despite ground reports suggesting otherwise could be that the large-scale testing is limited to a few areas, cities, or districts. Checking positivity rate at district-level could possibly help confirm this distribution of tests, not only in Uttar Pradesh, but other states that have shown low positivity rates even amidst reports of oxygen shortage, space crunch in hospitals, crematoriums, and graveyards.However, only a few states — Rajasthan, Punjab, Gujarat, Uttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh, Tripura, and Arunachal Pradesh — publish district-level testing or positivity rates, and most major states with low positivity rates are not among them. What we have at the district level for all major states is the number of Covid-19 cases.Also read | Covid quietly ravages rural UPBut these case numbers can be used as a proxy to test for adequacy of testing. For instance, if a district has a high number of cases per million population, it is evident that the infection is widespread in that district. It is reasonable to assume that adjacent districts will be affected by high rates of infection as well (especially if the first district is a hub of sorts). To check for this trend on a map, HT created a map of average cases per million by districts in the last week, normalised on a scale of 0 to 1 for districts of each state. A district with a score of 1 has the highest cases per million in the state, and the district with a score of 0 has the lowest cases per million in the state.HT plotted four such maps: showing this index for the week ending April 13, April 20, April 27, and May 4. Rather satisfyingly, data from most states support the premise that adjacent districts have similar caseloads theory throughout this period. Uttar Pradesh alone looks like an outlier in April, with districts around Lucknow having a far lower score than it. This means that while Lucknow had the highest infection rates in Uttar Pradesh through April, districts around it remained largely unaffected. That, as maps of other states suggest, is not credible unless there was no movement from Lucknow to adjoining districts, or unless testing in neighbouring districts was inadequate. That the state was holding Panchayat polls during this period makes this even more unlikely. (See maps)To be sure, this trend can also be seen in the union territory or Ladakh and some north-eastern states.In Ladakh, this trend is a mathematical quirk. If there are just two districts in a state, one of them will have the highest cases per million (and therefore a normalised score of 1) and other minimum (normalised score of 0). In districts in the north-eastern states, the absolute infection rates themselves are far lower than Lucknow, which might explain the infection not spreading to neighbouring districts as readily. In the week ending April 27, for example, West Tripura had an average of 49 cases per million compared to 1,137 per million in Lucknow.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/testing-limited-to-urban-clusters-in-up-101620429777566.html

After the conversation, Soren said PM Modi only did his “Mann ki Baat” during the conversation. “It would have been better had he listened to, and spoken on important matters,” the Jharkhand Mukti Morcha chief tweeted.On Friday, BJP hit back. “While making a statement on the Prime Minister of the country, he must not forget that the pandemic situation should be addressed by a joint effort of the Centre and the state government.

08-05-2021||Delhi||Delhiwale: Sufi island in the heart of the city||A little island. Circled with trees. With four graves.This Sufi shrine feels as secluded as if the island stood in the middle of the sea.But this is Delhi’s heart, within the India Gate grounds. (This excursion was undertaken before the Central Vista redevelopment project earnestly took off in the area). Turned away from the public gaze, this tiny spot exists like a self-contained world. The India Gate revelers are not lurking very far but also not close, letting this place enjoy an eerie charm and a sense of extreme remoteness.The island is in the middle of a pond, and is accessed by hopping and slipping along a slender stretch of humid, weedy earth. On this grey overcast afternoon the mound is cloaked in absolute solitude. No sound here, even birds are quiet, at least at this moment. You feel as if you could touch the silence. The shrine’s four graves are covered with colourful chadors—sheets of fabric for sacred offerings—implying that coming on pilgrimage here hasn’t fallen yet into obsolescence.A crudely painted sign on a green stone slab identifies the place as the burial place of Hazrat Shabbir Shah Baba. There is no knowing about this mystic, but then Delhi is full of small and big Sufi shrines. The patron saints of a few of these shrines are known across the world, while the biographies of a great many have been lost to history. Many such shrines are also believed to have disappeared over the years, as the expanding metropolis added more buildings to its already limited space.The absence of a substantial architecture makes it impossible to determine the age of this secretive landmark. Perhaps it’s 500 years old. Perhaps 50. The mystery makes the shrine truly enigmatic. In a fast-changing city, this spot of land has managed to survive largely unnoticed. It doesn’t figure in any noteworthy guidebook.One is now left to wonder how this place will look like following the completion of the Central Vista project.After, say, 50 years, will this barely known island hillock, and these barely known graves, still exist as they do now, or will they have become a part of our city’s undocumented history?||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhiwale-sufi-island-in-the-heart-of-the-city-101620425761867.html

The ambulance has also been seized, police said.The payment receipt issued by the ambulance operator, identified as Mimoh Kumar Bundwal, was widely shared on social media on May 6. After the post went viral, Bundwal returned ₹95,000 to the elderly person through an online transaction on Thursday, the police said.“Bundwal used to work as a junior resident at a government hospital in south Delhi. He quit the profession two years ago and started an ambulance service company,” said deputy commissioner of police Urvija Goel, adding that Bundwal was overcharging patients for the past one month and has cheated numerous people in this manner.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/ambulance-operator-held-for-overcharging-101620425552127.html

Those who have taken the first vaccine dose from a nearby centre would prefer to go there for the second dose as well.

08-05-2021||Delhi||Staff crunch, high volume of samples delay Covid reports||Mahesh Singh Rajput (63), a resident of southwest Delhi’s Dwarka, made several frantic calls to diagnostic centres in his locality for home collection of samples after his 59-year-old wife started showing Covid-19 symptoms. After at least eight labs declined, he drove his wife, who was already suffering from incessant coughing and high fever by then, to a diagnostic centre and waited for around 30 minutes before his wife’s sample was collected.His wait, however, did not end there. It took two days for the blood reports to arrive and another two days for the RT PCR report to come, which confirmed that Rajput’s wife had tested positive for Covid-19.“Though we started the basic treatment for her, the doctors kept asking for the blood test reports to determine the severity of her infection. We got the results four days after my wife started showing the first symptom,” said Rajput.Many residents in Delhi are facing hurdles in getting tested for Covid-19--be it at their homes or at diagnostic centres. With testing facilities being pushed to the limits amid the increasing number of Covid-19 cases, booking a slot for RT-PCR test and blood sample collection for CRP (C-reactive protein), D-Dimer and IL-6 and getting the reports, is proving to be quite a challenge.Owners of several private and government testing centres said shortage of manpower and an overwhelming surge in requests for testing has led to instances of samples getting lost and longer wait for test results.Also read | Fall in positivity rate a ray of hope for cityOn April 22, the Delhi high court directed the state government to ensure test reports are delivered within 48 hoursMany private labs said several staff members testing positive for Covid-19 and many others not reporting to work have led to severe shortage of trained manpower in laboratories conducting RT-PCR tests.“There is acute shortage of manpower. My technicians have to look inside the mouth of a suspected patient and collect the sample, what is the incentive? They too have families,” said the owner of one of Delhi’s biggest laboratories.Lab technologists in the city reiterated that manpower crunch has also forced most laboratories to stop collecting samples from home. It has also resulted in delay in giving the reports.“There may be some laboratories that are picking up more samples that they can process, thereby delaying the reports. At our centre, we collect only as many samples we can process in a single day. Earlier, we used to keep our sample collection centre open from 8am to 8pm. Now, with people rushing to get tested, we collect samples till about 1pm and on some days, till 11am,” said the owner of another laboratory in Delhi.A third laboratory owner said, “With the government capping the prices of RT-PCR tests, it is a challenge for laboratories to buy new machines and hire people to do the tests. When the pandemic is over, these machines are likely to be underutilised.”While labs are grappling with problems of their own, doctors said early detection of infection is the key to control the symptoms.“A delayed test report holds no value. In many cases, the symptoms start manifesting very fast and to control them, you need to put the patient on anti-viral or on steroids. This is why we need to scale up testing and make it more efficient. The load of the virus, if detected early on, can be controlled. We have observed mild cases turn severe just because requisite reports are not delivered on time,” said Dr Jugal Kishore, head of the department of community medicine at Safdarjung hospital.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/staff-crunch-high-volume-of-samples-delay-covid-reports-101620425005807.html
08-05-2021||Delhi||Gangster dies of Covid-19 as Tihar readies to decongest||Tihar jail officials on Friday said they were preparing a list of nearly 5,000 undertrials who could be released either on interim bail for 90 days or on eight weeks’ parole following a Supreme Court-appointed high powered committee recommending that the prison be decongested in view of the “alarming” and “threatening” situation of the pandemic in the Capital.Currently, Tihar has nearly 19,679 inmates, almost twice the prison’s sanctioned capacity of 10,026. It is also the country’s most populated prison complex. The jail currently has about 250 active Covid cases and six deaths have been recorded in the ongoing Covid wave. The latest prisoner to die of the infection was Gaurav Jhareda, a 38-year-old alleged gangster whose name featured in the list of Delhi’s most wanted. Jhareda died on Thursday night.After the high-powered committee’s recommendation, the state government is likely to order emergency parole for 1,000 convicts by Monday or Tuesday. The 4,000 undertrials, being selected based on the criteria set by the HPC, will be released on interim bail after the orders of the respective courts where their cases are being heard.“Each jail has prepared a list of prisoners. There will be approximately 5,000 prisoners who could be released. We are waiting for the government’s order. It should happen anytime next week,” said a prison officer who asked not to be named.Also read | Fall in positivity rate a ray of hope for cityThe first 1,000 convicts who will be released are those who surrendered in February and March after 10-11 months of similar parole, during the first nationwide lockdown in March last year. The undertrials who will be released are those who are currently facing trial in non-heinous cases -- in which punishment is less than 7 years. Other undertrials who have HIV, cancer, kidney dysfunction (requiring dialysis), or Hepatitis B or C, will also be considered for release, the officerThere are three prison complexes under Tihar Central prisons -- Tihar, Rohini and Mandoli. Tihar has nine sub jails, Rohini has one sub jail and Mandoli has six small sub jails. The prison is headed by one director general rank officer and assisted by an inspector general. Nearly 14,000 prisoners are lodged in the Tihar complex, while Rohini has around 2,000 and Mandoli has around 3,000 inmates.The committee has laid down 11 categories of undertrial prisoners -- such as those in civil imprisonment, senior citizens who are facing trial for offences with a maximum punishment of 10 years in jail, those who are suffering other serious illnesses and are facing trial for offences with punishment ranging from 10 years to life -- who would be eligible for grant of 90 days interim bail on furnishing of a personal bond.The jail administration wrote to the Delhi government last week to consider releasing prisoners on special parole to decongest the prison.In February, there was not a single case of Covid-19 among prisoners or jail officials in Tihar. Even until April 6, the jail had only 19 cases of Covid-19. But in the last one month, Tihar has reported over 300 Covid-19 cases among prisoners. Currently there are 249 cases of infection. Activist Umar Khalid, arrested in the Delhi riots case had also tested positive. Chhota Rajan, underworld gangster, too, tested positive last month and is admitted at AIIMS.While two prisoners died in June-July last year, in the last two weeks at least six prisoners have died of Covid-19.The last prisoner to die of the infection, Jhareda was allegedly involved in at least 18 criminal cases, including murder, robbery, arms act and extortion, among other heinous crimes.Also read | Govt to create oxygen reserves to handle distress calls by hospitalsJhareda, who was lodged in sub jail 8/9 tested positive for the virus on April 29.

08-05-2021||Delhi||Police raid Khan Market restaurants, seize O2 devices||A day after 419 oxygen concentrators were seized from Nege & Ju, a restaurant-cum-bar in Lodhi Colony, and private company Matrix Cellular’s godown in Chattarpur, Delhi Police said on Friday that they raided Khan Chacha and Town Hall restaurants in Khan Market and recovered 105 more concentrators.According to Delhi Police, these restaurants are owned by Navneet Kalra, a businessman who also owns Dayal Opticals. Police said Kalra was avoiding cooperating with the investigation since the raids were conducted at his restaurants and oxygen concentrators seized.“With further seizure of 105 #OxygenConcentrator from Khan Chacha & Town Hall, 2 upscale restaurants in Khan Mkt, total 524 seized frm #blackmarketers Owner Navneet Kalra, also owns Dayal Opticals, is on run. Manager, 3 staffers arrested by #DelhiPolice SouthDist. Further raids on,” the Delhi Police tweeted on Friday from its Twitter handle.“We tried contacting Kalra but his cellphone is switched off and he is absconding. Notices will be served to the management of all the three restaurants to join the investigation and explain their role in the entire hoarding and black-marketing of oxygen concentrators and as to why 96 such concentrators were stored in their restaurant,” said deputy commissioner of police (south) Atul Kumar Thakur.In a late evening development, the 47-year-old chief executive officer (CEO) of Matrix Cellular, Gaurav Khanna, who is a resident of Gurugram, was arrested in connection with the seizure of oxygen concentrators from his company’s godown in Chhatarpur, DCP Thakur said.Also read | Govt to create oxygen reserves to handle distress calls by hospitalsA senior office-bearer of the Khan Market Traders Association, who did not wish to be identified, confirmed that all three restaurants – Khan Chacha, Town Hall and Nege & Ju – are owned by Kalra. Khan Chacha restaurant’s website has Kalra’s name in the “About us” section. In the “Celeb Presence” section, he is seen inside the eatery with cricketers and Bollywood actors.While 96 oxygen concentrators were seized from Khan Chacha, another nine were found illegally stored at Town Hall. The fresh recoveries were made following the interrogation of four people, whose arrests along with the recovery of 419 concentrators were made public by the south district police on Thursday. With this, the total recovery made in the case, which is being probed by the Lodhi Colony police station, now stands at 524, the retail price value of which is around ₹1.04 crore. A concentrator costing between ₹20,000 and ₹50,000 is being sold for between ₹70,000 and ₹1.25 lakh in the black market, the police said.Senior police officers said they were probing a nexus between the restaurant owner and the private company in hoarding and black-marketing of oxygen concentrators, a device whose demand soared following the steep rise in Covid-19 cases in the ongoing second wave.HT tried to contact Kalra, Matrix Cellular and the restaurants (Nege & Ju, Town Hall and Khan Chacha) on Friday through phone calls and text messages through Thursday and Friday but there was no response till the time of going to press.Social media users commented extensively on the development. “I feel sorry for poor Khan Chacha & his family. First they lost the use of their name to Navneet Kalra & now they are being dragged through the mud for no fault of theirs because Kalra was using his eateries to store concentrators allegedly for sale on the black market,” tweeted Omar Abdullah, former chief minister of Jammu and Kashmir and vice-president of the Jammu Kashmir National Conference (JKNC).The police on Thursday said that they had arrested four persons in connection with the raids on Nege & Ju and Matrix cellular. They were identified as Hitesh, manager of Nege & Ju, and three employees of Matrix Cellular – Gaurav, Satish Sethi and Vikrant.“To portray that the machines were being sold at a fair price, stickers carrying fake maximum retail prices (MRPs) were pasted on them. The concentrators costing about ₹20,000 each were sold for as much as nearly ₹70,000,” Thakur had said on Thursday.A senior police officer privy to the developments said, requesting anonymity, that the investigation so far has revealed that people involved in the nexus were into the illegal trade of oxygen concentrators since October and had already sold many such devices.The officer said they are probing the role of the three arrested Matrix Cellular employees for allegedly getting the concentrators from outside India.In a separate raid, a Greater Kailash police station team arrested two individuals, Saeed and Muqueem, and seized 3,486 digital thermometers, 10 oxygen concentrators, 263 digital gun thermometers, 684 oximeters and 10 nebulizers, allegedly meant for sale in the black market.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/police-raid-khan-market-restaurants-seize-o2-devices-101620423658228.html

In comparison, 18,795 healthcare workers were immunised in the first four days in Delhi when the vaccination drive was rolled out from January 16.“In Delhi 1.84 lakh youth have got the 1st dose of vaccine, in first 4 days of 18-45 yrs age group opening. In total, 38.88 lakh people have got the vaccine in all age groups till yesterday evening,” Sisodia tweeted.The arrangement was described as “pretty smooth” by Kritika Goswami, 24, who took the shot on Friday at a government school in Dwarka. “The whole arrangement was pretty smooth and I was done in around 30 minutes. I had a slot for 3pm to 5pm, I had reached the centre a little early and got the shot before 3 o’clock. There were only five or six other people at the waiting hall and social distancing was followed,” she said. She received a dose of Covaxin.The Delhi government now plans to create outreach vaccination camps for journalists. “This is currently at the planning stage. Letters will be sent out to media houses to get a list of their employees and vaccinate them at outreach camps at their office. No timeline has been fixed yet,” said a senior government official, on condition of anonymity.Also read | Fall in positivity rate a ray of hope for cityChief minister Arvind Kejriwal, in a high-level meeting, directed district magistrates to pay surprise visits to vaccination centres and relief camps in order to review the preparations done for the convenience of the people.He also directed the officials to ensure that all eligible people are vaccinated within the next three months.He said, “We will be able to stop the third [national] wave of corona from coming to Delhi, only by being able to administer vaccines to everyone in Delhi as soon as possible in the next three months.”Kejriwal on Wednesday expressed concerns over short supply of Covid-19 vaccines, even as he asserted that with the current infrastructure in place, the entire population of Delhi can be vaccinated in three months if supply is scaled up.“In the coming days we will need large scale supply of vaccines. The latest consignment we have received is not a large one. With the established procedures in place, we can scale up [the vaccination drive] in 24 hours. But there is a shortage of vaccine production. If production and supply are scaled up, we are capable of vaccinating the entire population of Delhi. Right now, the only obstacle is a short supply of vaccines,” said Kejriwal on the sidelines of his visit to a vaccination centre in central Delhi’s Rajendra Nagar.While vaccination of people over 45 years old was underway in around 500 sites, the drive was opened to people aged between 18 and 44 years on a wider scale on May 3, in a different set of 300-odd sites scattered across all 11 revenue districts in the city.According to the Delhi government bulletin on Friday, a total of 2,856,955 people have received their first dose of Covid vaccine in Delhi so far. It also said that 809,739 have got their second doses as well.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/184k-between-18-44-years-got-their-first-jab-so-far-sisodia-101620423408730.html
08-05-2021||Delhi||Few ambulances with critical care a concern||The shortage of ambulances with ventilators has emerged as a concern amid the ongoing coronavirus disease wave in the Capital, with a large number of critical patients needing life support while being taken from their homes to hospitals, or from one medical facility to another in search of a bed.There are 2,287 ambulances registered with the transport department. Of these, 265 are permanent ambulances under the Centralised Accident and Trauma Services (CATS) fleet. The remaining are operated by private hospitals and private service providers. The state government has also temporarily augmented the fleet of CATS with around 400 more ambulances.“Of the total number of ambulances functional in Delhi, 25 CATS ambulances have ventilators and, at this point, and less than 125 private ones have ventilators,” said the senior official who asked not to be named.Also read | Delhi government caps rates of private ambulancesThe shortage of ambulances with ventilators translates to critically ill patients sometimes having to wait, officials and patients said. Since people often cannot wait, they take the risk of ferrying critical patients to hospitals in ambulances with high-oxygen flow systems. This becomes very risky, said Narendra Lakra, head of the Delhi CATS Ambulance Union.“We come across a high number of cases in which a patient, who is already admitted in a hospital, becomes critical and needs to be moved to a ventilator. But then there is a shortage of vacant ventilators in hospitals too. So, the patient has to be taken to another hospital where a ventilator is available. How do you do that without an ambulance that has a ventilator system?” Lakra said.What makes things more difficult is that earlier, an ambulance used to take one to two hours to pick up a patient and finally get relieved after hospital admission. Now, with a crisis of beds, the waiting time in hospitals has increased, officials said. A government spokesperson did not comment on the matter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/few-ambulances-with-critical-care-a-concern-101620423156132.html
08-05-2021||Delhi||Plea in HC over distribution of O2 by minister||The Delhi high court on Friday directed the state food and civil supplies minister Imran Hussain to appear before the court on Monday on a plea over stopping the alleged “unauthorised”, “unlawful” and “arbitrary” distribution of oxygen cylinders by the MLA in his constituency Ballimaran.A bench of justices Vipin Sanghi and Rekha Palli issued a notice to Hussain seeking his reply, and said it needed to be figured where he was procuring the cylinders from.“Suppose he is not getting it from refillers in Delhi... Suppose he has independent arrangement from some supplier in Rajasthan, Faridabad, or wherever…. If he is getting it from there and he is giving it to some people in need in his constituency, then you cannot have a grievance because then he is only augmenting supply to Delhi. Even gurdwaras are doing it,” said the court.“If he’s not eating away from the allocated source... He has arranged his own cylinder. Let us be clear about it,” it added, saying that there could be a grievance if Hussain was taking it from the allocation made for hospitals, nursing homes, or for individual use at homes in the national capital.Also read | Govt to create oxygen reserves to handle distress calls by hospitalsThe court’s observation and directions came while hearing a plea which alleged irregularities in the supply of medical essentials and sought an enquiry by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI).Advocate Amit Tiwari, representing petitioner Vedansh Anand, showed a Facebook post referring to the distribution of oxygen by Hussain, and contended that there was hoarding involved. The Delhi government counsel Rahul Mehra said that whether it is BJP MP Gautam Gambhir or AAP MLA Hussain, strictest possible action will be taken if any violation is found. His reference was to Gambhir’s tweet on April 21 that people in need of Fabiflu tablets could get them for free at his office. Fabiflu is an anti-viral used in the management of symptoms of Covid-19 infection.The court is hearing a plea by Rakesh Malhotra, who along with several hospitals had sought directions to the Centre and the Delhi government for better facilities and continuous supply of oxygen in the hospitals and nursing homes of the city.During the hearing, the court rejected a suggestion to bring the Armed Forces for setting up field hospitals in the national capital saying that they should be first ready for the duty they have been raised for.Meanwhile, another bench of the high court asked the Delhi government to treat as a representation a PIL seeking compensation for the families of those patients who died due to shortage of oxygen. A bench of chief justice DN Patel and justice Jasmeet Singh directed that the representation be decided in accordance with the law, rules, regulations, and policy applicable to the facts of the case||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/plea-in-hc-over-distribution-of-o2-by-minister-101620422922373.html
08-05-2021||Delhi||Govt to create oxygen reserves to handle distress calls by hospitals||With the daily oxygen supply to the city still in flux, the Delhi government plans to create oxygen reserves at several points across the Capital to answer SOS calls by hospitals, senior AAP leader Raghav Chadha said on Friday. Delhi on Thursday received 577 MT of oxygen -- 153 MT less than the previous day’s supply of 730 MT.“We have been creating SOS reserves stocked in various places in Delhi from where it will be supplied to hospitals in an emergency, if their regular supply is not initiated. For example, if a 300-bed hospital that was supposed to be delivered oxygen through a tanker from a designated company fails to get it due to some unforeseen circumstances, Team Kejriwal steps in,” said Chadha, who is monitoring the day-to-day oxygen supply in Delhi.The acute dip in supply earned the Centre reproach from the Supreme Court on Friday. The apex court warned the Centre of “coercive steps” if there is any deficit in the future. The city is estimated to require at least 700 MT to sustain the critical care patient load and consistently lower supplies have caused several hospitals to reduce the number of beds, officials have said.“We have been very clear that you have to give 700 MT to Delhi every day. We said it in our earlier order and also clarified this yesterday (Thursday). Don’t drive us to a situation where we have to take firm and coercive steps,” the bench of justices Dhananjaya Y Chandrachud and MR Shah told Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, who appeared for the Centre.Also read | Fall in positivity rate a ray of hope for cityChadha explained that multiple oxygen reserves will help the SOS tankers reach hospitals early. For instance, Batra hospital, where 12 patients including a senior doctor admitted to the hospital died for the want of oxygen on May 1, the tanker reached late because it was in Burari--over 30km away.The Delhi government has been demanding 976 MT of oxygen to ensure that they are able to increase the number of oxygen beds by 15,000 and ICU beds by 1,200. “The supply of oxygen has to be regular. We cannot give sufficient oxygen one day because of increased supply and completely deprive the patients another day because the Centre decreased our supply,” said Chadha.He added, “If the Kejriwal government wishes to substantially increase the number of these beds in Delhi to up to 40,000-45,000, it will need regular and uninterrupted supply of oxygen.”In a high-level review meeting on Friday, chief minister minister Arvind Kejriwal asserted that nobody should die because of lack of oxygen. “Now that Delhi has received oxygen, no one in Delhi should suffer because of shortage of oxygen. All the hospitals in Delhi should increase their beds and every DM should arrange new oxygen beds in their districts so that no deaths happen due to lack of oxygen in Delhi.”Hospitals such as Delhi government-run Rajeev Gandhi Super Speciality hospital in Tahirpur said they will start increasing the beds eventually but will monitor the oxygen supply for a couple of days. The hospital reduced its beds from 550 to 350 due to the uncertainty over oxygen supply.Also read | SC warns of coercive action if Delhi’s O2 quota not metKejriwal also urged everyone to use oxygen efficiently and avoid wastage. Several hospital have already implemented measures such as restricting the number of patients being put on “oxygen-guzzler high flow nasal oxygen”.The chief minister said, “The 48 oxygen plants should be installed immediately as soon as they reach Delhi. These plants have an oxygen production capacity of 40 tonnes. This will further help in improving Delhi’s oxygen situation.”Kejriwal also expressed displeasure over complaints that patients in home isolation were not being given pulse oximeters, which was part of the protocol to manage those who were recuperating at home.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/govt-to-create-oxygen-reserves-to-handle-distress-calls-by-hospitals-101620422661609.html
08-05-2021||Delhi||Doctor conducts last rites of woman as son recovers in hospital||For over a year now, doctors and other health care and frontline workers have been shouldering the burden of India’s battle against Covid-19. On Thursday, a 37-year-old doctor at a Delhi hospital took on some more weight. He performed the last rites of an elderly woman, who succumbed to the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), at Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel Hospital because her son, also diagnosed with the viral illness, was not in the condition to perform the rituals.“I got a call from a junior working at the Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel Hospital late on Wednesday, and he told me that an elderly woman had died of Covid there, and her son was unable to perform the last rites since he was still Covid-positive. I asked him to contact their immediate family and neighbours. When no one came forward till Thursday, I decided to help the family. I asked my doctor friend to get the consent from her son so that I could perform the rituals,” said Dr Varun Garg, assistant professor of forensic medicine at the North Delhi Municipal Corporation Medical College and Hindu Rao Hospital.“Her son gave us written consent, and authorised me to perform the rites in his stead. It was quite painful to realise that none of the woman’s relatives nor her friends and family were there,” he added. The woman’s son is currently admitted to the Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel Hospital.The doctor then coordinated with his colleagues at Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel Hospital and brought the body of the 78-year-old woman to the Nigambodh Ghat cremation ground. “I performed all rituals, and lit the pyre. I have stored her ashes in a locker at the crematorium so that whenever her son recovers, he can immerse them,” he said.Garg said he and his family -- his mother and his wife -- recovered from Covid-19 last week, and he resumed work on Saturday. “If there is anything that can help us overcome these challenging times, that is empathy and compassion. We need to help each other in any way we can amid this pandemic,” he said.The 37-year-old has been working at the hospital since 2015 and has been on Covid duty since last year.Delhi, bearing the brunt of its fourth and worst wave of infections, has seen long queues at crematoriums in recent weeks as the city has been consistently recording more than 300 daily deaths for the last 16 days. On Friday, Delhi again added 341 deaths and 19,832 new Covid-19 cases.In these difficult times, good samaritans and others have come forward to help. Last month, police helped cremate the bodies of an elderly couple who died in their homes while in quarantine in north Delhi’s Burari.In some cases, family members of the victims have been unable to reach India for last rites, leaving them to rely on funeral organisers.Officials at Messy funerals, a service provider in Civil Lines, told HT in April that they also carried out the last rites of two elderly people, aged 76 and 82, in neighbouring Ghaziabad as their children were in the United States.Garg, who is also the in-charge of the mortuary at the hospital, said there was a similar incident in his hospital on Friday.“A man from Rohini has died of Covid-19 and no one from his family has turned up for the last rites. We are still waiting to hear from them. If no one comes forward, we will inform the police and see what we can do,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/doctor-conducts-last-rites-of-woman-as-son-recovers-in-hospital-101620421795012.html

His accomplices, however, failed to get away as the space was too narrow for them to slip through.The trio had stabbed the teen, identified as Amardeep Singh, when he had tried to resist a phone snatching bid. Following the jailbreak, police lodged an FIR against night munshi Roshan Preet and sentry Budhi Raj for negligence. Proceedings to suspend the two cops have also been initiated. As per information, the accused, Harvinder Singh alias Lali of Gurmel Nagar, Gurmeet Singh alias Gagan of Jamalpur village, and Tej Ram alias Chintu of Mundian Khurd, were lodged in the lock-up of Daba police station that was being run from the flats in Daba.As Harvinder Singh alias Lali was extremely lean, he managed to escape by bending the grilles. The incident is said to have taken place around 2.30am. The cops deputed at the police station were reportedly sleeping at the time. They came to know about the incident in the morning and alerted their seniors. Additional deputy commissioner of police (ADCP, City 2) Jaskiranjit Singh Teja said it was utter negligence on the part of the police personnel deputed at the police station that a murder accused managed to flee. He said that teams have been formed to trace the accused. A case under Sections 224 (resistance or obstruction by a person to his lawful appre¬hension) and 225 (resistance or obstruction to lawful apprehension of another person) of the Indian Penal Code has been lodged against the accused as well as the two cops, he said.

08-05-2021||Chandigarh||SC notice to Punjab govt over Prashant Kishor’s appointment||The Supreme Court has issued notice of motion to Punjab government in connection with a petition challenging the appointment of political strategist Prashant Kishor as principal adviser (cabinet rank) to chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh. The bench of justices Sanjay Kishan Kaul and Hemant Gupta on Thursday directed the matter to be listed after summer vacations while hearing a plea filed by Labh Singh, a retired boxing coach and Satinder Singh, a Chandigarh-based advocate. Capt Amarinder had appointed Kishor as his principal adviser in March this year. The petitioners submitted that appointment of Kishor, who has been assisting different political parties, in the rank and status of a cabinet minister was a clear violation of Articles 14 and 16 of the Constitution. The petitioner alleged that in Kishor’s appointment, no advertisement was issued, no interviews were conducted and no criteria was adopted. The petitioner said that the article 16(1) of the Constitution provides that there shall be equal opportunity to all citizens in employment or appointment to any office under the state. “Kishor will be enjoying pay, perks and all facilities from the state exchequer. His appointment is contrary to the provisions in the Constitution,” the petitioners added. “Had proper procedure been followed, more qualified and suitable persons could have been available. The appointment has been made in a clandestine and cloistered manner causing loss to millions of aspirants,” the petitioner said. The petitioner said the appointment smacks of mala fide as he was appointed election strategist by Punjab Pradesh Congress Committee in 2017. “There is a reasonable apprehension in the mind of petitioners that Kishor has been appointed principal adviser just to make election strategies for the coming elections,” the petition said. In March, the Punjab and Haryana high court had dismissed a similar petition challenging Kishor’s appointment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/sc-notice-to-punjab-govt-over-prashant-kishor-s-appointment-101620419943094.html
08-05-2021||Chandigarh||Infections spike, positivity rate stagnates in Punjab||Despite an exponential rise in daily Covid-19 cases in Punjab in last few weeks, there is some respite as the state’s average positivity rate for the last week (April 30-May 5) has been static when compared with the previous week (April 25-30). The positivity rate in state for both the weeks remained at 11.7%, reveals the weekly analysis done by the health department. Positivity rate is the percentage of new infections in proportion to the total tests done. According to the analysis, 11 districts — SAS Nagar, Bathinda, Ludhiana, Patiala, Pathankot, Jalandhar, Amritsar, Rupnagar, Sangrur, Gurdaspur, Bathinda, Fatehgarh Sahib, SBS Nagar — witnessed a slight rise in the average weekly positivity rate, and an equal number of districts — Muktsar, Fazilka, Mansa, Faridkot, Moga, Bathinda, Hoshiarpur, Ferozepur, Barnala, Taran Taran and Kapurthala — recorded a decline. Between April 30 and May 5, 10 districts registered a positivity rate of more than 10%, while in the preceding week (April 25-April 30), the number of districts in the said category was 12. Fazilka, Ferozepur, Mansa and Barnala districts witnessed the steepest decline in the positivity rate. No respite in SAS Nagar, Ludhiana The health department analysis revealed that SAS Nagar (Mohali) registered an increase of 1% in the average positivity rate, whereas the spike was 1.1% in the worst-hit Ludhiana district. The week that ended on May 6, SAS Nagar’s average positivity rate was found to be 24.9% as compared to 23.9% in the previous week. Ludhiana’s figure increased to 13.1% as compared to 12% in the previous week. Punjab’s nodal officer for Covid-19 Dr Rajesh Bhaskar said the state registered a rise in cases but the average positivity rate for both weeks remained unchanged because the testing was also increased. “Our daily testing increased from around 55,000 in the last week of April to 68,000 on May 6. This means we are increasing testing to track the virus in order to curtail its spread,” said the nodal officer. The health department has termed the outcome as the first positive sign that the cases may stabilise in the coming days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/infections-spike-positivity-rate-stagnates-in-punjab-101620419823738.html

The curfew will come into effect from 12noon and go on till 5am. A seven-hour relaxation will be allowed from 5am to 12noon during which all shops, including those selling non-essential items, and private offices and establishments, will be allowed to open. The curfew will be observed on weekdays – Monday to Friday—while the weekend lockdown will also continue until further orders. The weekend curfew will start from 12noon on Friday and continue till 5am on Monday.As per the fresh orders, there will be no movement of passenger vehicles within the city during curfew hours. Passenger movement by four-wheelers or motorised two-wheelers during curfew hours will be allowed only in exceptional circumstances, provided the vehicle occupants present an e-curfew pass. However, there will be no restriction on movement of passenger vehicles during curfew relaxation hours in morning. It has also been ordered that takeaway and home-delivery services will be allowed during curfew relaxation time (5am to 12pm) only as the hotels will remain closed during curfew hours. The DC has also directed that all government employees will be staying at the headquarters for posting and may be put on Covid duty. The department heads concerned shall ensure that any staff put on Covid duty is made to be present immediately with orders given to all staff to be on calls for any Covid duty. To and fro inter-state movement or movement to other districts is allowed on national and state highways. Home delivery of milk is allowed on all seven days from morning 5am to 12 noon and in the evening from 5pm to 9pm. Milk vendors will not require curfew passes. All manufacturing industrial units have also been exempted from the curfew. Any violations shall invite criminal proceedings under the relevant provisions of the Disaster Management Act 2005 and the Indian Penal Code 1860. High positivity rate prompted stringent steps: DC Deputy commissioner Varinder Kumar Sharma said the curfew was necessitated due to the steady rise in the number of Covid-19 cases in the district. He said the decision was taken after reviewing the situation with civil surgeon, district epidemiologist and commissioner of police. “The positivity rate is currently above 10% and the bed occupancy in Ludhiana city hospitals is above 81%. Therefore, there is an urgent need to impose stringent restrictions to save precious human lives in district,” he said. Industry had cried their heart out earlier in the day Earlier in the day, several representatives of the Ludhiana industry participated in a virtual meeting with state food and supply minister Bharat Bhushan Ashu and senior officials of the Ludhiana administration and expressed their grievances over the ongoing partial lockdown in the state.The traders and manufacturers said they are facing a plethora of problems due to shortage of labour and closure of main markets across the country. “Most of the units are in losses and working just to engage the labour,” said Pankaj Sharma, general secretary, CICU. Ashu said that almost all Level-III and Level-II beds are occupied in the hospitals and health infrastructure is severely strained due to the continuous inflow of patients in Ludhiana. He said the administration is already at work to create more beds in other places for the best treatment of patients. Deputy commissioner Varinder Kumar Sharma and police commissioner Rakesh Agrawal said that it is high time for people to mitigate the stress of healthcare and other frontline workers by observing Covid-appropriate behaviour. “Scores of medium and small scale units are suffering due to the shops being closed as we have a limited source of money. With shops closed, the payments are being delayed and it is difficult for us to pay our labour force,” said Charanjit Singh Vishwakarma, former president of the United Cycle Parts Manufacturers Association (UCPMA). After the orders, the industry expressed satisfaction over the decision to allow all shops to open for business in morning hours. “Earlier, electricians and plumbers were also not allowed to work. Now at least emergency requirements can be catered to,” said Ankur Sharma, a businessman based in Sarabha Nagar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/from-monday-ludhiana-to-have-17-hour-curfew-daily-101620419344300.html
08-05-2021||Chandigarh||Situation critical in Punjab, Haryana, UT; consider reorientation of O2 supply: HC||The Haryana high court Friday said that situation appears to be critical in Punjab, Haryana and Chandigarh and directed the Centre to consider reorientation of the supply of oxygen from various plants in such a manner that the allocated quantity reaches the respective states before already allotted quota is exhausted to avoid loss of life. The order was passed by the high court after it was apprised by Punjab advocate general Atul Nanda that Punjab requires 300 metric tonnes (MT) of oxygen whereas the Centre has allocated to it 227 MT, which is also not reaching the state. “Sufficient number of containers are not allotted to transport the same. Besides, Punjab needs 600 doses of Tocilizumab which is considered as life saving drug in critical cases,” Nanda had told court, adding that there is shortage of vaccinate too, especially in the age group of above 45 years of age. There is a shortfall of 32 lakh of doses. In total, 2.64 crores doses are required in Punjab for the age group of 18 to 45 years. The state has been given liberty to secure the same from two suppliers, Serum Institute, Pune and Bharat Biotech, on payment basis. This demand has also not been met despite the fact that orders have been placed after following due procedure, it had told the high court. Haryana on the other hand said that state is facing extreme shortage of oxygen despite the fact that it has a plant located at Panipat which is manufacturing 260 MT. The state is facing extreme shortage of oxygen despite the fact that it has a plant located at Panipat. Instead of allowing Haryana to get the supply from the plant at Panipat for the facility of transport as well as timely replenishment, it has been allocated far off places like Rourkela and Jamnagar etc. Resultant delay has led to several deaths in Haryana as well,” state’s advocate general, Baldev Raj Mahajan had told court. UT too said that it is now facing difficulty in procuring the required quantity of oxygen and Centre has been requested to increase the quota to 35 MT. Amicus Curaie Rupinder Khosla too had said that there is severe shortfall in supply of oxygen to both the states and UT. “The allocated quantity of oxygen is either not being supplied or has been allotted from very distant places, such as, Rourkela and Jamnagar etc., timeline for which is not conducive. By the time the arrangements are made, the states are virtually left starving of oxygen, resulting in many deaths,” he had submitted. Additional solicitor general Satya Pal Jain assured the court that the matter would be considered immediately and appropriate steps shall be taken. However, he had submitted that the allocation of oxygen is being done equitably to all the states in the country. The bench observed that at this stage these states are not seeking enhancement of supply but timely delivery of oxygen allotted to them,well in time. It added that supply be reoriented in a manner that the allocated quantity reaches the respective states before already allotted quota is exhausted to avoid loss of life. “..the availability of oxygen at the earliest is imperative. In absence thereof, many patients experience breathlessness and other complications and resultant fatalities. People in trauma cannot be made to run here and there in hospitals to get oxygen cylinders,” it said adding that Centre needs to be over sensitive and in an overdrive to reach out to patients in need of medical care and assistance.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/situation-critical-in-punjab-haryana-ut-consider-reorientation-of-o2-supply-hc-101620419163023.html

The couple rushed to Shergarh but were told by villagers that no vaccination drive was on. When they reached Sahri around 4pm, the vaccination centre was closed. They drove to the civil hospital to lodge a complaint with the health officials but before they could do that, they received provisional certificates on their cellphones saying that they had been successfully vaccinated at Sahri village. The QR-based certificates carried the name of the staff that vaccinated them and also mentioned the batch number of the dose.“It came as a shock. We needed the vaccine as a safeguard against coronavirus, not for completing any formality. We knew that we will face issues in getting a second jab so we argued with the authorities to administer us the dose of the same batch, which was mentioned in the certificate. We were asked to come the next day. On Friday, after a lot of dilly dallying, the staff at the civil hospital vaccination centre administered us the first dose,” said Ram Naresh.Civil surgeon Ranjit Singh said that inconvenience was caused due to some technical glitch in the online app. “This is first of its kind complaint, but otherwise, beneficiaries have been coming from far-off places to get vaccinated,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/phagwara-couple-gets-vaccination-certificates-without-getting-a-jab-101620418502776.html

The SIT --- headed by additional director general of police (vigilance bureau) LK Yadav, who will be assisted by Ludhiana police commissioner Rakesh Agarwal and Faridkot range DIG Surjit Singh --- will complete the investigation within six months, the government said. The high court on April 9 had quashed a report by an earlier Punjab Police SIT, headed by IG (now retired) Kunwar Vijay Pratap Singh into the Kotkapura firing. Police had opened fire at people protesting over the alleged desecration of the Guru Granth Sahib in Bargari village of Faridkot district. Police had also opened fire at a similar demonstration in Behbal Kalan, also in Faridkot, where two people were killed. A separate probe is underway in that case. The ruling Congress in Punjab has constantly targeted the Shiromani Akali Dal, which was in power then in the state, over the two incidents. The new SIT will investigate the two FIRs registered on October 14, 2015, and August 7, 2018, in connection with the Kotkapura incident. The state home department order said the new SIT would ensure “meticulous compliance” with the directions of the high court stipulating that there would be no interference from any quarter, internal or external, in the investigation. The SIT shall work jointly and all its members would put their signatures on all the proceedings of the investigation and the final report. The SIT would not report to any state executive or police authority regarding the investigation and would report only to the magistrate concerned, it said. The members of SIT have also been directed not to leak any part of the investigation and refrain from interacting with the media on the probe.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/punjab-govt-sets-up-new-sit-to-probe-2015-kotkapura-police-firing-101620418442732.html
08-05-2021||Chandigarh||In Punjab, 18+ priority groups to get jabs from Monday||The third and the largest phase of vaccination, under which beneficiaries in the 18-45 age group will be given jabs against coronavirus, will begin in Punjab on Monday.Chairing a review meeting, chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh on Friday asked officials to be ready to vaccinate priority groups in the 18-45 age category from Monday as the state is expected to receive one lakh doses of coronavirus vaccine from the Serum Institute of India (SII) by weekend.The state government has identified construction workers, teachers, government employees and those with co-morbidities as high-risk individuals in the 18-45 age group for priority vaccination. Vaccination of co-morbid categories will be planned by deputy commissioners and only advance registration and slotting of vaccination site will be allowed. The state government had ordered 30 lakh vaccine doses from the SII for the Phase 3 vaccination and the Centre has allocated 3.3 lakh doses to Punjab for May. 1,550 18+ beneficiaries inoculated Over 35 lakh beneficiaries in the 18-45 age group have registered in the state on the CoWIN app since April 28 for taking the vaccine shot in the third phase of vaccination, but the drive will start for only co-morbid people, constriction workers, teachers and government employees.The Punjab government had deferred the third phase of the vaccination drive in government vaccination centres, which was scheduled to start from May 1 as was announced by the central government, citing “‘shortage of doses”.Meanwhile, 1,550 people in this age group have already got vaccinated in private hospitals, data available with the health department revealed. “Till now, over 35 lakh beneficiaries have registered for the vaccination in 18+ category but they will have to wait for few more days to get the jabs as the drive will start with the limited vaccine stock. We are expecting second batch of 2 lakh Covishield doses from the SII next week,” said Dr Rajesh Bhaskar, state nodal officer for Covid-19.Vaccine shortage hits drive The state health department says that the erratic supply of vaccine doses from the Centre has hit the inoculation drive in Punjab, resulting in spread of the infection.In last seven days, state could administer the first dose of vaccine to only 1,44,779 beneficiaries (health care workers, frontline warriors and 45+ age group), with average of only 20,683 people per day. During the period, 79,500 people got the second dose of vaccine.“The vaccination shortage has badly hit the drive in Punjab as we are unable to administer jabs to even registered beneficiaries. After receiving 1.5 lakh doses on Thursday, we were left with just 2 lakh doses on Friday morning while the stock was used on Friday’s drive too. Also, 35 lakh people in 18+ category are also waiting for the doses in absence of the stock”, Dr Bhaskar said.(With inputs from Mandeep Narula)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/in-punjab-18-priority-groups-to-get-jabs-from-monday-101620418142712.html

He said almost entire factory was reduced to ashes within hours. “We have yet not got any statement from the factory owners about the loss, but it can run into crores. There were many imported machineries in the factory that were gutted,” he added. Member of Parliament (MP) Gurjit Singh Aujla and cabinet minister OP Soni also visited the site.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/dry-fruits-worth-crores-perish-in-amritsar-factory-fire-101620416883610.html
08-05-2021||Chandigarh||In Punjab, govt medical colleges’ labs flooded with swab samples||With the sudden spike in cases of coronavirus across the state, many major cities are suffering from unprecedented delays in RT-PCR test results as the Covid testing facilities of three government medical colleges (GMCs) at Faridkot, Amritsar and Patiala are overburdened and as a result, there is a big pileup of pending tests. As per the record, testing labs at GMCs are testing around 29,000 RT-PCR samples per day and the results are taking more than three days to be declared. Faridkot epidemiologist Dr Harjot Kaur said the swab samples sent for RT-PCR tests to GGSMCH lab are taking three days to be tested. “The delay in results causes further threat of spread as contact tracing only starts after receiving a positive report. We have raised this issue with Baba Farid University of Health Sciences (BFUHS) vice-chancellor Dr Raj Bahadur. The RT-PCR results should be available within 24 hours so that the isolation and contact tracing process could be started as soon as possible,” she added. Swab sample of patients from nine districts are sent to Faridkot medical college lab RT-PCR testing. While sample load has increased with the surge in cases, GGSMCH lab is having trouble giving RT-PCR test results early as 12 of its staff members, including six lab technicians and a research scientist, have tested positive. Rechecking of positive samples is also another reason for the delay. Dr Rajeev Sharma, GGSMCH principal, said that presently, the medical college lab is giving around 8,000-9,000 RT-PCR results everyday, which is less than the number of samples they are receiving every day right now. “We also retest the positive samples to double-check, so there is no error. Due to this, there is some delay in giving results, but we are catching up on the pendency,” he added. A Jalandhar resident said after being tested positive in a rapid antigen test, she also sent a sample for RT-PCR test. “I was informed that my sample was sent to Faridkot medical college, but even after three days, I have not received the test result report,” she added. Jaskaran Singh from Amritsar said, “My wife and I experienced mild symptoms on May 4, after which we decided to undergo RT-PCR tests. It has been four days since we have given swab samples, but my wife’s test report is still pending, whereas I was tested positive for Covid-19 on Friday. Despite being symptomatic, we had to wait for four days for the reports and medication.” Dr Lavina, Covid testing lab in-charge of GMC, Amritsar, said, “The labs are overburdened with samples as cases are rapidly increasing in the state. We are testing around 9,000 samples daily while the positivity remains between 10-15%. We are trying to give reports to the people as early as possible.” Dr Rupinder Bakshi, in-charge of GMC, Patiala lab, said, “Since we are experiencing the highest-ever demand for Covid-19 testing due to the second wave of the pandemic, we are trying to do our best to give results on time. Presently, we are testing around 12,000 samples per day and giving results in 24 hours.” Patiala civil surgeon Dr Satinder Singh said, “We are receiving RT-PCR results of the district within 24 hours. But there is a delay in results of samples coming from other districts due to transportation and other reasons.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/in-punjab-govt-medical-colleges-labs-flooded-with-swab-samples-101620416882549.html
08-05-2021||Delhi||Fall in Covid-19 positivity rate a ray of hope for Delhi||The average weekly test positivity rate – proportion of samples tested that return positive for Covid-19 – in Delhi has now dropped at least five percentage points in the past week, offering a much-needed glimmer of hope at a time when the Capital’s administration and its people are engaged in a brutal battle against the city’s fourth Covid wave.What may be the first signs of recovery (with the positivity rate, and subsequently, cases starting to plateau) for Delhi started to appear around two weeks since the time the city went under a lockdown, data shows.The move, experts suggested, appeared to have helped bring the transmission of the disease under control, although they warned that removing curbs on social movement prematurely may again start the spread of the infection.On Friday, the daily positivity rate was 24.9%, remaining below 25% for the second day in a row, even as the Capital added 19,832 new cases and recorded 341 new deaths, according to the government’s bulletin on Friday, taking the total number of infections in the city to 1,292,867 and fatalities to 18,739.In the past week, 27.4% of all samples have returned positive in Delhi, against 32.5% the week before. The average positivity rate was consistently above 30% in the two weeks before the current one.Also read | SC warns of coercive action if Delhi’s O2 quota not metTo be sure, even at 27.4%, the current average positivity rate in Delhi remains more than five times the 5% threshold recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) at which the Covid-19 infections in an area can be said to be under control.Positivity rate is a crucial metric that shows how widespread the virus is in the community, and over time it provides an idea of whether a region’s testing strategy is adequate to contain the virus. Generally, this metric serves as a precursor to the movement of new infections in a region – for instance, if a region’s positivity rate is rising, it means that cases will likely remain rising (if the same amount of testing is maintained) over the coming days.This apparent cresting of the wave is reflected when we take a look at the case curve in Delhi – the seven-day average of daily infections have dropped 19% from the peak of 25,294 for the week ending April 23 (exactly two weeks ago) to 20,505 for the week ending Friday.Deaths due to the disease, however, are yet to see as proportionate a drop as cases have – the seven-day average of daily deaths have only seen a marginal drop of 7% from peak value so far. However, studies have shown that death figures generally catch up to change in rate of cases at a 14-day lag. This is because studies have showed that the median time between someone testing positive for Covid-19 and dying from it (if things go South) is around 13.8 days.Experts said the reduction in positivity rate appeared to show that Delhi has reached its fourth peak.Watch | ‘Covid third wave may not happen if we take strong measures’: Dr K VijayRaghavan﻿“The reducing positivity rate is a signal that Delhi has reached the peak of infections. Now, whether the current reduction is because of the lockdown, we cannot know for sure. This could be the natural progression of the disease; any infection can spread only to a certain extent before coming down. Lockdown, if properly implemented, prevent interfamily transmissions giving hospitals a breather – allowing them to arrange beds, oxygen, medicines etc,” said Dr Jacob John, former head of the department of virology at the Christian Medical College-Vellore.But he warned that removing curbs on social movement may again start the spread of the infection. “However, with an airborne infection like Covid-19, the infections are likely to start spreading again when the lockdown is lifted. The government has to ensure that 100% masking is followed after lockdown,” he said.“A stringent lockdown may be used to break the chain of transmission. However, we cannot remain in lockdown for months on end. So, while planning to come out of the lockdown the government has to ensure that a significant proportion – 40% to 50% -- of the people are vaccinated,” said Dr Amit Singh, associate professor, Centre for Infectious Disease at Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/fall-in-positivity-rate-a-ray-of-hope-for-city-101620416275846.html
08-05-2021||Other||4 held for animal trafficking attempt in Maharashtra’s Alibag||Four persons were arrested in Alibag, Raigad district, on Thursday for protected wildlife’s trafficking attempt. Two live pangolins, an adult female and a cub were recovered from the accused who have been booked under relevant sections of the Wildlife Protection Act (1972) by the Maharashtra forest department.Pangolins are protected under Schedule I of the Wildlife Act, putting them in the same bracket as tigers, lions, rhinos and several other species. Smuggling or hunting of pangolins – which are classified as endangered in the International Union for Conservation of Nature’s red list of threatened species – attracts the highest penalties as per the law.Thursday’s arrest was made in Navghar region of the Sudhagad Pali forest reserve in Alibag. Officials said they acted on a tip-off received from an informant, and were able to nab the accused after one of them posed as a customer interested in purchasing pangolins for their scales, which are in high demand in the international wildlife market. “We had been on the trail of the accused for three days,” said range forest officer Sameer Shinde, who also credited Alibag’s deputy conservator of forests Ashish Thakre, and assistant conservator of forests Sanjay Kadam, for their role in the operation. The four accused have been booked under Sections 9 (prohibition of hunting), 39 (3) (possession of wild animals), 44 (1) (a) (dealing in captive animals), 48 (a) (illegal transportation of wildlife), 49 (purchase of wild animals) and sections 50, 51, and 51 (a), which dealing with arrests and penalties, of the Wildlife Protection Act (1972). They have been remanded to police custody.This is the third incident in Maharashtra this year where poachers have been arrested for smuggling of pangolins. In February, four people had been arrested from Ahmednagar district for attempting to smuggle these animals. During the same month, three persons had also been arrested from Raigad district in a similar case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/4-held-for-animal-trafficking-attempt-in-maharashtra-s-alibag-101620416341933.html

The elephant, 25-year-old Gajraj, was finally tranquilised at 5am on Friday after a nightlong operation.Department officials said the elephant had entered a period of musth, a phenomenon seen in male adults that is characterised by aggressive, irritable behaviour and in which the elephant’s testosterone levels can shoot up by almost 60 times. Musth is a healthy occurrence and typically lasts between two-four months.“Unaware of this fact, assistant conservator of forests (Kolsa), Mr Kurkarni, along with chief accountant at the office of forest department, TATR, were moving in the same area. Their vehicle got stuck in the mud and they had to leave the vehicle looking at the approaching elephant. In the process, the elephant attacked the two and tragically Shri Gaurkar, chief accountant, died in the event,” the forest department said in a statement.“Two rapid response teams, one from Tadoba Tiger Reserve and another from the Chandrapur forest division had to be called in. We started tracking the animal on Thursday evening, but because it got dark and the elephant was aggressive, we could not confront it till about 5am, when it was finally taken into captivity. The elephant is currently chained and we’ll take a decision on releasing it after it is out of musth,” said Jitendra Ramgaonkar, chief conservator of forests, TATR.At least 80 people, including several members of TATR’s tiger protection force, were roped in for the operation. “Our main concern was the safety of villagers in Kolsa and Ram Talodi, which are the only two habitations inside the TATR core area. We immediately put the residents on alert. Our elephant camp was initially located outside the core tiger reserve area in a village called Moharli, and was shifted earlier this year to Botezari to avoid incidents like this. This was an extremely unfortunate occurrence,” said Ramgaonkar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/forest-dept-staffer-killed-by-elephant-in-maharashtra-s-reserve-animal-restrained-101620415981910.html

A metropolitan magistrate at Mulund remanded them in police custody till May 10.“During investigation, we learnt that the water pumps and smoke detectors were not functional at the mall. Pona Corporation is a BMC (Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation)-authorised licenced agency, which claimed to have tested the fire-fighting system in the mall and submitted bogus fitness certificate. Based on it, the fire department issued an NOC to the mall, said Dhakane.Bhandup police have also booked several people, including HDIL directors Rakeshkumar Wadhawan and his son Sarang, Nikita Amitsingh Trehan and Deepak Shirke, as well as Amitsingh Trehan and Sweetie Jain who are the directors of Privilege Health Care Services Private Limited, for culpable homicide not amounting to murder.Sections 409 (criminal breach of trust), 465 (forgery) and 471 (using as genuine a forged document or electronic record) of the Indian Penal Code have been added to the crime on Thursday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/bhandup-mall-fire-hospital-group-s-executive-fire-agency-staffer-held-101620415921966.html
08-05-2021||Mumbai||Covid vaccines for 18+: Maharashtra to give priority to 35-44 age group||Amid limited stock for the third phase for the 18-44 age group and to control crowding at vaccination centres, the Maharashtra government plans to first give the shot to those in the 35-44 age group, with preference to people with comorbidities. Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray is expected to take a decision on it, said state health minister Rajesh Tope, adding the inoculation of those in the 18-34 age group would start once adequate doses are available.Currently, the state is inoculating citizens in the 18-44 age group only at five centres in a district, as the number of doses is limited. The state started the drive with 300,000 Covishield doses and later purchased 479,000 Covaxin doses. So far, 215,284 citizens in the 18-44 category have been inoculated since May 1. The move is prompted amid instances of people from urban areas taking an appointment at vaccination centres in rural areas. Tope said such incidents have caused “unrest” among locals in rural areas. “Till we have abundant supply of vaccines, we will have to make slots as per the age group and comorbidities. If 100% people from the 18-44 category are allowed to go, there can be crowding. We plan to have an age bracket of 35 to 44, with preference to people with comorbidities. I will discuss this with the chief minister,” said Tope. The state is also in talks with the Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF), Russia’s sovereign wealth fund that helped financed vaccine Sputnik V, to purchase doses. “We are trying to get the stock available with them,” Tope told reporters on Friday. He said the state has not got the doses assured by Serum Institute of India for inoculation of the 18-44 category. “The institute had assured us that it would supply additional 350,000 doses, but so far it has not come. For the 18-44 age group, we are going slow as per the availability of 779,000 vaccines. As we get more stock, we will ramp it up.” With the vaccination of over 700,000 people in the 45+ age group on Wednesday and Thursday, the state is left with a limited number of doses. With under 100,000 doses remaining, the vaccination drive for people over the age of 45 is expected to slow down this weekend, unless doses arrive from the Centre, Tope said. Maharashtra had received 900,000 doses earlier this week from the Centre. Tope said they are “constantly” following up with the Centre to provide doses of Covishield and Covaxin. Over 400,000 people in the state are due for their second dose of Covaxin. With the Centre not sending Covaxin doses, the state will take a decision on diverting the doses it has purchased for the second dose of people over age 45. The Centre provides vaccines to the states for free. The state has been buying vaccines for those in the 18-44 age group. “Two days ago, we had received 900,000 doses for vaccination of people over 45 years. Of the stock, 800,000 doses have been consumed. We have some thousand vaccines left. We appeal to the Centre to provide vaccines in large quantities, especially Covaxin. Around 400,000 to 500,000 people are due for their second dose of Covaxin. It has to be given within 42 days. If they do not provide in time, the state will divert the Covaxin doses it has purchased. But we are confident that the Centre will provide adequate doses,” Tope said. The minister reiterated the state is prepared to purchase 120 million doses at one go for the inoculation of 57.1 million population in the 18-44 category as vaccination remains “top priority” of the government. He added the state can ramp up daily vaccinations to 1 million, but the stock is not available.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/covid-vaccines-for-18-maharashtra-to-give-priority-to-35-44-age-group-101620415681975.html

The special NDPS (Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act) court in Mumbai remanded Shah to judicial custody for 14 days on Friday, said NCB zonal director Sameer Wankhede. According to NCB officers, Shah was arrested from Miramar, Panjim, in Goa on March 8 during an operation in a local seizure case. Shah, a native of Madhya Pradesh, was running a shack and resort in Goa’s Morjim area from the past several years.Shah had allegedly supplied drugs to two local suppliers, Anuj Keshwani and Regal Mahakaal, who were arrested in September and December, respectively, in the drug probe related to the actor’s death.Keshwani and Mahakaal had revealed Shah’s involvement in the supply of drugs. “Both had in their statements said that Shah had supplied LSD and charas to them,” said Wankhede.Accordingly, NBC located Shah in Miramar and conducted raids at his premises on March 8 and allegedly recovered 15 blots of LSD (commercial quantity) and 30 grams of charas from there, said Wankhede.Thereafter, the agency filed an application on April 30 to take Shah’s custody to conduct an inquiry into the drug angle in Rajput’s death probe. The NDPS sessions court at Panjim issued an order, following which Shah’s custody was taken from the jail and he was produced in the court at Goa. He was brought to Mumbai on May 6 on transit remand. Keshwani is a Khar resident and during a search at his residence in September last year, the agency allegedly seized 590 grams of hashish, 0.64 gram of LSD sheets, 304 grams of marijuana, including imported marijuana joints and capsules, and cash worth ₹1.85 lakh as well as Indonesian currency from him. During his interrogation, Keshwani said Mahakaal used to supply drugs to him. Keshwani had allegedly supplied drugs to actor Rhea Chakraborty and Rajput, who was found dead in his Bandra apartment last June. Chakraborty’s counsel has earlier denied all the allegations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/sushant-singh-rajput-s-death-case-ncb-nabs-alleged-drug-supplier-from-goa-101620415502022.html

Police nabbed him after a chase of over three kilometres.The accused identified as Manikandan alias Shambhu Kuttan, was residing at Juhu Gaon in Navi Mumbai and was wanted in more than 23 cases in Mumbai.According to police, Manikandan had been absconding after a theft case was registered against him on April 8. Sub-inspector Sandeep Rahane said that he changed his mobile number every 15 days, which made it difficult to track him. On Wednesday, however, Rahane received a tip-off about Manikandan residing in Vashi.“We immediately informed the Vashi police and laid a trap near his residence at Juhu Gaon,” said Rahane. However, just before a police team reached the spot, Manikandan was alerted by his informers about the police search.“Manikandan then dressed as a woman jumped off the roof of his building and began fleeing. We already knew about his disguises, so we kept a watch and chased him,” added Rahane. After a chase of over three kilometres, the police were able to intercept Manikandan and arrest him.Sub-inspector Dattaray Malvekar, who was also a part of the team said, “After committing the crime Manikandan would return to the scene or nearby area dressed as a woman or a sadhu or any of the disguises to meet his informer or keep a watch on the police,” said Malvekar.After the arrest of Manikandan, the police are now trying to find out how many more crimes has he committed and his other disguises.Prakash Chougule, senior police inspector of Mankhurd police station said that there are several crimes registered against Manikandan. He has been booked for threatening, assault, kidnapping and attempt to murder in police stations across the city. Manikandan has been externed from the city twice since 2007.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/local-gangster-disguised-as-woman-in-navi-mumbai-held-101620415381863.html

HC said there was no evidence suggesting the involvement of the trio – arrested by Mumbai Police’s economic offences wing in 2019 – in the alleged fraud. “There is no evidence to show that the applicants were a part of any conspiracy with the prime accused in causing loss to the bank. There is nothing on record to show that the applicants at any point of time had met accused Nos 1, 2 [realty group Housing Development Infrastructure Limited’s Rakeshkumar Wadhawan and his son Sarang] or there were any meetings with HDIL’s directors,” said HC while granting bail to Dr Trupti Bane, Mukti Bavisi and Rajneet Tara Singh Nandrajog. “There is no evidence that the applicants received any kickback or gratification as board of directors of the bank or that they misused their position in sanctioning loan to themselves or to their relatives or any other person known to them,” the court added.Dr Bane, who works at Bhabha Hospital, was represented by noted lawyer Niteen Pradhan. Bavisi, a non-practicing chartered accountant was represented by senior advocate Ashok Mundargi, while Nandrajog had appointed Wesley Menezes and Waqar Pathan as his counsels.They had pointed that the statements of the witnesses do not establish prima facie case for commission of offence against their clients. All instructions to effectuate the fraudulent transactions were given by the chairperson and managing director to the managerial personnel of PMC Bank, they had argued.The prosecution had opposed the bail pleas.As per the prosecution case, the multi-state scheduled cooperative bank granted loans to HDIL without following the due process. The principle loan amount of ₹2,400 crore snowballed to ₹6,670 crore because HDIL allegedly failed to repay for the multiple loans taken between 2008 and 2019. PMC Bank’s senior management covered up these irregularities to avoid scrutiny by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), by masking the loan transactions from the Central bank auditors and manipulating the compute system to keep the transactions accessible only to a select few within the bank, the prosecution alleged.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/bombay-hc-grants-bail-to-3-independent-directors-of-pmc-bank-101620415321893.html

The matter has been listed for final hearing on June 30, before a two-judge bench comprising chief justice Dipankar Datta and justice GS Kulkarni.The impugned office memorandum, dated February 19, and authored by joint secretary of MoEFCC’s CRZ division Sujit Kumar Bajpayee, was also stayed by the Madurai bench of the Madras HC on April 29, in response to a different petition.MoEFCC’s office memo would have allowed projects – typically permitted as per CRZ, 2011, but did not seek requisite clearances prior to commencement –to become regularised subject to fulfilment of certain conditions.“Bringing such projects and activities in compliance with the environmental laws at the earliest point of time is therefore essential, rather than leaving them unregulated and unchecked, which will be more damaging to the environment,” Bajpayee had written to the environment secretaries of all coastal states.“As the project commenced construction and/or operations without a prior CRZ clearance, the respective coastal zone management authority shall assess the environmental damages caused by such an action and shall give specific recommendation in respect of activities, corresponding to the environmental or ecological damage assessed, to be taken up by the project proponent within a period of three years from the date of clearance, under compensatory conservation plan (CCP) and a community resource augmentation plan,” stated MoEFCC’s February 19 office memorandum, which has been reviewed by HT.“This circular empowers coastal authorities/MoEFCC to regularise all kinds of CRZ violations on a day-to-day basis, making it easier for environmental violators to evade substantive law. It further encourages a “pollute and pay” principle rather than the ‘precautionary principle’. A public interest litigation is filed by Vanashakti on the ground that this circular is arbitrary, wholly unconstitutional and in direct contravention of recent Supreme Court judgments,” said Mumbai-based NGO Vanashakti, at the time of filing their PIL before HC on March 30.Experts also pointed out while the amended CRZ (2019) notification has come into force, contingent coastal zone management plans (CZMP) as per the same have not yet been finalised. Until such a time, CRZ 2011 rules should remain in force, Vanashakti’s petition clarified, adding that neither notification allows for grant of ‘ex-post facto CRZ clearance’ which the MoEFCC’s office memorandum proposes to facilitate.HC has also stated that if any permission has been granted or any application has been received for any such CRZ regularisation by a violator since February 2019, then such persons and industries are to be informed of the proceedings stemming from Vanashakti’s PIL.“All such permissions and applications will be subjected to the outcome of the present PIL,” said Vanashakti’s advocate, Zaman Ali. A copy of the HC order is not yet available. The Madras HC, meanwhile, is set to take up the matter on August 25, in response to a PIL filed by R Fatima of Thoothukudi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/bombay-hc-stays-post-facto-crz-clearance-for-projects-101620415141813.html
08-05-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai civic body looks to boost ‘Brand BMC’||The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) is looking at ways to strengthen its image and build its reputation by enhancing its social media presence across digital platforms, namely Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, Telegram, YouTube and blogs. It is now looking for a dedicated agency to maintain these platforms for at least nine departments of the civic body – public health department, education department, disaster management and fire brigade departments, roads and traffic departments, sewage, solid waste management and water departments, social media accounts of all 24 wards, various municipal hospitals, and the main umbrella account of the civic body. The agency will be hired on a contractual basis for content management, creation and improving creative design. As part of this, the BMC wants to create interactive strategies such as quizzes, crossword puzzles, contests and online surveys, across these social media platforms, live streamlining and tweeting of events, live broadcasts and webcasts. Social media platforms will also be used to give out information on the civic body’s policy decisions, services, initiatives, and events. Currently, an agency has been informally appointed by the civic body to manage its various social media accounts, which was met with mixed reactions from BMC corporators, when it started two years ago. While some criticised it as a waste of BMC’s financial resources, others pointed it was much needed to effectively communicate with citizens, especially a younger audience. Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner incharge of BMC’s disaster management, fire brigade and public health departments, among others, said, “We want to formalise a contract with any agency appointed with the due tendering process, that will manage BMC’s social media presence. Social media is an effective tool in communicating with citizens, and especially during a pandemic. Our expectations from the agency have been listed out in detail in the tender document. We have a comprehensive vision of social media communication.” A tender floated by the civic body to appoint an agency said, “It will strengthen the image of the BMC as an empathetic local body and of Mumbai as a premier smart city. The aim is to bridge the gap between public perception and brand reputation of BMC.” As part of the contract, that will be valid for one year, the BMC is looking for audio and video editors, creative content writers, public relations officers, translators, photographers, videographers. Recently, the BMC undertook various initiatives to engage with Mumbaiites. In January, the BMC headquarters opened its doors to tourism, and organised guided history tours of the BMC building on the weekends. For two years now, barricades placed along civic work happening on roads and footpaths across the city sport fun facts about BMC’s history, or Mumbai City. A senior civic officer said, “It is time we looked at customer experience. This type of social media exercise will also give credibility to the information about the civic body that is floating in the public domain. It will help us counter fake information effectively, create awareness, educate Mumbaiites about the work done by the civic body. Citizens can feel closer to the civic body because they can directly reach us, convey queries or grievances from their phones.” Ravi Raja, leader of the opposition in BMC, said, “The BMC has tried using social media before and failed. Each administrative head comes up with his own idea. In times of a pandemic, we need to think before we utilise money for such an initiative.” Nayana Kathpalia, a resident of South Mumbai, who has been engaging with the BMC for two decades through various community and citizens initiatives, said, “This is a good idea. The BMC does a lot of work, but there is not enough awareness or information about it. Some years ago, the BMC was constructing an underground water tunnel between Malabar Hill and Churchgate area. The work was done so seamlessly, quietly, without interfering with routine public life. No one even realised that a huge tunnel was being constructed under main roads, railway lines and residential buildings in South Mumbai. We are always bashing the BMC, so it’s time we also saw how much work gets done on the ground.” Kathpalia added, “However, the civic body should examine if it’s premature to spend so much money on non-Covid information at present.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-civic-body-looks-to-boost-brand-bmc-101620415022599.html
08-05-2021||Mumbai||Resident doctors in Mumbai demand arrears in stipends, start social media campaign||Resident doctors of civic-run hospitals in the city, who have not received an additional stipend for almost nine months, have threatened to not take part in Covid-19 services if their arrears are not cleared soon.On Friday, #BMCbetrayedus and #BetrayedStillWorking trended on Twitter as resident doctors took to social media to register their protest against the non-payment of stipend and arrears. In a statement released Wednesday, the Mumbai chapter of the Maharashtra Association of Resident Doctors (MARD) said that doctors will shut down Covid services in the next seven days if the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) does not release the stipend.“We do not want to stop our services to Covid-19 patients. We are hoping and trying that it doesn’t come to that. We are putting up posters at the hospitals and making our voices heard as we continue our work,” said Arun Ghule, president, MARD, Mumbai.From May 2020 till January this year, over 3,000 resident doctors of the four BMC-run hospitals—KEM, Sion, Nair and Cooper—were paid ₹10,000 a month. It was then discontinued as Covid-19 cases started to go down. In September, the government announced a hike of ₹10,000 in the stipend for resident doctors, however, the civic body released a circular regarding the stipend only in March.When doctors demanded the arrears for the stipend hike, they said the BMC informed them that the arrears were adjusted against the ₹10,000 paid to them last year during the first Covid-19 wave. “This is unfair, especially since doctors have been working non-stop, risking their lives during the pandemic,” said Ghule. MARD claimed that the arrears for each doctor amount to ₹1.2 lakh. Despite repeated attempts, TP Lahane, medical education director, said the matter was in the jurisdiction of BMC. However, Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner, health, did not respond to calls or messages, despite repeated attempts. The Maharashtra State Association of resident Doctors has also extended its support to the doctors in Mumbai. “This tragedy is greater than the pandemic itself for the resident doctors. The government has finally found scapegoats to hide their failures in the resident doctors,” said the association in a statement on Friday. Meanwhile, doctors have stormed social media with their pleas for arrears.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/resident-doctors-in-mumbai-demand-arrears-in-stipends-start-social-media-campaign-101620414961962.html

08-05-2021||Mumbai||IIT-Bombay student magazine demands no-fail policy||The demand for a no-fail policy is gaining ground among students at the Indian Institute of Technology-Bombay (IIT-B), with the institute’s student magazine — Insight — making a case for it. In an editorial published Wednesday, Insight made an “absolute demand” for a no-fail policy in view of the Covid-19 pandemic and virtual classes. “It could make sense to fail students who have performed below a certain (usually very low) threshold set by the professor, if: all students are equally able to attend classes, all students are able to focus on their academics, all students are able to give their best in their examinations. If any of the conditions above do not hold, failing students does not make any sense. It has serious negative consequences for a student,” read the editorial. Members of Insight declined to comment. Institute director Subhasis Chaudhuri said, “I was not aware of such a demand. Our end-semester exams are all over now. Only project evaluations are possibly still remaining. We have given (students) the option for S grade for the projects. That carries a lot of weight.” He did not comment on if the institute was planning to introduce a no-fail policy. However, students interviewed by HT said virtual learning was not enough and the pressure of the pandemic keeps students from performing their best at exams. “There is a genuine frustration among students about the evaluation policies of the institute. Our learning environments are different from what it used to be on campus,” said a BTech student on the condition of anonymity. “Learning virtually is a pain, because you miss out significantly on peer learning. The online class environment is not great, difficult for dialogue during most lectures, so it’s a fairly disconnected learning,” said a final-year BTech student. He added, “During exams, it’s very difficult to maintain a conducive environment at home, especially with the strict proctoring. Some professors insist on rigorous continuous evaluation, magnifying academic stress.” The stress of family members, close friends and acquaintances suffering from Covid-19 also affect students’ ability to perform in exams, they said. “Most professors have conducted continuous and rigorous evaluation throughout the semester which has actually been far more demanding than a regular semester. Students have, at different points of the semester, been forced to make a direct choice between their academic performance and their mental and physical wellbeing. This is inhumane enough, but to fail them on top of all this is downright apathy,” read the op-ed by Insight. As the pandemic broke out in March last year, the institute allowed students to drop a course and also opt for an S grade. The S grade is a place-holder and depicts notionally a pass in a course and the test can be taken again to improve the grade. In its op-ed, Insight also made a case for S grade to be applied to the upcoming semester. The institute’s senate is yet to decide whether the option will be available to students in the upcoming semester.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/iitbombay-student-magazine-demands-no-fail-policy-101620414842998.html
08-05-2021||Other||Defer Class 5 and 8 scholarship exam: Schools, parents to Maharashtra govt||As Covid-19 infections in Maharashtra continue to remain high, schools and parents have urged the state education department to either postpone or cancel the Class 5 and Class 8 scholarship examination, scheduled to be held on May 23. Over the past few days, there have been several demands to cancel the exam considering the risks involved in conducting them offline. However, a circular issued by the Maharashtra State Council of Examination on May 5, which had asked schools and teachers to prepare for the offline exam, irked parents and schools. “At a time when all exams including the professional ones such as JEE (Joint Entrance Examination), NEET (National Eligibility cum Entrance Test) and even board exams are being postponed, why the insistence on conducting offline exam for students as young as Class 5 and Class 8? In fact, if the exam cannot be postponed, it can be cancelled altogether. Children’s safety is more important than any exam,” said the principal of a suburban school. While the exam was earlier scheduled to take place on April 25, it was later pushed to May 23 due to the Covid-19 outbreak and the resultant lockdown. Officials said that they will issue a circular in this regard soon. “There is a plan to postpone the exam and we will issue an official circular soon,” said an official from the education department.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/defer-class-5-and-8-scholarship-exam-schools-parents-to-maharashtra-govt-101620414842335.html
08-05-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai: Doctors flag indiscriminate use of steroids, antibiotics in Covid-19 treatment||A 43-year-old man from Andheri was prescribed a cocktail of antibiotics, antiviral, and steroids on his first consultation with a local physician when he developed symptoms and was suspected of Covid-19. At first, he got better but within days he developed a persistent high-grade fever and his oxygen saturation levels dropped, following which he had to be hospitalized last month. In another instance, a 13-year-old girl with Covid-19 was prescribed a heavy dosage of steroids by her family physician on the fifth day of her illness, even as her symptoms had diminished. Her physician made the prescription based on a chest CT scan that showed a slight abnormality in her lungs. On the 10th day, she developed a full-blown fever and was rushed to a hospital where the doctors had to take her off steroids and work with other medicines. These are not one-off cases. City’s top medical experts have flagged a trend of patients being prescribed steroids in the first few days of symptoms. Even antibiotics that have no role in treating Covid-19 -- a viral infection-- and antiviral drugs that have little evidence backing them are being indiscriminately used, they said. “The Recovery Trial carried out in the UK has established that a 6mg dose of dexamethasone once daily has shown reduced mortality,” said Dr Sujeet K Rajan, city-based respiratory medicine specialist. “But what you see in practice is disturbing. Patients are given two to three times more steroids than what they should be given,” he said. The Recovery Trial conducted in the United Kingdom – preliminary results came out in June 2020 --found that a 6mg dose of dexamethasone, an inexpensive steroid drug, once daily for up to 10 days decreased mortality in patients on respiratory support. The trial also showed that patients not requiring oxygen did not benefit from the drug. Steroids like dexamethasone are widely used to fight against inflammation, one of the effects of the coronavirus disease. However, most doctors label steroids as “double edged swords” in Covid-19 treatment if they are not used judiciously. In fact, the unwarranted use of steroids began soon after the trial results became public. Given that the number of Covid-19 cases is higher in absolute numbers, the problem is more pronounced in the second wave. “This has the potential to be nothing short of a disaster,” said Rajan, who practices at Bombay Hospital. Indiscriminate use “Starting patients on steroids early is harmful for them,” said infectious disease expert Dr Tanu Singhal from Kokilaben Dhirubhai Ambani Hospital where the 43-year-old man and the teenager mentioned above are undergoing treatment. “Steroids lower the body’s immunity and can also cause viral replication. Their unindicated and early use worsen the outcome of patients. The right time to use steroids is when the oxygen saturation is low,” she said. The treatment protocol released by the Maharashtra Covid-19 task force in April 2021 allows the use of steroid- injection dexamethasone in moderate patients with pneumonia and oxygen saturation below 94%. Put simply, viral replication is a process of multiplication of the virus in the body. As steroids mask symptoms and reduce the body’s immunity, patients are at the risk of developing a severe infection. Dr Randeep Guleria, a member of the national Covid-19 task force and director of All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), Delhi has also recently cautioned against an early use of steroids and said that it leads to “faster viral replication and severe viral pneumonia.” According to Rajan, unwarranted high doses of steroids, often coupled with unnecessary high-generation antibiotics, present the perfect soil for invasive and life-threatening fungal infections, which can be independently a major risk factor for mortality. Cases of mucormycosis, a stubborn fungal infection are now widely being reported from the city. Also referred to as black fungus, it commonly affects sinuses or the lungs. While the disease is tackled with medication at a very early stage, cutting away the infected tissue is the only option when it spreads. Doctors in the city have had to operate out tissues of the eyes, nose and jaw in many patients. “We currently have 21 patients with mucormycosis and 15 of them are in an inoperable stage,” said Dr Hemant Deshmukh, dean of civic-run KEM Hospital. “The number of patients coming with these infections has doubled,” he said. Doctors said that post-Covid-19 we are staring at a wave of threatening antimicrobial resistance. “Antibiotics like doxycycline, azithromycin, and others are crucial in treating illnesses and infections like typhoid, scrub typhus, pneumonia, etc,” said Singhal. “With their unnecessary use, we are leading to a serious drug resistance,” she said. Singhal has also stopped using ivermectin and another antiviral called favipiravir as they don’t play any role in treating Covid-19 contrary to popular belief. Many doctors in the city have questioned the inclusion of antibiotic doxycycline for off-label use and antiviral drug ivermectin in the Covid-19 treatment protocol framed by the state task force. “The task force has simply encouraged the grassroots level physicians to use antibiotics and antivirals without any great evidence backing these drugs,” said a senior doctor who did not wish to be named. Anti-microbial resistance Antibiotics, antivirals, antifungals and antiparasitic drugs are known as antimicrobial drugs. Misuse and overuse of antimicrobial drugs is one of the main factors for antimicrobial resistance. The World Health Organization has declared antimicrobial resistance as one of the top 10 global public health threats facing humanity. “For mild patients, we immediately start doxycycline, ivermectin, and paracetamol,” said Dr. Akhtar Shaikh, general secretary of the Dharavi AYUSH Doctors Association- a body of nearly 180 alternative medicine practitioners in Dharavi, who are also now treating Covid-19 patients with allopathic drugs. “Additionally, we also prescribe some AYUSH remedies for symptom relief,” Shaikh said that antibiotics are crucial because patients may have an underlying bacterial infection developed along with Covid-19 when the body’s immunity is low. “We avoid steroids before seven days of symptoms unless it is extremely necessary,” he added. Due to a shortage of healthcare staff, mainly allopathy doctors, the state government has also deployed a large number of AYUSH practitioners on Covid-19 duty. On the grassroots, however, many other alternative medicine practitioners prescribe allopathic medications, even when they are not allowed to do so. “Except Ayurveda and Unani practitioners, no other alternative medicine practitioners are allowed to prescribe allopathic medicines in Maharashtra,” said Dr Jayesh Lele, general secretary of the Indian Medical Association (IMA). “But the government rule that allows these practitioners to prescribe allopathic medicines has been challenged in court by the IMA. This is a huge problem and often leads to unwarranted use of drugs,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-doctors-flag-indiscriminate-use-of-steroids-antibiotics-in-covid-19-treatment-101620414781884.html
08-05-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai: Stand-up comedians bring smile on tired faces of doctors||Laughter is the best medicine, and who knows this better than stand-up comedians. Several well-known comedians have joined hands with civic-run medical colleges in bringing a smile on the faces of the overwhelmed doctors amid the Covid-19 pandemic. “I have never seen so many deaths...sometimes, we have to decide depending on the vitals of the patients whom to prioritise. We feel helpless...,” said a 28-year-old resident doctor from the orthopaedic department of Lokmanya Tilak General Hospital, also known as Sion hospital.He is one of the 700 resident doctors from the hospital who have been working tirelessly since the outbreak of the pandemic in March 2020. He had also contracted the Covid-19 infection in January. So far, 262 resident doctors from the hospital alone have been infected with Covid-19 while taking care of the Covid-19 patients. In addition, 650 resident doctors from the other three civic-run medical colleges — King Edward Memorial (KEM), RN Cooper and BYL Nair hospitals — have been diagnosed with Covid-19 since last year. The ongoing pandemic, especially the second wave, has taken a toll on the mental health of resident doctors who are the main pillars of the healthcare system. “It is not only exhausting us physically but also mentally. Most of us have burnt out and have anxiety. The second wave is more stressful due to shortages of beds, medicines and oxygen because we have to deal with patients in need every day,” said a 29-year-old post-graduation student from the medicine department, KEM Hospital. “When we lose someone to the virus, we don’t even get the time to grief,” he added.City psychiatrists cautioned about a possible rise in mental ailments due to the increased work demand, social isolation, decreased self-care and increased exposure to emotionally traumatic events at work and home.Last week, a resident doctor at a private hospital in Delhi died by suicide due to severe stress amid the deadly second wave of the pandemic. Another 22-year-old medical student from Vadodara died by hanging himself from a fan on May 6 due to the stress related to Covid-19 duty. “Hours long duty in Covid wards in personal protective equipment (PPE) amid the ongoing crisis can break anyone. These young doctors have been working since 14 months, which will leave a mark on their mental health,” said Dr Harish Shetty, a psychiatrist who has been working closely with the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) for counselling of the caregivers. Laugh it out say hospitalsResident doctors claim that almost 70% of them are suffering from Covid stress. To address the issues, medical colleges are inviting stand-up comedians to improve their mental health with humour. “These brave fighters have been through a lot. They are exhausted and tired. So, other than counselling, we are trying to uplift their mood through humour. And comedy is the best way to keep them entertained,” said Dr Henal Shah, head of the psychiatry department, Nair Hospital.Last week, actor and stand-up comedian Ali Asgar performed for the doctors at Sion hospital. He held a 45-minute programme for the doctors in the hospital premises, while maintaining social distance and Covid-19 precautionary measures. “The health system is completely dependent on the shoulders of these young doctors. When I heard them laugh, I felt that, in some way, I have also contributed to the society during this pandemic,” Asgar said. “After the programme, so many students came and told me that they laughed so loudly after days. I have performed in different shows but never felt so happy,” he added.Last week, stand-up comedian Sahil Shah, who is also the founder of East India Comedy, performed a virtual pro bono show for doctors of the medical colleges. Talking to HT, he said, “Both my parents are doctors, so I know the stress that they are going through. So, as soon as I got the invitation, I immediately accepted it, because that was my way of thanking them for their service. There were jokes about Covid-19 and viruses, which helped make the doctors laugh.” Mumbai Dharkan, a group of NGOs, has tied up with medical colleges for the well-being of doctors. Other than providing nutritional food, they are also arranging different programmes for the mental health of the doctors. Under their initiative, well-known stand-up comedian Atul Khatri will perform for the doctors at Nair hospital on May 9. Talking to HT, Khatri said this is the least he can for the young bravehearts who are fighting against an invisible enemy. “Laughter releases happy hormones, so even though I won’t be able take away their worries permanently, if I can make them forget their worries even for 30 minutes, my mission will be successful,” he said. When asked about the topic of his stand-up, he said, “The current situation is extremely sensitive as everyone has lost their dear ones. We are all overwhelmed, so I don’t know if they would like to hear about Covid-19. So, I am yet to finalise it.”Other than professional stand-up comedians, medical colleges are also inviting senior doctors to give a moral boost to the juniors through comedy. Dr Tushar Shah, an alumni of Nair hospital, also performed stand-up for the doctors. Along with this, medical colleges are also trying to keep the doctors motivated through yoga, games and dancing. Dr Anjali Chhabria, psychiatrist, Founder of Golden Citizens Trust and Mumbai Dharkan, said, “Soon, we will start dance therapy for doctors in medical colleges. All the doctors who are interested can participate in the virtual sessions.” Dr Ajita S Nayak, head of the psychiatry department at KEM hospital, said they have started yoga sessions for the doctors.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-stand-up-comedians-bring-smile-on-tired-faces-of-doctors-101620414721682.html
08-05-2021||Mumbai||Maratha quota: Ready to call special session, says Ajit Pawar; cabinet sub-committee to meet on May 8||Deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar on Friday said the state government is ready to send a delegation, along with Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leaders, to Prime Minister Narendra Modi over the Supreme Court’s order scrapping Maratha reservation. He said they may also hold a one-day special session of the state Legislature if required.Meanwhile, the cabinet sub-committee formed to take decisions related to the reservation issue is likely to meet on Saturday where a decision over the next course of action may be taken.“We are committed to provide justice to the Maratha community and for that, injustice will not be done to any other community. If required we will hold a special session of the state Legislature or pass a proposal in the monsoon session. We are also ready to send a delegation headed by the chief minister (Uddhav Thackeray) to PM Modi along with leaders from the opposition party (BJP),” Pawar said in Pune on Friday.The Supreme Court on Wednesday quashed the reservation to the Maratha community saying people from the community cannot be declared educationally and socially backward just to bring them in the reserved category. The five-judge bench also refused to refer the 1992 Indra Sawhney judgment, setting a 50% cap on reservation, to a larger bench for reconsideration. Marathas were given 12% and 13% quota in education and government jobs, respectively, under the Socially and Educationally Backward Classes (SEBC) Act, 2018.“We had given two days to legal teams and counsel to study and examine the 569-page order of the Supreme Court. Tomorrow, we will have point-wise discussions on the verdict, based on which a decision on the next step is likely to be taken,” said an official privy to the development.According to legal experts and counsels, the state may go for enacting a new law by addressing the flaws pointed out by the SC, but this will take place only if the Centre takes the legal recourse to empower the state to do so.The state government has already declared approaching the National Commission of Backward Classes (NCBC) following the Apex court’s order that says states do not have powers to create a class to provide reservation to any community based on their backwardness in the social and educational sector.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maratha-quota-ready-to-call-special-session-says-ajit-pawar-cabinet-sub-committee-to-meet-on-may-8-101620414662389.html
08-05-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Manora hostel project leads to war or words between BJP and Congress||The bid floated for the construction of Manora MLA hostel by Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government has led to another war of words between the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and Congress. The BJP has questioned the escalation in construction cost, while the Congress has defended the decision by saying the cost went up due to the delay in construction by an agency appointed by previous Devendra Fadnavis-led government. BJP legislator Atul Bhatkhalkar raised question over cost escalation for reconstruction of the hostel at Nariman Point to ₹900 crore, from ₹600 crore during the BJP government. “How can the cost go up by 66% in just two years? Whose scam it is? Why was it floated in haste when the state government has no money to spend on Covid-19 management? I have asked chief minister Uddhav Thackeray to scrap the contract, or else we will make a complaint to the central vigilance commission against it,” he said.Bhatkhalkar also said that the Congress does not have the right to raise questions over the Central Vista project as it comes under the public works department, which is led by Ashok Chavan of the Congress. Responding to the allegations, Maharashtra Congress general secretary Sachin Sawant said the previous Fadnavis government went for reconstruction of the MLA hostel instead of repairs. “The hostel could have been repaired (instead of reconstruction), but the repair work was embroiled in a scam during Fadnavis government’s tenure. The decision of reconstruction of the hostel was taken by the Fadnavis government in 2018 and National Builders Construction Company was engaged to demolish the old structure. Due to the delay in the reconstruction, there has already been a significant escalation of cost along with paying a compensation of ₹1 lakh per month to the legislators for accommodation in Mumbai,” he said.Sawant said there cannot be a comparison between Central Vista and Manora hostel redevelopment projects as the Centre’s project is being implemented despite the Prime Minister and members of Parliament having residents in fair conditions. “While the hostel meant for the MLAs in Maharashtra has been demolished. The allegations (by BJP) are desperate attempt to save face of Shahensah Modi,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtramanora-hostel-project-leads-to-war-or-words-between-bjp-and-congress-101620414663133.html
08-05-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra to set up paediatric taskforce||The Maharashtra government plans to set up a paediatric task force to guide the state to deal with Covid-19 infections among children and infants in the possible third Covid-19 wave expected later in the year. State health minister Rajesh Tope said the state will prepare to ramp up hospital beds and other infrastructure for children based on the recommendation of the task force. As projections suggest that children could be hit in the next wave of infections, the state aims to streamline the treatment protocol and set up health infrastructure to deal with such cases. Earlier this week, environment and tourism minister Aaditya Thackeray suggested the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation set up a paediatric Covid care ward. A 300-400 bed facility is expected to come up at Nesco in Goregaon East. Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray held a meeting via video-conference with leading paediatricians from Mumbai and other parts of the state on Thursday. Thackeray, in a statement from the Chief Minister’s Office, said, “Medical experts have projected that the third wave could be dangerous for children. Therefore, we will set up a paediatric task force in the state.” Tope said that as the state is inoculating citizens above 18 years, those below it will fall under the vulnerable category when the third wave strikes between June and September. “Keeping the third wave in mind, we are planning some important decisions. We are setting up a paediatric task force immediately. We are not vaccinating those under 18, so we have to take more precautions for them... Children and infants need their mother with them. So, we need separate planning for them. The state will prepare a plan based on their (taskforce’s) recommendation,” the minister said. He added that separate ICUs, ventilators, medicines would be required for children. “Beds, paediatric SNCU (special newborn care units) beds, ventilators, medicines, etc are needed for children,” he said, adding the state is not just preparing for minors, but for all age groups for the third wave. The second wave of Covid-19 has impacted children between the age group of 0 to 10 and those in the 11 to 20 age group. As per the data of the State Medical Education and Drugs Department (MEDD), the state has seen a jump of 113% in Covid cases in the age group of 0 to 10 from between February 15 and May 6. The jump is even more in the 11 to 20 age group—146%. Since February 15, Maharashtra has added 79,408 cases in the 0 to 10 age group, while it added 201,223 cases in the 11 to 20 age group.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-to-set-up-paediatric-taskforce-101620414001656.html
08-05-2021||Mumbai||Despite restrictions, Mumbai witnesses traffic snarls||Despite restrictions by the state government amid the soaring Covid-19 cases and deaths in Mumbai, the vehicles on city roads are increasing, most often resulting in traffic jams at entry and exit points of the city as well as on some important arterial roads. A Twitter user named Mehlman Kaku tweeted that at 9am on Friday, there was traffic on Jogeshwari-Vikhroli Link Road, while two days ago, the closure of Phoenix Mills flyover led to traffic jam on southbound roads. The traffic police, however, attributed the vehicular traffic to delivery vehicles and construction vehicles as well as infrastructure. According to traffic police officers in south Mumbai, the maximum snarls are caused by two-wheelers. “Delivery boys on two wheelers are observed in this region since the past one month. There are no tourists as the Marine Drive promenade, Gateway of India and other attractions are closed for public,” said police inspector Mubarak Shaikh, in-charge of Colaba traffic chowky. The police also said that as many hospitals are located in south Mumbai, people are traveling for vaccinations or to get admitted. Senior police officers said that the increase in traffic is also due to people traveling on their private four-wheelers as there are travel restrictions on local trains and BEST busses. “Many are traveling to reach vaccination centres and drive in vaccinations,” said a senior officer. The system of colour-coded sticker, introduced by the Mumbai Police to ensure the smooth movement of vehicles engaged in emergency and essential services during the ongoing restrictions was recently discontinued after the move to reintroduce the e-pass system for inter-state and inter-district movement was chalked out. Last year, 5,095,478 drivers had received challans for various traffic-related violations, despite total lockdown for six months. This was a steep surge from 4,938,485 violations in 2019.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/despite-restrictions-mumbai-witnesses-traffic-snarls-101620413941765.html

This is partly owing to the fall in the daily positivity rate in the city to 8% on Friday.The city recorded 3,040 cases and 71 deaths on Friday. The city’s case tally is now 671,125, while the toll is 13,651. The city’s recovery rate is 89.63% with 601,545 recoveries. The mortality rate in the city is 2.03% and there are 54,162 active cases in the city. The city’s former hotspot Dharavi reported 18 cases on Friday taking the total to 6,592 cases. There are 822 active cases in Dharavi.As per the BMC data, 789 were building and 9,785 floors were sealed on April 6, 2021, while on May 6, around 617 buildings and 8,658 floors are sealed. According to civic body officials, this is one indicator of the cases going down in the city. The high-rises in the city have been contributing over 85% of the daily cases in the second wave that started in the city from around February 10, 2021.“This fall in the number of sealed buildings and sealed floors is owing to the dip in growth rate in the city in the last one month. In the first week of April, the growth rate was around 25%, which has now gone down to around 8-10% daily,” a BMC official said.Meanwhile, Dr Siddarth Paliwal, city-based physician said, “The number of sealed buildings and sealed floors going down is also an indicator that the level of antibodies has increased in citizens. For our better understanding, we should take a bigger sample size and conduct a serosurvey.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/fall-in-number-of-sealed-buildings-in-mumbai-daily-positivity-rate-falls-to-8-101620413881557.html

Grab one at Varanasi Collectorate soon||Remdesivir injection, which is in huge demand for treating corona patients, will soon be available at Collectorate here, said a statement from district administration. The decision regarding this was taken at a meeting of UP ministers Neelkanth Tiwari, Ravindra Jaiswal with MLC AK Sharma, divisional commissioner Deepak Agarwal and district magistrate Kaushalraj Sharma on Thursday, said the press statement. “The injection will be available for Covid patients under treatment in private hospitals or in home isolation. It will be made available free of cost for the patients at government hospitals as previously. Kin of the patients of those in home isolation or in private hospitals will have to show the doctors’ prescription and they will be given the injection at a minimum possible price,” read the statement. The anti-viral drug is being used to treat some critical Corona cases due to which it is in high demand. This has even led to shortage and black marketing of the injection.Also, a counter will be set up at each hospital where number of vacant beds and availability of the oxygen will be displayed, it added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/need-remdesivir-grab-one-at-varanasi-collectorate-soon-101620413822436.html
08-05-2021||Mumbai||Co-WIN: No easy victory here, amid cancellations and server problems||Every evening for the past six days, Sneha Sedani, a 28-year-old Kandivli resident, is glued to her computer screen between 7.30pm and 8pm, attempting to register for her Covid-19 vaccine shot on the Co-WIN portal. However, she has still not secured an appointment. Since May 1, when Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) began vaccinating citizens in the age group of 18 – 44 years, every evening its Twitter handle announces the time registration window. With few slots to fill per day, only those citizens who manage to register themselves in the short duration of 20-25 minutes before all slots are reserved, can get vaccinated the next day. On Thursday, BMC suspended walk-in vaccination for all age categories, to avoid overcrowding at vaccination centres. Now, citizens above age 45 years also have to book a slot on the previous evening and get an appointment for the next day. Mumbaiites are reporting frustrating failed attempts during the registration process, last-minute cancellations of appointments, and server problems. Sedani said, “I get automatically logged out within minutes of logging into the application. Then I have to repeat the procedure. By the time I reach the end of the process after the second or third attempt, all slots are taken.”“Sometimes, registration starts two or three minutes before the time announced by BMC on Twitter. So we constantly refresh the application to make sure we are online as soon as registration starts. Because all slots are booked right away,” Sneha added.Sedani’s brother, Harsh, 22, was lucky in this regard. He managed to get registered on the application on his first attempt and was vaccinated at SevenHills Hospital on May 3. Registering on the government of India’s Aarogya Setu application is equally challenging. Some citizens who have been allotted slots have been told last minute that their slots have been cancelled. Disgruntled, they have taken to social media to express their frustration. A Twitter user, Keyur Kenia, tweeted on Friday morning with a screenshot of his confirmed appointment, “I had been to BKC vaccination centre today as I registered from Aarogya Setu app but they refused as the below appointment is not valid. Then what is the point of registering through it.” Another Twitter user, Prasad said, “I had booked a slot for May 8 at BKC jumbo centre. Within half an hour, received a message scheduled vaccination has been cancelled. It is some kind of joke played on common man.” Manish Keswani, 44, a resident of Borivli said, “The Co-WIN application was allowing me to book a 12.30pm slot at 2.45pm. The application is not updated on time. I have been trying to book an appointment for a while now, but I am unable to register.” A senior civic official from BMC’s public health department said, “It is essential that citizens get an appointment for vaccination to avoid overcrowding or long queues at vaccination centres. We also don’t want senior citizens travelling long distances only to find out stock at the vaccination centre is over. So prior registration is a good solution. Due to shortage in vaccine doses, we have fewer shots available at present.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/cowin-no-easy-victory-here-amid-cancellations-and-server-problems-101620413821550.html
08-05-2021||Mumbai||Most relief material is distributed in BJP states, Maharashtra Congress alleges||Maharashtra Congress has once again slammed Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led Central government for its alleged discrimination towards the non-BJP state governments including Maharashtra. The party has said that most of the relief material received from around 40 countries as Covid-19 ravaged in the country, was distributed to the select state under the rule of BJP.Maharashtra Congress’s general secretary and spokesperson Sachin Sawant alleged that the aid which was received in about 25 aircraft from various countries has been distributed mostly to BJP-ruled states. “Most of the states are BJP-ruled including Gujarat, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Haryana. Maharashtra has got nothing from it. States governments have right on the relief material,” he said.Sawant raised questions about why it being distributed through Central agencies instead of handing it over to the state governments directly. “Just like #PMcares fund, this centralised approach is with an intention to give extra power in hands of Modi. It is against federal structure as well…first they sat on it (the relief material) and when they started distributing it, Maharashtra is not in the list (sic),” Sawant has tweeted.BJP’s media cell chief Vishwas Pathak said, “NITI Aayog CEO (chief operating officer) Amitabh Kant has already explained in detail how the aid received from all across the globe is being distributed transparently. According to the government data, 38 institutions in 31 states and union territories have received the aid. Just because Congress exists in hardly a few states they feel that the relief material is distributed more in BJP ruled states.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/most-relief-material-is-distributed-in-bjp-states-maharashtra-congress-alleges-101620413761552.html
08-05-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra records 54,022 cases, 898 deaths||Maharashtra on Friday recorded 54,022 new Covid-19 cases pushing the count to 4,996,758. The tally of active cases has now slightly increased to 654,788 as 37,386 recoveries were reported in a day.The toll is now 74,413, with 898 deaths recorded on Friday. Nashik reported the highest toll with 133 deaths. Nashik district recorded 102 deaths while Nashik city reported 31 fatalities. It was followed by Mumbai with 71 deaths.Surge in Covid-19 cases is yet to come down in Maharashtra, despite a lockdown imposed across the state since April 22. However, there is a slight improvement in average daily cases. While 59,647 cases were reported last month, it has reduced to 56,326 in the first week of May. In this month, maximum cases were reported on May 1 — 63,282.Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray in a recent address said that the state would have crossed one million active cases if lockdown wasn’t imposed. “Going by the predictions made by the experts, the tally of active cases would have crossed one million mark, but we have been able to contain the spread and we have restrained them under 700,000. It is because of the lockdown and the restraint shown by the people,” he said last Friday.Dr Rahul Pandit, member of the state task force said, “The daily cases in the state are not increasing. Some of the districts that didn’t have a surge in cases until now are not recording more cases. The districts that had witnessed a surge in cases, for example, Mumbai, have started experiencing a decline. That’s the reason our average daily cases of the state are still plateauing and not falling as expected.”By the end of May, the situation of the state would be better than what it is today, he added.Maharashtra’s effective reproduction number (R) for Covid-19, which indicates how fast the infection is spreading, has also declined to 1.29 from 1.45 from last week, according to an analysis prepared by the state health department.For a pandemic to come to an end, the R-value has to be sustained under 1. This infection rate was recorded 0.36 in February when the second wave hit the state. By March, it rose to 1.33.“Our situation would have gone out of hand if lockdown was not imposed. As we all can see the daily cases have hit stability and by the end of this month or from the first week of June we are expecting a gradual decline,” said a senior official from the state health department.Officials also said that there are many districts where the rise in daily cases is yet to stabilise. In addition, some districts are currently experiencing a surge in cases, as a result of which, the average daily cases of the state is not showing an expected decline. This is despite the daily average cases of Mumbai coming less than 5,000.These districts are Ratnagiri, Buldhana, Parbhani, Beed and Sindhudurg and their average weekly positivity rate (till May 4) recorded were 3.18%, 2.83%, 2.67%, 2.64% and 2.60% respectively.On Friday, Mumbai clocked 3,040 cases and took the total cases to 671,125.In the last 24 hours, the state tested 268,912 samples and had a positivity rate of 20.08%. The overall positivity rate of the state stood at 17.27%.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-records-54-022-cases-898-deaths-101620413702571.html
08-05-2021||Mumbai||Only citizens who have received slot should arrive at vaccination centre: Mumbai civic body||Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) on Friday appealed to all citizens against crowding at vaccination centres if they have not received an appointment after registering on the CoWIN application, the previous day. In a statement, BMC said, “The crowding is making it difficult to take the necessary precautions and maintain social distancing. Only those citizens who have been registered and have received a slot should arrive at the vaccination centre during the allotted timing.” Authorities said that there is a systematic way in which a particular number of slots are allotted to respective vaccine centres.Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner incharge of BMC’s public health department said, ‘’We decide how many vaccine doses each centre should receive based on the average turn out of the past week. Usually, each vaccine centre receives stock to suffice three-four days to a maximum of one week’’.Now that BMC has made it mandatory for citizens of all age groups to take an appointment for vaccination and has disallowed walk-ins. Kakani said, “When citizens register on the Co-WIN application, they are allotted a time to visit the vaccine centres based on the availability of the slot. Vaccine centres are allotted between one and 10 slots per day, depending on the available stock at the centre. A maximum of 100 beneficiaries can be vaccinated in every slot.”At the end of each day, vaccine centres submit data to BMC of the number of vaccine shots utilised during the day, which helps the civic body keep track of the availability of stock at the centre. When stocks run out, BMC informs the state government to place an order for more vaccine shots. BMC then collects the stock allotted to the civic body by the state government, from the state’s storage facility in Pune. This is then brought to BMC’s main storage facility at Kanjurmarg and the public health department’s head office at F/South ward in Parel, and delivered to vaccine centres the next morning, before the vaccination drive for the day begins. Among stocks available at vaccine centres approximately 1% doses are wasted. Kakani said, “Mumbai has one of the lowest percentage of wastage of vaccine doses, at 1%. Wastage usually happens because every vial accommodates 10 vaccine shots. If a vial is opened at the end of the day, but only nine beneficiaries are left to get vaccinated, one dose goes waste, for example.” On an average, BMC vaccinates 35,000 to 40,000 beneficiaries per day. On Friday, 41,107 beneficiaries were vaccinated in Mumbai, of which 16,310 received their first dose, and 24,797 received their second dose. 3,613 beneficiaries in the age group of 18-44 years were vaccinated on Friday. Presently, BMC has less than 100,000 vaccine shots left in its stock, and more are expected to arrive on Saturday or Sunday night. After suspending walk-in vaccination for all age groups on Thursday, Municipal commissioner Iqbal Singh Chahal on Friday directed the administration to allow walk-ins for beneficiaries in the 45 years and above age group, only if they are receiving their second dose. This will happen after the immunization manager at each centre verifies vaccine certificates received by these beneficiaries after the first dose.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/only-citizens-who-have-received-slot-should-arrive-at-vaccination-centre-mumbai-civic-body-101620413701579.html

The minister held an inspection accompanied by doctors and officials and learned about the arrangements at the hospital. At the same time, he encouraged the doctors and other health workers who are serving the people in these difficult circumstances.The minister said that close monitoring of admitted patients in ICU is the need of the hour, in which these computerized monitors will prove to be helpful.The principal of SRN Medical College, Dr SP Singh said that through the monitors, the SPO-2 oxygen saturation level of the admitted patients in the ICU will be monitored. Accordingly, the doctor will be able to see the flow of oxygen. When oxygen is in the BIPAP or on a ventilator, the entire parameter is visible on a vital monitor. The pulse rate, blood sender and ECG will also be displayed, so that there is no problem in monitoring a patient, he explained.Everything is visible on the monitor, which remains connected to the doctor’s duty room. The doctor can also monitor the patient’s vitals through the monitor from the duty room. If the saturation falls, the monitor starts beeping, he explained.There were 140 monitors already available in the hospital and these new 100 machines will allow more patients to remain under better observation, he said.When asked about the arrangements and supply of oxygen by the minister, Principal Dr SP Singh said that SRN has two liquid tanks for the supply of oxygen with a capacity of 40,000 litres. The per-day need is about 20,000 to 22,000 litres of oxygen. The liquid supply in the tank is from Jamshedpur. Two tankers arrive per day due to which the supply of oxygen in the SRN remains constant. There is no shortage of oxygen so far. Minister Nandi directed increasing the capacity and installation of an additional tanker for oxygen supply.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/prayagraj-state-govt-provides-100-additional-monitors-to-srn-hosp-icu-101620413401594.html

He instructed officials to arrange paediatric facilities in rural and urban area. In Pune, officials said the civic body has planned to set up a dedicated paediatric unit for children diagnosed with Covid at its Rajiv Gandhi hospital in Yerawada. Since last year, 3.05% (149,224) of total Covid cases so far are from the age group of 0 to 10 years while 6.92% (338,397) are between 11 and 20 years, according to a report of medical education and drugs department. While all above the age of 18 years are covered for inoculation, there is no vaccine available for below 18 age group. Referring to cases among children, state health minister Rajesh Tope said a special task force for paediatrics are being constituted at the state level. Speaking to reporters after a Covid review meeting in Pune, Pawar emphasised the importance to be prepared for the third wave. He acknowledged the warning given by experts about infection of children in the third wave and claimed that the administration is taking steps to prepare for this situation. “It is decided that Rajiv Gandhi hospital in PMC limits will be reserved for children. Similar instructions have been given to Pimpri Chinhwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC). I have instructed the divisional commissioner, collector, CEO zilla parishad, PMC and PCMC commissioners to arrange paediatric facilities in corporation limits and also at each tehsil level. Currently it is a prediction by experts, but we should be prepared,” Pawar said. In Mumbai, Tope announced the plan to deal with the third wave and ensure the safety of children. “We are constituting a special task force for paediatric cases. We are not vaccinating those below the age of 18 years. So, they have to be taken care of. We have to make the paediatric medical infrastructure such as paediatric beds, paediatric ventilators, paediatric FNCU beds ready. On Thursday, CM talked to many paediatricians through a video conference,” Tope told reporters in Mumbai. On Wednesday, Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray during a meeting with paediatric doctors across the state instructed them to prepare for the third wave. Pawar said the issues faced during the second wave should be avoided in the third. “We faced scarcity of oxygen, ventilators, Remdesivir and vaccines in the second wave. We want to avoid these problems and better the medical infrastructure, like the oxygen plant in Dalvi hospital has started. Sassoon plant will be fully operational soon,” Pawar said.

The vaccination will be done at some centres, the names of which pop up when one registers on the Co-Win portal.The vaccination campaign for the 18-44 category was initially started in seven districts with a high active caseload—Lucknow, Kanpur Nagar, Prayagraj, Varanasi, Gorakhpur, Meerut and Bareilly —on May 1. Since then, 85,566 people in this age group have been vaccinated in these seven districts. Yogi said that so far, the state had vaccinated 1.34 crore people statewide (since the start of the overall Covid-19 vaccination campaign on January 16). The state has 75 districts.The chief minister also asked for suspending on-the-spot registration for inoculation, adding that jabs should be given only to such persons who have pre-registered for their dose.Besides, he said people with the Covid-19 infection, or its symptoms should not be given the vaccine till a month after recovery.On the day of the launch of the vaccination in 11 districts, the minister in charge of those districts or local people’s representatives should be present at one or the other vaccination centres there, the chief minister said.Regarding pre-registration, he said: “On-the-spot registration may cause chaos. So that there is no unnecessary crowding at vaccination centres, it would be appropriate to do the vaccination through online registration. If possible, also contact the pre-registered beneficiaries a day or two before their appointed vaccination date.”About not giving jabs to Covid-19 positive patients, he said, “Health experts have advised that those with the Covid-19 infection or symptoms should not be vaccinated. The experts have said that those with the Covid infection should be vaccinated not before a month after recovery. Spread this advice among the people.”He also said the vaccine wastage had come down further.“The best part of vaccination in this (18-44) age group is that the vaccine wastage is minimal, perhaps due to enthusiasm in the age group. The wastage percentage that was 0.39% has further come down to 0.11% and our target is to make it 0%.”He once again emphasised on the “trace, test, treat, vaccinate” policy to control the Covid-19 infection, saying that it was giving favourable results.“On April 30, the state had 3.10 lakh active cases, and, in a week’s time, they fell by 55,000. The highest number of positive cases was recorded on April 24 and since then there is a regular decline in the fresh positive cases. At the same time, the number of people recovering is steadily rising,” he said.He said that in the last 24 hours a total of 28,076 fresh cases had been recorded while a total of 33,117 recovered and were discharged from hospitals.Earlier on Thursday night, the chief minister held the first meeting with the medical experts’ panel that the state has constituted for expert advice to Team-9. Team-9 is an administrative and policy-making team of top bureaucrats and two senior ministers engaged in Covid management during the second wave of the pandemic. The medical expert panel has 14 members.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/jabs-for-18-44-to-be-launched-in-11-more-up-districts-on-monday-101620408240979.html

PMC approved the plan to develop a new ecosystem making use of the unused land existing in the 130 acres which will house 10 new exotic species, reptiles and mammals in the next three years. “Although this pandemic has put a spoke into the plans and its implementation, we have managed to complete 95 per cent of the work on some of the enclosures for mouse deer, three species of jungle cats in 150 sq. metres in four enclosure and the lion enclosures. The second phase of the plan was to develop the Katraj lake post desilting into a roosting ground to attract migratory and local birds by creating small islands in the lake,” said Rajkumar Jadhav, director of Rajiv Gandhi Zoological Park and Wildlife Research Centre. He also added that the relocation of the snake park is stuck due to paucity of funds. “We have planned according to the Central Zoo authority’s housing plan for animals and reptiles. The new space is around 12,000 sq. metres and 150 reptiles of 29 species in the zoo’s collection at an estimated ₹2.5 crore. Initially we were to create space only for native reptiles but now we have added four exotic reptiles including anaconda and six exotic animals which include giraffe and zebra, meanwhile the lion enclosure spread around 2,500 sq. metres are almost ready,” Jadhav said. According to the official, the newly built four enclosures are for leopard cat, jungle cat, spotted cat and the giant Indian squirrel which will be interesting for visitors who will get to see three cat species together. “It will take another year or so to complete, the next three years will be vital for the zoo, seeing the way, the work is progressing,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/rajiv-gandhi-zoo-masterplan-in-the-works-despite-covid-interruption-101620401940245.html

After the break in March and April, when prices had either stabilised or declined, they have started to soar from May 4.The transporters have expressed deep discontent over the price fuel price hike and especially the record prices of diesel.“Now passenger transport is completely closed and only goods transportation is going on. Most transportation is of the essential goods as the pandemic is raging. The hike in diesel price is a major blow to the transporters. The ultimate cost of these excessive prices will have to be sustained by transporters because traders won’t negotiate the transportation rates. How are we supposed to carry on? We are constantly writing to the central government to control the prices and give us some concessions,” said Baba Shinde, director (Maharashtra), All India Motor Transport Congress.Sagar Ghare, a delivery person associated with a food home delivery app in the city said that their profit margin is getting impacted because of the petrol price hike. “The companies already have reduced our per home delivery commission. In addition to this now fuel prices have started to increase again. There are restrictions imposed and we do not have any other opportunity but to continue with this to earn a livelihood.

The authorities said that after the body is cremated at 650 to 750 degrees Celsius, the virus does not exist.“Though people are aware that ashes does not contain the Covid-19 virus, the spike in death in the second wave and the long wait to cremate bodies have caused residents to develop cold feet over visiting the crematoriums again to collect ashes,” said one of the official from Vaikunth, Navipeth, on the request of anonymity.Arun Jangam, body disposal officer deployed at Amardham Hindu Smashan Bhumi, Yerawada said, “Though people are coming to collect urns unlike last year, many are taking a long time after the last rites to collect ashes.”Few residents are visiting the crematorium in Talegaon to collect urns.“As the number of daily cremations has increased over the past 10 days, few are visiting again to collect. The situation was normal till the second week of April,” said Kailash Patil, body disposal officer, Talegaon.Body disposal officers said that there will not be any need to hold mass awareness programmes like last year. PMC has allowed all 21 crematoriums in the city to conduct the final rites of Covid patients.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/urns-gather-dust-at-crematoria-as-covid-fear-keeps-kin-away-in-pune-101620401760250.html

The vaccination drive for beneficiaries of 45 years and above age will not be functioning from May 8, as the district again faces shortage of vaccine doses.Rubal Agarwal, PMC additional municipal commissioner, said only four vaccination centres will be functional for 18-plus beneficiaries where only Covaxin will be administered.“The stock for Covishield is over. And so, there will be only Covaxin given to 18 to 44 years of beneficiaries at four centres across Pune. These centres are Jayabai Sutar hospital, Annasaheb Magar hospital and Murlidhar Laygude hospital where there will be 500 doses each given to the centre. Also, Sassoon General hospital will have 200 doses of Covaxin on May 8,” said Agarwal.She said the 45-plus beneficiaries will not receive any vaccine on May 8 as there is no stock remaining. “When the new vaccine stock arrives, we will resume the vaccination drive,” said Agarwal.On Friday, 6,155 beneficiaries were inoculated in Pune district. Of these, 2,592 beneficiaries were in PMC, 2,015 in Pune rural and 1,548 in Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC).Speaking about the vaccine stock, Dr Sanjay Deshmukh, deputy director of health, Pune circle, said that the doses are likely to get over by Friday evening.“There are fresh vaccine stocks expected on May 9 for 45-plus beneficiaries. However, the vaccination drive until then will be slow due to the shortage. On Thursday late night, we had received 25,000 doses of Covishield which were utilised on Friday. There is no Covaxin stock with us as of now,” said Dr Deshmukh.He said the vaccine stock for 18-plus beneficiaries is available with local authorities.“Vaccination drives for 18-plus beneficiaries will continue smoothly for the next few days as doses are available, but senior beneficiaries will have to wait for a while to get the jab,” said Dr Deshmukh.On Friday, 35,457 beneficiaries were inoculated in Pune district. Of these, 29,302 were above the age of 45 years. There were a total of 367 centres in the district that inoculated 12,994 beneficiaries in PMC, 10,947 in Pune rural and 5,361 in PCMC on Friday.Four centres for 18-plus vaccinationFor Covaxin only*Hospital--Doses*Jayabai Sutar Hospital--500*Annasaheb Magar Hospital--500*Murlidhar Laygude Hospital-- 500*Sassoon General Hospital--200*Source: PMC||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/no-jab-drive-for-45-plus-today-only-4-centres-for-18-plus-in-pmc-101620401640157.html

These popular tourist spots in Pune district have seen an alarming spike in positive cases, forcing the local administration to announce lockdown. Sub divisional magistrate Rajendra Jadhav of Bhor taluka was given additional charge of Maval taluka at a review meeting held on Thursday with local authorities in Maval. Maval taluka will be under strict lockdown from May 7 to May 12. “Marketplaces will be closed till May 12 and only emergency medical services and medical shops will remain open. Milk delivery is allowed only between 7 and 9 am,” said Jadhav. Lonavla city police have launched rapid antigen tests (RAT) of people seen on the streets from Friday morning.Dilip Pawar, senior inspector and incharge of Lonavla city police station said, “We started nakabandi and checking of people from 7am.

08-05-2021||Pune||Medicinal plants in demand for terrace and balcony gardens||The current scenario of medical oxygen scarcity during the Covid pandemic has seen a preference among residents to opt for medicinal plants, known to improve air quality as per the traditional medicine system, for their private gardens. Nurseries in the city are seeing a rise in demand for plants like tulsi, turmeric, ashwagandha (withania somnifera) over the past few months.Medical experts caution residents to contact doctors before consuming any medicinal plant or herb as a cure or prevention against Covid-19. “Many customers are buying tulsi nowadays as it is known to increase the supply of oxygen and absorbs harmful gases like carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide and sulphur dioxide. Even as the shop is closed because of the lockdown timings, many are contacting us and visiting us in person. Demand for turmeric and ashwagandha is also on the rise,” said Ravi Dhole, who runs a nursery in Vimannagar.Bapu Survase from Krupa plant nursery, Uruli Kanchan, said, “Generally, the demand for tulsi increases during Aashadi Ekadashi festival, but this time it is seen as we are in the grip of Covid pandemic. Customers are going by the advice of elders and following the traditional medicine system and buying plants that purifies the air.”“The demand for indoor and garden plants is seen during the last weeks of May as monsoon starts in June. Rose plants are the favourite, but residents are now buying tulsi and other medicinal plants,” said Ulhas Patil, Balaji Rose nursery, Singhad road.Swapnil Deshmukh, an Ayurvedic doctor, said, “As per the traditional medicine system, certain plants are good for health and its constituents are scientifically proved to provide health immunity.”“We get oxygen from tulsi and planting more than one rope of the plant is beneficial. Intake of certain medicinal plants daily is important for health,” said Dr Ashwini Varpe.Ajay Aggarwal of Wanowrie, who has a big terrace garden at his place, said, “I believe in growing my own oxygen and food so I grow herbs and veggies at my place. Every plant gives oxygen so maintaining a habit of plantation is important.”Pooja Kale of Baner said, “I have a separate section of medicinal plants at my terrace garden. Earlier people used to question on why I give so much space to these plants which are not attractive, but now they are following suit because of the pandemic situation.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/medicinal-plants-in-demand-for-terrace-and-balcony-gardens-101620401460127.html
08-05-2021||Pune||Local authorities should decide on total lockdown as per virus cases, bed availability, says Ajit Pawar||With Covid caseload on the rise in rural parts of Pune district and new hotspots emerging, Pune guardian minister Ajit Pawar said that the decision on complete lockdown should be taken by the local authorities considering virus cases and bed availability. The minister said the current curbs imposed in Pune will continue. Pawar was speaking in Pune after the Bombay High Court instructed the state administration to impose complete lockdown in Pune to check the virus cases. “As the head of the state, the CM will decide on HC suggestions. In the meeting, most favoured the continuation of current curbs and stricter implementation. If the number of people roaming around unnecessarily is reduced, then it will show good results,” Pawar said. In the last few days, the positivity rate in urban parts of the district has reduced, but cases are rising in rural areas.“Regarding rural parts, officials from Baramati have taken the decision to impose seven-day lockdown and I approved it,” he said. Pune mayor Muralidhar Mohol said that Pune city doesn’t need complete lockdown. “The number of cases in Pune is going down. There is no need to impose complete lockdown. I fear that the numbers presented before the court were not correct,” Mohol said. Pawar said the Pune mayor should appoint a lawyer to represent the case of PMC. “Collective numbers from Pune district, and not of PMC alone, were presented before the court and the court may have felt the necessity to suggest complete lockdown. The mayor should appoint a lawyer to put the case of PMC before the court,” Pawar said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/local-authorities-should-decide-on-total-lockdown-as-per-virus-cases-bed-availability-says-ajit-pawar-101620401340201.html
08-05-2021||Mumbai||Malavika’s Mumbaistan: Motherless Children||You do not have to give birth to be a mother. It is neither a function of biology, nor a title, nor even a noun. Motherhood is a verb. It means to love, to protect, to shield, to shelter; to put another’s interests ahead of one’s own. It calls for courage, sacrifice, heroism, unconditional love and deep reservoirs of empathy and compassion. A mother is a repository of our hopes and dreams, as well as of our pains and sorrows. No matter how old a person is, their mother is who they will call out to for help in their moment of agony or need. Minutes away from his certain death, with his murderer’s knee on his neck, George Floyd called out to his long-departed mother, when he could not breathe. It is said that Jacinda Arden brings many qualities to her role as the Prime Minister of New Zealand, but perhaps the greatest one is that she sees her job as being a mother to her people. A mother will not favour one of her children over the other and even if she does, will never want it to be known. A mother is someone who feels her child’s pain without having to be told of it. She is someone whose side you hurry to when you are anxious and unwell. And today, on the eve of International Mother’s Day, the wretched truth that we might as well face is that every one of us — you, me, him, her and them — we are all motherless children, orphaned, abandoned and alone, with no one to turn to, to wipe away our tears, or mitigate our fears or tell us that things are going to be okay… ************************************************“No language can express the power and beauty and heroism of a mother’s love,” said Edwin Chapin. “Motherhood: All love begins and ends there,” said Robert Browning. If you want to put an end to all wars, ask the mothers of soldiers to sit across a table and negotiate for conflict resolution. If you want to feed an ever-expanding congregation of hungry stomachs when supplies are low, put a mother in charge of the kitchen. In the long list of dictators, despots and tyrants who inflict genocide and suffering on their citizenry, you’d be hard pressed to come up with more than a couple who are mothers. Of all her epoch-making achievements, singer and activist Joan Baez, who once marched with Martin Luther King and had sung at the fall of the Berlin Wall, declared that motherhood was her most momentous one. Of all her iconic titles, Vice-President of America and major glass-ceiling-shatterer Kamala Harris says being called “Momala” is her most cherished. There’s no bond as strong in the entire world as that of a mother and child, nor is there a love so all-encompassing and protective. The natural world abounds with stories of mother goats that have nurtured newborn pups and of mother wolves suckling human cubs. A mother’s primary dharma is inclusivity; she is someone who will always look out for the weakest child in her litter. And today, on the eve of International Mother’s Day, the wretched truth that we might as well face is that every one of us — you, me, him, her and them — we are all motherless children, orphaned, abandoned and alone, with no one to turn to, to wipe away our tears, or mitigate our fears or tell us that things are going to be okay… ************************************************The art of mothering is to teach the art of living to children. Barrack Obama credits his idealistic, single mother for all that is good and noble in himself. Philanthropist, award-winning filmmaker and celebrated chef Vikas Khanna says his feisty, octogenarian airplane-flying mother is his abiding inspiration. A mother is someone who will think nothing of going hungry, even as she cooks a meal for her child. The mythologies of the world are full of examples of mothers like Yashodhara, Parvati and Sita who protected and nurtured and safeguarded their offspring. A mother occupies pole position in the world’s collective consciousness. It is said that the most memorable dialogue heard from all of award-winning screenwriters Salim and Javed’s vast body of work is the one delivered by Shashi Kapoor in Deewar, when he utters the simple words “mere paas ma hain”. Princess Diana believed, “A mother’s arms are more comforting than anyone else’s.” A mother would rather die than betray the faith and trust that her children have placed in her. And today, on the eve of International Mother’s Day, the wretched truth that we might as well face is that every one of us — you, me, him, her and them — we are all motherless children, orphaned, abandoned and alone, with no one to turn to, to wipe away our tears, or mitigate our fears or tell us that things are going to be okay… ************************************************So, not for the cheesy sentimentality of a Hallmark holiday, nor for the crass commercialisation of a spurious slogan, (Anna Jarvis, the instigator of International Mother’s Day, actually devoted the remainder of her life to protest against it), but to stress the fundamental truth of it: having a mother and dying are the only two universal human conditions. Mothers have been immortalised in great literature, iconography, popular culture and art. Brecht’s Mother Courage and single mum-on -welfare, JK Rowling’s big-hearted mother Molly Weasley in the Harry Potter series. NGO Mothers Without Borders was created by Kathy Headlee to nurture orphans across the world. Earth Mothers who don’t have to be told that the health of our planet and the health of every creature on it, however small, are inextricably bound. Modern-day Momagers, who step in to make their children’s dreams come true. Mothers like Irena Sendler, who smuggled 2,500 Jewish children out of the Warsaw Ghetto during the Holocaust. The righteous mother played by Nargis in Mehboob Khan’s Mother India, who puts her principles above her maternal love. The anguished mother in the Bible’s Judgment of King Solomon, who begs that her child be taken from her rather than cut in half. The natural state of motherhood is selflessness. The highest undertaking that a person can aspire to is to be a mother to the world. A mother will put aside her own prejudices and partisanships, when her child is in danger. She will rush to their bedside if they are ill and dying. A mother will soothe their fevered brow and keep vigil all night, until they are nursed back to health. The planet would be better served if all manmade constructs of nationhood, economy, jurisprudence, administration, and leadership were predicated on the principles of motherhood. Fortunate are those families that have a mother amid them; favoured are those people who have a mother to call their own; blessed is that country led by one who embodies the qualities of a mother. The best place to cry is in a mother’s arms. Minutes away from his certain death, with his murderer’s knee on his neck, George Floyd cried out for his long-departed mother when he could not breathe.And today, on the eve of International Mother’s Day, the wretched truth that we might as well face is that every one of us — you, me, him, her and them — we are all motherless children, orphaned, abandoned and alone, with no one to turn to, to wipe away our tears, or mitigate our fears or tell us that things are going to be okay…||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/malavikas-mumbaistan-motherless-children-101620399960888.html
08-05-2021||World||India, EU to resume negotiations on three trade-related agreements||India and the European Union (EU) on Saturday announced the resumption of negotiations on three balanced and comprehensive trade-related agreements but were unable to reach common ground on New Delhi’s call for a waiver of patent protections for Covid-19 vaccines. During a virtual summit between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and leaders of the 27 EU member states, the two sides also unveiled an ambitious connectivity partnership to foster public and private investments in connectivity projects and take up joint projects in Africa, Central Asia and the Indo-Pacific. This is only the EU’s second such partnership after a similar arrangement with Japan. The two sides didn’t specify any timeframe for negotiations on the agreements on trade, investment protection and geographical indications, saying a high-level mechanism led by India’s commerce minister and the EU trade commissioner would steer the negotiations and decide timelines. The agreement on resumption of trade negotiations, which were started in 2007 and suspended in 2013 after major differences on issues such as market access and mobility of Indian professionals, was described by secretary (West) Vikas Swarup of the external affairs ministry as the “most important outcome” of the summit. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said all three pacts will be negotiated “in parallel at the same time so that we move forward rapidly”. “Both sides have worked intensively over the last few months to arrive at a common understanding. The decisions are a result of the political desire on both sides to harness the full potential of our economic engagement and work towards an early post-Covid-19 recovery,” Swarup said. At a news briefing in Porto after the summit, Von der Leyen and European Council President Charles Michel were lukewarm towards the proposal by India and South Africa for relaxing norms of the WTO Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) for vaccines. They expressed doubts as to whether such a move will help global access to vaccines and instead called on countries currently manufacturing doses to ramp up production and delivery. Swarup told a separate news briefing in New Delhi that Modi had requested the EU’s support for a TRIPS waiver on vaccine-related patents to ensure equitable access for the entire world, especially after the US had backed the move recently. “The EU’s support at WTO for this waiver will ensure that we can scale up the vaccine production for equitable and global access and save lives,” Swarup said. “We will be watching the evolving EU position on this particular issue.” Both Michel and Von der Leyen expressed solidarity and support for India to counter a devastating second wave of Coronavirus infections, which has seen daily cases crossing the 400,000-mark in recent days, but made it clear the EU didn’t think a waiver of patents will produce significant and immediate results. The EU, they said, would back any effort that can lead to an increase in vaccine production and delivery in the short term. “Nevertheless, in the short term, many of us think that this may not be the magic solution. That’s why we want to keep a close eye [on it] and keep discussing this issue,” Michel said, acknowledging the only way out of the Covid-19 crisis is to immunise the global population. Von der Leyen noted the EU is open to discussions on waiver of patent protections but said: “These are important topics to discuss but we should be aware of the fact that these are topics for the long term. It’s not a topic for the short term or medium term, and therefore, we should not lose sight of the main urgencies now, which is ramping up vaccine production as quickly as possible and ensuring that they are fairly and evenly distributed.” She instead suggested other vaccine-producing countries should follow the EU’s example of exporting 50% of its total production of 400 million doses to 90 countries. Other countries should also support the WHO-backed COVAX facility and invest in global vaccine manufacturing capacities. In this regard, Von der Leyen said EU member states were investing in scaling up vaccine manufacturing capacities in Africa, and even thinking of deploying container-based vaccine laboratories that can train the workforce in African countries and transfer knowledge for providing safe and effective vaccines. The EU leaders stressed they had assured the Indian prime minister of solidarity and support, and pointed to the oxygen-related gear, medicines and other equipment worth 100 million euros donated by 17 member states. In his initial remarks at the summit, Modi explained the rationale for a stronger relationship with the EU and all its member states and described the strategic partnership between the two sides as a “force multiplier for the global good”. On the economic front, the two sides agreed to have dedicated dialogues on WTO issues, regulatory cooperation, market access issues and supply chain resilience. The high-level trade and investment dialogue will monitor progress on these decisions. The two sides also discussed how technology should be used for the welfare of the people while being rooted in democratic values. They also emphasised the need for secure networks and agreed to cooperate on global standards in new and emerging technologies such as 5G.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/india-eu-to-resume-negotiations-on-three-trade-related-agreements-101620497409646.html
08-05-2021||World||Angela Merkel hopeful on Europe summer travel even without Covid-19 vaccination||Europeans can look forward to traveling this summer, if coronavirus cases keep declining further on the continent, German Chancellor Angela Merkel said Saturday.While the European Union (EU) is developing a vaccine certificate valid throughout the 27-nation bloc, summer vacations abroad should be possible again even for people who haven't had their shots against the coronavirus, she said.“If you look at the low incidence (of Covid-19) that some of our European partner countries already have,...then I'm very hopeful that we can also generally afford to do what was possible last summer, too," Merkel said.She cited the sharp drop in Covid-19 cases in Portugal in recent months after the country imposed a drastic lockdown.Portugal had one of the highest infection rates worldwide in January, but by Friday the seven-day rolling average of daily new cases stood at 3.3 per 100,000 inhabitants - about a quarter of the rate in the United States.Merkel said that Germany also appears to have broken its most recent outbreak.“Step by step, more will be possible in Germany, too, wherever the incidence drops, and that will hopefully be the case for all of Europe,” she said.Merkel spoke to reporters in Berlin, from where she took part remotely in a two-day EU summit that discussed, among other issues, the effort to develop a “green certificate” that would facilitate travel across the region this summer. Even if case numbers drop, some countries will likely impose restrictions - such as mandatory testing and quarantine - for travelers who can't prove they've been vaccinated or recovered from infection.EU leaders discussed the technical requirements for such a certificate, which would record a person's vaccine status, and outstanding questions about how to treat people who received vaccines that weren't approved for use in the bloc.The president of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, said Saturday that the certificate was on track to be launched in June.So far, about 30% of adults in the EU have received at least one dose of a coronavirus vaccine.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/angela-merkel-hopeful-on-europe-summer-travel-even-without-covid-19-vaccination-101620494285803.html
08-05-2021||World||Archaeologists discover remains of 9 Neanderthals near Rome||Italian archaeologists have uncovered the fossilized remains of nine Neanderthals in a cave near Rome, shedding new light on how the Italian peninsula was populated and under what environmental conditions.The Italian Culture Ministry announced the discovery Saturday, saying it confirmed that the Guattari Cave in San Felice Circeo was “one of the most significant places in the world for the history of Neanderthals.” A Neanderthal skull was discovered in the cave in 1939.The fossilized bones include skulls, skull fragments, two teeth and other bone fragments. The oldest remains date from between 100,000 and 90,000 years ago, while the other eight Neanderthals are believed to date from 50,000-68,000 years ago, the Culture Ministry said in a statement.The excavations, begun in 2019, involved a part of the cave that hadn’t yet been explored, including a lake first noted by the anthropologist Alberto Carlo Blanc, who is credited with the 1939 Neanderthal skull discovery.Culture Minister Dario Franceschini called the finding “an extraordinary discovery that will be the talk of the world.”Anthropologist Mauro Rubini said the large number of remains suggest a significant population of Neanderthals, “the first human society of which we can speak.”Archaeologists said the cave had perfectly preserved the environment of 50,000 years ago. They noted that fossilized animal remains found in the cave - elephant, rhinoceros and giant deer, among others - shed light on the flora and fauna of the area and its climactic history.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/archaeologists-discover-remains-of-9-neanderthals-near-rome-101620494075379.html
08-05-2021||World||EU invites 'concrete' US plan on lifting patents for Covid-19 vaccines||Europe on Saturday passed the ball back to Washington in a debate over Covid vaccine patents, pushing the US for a concrete proposal and a commitment to export much-needed jabs.Germany's Chancellor Angela Merkel, speaking after a summit of EU and Indian leaders, said the EU had exported much of its own production and that America should follow suit."Now that a further part of the American population has been vaccinated, I hope that we can come to a free exchange of components and an opening of the market for vaccines," she said.European Council chief Charles Michel said the bloc was ready to discuss a US offer to suspend patent protection on vaccines -- once the details are clear."We are ready to engage on this topic, as soon as a concrete proposal would be put on the table," Michel said at an EU summit in Portugal that discussed that subject, among others.He added that the EU had doubts about the idea being a "magic bullet" in the short term and encouraged "all the partners to facilitate the export of doses."France's scepticism was plain, with President Emmanuel Macron declaring "patents are not the priority".A debate on the issue could be "a very good idea," Macron suggested, but he added: "I call very clearly on the United States to put an end to export bans not only on vaccines but on vaccine ingredients, which prevent production."The key to producing vaccines more quickly for poor countries and developing countries is to produce more, to lift export bans."Italy's prime minister, Mario Draghi, echoed that."Before getting to the liberalisation of vaccines, other simpler things should be done, such as removing the export block that today the US firstly and the UK continue to maintain," he said."This, I would say, is the first thing to do," he said. "The fact of liberalising the patents, even temporarily, does not guarantee the production of the vaccine."While at the summit, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen announced a contract with drugs giant Pfizer/BioNTech for up to 1.8 billion doses of their patented vaccine had been concluded. Part of that supply is for EU exports to countries in need.Influential voices support the push to waive patents, not least that of Pope Francis, who criticised putting "the laws of the market or intellectual property above the laws of love and the health of humanity".The World Health Organization, India and South Africa have all called for patents to be temporarily suspended.- 'Global cooperation' needed -The EU leaders' comments came on the second day of an summit that featured a bilateral meeting between the EU and India, where authorities on Saturday said the pandemic killed 4,000 people in a single day.In a joint statement, both sides said "global cooperation" was needed to fight the pandemic and they "supported universal, safe, equitable and affordable access to Covid-19 vaccines, diagnostics and treatments"."The vaccination process is not a race amongst countries but a race against time," they said, underlining the EU's contributions to the WHO-backed Covax facility and India's role producing many of the vaccine doses distributed around the world.EU officials briefing journalists in Brussels on the issue of waiving patents said the hoarding of crucial ingredients needed for vaccines was a larger obstacle than patent protection.The United States is not in a position to export Covid vaccine doses to countries in need because contracts it signed with vaccine-makers prevent their use outside of America, and the Defense Production Act restricts exports until Americans are vaccinated first.That contrasts with the EU, which has sent more than 200 million doses abroad -- as many as it kept for itself -- prompting von der Leyen to describe the bloc as "the pharmacy of the world".EU officials are worried that Washington's gambit to get around its own blockage by invoking a suspension of patents will end up painting Brussels as a villain if it does not follow suit.An EU official briefing journalists on the complexities on the issue said on Friday that lifting patents, by itself, "will not fix things".Technology transfer and training a vaccine-making workforce were also necessary, the official said.Even if all those elements were in place, it would still take up to a year for a factory to start producing copycat vaccines.bur-rmb/dc/wdbPFIZERBioNTech||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/eu-invites-concrete-us-plan-on-lifting-patents-for-covid-19-vaccines-101620492439617.html
08-05-2021||World||EU tells Biden to export Covid-19 vaccines now and worry about patent later||European Union leaders urged U.S. President Joe Biden to lift restrictions on exports of Covid-19 vaccines to address the desperate needs of developing countries before embarking on complex discussions about whether patent waivers might also boost supply in the longer term.Gathering in Porto, Portugal on Friday and Saturday shortly after the U.S. suggested suspending intellectual property rights to boost the supply of Covid shots, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, French President Emmanuel Macron and Italy’s Mario Draghi appealed in unison to the U.S. president to follow the EU example and start shipping significant numbers of vaccines. They argued that any patent waiver will only increase supply in the long term and the world needs a faster solution.“I hope that now that large parts of the American society have been vaccinated we will come to a free exchange of components and opening of the market for vaccines,” Merkel told reporters in Berlin after dialing in remotely to the summit talks. “Europe has always exported a big part of its production to the world and that should now become the regular case.”Vaccine manufacturers in the EU have exported about half of the 400 million shots they’ve produced whereas the U.S. has gobbled up nearly all of the doses produced on its soil. According to the Bloomberg Vaccine Tracker, the U.S. has now fully vaccinated a third of its population while in India, where the virus is raging out of control, only 2.5% of the population is fully immunized.“We should not lose sight of the main urgencies for now, which is ramping up vaccine production as quickly as possible and ensuring they are fairly and evenly distributed,” European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen told reporters following the talks.The U.S. has sent 4.2 million AstraZeneca shots -- which aren’t authorized for use in the U.S. -- to Mexico and Canada and says it plans to ship another 60 million of those doses by the end of June. The doses are undergoing a safety review. Pfizer Inc. has also begun fulfilling non-U.S. orders from its U.S. production, but hasn’t said how many doses it has shipped or which countries have received them.“The European Union is the only continental, democratic region of this world that is exporting on a large scale,” von der Leyen said.French President Emmanuel Macron reprimanded the U.S. and the U.K. on Friday for blocking the export of shots and the raw materials needed to make them.“Today the Anglo-Saxons are blocking many of these ingredients and these vaccines,” Macron said. “Today 100% of the vaccines produced in the U.S. go to the American market.”Echoing similar comments from Berlin on Thursday, he said sharing intellectual property isn’t the immediate issue. “You can give IP to labs who don’t know how to produce it, and they won’t produce it tomorrow,” Macron said.No Patent ProblemsEU officials are skeptical that the U.S. proposal can meaningfully address the vaccine shortage, arguing that there has been no example so far of intellectual-property protections limiting supply. WTO negotiations could take many months or longer, the officials said.Instead, the priority should be scaling up manufacturing capacity by freeing up supply chains, exports of key inputs and ingredients, the EU officials said. Crucially, they should work to connect companies with the patents and know-how to produce the vaccine with any spare manufacturing capacity around the world.Nevertheless, Biden’s move has proved popular within his Democratic Party and could ultimately serve as leverage over pharmaceutical companies.Jeff Zients, the president’s Covid-19 response coordinator, said Friday that supporting a waiver is “the right thing to do” but that the waiver alone won’t give the world enough vaccine.“That’s why we will continue to ramp up our efforts -- working with the private sector and all possible partners -- to expand vaccine manufacturing and distribution around the world and increase, as you point out, the important supplies, the raw materials, the equipment needed to make the vaccines,” Zients said in Washington.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/eu-tells-biden-to-export-covid-19-vaccines-now-and-worry-about-patent-later-101620487772404.html

The Taliban condemned the attack apparently aimed at civilians, and denied any responsibility.The explosion is being investigated, said Interior Ministry spokesman Tariq Arian who added the death toll could rise further.Ambulances were rushing to evacuate wounded from the scene of the blast near Syed Al-Shahda school, in the Shiite majority neighborhood of Dasht-e-Barchi, Interior Ministry spokesman Tariq Arian said.Residents in the area said the explosion was deafening. One, Naser Rahimi, told The Associated Press he heard three separate explosions, although there was no official confirmation of multiple blasts. Rahimi also said he believed that the sheer power of the explosion meant the death toll would almost certainly climb.While no one has claimed responsibility for the bombing, previous brutal attacks in the same neighborhood have been claimed by the Afghan Islamic State affiliate.The radical Sunni Muslim group has declared war on Afghanistan's minority Shiite Muslims. Washington blamed IS for a vicious attack last year in a maternity hospital in the same area that killed pregnant women and newborn babies.In Dasht-e-Barchi, angry crowds attacked the ambulances and even beat health workers as they tried to evacuate the wounded, Health Ministry spokesman Ghulam Dastigar Nazari said. He implored residents to cooperate and allow ambulances free access to the site.Images circulating on social media purportedly showed bloodied school backpacks and books strewn across the street in front if the school, and smoke rising above the neighborhood.At one nearby hospital, Associated Press journalists saw at least 20 dead bodies lined up in hallways and rooms, with dozens of wounded people and families of victims pressing through the facility.Outside the Muhammad Ali Jinnah Hospital, dozens of people lined up to donate blood, while family members checked casualty posted lists on the walls.Both Arian and Nazari said that at least 50 people were also wounded, and that the casualty toll could rise. The attack occurred just as the fasting day came to an end.No one immediately claimed responsibility for the attack, and Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid told reporters in a message that only the Islamic State group could be responsible for such a heinous crime. Mujahid also accused Afghanistan's intelligence agency of being complicit with IS, although he offered no evidence.The Taliban and the Afghan government have traded accusations over a series of targeted killings of civil society workers, journalists and Afghan professionals. While IS has taken responsibility for some of those killings, many have gone unclaimed.IS has previously claimed attacks against minority Shiites in the same area, last year claiming two brutal attacks on education facilities that killed 50 people, most of them students.Even as the IS has been degraded in Afghanistan, according to government and US officials, it has stepped-up its attacks particularly against Shiite Muslims and women workers.Earlier the group took responsibility for the targeted killing of three women media personnel in eastern Afghanistan.The attack comes days after the remaining 2,500 to 3,500 American troops officially began leaving the country. They will be out by Sept. 11 at the latest. The pullout comes amid a resurgent Taliban, who control or hold sway over half of Afghanistan.The top U.S. military officer said Sunday that Afghan government forces face an uncertain future and possibly some “bad possible outcomes” against Taliban insurgents as the withdrawal accelerates in the coming weeks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/bomb-kills-at-least-25-people-near-school-in-afghan-capital-101620483914410.html

However, he emphasised it was also a 'very risky period' as we see during this period a kind of shopping frenzy."We are today in the midst of the third wave of Covid-19 pandemic," he said adding the public alone could make the battle against the virus successful by strictly following Covid-19 SOPs.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-imposes-10-day-countrywide-lockdown-from-may-8-to-tackle-covid19-101620482424325.html

What does it mean?||Seychelles, an island nation in the Indian Ocean, announced the reopening of borders for tourists in March to revive its economy which is heavily reliant on the tourism industry. The archipelago kicked off an aggressive vaccination drive to inoculate its population of nearly 100,000 and soon became the world’s most vaccinated country.Seychelles began vaccinating its population against the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) using a donation of China's Sinopharm vaccines from the United Arab Emirates. Later, the island nation used the Covishield vaccines, a version of AstraZeneca’s shot manufactured by Pune-based Serum Institute of India (SII).As per the latest data, more than 60 per cent of Seychelles’ population has been fully vaccinated and around 70 per cent has been administered at least one dose of the Covid-19 vaccine. The percentage of the fully vaccinated population is more than other vaccine giants like Israel and the United Kingdom.In spite of these impressive vaccination figures, Seychelles this week reported the highest number of Covid-19 cases per capita, worse than a country like India which has not even 3 per cent of its population fully vaccinated. According to Our World in Data, the latest rolling 7-day average for daily new Covid-19 cases per capita in Seychelles is more than twice India’s.Seychelles has reported nearly 7,000 Covid-19 cases since the start of the pandemic but it’s a big deal for a country with a population of less than 100,000. Earlier this week, the archipelago announced new measures, including shutting down schools and cancelling sporting activities, for two weeks to curb the infection. Peggy Vidot, Seychelles’ health minister, told a press conference that the Covid-19 situation in the country is critical right now despite all the “exceptional efforts”.Experts have been watching the situation in Seychelles closely for what it says about the effectiveness of vaccines. According to a Washington Post report, the surge in new cases may confirm that the Covid-19 vaccines being used in the country “have comparatively low effectiveness.” Yanzhong Huang, a senior fellow for global health at the Council on Foreign Relations, told the Post that the situation in Seychelles is making a critical case to “consider the effectiveness of some vaccines and what range we have to reach to meet herd immunity.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/worlds-most-vaccinated-country-is-witnessing-covid-19-surge-worse-than-india-101620481772947.html
08-05-2021||World||India's role as a global player will expand: PM Modi, Portuguese PM||India's role as a major regional and global player is set to expand over the coming years and its journey with the European Union in search of new routes of political, economic and technological cooperation will continue, Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his Portuguese counterpart Antonio Costa said on Saturday.In a joint op-ed piece in Politico, they said the India-EU leaders' meeting is an opportunity to expand cooperation in new areas of decisive importance for the development of contemporary societies and economies."India's role as a major regional and global player is set to continue to expand over the coming years, and a strengthened partnership would offer Europe an opportunity to diversify relations in a strategic region of the world," Modi and Costa said.In the virtual India-EU leaders' meeting on Saturday, the two sides are expected to announce the resumption of negotiations for a free trade agreement after a gap of eight years, besides resolving to further broadbase their ties."The journey together between the EU and India will be continued and advanced as of tomorrow in search of new routes of political, economic and technological cooperation, with enormous potential for mutual benefits," the two prime ministers said.Modi and Costa said the India-EU meeting will provide new impetus to the partnership that will have a positive effect on international trade and investment."The meeting is a chance to expand cooperation between the EU and India in new areas of decisive importance for the development of contemporary societies and economies: the digital transition, connectivity, mobility, health, the energy transition and climate action," they said.The two leaders mentioned that the EU is India's biggest trading partner and the second-largest destination for Indian exports, adding the two-way trade has increased 72 percent in the last decade."It is the right time to resume negotiations toward an ambitious and balanced trade agreement capable of acting as a key driver for sustainable growth and jobs creation, both for India and Europe," they said."Apart from everything else, an EU-India agreement would send a powerful signal to the world in support of the benefits of international trade cooperation," they added.The two prime ministers noted that a similar rationale applies to investment."The negotiation of an EU-wide investment protection framework would provide greater stability and certainty to companies from India and EU to expand their presence in each other's markets," they added.Modi and Costa said India-EU relations have always been marked by mutual support and solidarity which was evident during the coronavirus pandemic when both have supported each other and the rest of the world."India extended medical supplies to Europe earlier and now the EU has extended assistance to India as it experiences a second wave of COVID-19," they said.The two prime ministers also said that Portugal and India have always played a unique role in bringing the two continents together, both in the distant and recent past.Modi and Costa also said that Nobel laureate Rabindranath Tagore travelled extensively in Europe in different periods of his life."The great poet was a staunch believer in the principles of mutual understanding between peoples and in India's mission to bring together the East and the West," they said."He wrote frequently about the meeting of Europe and India, to which he attributed deep cultural, political and even personal significance:“I have felt the meeting of the East and the West in my own individual life,” they added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/indias-role-as-a-global-player-will-expand-pm-modi-portuguese-pm-101620479273221.html
08-05-2021||World||EU agrees potential 1.8 billion-dose purchase of Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine||The European Union cemented its support for Pfizer-BioNTech and its novel COVID-19 vaccine technology Saturday by agreeing to a massive contract extension for a potential 1.8 billion doses through 2023.EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen tweeted that her office “has just approved a contract for a guaranteed 900 million doses" with the same amount of doses as a future option.The new contract, which has the unanimous backing of the EU member states, will entail not only the production of the vaccines, but also making sure that all the essential components should be sourced from the EU.The European Commission currently has a portfolio of 2.6 billion doses from half a dozen companies. “Other contracts and other vaccine technologies will follow,” von der Leyen said in a Twitter message.Pfizer-BioNTech had an initial contract of 600 million doses with the EU.Saturday’s announcement also underscores the confidence the EU has shown in the technology used for the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, which is different from that behind the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine.The active ingredient in the Pfizer-BioNTech shot is messenger RNA, or mRNA, which contains the instructions for human cells to construct a harmless piece of the coronavirus called the spike protein. The human immune system recognizes the spike protein as foreign, allowing it to mount a response against the virus upon infection.The announcement of the huge contract extension comes as the European Union is looking for ways to meet the challenges of necessary booster shots, possible new variants and a drive to vaccinate children and teenagers.America’s Pfizer and Germany’s BioNTech have already said that they would provide the EU with an extra 50 million doses in the 2nd quarter of this year, making up for faltering deliveries of AstraZeneca.In contrast to the oft-criticized Anglo-Swedish AstraZeneca, von der Leyen has said that Pfizer-BioNTech is a reliable partner that delivers on its commitments.Two weeks ago, the EU launched legal proceedings against AstraZeneca for failing to respect the terms of its contract with the 27-nation bloc.The AstraZeneca vaccine had been central to Europe’s immunization campaign, and a linchpin in the global strategy to get vaccines to poorer countries. But the slow pace of deliveries has frustrated the Europeans and they have held the company responsible for partly delaying their vaccine rollout.So far, von der Leyen said, the EU has made some 200 million doses available to its 450 million citizens while almost as many have been exported from the bloc.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/eu-agrees-potential-1-8-billion-dose-purchase-of-pfizer-covid-19-vaccine-101620473218260.html
08-05-2021||World||Chinese Covid-19 vaccine nod ‘milestone’: WHO China chief||The World Health Organisation’s (WHO) decision to validate the first Chinese Covid-19 vaccine represents a “milestone”, the UN agency’s China chief has said, adding that it could spur 15 more Covid jabs in development here to pursue the same path.The WHO on Friday gave the green light to China’s Sinopharm Covid-19 vaccine for emergency use, approving the vaccine to be rolled out globally.It is the first vaccine developed by a non-Western country to get the UN health agency’s backing though China has already vaccinated millions of people at home, since last year, and in dozens of other countries with it.It was also the first time the WHO had given emergency use approval to a Chinese vaccine to be used globally for any infectious disease.In a statement issued on Saturday, Gauden Galea, WHO’s representative to China called it a “milestone achievement”. “One vaccine has received EUL (emergency use listing) but we know that there are over 15 additional Covid-19 vaccines in advanced development in China. Today’s milestone achievement should spur other manufacturers to pursue this route and add to the global vaccine arsenal,” Galea said.“The successful EUL application is built on years of training and research by Chinese scientists, and decades of investment, coordinated efforts, and reform on the part of the government, national regulators, and the manufacturers themselves,” Galea said.Calling it a “highly anticipated WHO EUL listing of the vaccine”, Galea said it shows both at home and abroad that the vaccines are of assured quality, safe for use, and meets WHO’s requirements for efficacy.A WHO EUL is a pointer to an individual country’s drug regulator that a product is safe as well as effective.It also allows it to be included in Covax, a global programme to provide vaccines to be channelised for poor countries.“This (Sinopharm listing) expands the list of Covid-19 vaccines that Covax can buy and gives countries confidence to expedite their own regulatory approval, and to import and administer a vaccine,” WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told a briefing on Friday.Until now, the WHO had only approved the vaccines made by Pfizer, AstraZeneca, Johnson & Johnson and Moderna to be used during the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic.Galea pointed out the importance of and the need for Covid-19 vaccines reaching poorer countries.“Around the world, more than a billion vaccine doses have been administered. Among those, 100 million were administered in April - but only 1% (1 million doses) went to low-income countries. The rest - 99 million doses - went to high- and middle-income countries,” he wrote.In May, 2020, President Xi Jinping had pledged to make Chinese vaccines a global good.“Covid-19 vaccine development and deployment in China, when available, will be made a global public good, which will be China’s contribution to ensuring vaccine accessibility and affordability in developing countries,” Xi had said at the opening of the 73rd session of the World Health Assembly via video link.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinese-covid-19-vaccine-nod-milestone-who-china-chief-101620474188085.html
08-05-2021||World||EU sceptical on waiving patent rights to Covid-19 vaccines, but ready to discuss proposal||The European Union (EU) is sceptical about the usefulness of waiving patent rights to Covid-19 vaccines as a way to fight the pandemic, but is ready to discuss a concrete proposal, the chairman of EU leaders Charles Michel said on Saturday.Speaking to reporters before the second day of an EU summit in the Portuguese city of Porto, Michel said the way to fight the pandemic now was to quickly make more shots and lift export curbs on them in countries like the United States and Britain that make vaccines but do not sell them to others."In Europe we took the decision to make exports possible and we encourage all partners to facilitate the exports of doses," Michel said after discussions with leaders of the 27-nation bloc on Friday evening.India and South Africa called last year for the lifting of patent rights to vaccines as a way of boosting manufacturing and ensuring the world is supplied. Debate around the issue erupted anew on Wednesday when US President Joe Biden supported the idea, provided it was done through the World Trade Organization (WTO).The time taken to get a WTO agreement and to build expanded vaccine-making capacity would mean that such a waiver would not provide a quick fix, sceptics say."On intellectual property -- we don't think that in the short term that it is a magic bullet, but we are ready to engage on this topic as soon as a concrete proposal would be put on the table," Michel said.Officials said that during Friday's summit talks, Germany - home to BionTech which holds a patent on the highly effective mRNA vaccine together with Pfizer - argued strongly against the idea of waiving patent rights.Portugal, Estonia, Belgium and Ireland were also sceptical but Greece backed the waiver idea, as did Italy, which was in favour of time-limited and geographically targeted measures.EU officials say Europe is one of the biggest exporters of coronavirus vaccines in the world, with some 200 million doses shipped out to 90 countries -- the same number of shots that Europe has distributed among its own citizens.French President Emmanuel Macron, speaking to reporters before Saturday's talks, said that with Covid-19 vaccines the world could try to emulate what was done years ago with medicines against HIV, when such medicines became too expensive for poor nations."We need to start a debate today about doing exactly as we did at the time of HIV, where the intellectual property was a source of blockage, it should be possible to lift it, but in a limited way," Macron said.He stressed that any action should not financially punish the companies that came up with the vaccine technology. The EU's executive arm, the European Commission, called on Friday on the United States and other major vaccine producers to export what they make. Commission head Ursula von der Leyen told a news conference discussions on the waiver would not produce a single dose of Covid-19 vaccine in the short- to medium-term.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/eu-sceptical-on-waiving-patent-rights-to-covid-19-vaccines-but-ready-to-discuss-proposal-101620470048250.html
08-05-2021||World||US military predicts time, place of Chinese rocket debris crash: Report | All you need to know||A large segment of Chinese rocket is in an uncontrolled free-fall towards Earth and the latest track prediction suggests that the debris could crash in a potentially populated area. China launched a Long March-5B rocket on April 29 carrying the first module of its new space station into Earth's orbit. While multi-stage rockets typically fall back before getting into Earth’s orbit, this one went into orbit and has to come back into the atmosphere.The rocket’s 18-tonne main segment is now in a free-fall but Beijing has downplayed fears of damage. Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin on Friday told reporters that the upper stage of this rocket has been deactivated, insisting that most of its parts will burn up upon re-entry and the probability of causing harm on the ground is extremely low.The argument that the debris will just splash down into the ocean, given that the planet is 70 per cent water, was also put forward. Florent Delefie, an astronomer at the Paris-PSL Observatory, told news agency AFP that there will be big pieces left over due to the size of the rocket. "The chances of debris landing on an inhabited zone are tiny, probably one in a million," he said.However, the latest prediction by the US military, which is tracking the rocket segment, is not encouraging, according to CNN. The US military has predicted that the debris will fall in Turkmenistan in Central Asia around 7pm Eastern Time on Saturday (4.30am IST on Sunday), per CNN.Jonathan McDowell, an astrophysicist at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, told AFP that there is a real chance of damage to whatever it hits, suggesting an outside chance of a casualty. This is not the first time that a Chinese rocket has caused concerns for inhabitants on Earth. In 2020, debris from another Long March rocket fell on villages in the Ivory Coast, a West African country, causing structural damage. But the crash didn’t result in any injuries or deaths."Having a ton of metal shards flying into the Earth at hundreds of kilometres per hour is not good practice, and China should redesign the Long-March 5B missions to avoid this," McDowell added.(with agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-military-predicts-time-place-of-chinese-rocket-debris-crash-report-101620470619139.html

08-05-2021||World||Pakistan opposition leader Shahbaz Sharif prevented from leaving country||Pakistan’s ailing opposition leader, who has been charged with corruption, was turned back on Saturday at the international airport in Lahore and prevented from leaving the country, his party spokesperson said.Shahbaz Sharif, head of the opposition bloc in the lower house of parliament and the Pakistan Muslim League party, was not allowed to board a Qatar Airways flight to London, said Maryam Aurangzeb, the party spokeswoman.She said immigration officials at the airport said Sharif’s name was still “on the black list" so he could not leave.On Friday, the Lahore High Court ruled that Sharif could leave Pakistan and stay abroad for treatment till early July. The court had acted on a petition from Sharif, who pleaded that as a cancer survivor he now needed treatment outside of Pakistan.The court order drew criticism from Prime Minister Imran Khan’s government, which said it would explore legal options to stop Sharif from leaving. Information Minister Fawad Chaudhry said the government had not received any application from Sharif or his party asking that he be taken off the black list.Sharif faces corruption charges in three separate court cases. He leads his brother’s Pakistan’s Muslim League party after Nawaz Sharif, a three-time prime minister, was disqualified from office.The ex-premier and elder Sharif, convicted of corruption, lives in exile in London. He was released from prison in 2019 on bail to seek medical treatment abroad but never returned home.Shahbaz Sharif was released on bail last month on a court order, about seven months after he was arrested by an anti-graft body over alleged involvement in money laundering.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-opposition-leader-shahbaz-sharif-prevented-from-leaving-country-101620464543878.html

The company transports 2.5 million barrels per day of gasoline, diesel, jet fuel and other refined products through 5,500 miles (8,850 km) of pipelines.Colonial Pipeline says it transports 45% of East Coast fuel supply.The company learned of the attack on Friday and took systems offline to contain the threat, it said in the statement. That action has temporarily halted operations and affected some of its IT systems, it said.The company has engaged a third-party cybersecurity firm to launch an investigation, and Colonial has contacted law enforcement and other federal agencies, it said.Colonial did not give further details or say for how long its pipelines would be shut.Reuters reported earlier on Friday that Colonial had shut its main gasoline and distillate lines.During the trading session on Friday, Gulf Coast cash prices for gasoline and diesel edged lower.Both gasoline and diesel futures on the New York Mercantile Exchange rose more than crude prices during the day. Gasoline futures gained 0.6% to settle at $2.1269 a gallon, while diesel futures rose 1.1% to settle at $2.0106 a gallon.Longer-term price effects will depend on the amount of time that the lines are shut.

It has also approved Russia's Sputnik and China's Sinopharm vaccines for emergency use.The island nation reported 1,914 new cases and 19 deaths in the past 24 hours, according to federal health data, and its total number of active cases is higher than any point since the pandemic began. Infections surged after crowded celebrations for traditional New Year last month.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/sri-lanka-approves-pfizer-covid-vaccine-for-emergency-use-101620463181678.html

The most recent example is Covid-19, which was first detected in Wuhan, China. Health experts and advocates have directly connected terms like the "China virus" or "Wuhan virus" to the recent increase in hate crimes against Asian Americans," the SAJA said.The association encouraged journalists to exercise care in their ongoing coverage of the coronavirus surge in India and said it was available to foster fair and accurate coverage of the South Asian community."SAJA recommends applying the same guidance to any current or future variants of the coronavirus," it said.B.1.617, known as the 'double mutant' -- this name comes from two notable mutations found in other variants that appeared together for the first time in this new strain and first detected in western parts of India, the letter stated.At present, B.1.617 and B.1 are the major strains identified from the samples of south India from the positives of the April month data, which is very infectious and is also spreading in the younger age groups apart from the adults.With a total of 4,14,188 new Covid-19 cases being recorded in the last 24 hours, India again reported its highest single-day spike on the second consecutive day. With this, the cumulative count of cases in the country reached 2,14,91,598, informed the Union Health Ministry.The country registered 3,915 new Covid-related deaths which took the total death toll in the country further up to 2,34,083.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/saja-advises-news-firms-against-using-india-variant-term-for-new-covid-strain-101620442173880.html

Palestinian sources said Shalabi is a dual US national.On Wednesday, Israeli troops killed a 16-year-old Palestinian when they opened fire on protesters throwing petrol bombs, also in the West Bank.And clashes have broken out between police and demonstrators in the east Jerusalem Sheikh Jarrah neighbourhood -- fuelled by a years-long land dispute between Palestinian refugees and Jewish settlers.AFP correspondents said around 100 protesters again rallied Friday night in the neighbourhood, with officers using stun grenades and water cannon to disperse them.The incidents in Sheikh Jarrah and around Damascus Gate -- a key entry point to the Old City -- left many wounded, the Red Crescent said, adding to the toll of around 22 wounded in confrontations earlier in the week.Israeli police also said they made 26 arrests between Wednesday and Thursday.Meanwhile in Jordan -- home to a large Palestinian population -- hundreds rallied Friday, chanting "we will die for Sheikh Jarrah".The nation administered the West Bank, including mostly Arab east Jerusalem, until the 1967 Six-Day War and remains the custodian of Muslim holy sites in the city.Earlier this year, a district court ruled four Palestinian homes in Sheikh Jarrah legally belonged to Jewish families.The Jewish plaintiffs claimed their families lost the land during the war that accompanied Israel's creation in 1948, a conflict that also saw hundreds of thousands of Palestinians displaced.The Sheikh Jarrah families have provided evidence that their homes were acquired from Jordanian authorities, who controlled east Jerusalem from 1948 to 1967.Israel's Supreme Court is to hold a new hearing in the case on Monday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/over-160-injured-in-clash-between-israeli-police-palestinians-at-jerusalem-s-al-aqsa-mosque-101620440630170.html

Meanwhile, ICU bed occupancy has fallen to 78.3 percent in the state from over 91 percent on April 1.Sao Paulo was in the red phase from March 6 to 23, moving to the transition phase and gradually opening up activities as according to hospital availability.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/brazil-sao-paulo-extends-covid-restriction-phase-but-eases-commercial-activity-101620440096801.html

Twenty-four other people and a police officer also died in the operation in the northern Rio neighborhood of Jacarezinho."Intelligence confirmed that the dead were drug dealers. They fired at officers, to kill. They had orders to confront," Civil Police chief Allan Turnowski told reporters.The bloodbath prompted criticism from human rights groups including Amnesty International, which lambasted the police for the "reprehensible and unjustifiable" loss of life in a neighborhood mostly populated by Black and poor people.The United Nations human rights office on Friday called for an independent investigation into the operation. U.N. human rights spokesman Rupert Colville said the police deployed a "disproportionate and unnecessary" use of force.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/rio-de-janeiro-drug-shootout-death-toll-rises-to-28-101620439521678.html

Kami Rita and 11 other Sherpa guides reached the summit at about 6pm, tourism department official Mira Acharya said. They are the first climbers to reach the summit this year and were fixing the ropes on the icy route so that hundreds of other climbers can scale the peak later this month.Everest was closed to climbing last year on its southern side, which is in Nepal, because of the coronavirus pandemic. Climbing permits were issued this year to 408 foreign climbers.Rita, 51, first scaled Everest in 1994 and has been making the trip nearly every year since then. He is one of many Sherpa guides whose expertise and skills are vital to the safety and success of the hundreds of climbers who head to Nepal each year seeking to stand on top of the 8,848.86m mountain.In addition to the 25 times he’s reached the top of Everest, Rita has scaled several other peaks that are among the world’s highest, including K2, Cho-Oyu, Manaslu and Lhotse.He was at Everest’s base camp in 2015 when an avalanche swept through, killing 19 people. After that tragedy, he had come under intense family pressure to quit mountaineering.Forty-three teams have been permitted to scale Everest during this year’s spring climbing season. Each May, there are usually only a few windows of good weather at the summit during which climbers can attempt to scale the peak.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nepals-kami-rita-scales-everest-for-record-25th-time-101620436534090.html

The US has also announced support for India and South Africa’s proposal at the World Trade Organization (WTO) to temporarily waive intellectual property rights on Covid-19 vaccines to ensure easy access to them around the world.“As many of you know, generations of my family come from India. My mother (Shyamala Gopalan) was born and raised in India, and I have family members who live in India today,” Harris said in a recorded video message played at a US state department virtual event on American support and the role of the Indian diaspora.Harris said, “The welfare of India is critically important to the United States. The surge of Covid-19 infections and deaths in India is nothing short of heartbreaking.”She gave a timeline of how the US came to announce the assistance, starting with a phone call between US President Joe Biden and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi on April 26, a Monday. “By Friday, April 30, military members from the US and civilians were delivering relief on the ground,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/heartbreaking-situation-in-india-kamala-harris-101620436007289.html

Alcohol will be banned at outdoor sporting events.When asked if the opening could cause a spike in infections in the city, Sheinbaum said a number of factors could prevent that happening, including rising vaccination rates, discipline of citizens, warmer weather and a large number of previously infected citizens who could help generate herd immunity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/mexico-city-to-allow-open-air-events-amid-fall-in-covid-19-cases-101620432901368.html
08-05-2021||World||European Commission calls on United States and others to export their vaccines||The European Commission called on Friday on the United States and other major Covid-19 vaccine producers to export what they make as the European Union does, rather than talk about waiving intellectual property rights to the shots.Commission head Ursula von der Leyen told a news conference on the sidelines of a summit of EU leaders that discussions on the waiver would not produce a single dose of Covid-19 vaccine in the short- to medium-term."We should be open to lead this discussion. But when we lead this discussion, there needs to be a 360 degree view on it because we need vaccines now for the whole world," she said."The European Union is the only continental or democratic region of this world that is exporting at large scale," von der Leyen said.She said about 50% of European-produced coronavirus vaccine is exported to almost 90 countries, including those in the World Health Organization-backed COVAX program."And we invite all those who engage in the debate of a waiver for IP rights also to join us to commit to be willing to export a large share of what is being produced in that region," she said.Only higher production, removing exports barriers and the sharing of already-ordered vaccines could immediately help fight the pandemic quickly, she said."So what is necessary in the short term and the medium term: First of all vaccine sharing. Secondly export of vaccines that are being produced. And the third is investment in the increasing of the capacity to manufacture vaccines."Von der Leyen said the European Union had started its vaccine sharing mechanism, citing delivery of 615,000 doses to the Western Balkans as an example.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/european-commission-calls-on-united-states-and-others-to-export-their-vaccines-101620432125383.html

This year authorities have eased rules to lure back foreign adventurers and have issued climbing permits to more than 400 people, a new record. But the warmer weather that ushers in safer conditions for scaling Nepal’s snow-capped peaks has coincided with a deadly second wave of Covid-19 infections, with active cases in the country rising six-fold in the last two weeks.Norwegian climber Erlend Ness spent two nights sleeping in his tent at base camp last month, unsure of what was making him ill. “I was evacuated to Kathmandu and was tested. My result was positive for Covid,” he told AFP. “I think I’m not the only one...” he said. Fellow climber Gina Marie Han-Lee decided to abandon her expedition last week over fears the disease was spreading around base camp, she said on Facebook on April 29. Officials at a clinic near the camp say more than 30 people have been flown off the camp in recent weeks. But the government has denied that any Covid-19 case was confirmed on Everest.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-scales-mt-everest-at-least-30-evacuated-in-recent-weeks-101620422328757.html

He's withdrawn troops," he said.Asked about meeting Putin in June, he said: "I'm confident we'll be able to do it. We don't have any specific time or place. That's being worked on."The United States has said it supports Ukraine amid what US Secretary of State Antony Blinken this week called Moscow's "reckless" troop build-up.Biden and his advisers would like to add a summit with Putin in a third country while the US president is in Europe in mid-June for a Group of Seven meeting in Britain and talks with NATO allies in Brussels.But negotiations with the Russians on staging the summit are continuing, White House spokeswoman Jen Psaki told reporters."We're working through the question of some logistics - place, location, time, agenda, all the specifics - that was always going to happen at a staff level. It's really up to them what they want to achieve," she said.Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov was cited by Russian news agency TASS as saying Russia was studying the possibility of a Putin-Biden meeting."We continue to analyze the situation," TASS quoted Peskov as saying when asked whether the Russian side has officially agreed to the proposed summit.The United States has a number of grievances with Russia, including its treatment of jailed Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny. But Psaki said these grievances do not need to be resolved in advance of a Biden-Putin summit."Obviously, human rights, freedom of speech, freedom of expression, values are all issues the president, Secretary (of State Antony) Blinken, National Security Adviser (Jake) Sullivan raised with their counterparts. But the invitation to have a discussion and have a meeting was not offered with the prerequisite that every issue is resolved in advance. We expect we will still continue to have disagreements," she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-president-joe-biden-says-he-is-confident-of-meeting-russia-s-putin-soon-101620421325515.html
08-05-2021||World||China's rocket out of control but risk of damage low, say experts||China's rogue rocket is in an uncontrolled free-fall towards Earth and no one knows where or exactly when it will burn through Earth's atmosphere, but the risk of debris hitting an inhabited area remains very small, experts told AFP Friday.What happened?On April 29, China launched the first module of its "Heavenly Palace" space station, a milestone in Beijing's ambitious plan to establish a permanent human presence in space.The module was propelled by a powerful Long March 5B rocket, whose first stage is currently descending Earthward.If Chinese ground engineers have no control over the booster stage's trajectory, it is not due to a technical failure or some unexplained glitch. The rocket was designed that way.From a low Earth orbit, bodies are drawn gradually by gravity towards the surface of the planet.Such objects are usually consumed by heat as friction from an increasingly dense atmosphere increases on approach.But the Long March rocket is so massive -- up to 18 tonnes -- that is it unlikely to burn up entirely."Given the size of the object, there will necessarily be big pieces left over," said Florent Delefie, an astronomer at the Paris-PSL Observatory."If the rocket is composed of materials that don't separate on re-entry, it's even riskier," he added. "That would appear to be the case for the Long March 5B."This was no doubt clear to Chinese flight engineers."The Chinese should have anticipated a controlled re-entry with a retrorocket, which is what the Russian did when they removed the Mir station from Earth orbit," explained Nicolas Bobrinsky, head of engineering and innovation at the European Space Agency.Likely scenarios?Given the rocket's altitude -- 150 to 250 kilometres -- its re-entry is very difficult to anticipate.Because lower levels in the atmosphere are more prone to variations in density, "we can't really say exactly when that will happen," Bobrinsky said.As of late Friday, European time, it was forecast that re-entry would happen between 21:00 GMT Saturday and 0700 GMT Sunday. That range will continue to narrow in the coming hours."But even one hour before impact, the level of uncertainty will be high," Bobrinsky said.One thing is sure: the spent booster is orbiting on an inclination to the equator of about 41 degrees. This means that any debris will fall within 41 degrees North and 41 degrees South, which includes the tropics and a generous band on either side.Greece, Spain and north Africa are within that belt, as are most of the United States and China. France and Germany lie outside it.The most likely landing zone is water, simply because nearly three-quarters of the surface of the planet is covered by oceans."The chances of debris landing on an inhabited zone are tiny, probably one in a million," said Delefie.Even if fragments of the rocket do land on buildings, the speed of impact will be relatively slow at about 200 kilometres per hour (125 miles per hour). By comparison, a meteorite can reach speeds of 36,000 km/hr as it hurtles towards Earth.Has this happened before?In 2020, debris from another Long March rocket fell on villages in the Ivory Coast, causing structural damages but no injuries or deaths.Since the launch of the first satellite in 1957 by the Soviet Union, tonnes of rocket stages, satellites and instruments have been sent into space.NASA estimates that there are about 34,000 objects of at least 10 centimetres (four inches) in diameter circling Earth's today.Since the beginning of the space age more than 60 years ago, some 6,000 objects have made an uncontrolled re-entry into Earth's atmosphere, and only once has any debris struck a human being. Even then it did not result in injury, according to Stijn Lemmens, an expert at ESA.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinas-rocket-out-of-control-but-risk-of-damage-low-say-experts-101620420935974.html
08-05-2021||World||Canada says ready to discuss IP waiver on Covid-19 vaccines||Canada is ready to discuss an intellectual property rights (IP) waiver for Covid-19 vaccines and will not block one even though it stresses the importance of protecting patents, officials said on Friday.US President Joe Biden on Wednesday threw his support behind waiving IP rights for Covid-19 vaccines. Any such waiver would have to be negotiated through the World Trade Organization (WTO)."We've been working with partners at the WTO to find a consensus-based solution and are ready to discuss proposals, in particular for Covid-19 vaccines," Prime Minister Justin Trudeau told reporters.Biden's proposal angered pharmaceutical companies. Firms working on vaccines have reported sharp revenue and profit gains during the crisis.Canadian International Trade Minister Mary Ng earlier said that Ottawa firmly believed in the importance of protecting IP."I can assure you Canada is not interfering or blocking. Canada is very much working to find a solution," said Trudeau, who did not give details of the Canadian negotiating stance.Ng said Ottawa recognized how much the pharmaceutical industry had done to innovate Covid-19 vaccines, adding that many barriers to access were unrelated to IP, such as supply-chain constraints.Canada is trying to quell a third wave of the coronavirus pandemic that is pushing some healthcare systems to breaking points, particularly in the western provinces of Alberta and Manitoba.Manitoba officials said they were postponing some non-urgent surgeries to open space for Covid-19 patients and planned to announce tougher public health restrictions as daily cases soared to a near-record high.The U.S. state of Montana will offer vaccines to around 2,000 Alberta truckers who regularly cross the border, Alberta Premier Jason Kenney said.Truckers will get vaccinated at a post being set up just south of the border, using Montana's surplus Johnson & Johnson vaccines.The scheme mirrors an agreement that Saskatchewan and Manitoba reached with North Dakota.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canada-says-ready-to-discuss-ip-waiver-on-covid-19-vaccines-101620413448052.html
08-05-2021||World||Unsure Covid-19 vaccine waiver will help, some EU leaders call for more exports||European leaders voiced increasing skepticism Friday that a US proposal to lift patent protections on Covid-19 vaccines would solve the problem of getting shots into the arms of people in poorer countries, with some instead calling for more exports of the doses already being produced.While activists and humanitarian groups have cheered the Biden administration’s decision and urged others to follow suit, European Union leaders are hammering home the message that any benefit from a temporary waiver of intellectual property protections would be long in coming. Instead, they've taken the US, in particular, to task for not sharing more vaccines with the rest of the world.“You can give the intellectual property to laboratories that do not know how to produce it. They won’t produce it tomorrow,” said French President Emmanuel Macron at a summit in Portugal, even though he has also said he would agree to waive the protections.EU officials insist rewriting rules in the World Trade Organization could take months or even a year, and say they've found few examples — if any — that intellectual property issues are what's holding up the rollout of vaccines.Supporters of a patent waiver have argued it would allow more factories around the world to produce the shots, increasing the supply, especially in poorer countries. The decision ultimately is up to the 164-member WTO, and if just one country votes against a waiver, the idea will fail.Macron said the key issues are really donations and exports — an argument also made by the pharmaceutical industry — and he said the United States should do more on that front.The US does not have an export ban on vaccines nor does it prohibit the export of ingredients for the shots. But the federal government controls hundreds of millions of doses manufactured in the country under the terms of its contracts with drug makers, and is first in line for some raw materials produced by US suppliers.The US has sent Canada and Mexico about 4 million doses from its stockpile of vaccines from AstraZeneca — which hasn't yet applied for authorization in the US — and it plans to begin exporting as many as 60 million doses in coming months. Last week, the US also redirected some raw materials used for AstraZeneca to India as part of its relief efforts for the hard-hit country.Macron boasted, however, that almost half of the doses produced on in the European Union — or about 200 million — have been allowed to be exported.“We are the most generous in the world of developed nations,” he said.White House press secretary Jen Psaki told reporters Friday that the US is going to “work with international partners, with the pharmaceutical companies to up the supply, to get as much supply out to the global community as possible.”WTO Director-General Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala echoed some of the sentiments expressed by European leaders at a virtual conference Friday, noting that lifting patent protections could help expand fair access to vaccines but might not be the most “critical issue” in expanding vaccine production.Other key steps include reducing restrictions on the export both of vaccines and the ingredients needed to make them, sharing the know-how behind the shots, training manufacturing personnel and increasing manufacturing capacity globally.Meanwhile, Germany, a research powerhouse with strong biotech and pharmaceutical sectors, spoke out against waiving the protections — and also urged more exports.“The main issue is not the question of patents. The main issue is the question of production capacity," German Health Minister Jens Spahn said, noting that producing vaccines like one developed by German firm BioNTech — and manufactured with Pfizer —is very complicated.Instead, he stressed that developed countries whose vaccination campaigns are going well should export more shots.“We’ll be exporting a lot more," he said. “I can only welcome if the United States change their policy and make vaccination doses available for other countries.”Fatima Hassan, a human rights lawyer and director of the Health Justice Initiative in South Africa, welcomed the Biden administration’s announcement but said it’s “eight months too late.”“We can’t basically wait for months for this waiver to be finalized,” she said. Hassan said the countries that have “overordered” vaccines are “ironically blocking the waiver and the ability of people in low income parts of the world to access the vaccines.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/unsure-covid-19-vaccine-waiver-will-help-some-eu-leaders-call-for-more-exports-101620412289227.html

Vaccine efficacy for symptomatic and hospitalised disease was estimated to be 79%, all age groups combined,” the WHO said.“Few older adults (over 60 years) were enrolled in clinical trials, so efficacy could not be estimated in this age group. Nevertheless, WHO is not recommending an upper age limit for the vaccine because preliminary data and supportive immunogenicity data suggest the vaccine is likely to have a protective effect in older persons.”Until now, the WHO had only approved the vaccines made by Pfizer, AstraZeneca, Johnson & Johnson and Moderna to be used during the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic.“This afternoon, the WHO gave emergency use listing to Sinopharm, Beijing’s Covid-19 vaccine, making it the sixth vaccine to receive WHO validation for safety, efficacy, and quality,” WHO DG Tedros Ghebreyesus said at a twice-weekly webinar on Covid-19.“The Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization, or SAGE, has also reviewed the available data, and recommends the vaccine for adults aged 18 and older, with a two-dose schedule,” he said.“This expands the list of vaccines that COVAX combined, and gives countries confidence to expedite their own regulatory approval,” he was quoted as saying by the official Chinese news agency, Xinhua.The Sinopharm vaccine is produced by Beijing Bio-Institute of Biological Products Co Ltd, a subsidiary of China National Biotec Group.“The addition of this vaccine has the potential to rapidly accelerate Covid-19 vaccine access for countries seeking to protect health workers and populations at risk,” said Dr Mariangela Simao, WHO assistant-director general for Access to Health Products.“We urge the manufacturer to participate in the COVAX facility and contribute to the goal of more equitable vaccine distribution,” Simao was quoted as saying.The WHO emergency use listing (EUL) is a prerequisite for COVAX facility vaccine supply, also allowing countries to expedite their regulatory approval to import and administer Covid-19 vaccines in the population.The listing assesses the quality, safety, and efficacy of Covid-19 vaccines, and risk management plans and programmatic suitability, such as cold chain requirements.The EUL, according to the WHO, assesses the quality, safety and efficacy of Covid-19 vaccines, as well as risk management plans and programmatic suitability, such as cold chain requirements.The assessment is performed by the product evaluation group, composed by regulatory experts from around the world and a Technical Advisory Group (TAG), in charge of performing the risk-benefit assessment for an independent recommendation on whether a vaccine can be listed for emergency use and, if so, under which conditions, the WHO said.Feng Duojia, president of the China Vaccine Industry Association, told Global Times that the WHO approval will allow Chinese vaccines to reach more developing countries through international purchase or donations, and it will also be helpful for some EU members’ emergency use of Chinese vaccines.“The Sinopharm product is an inactivated vaccine called SARS-CoV-2 Vaccine (Vero Cell). Its easy storage requirements make it highly suitable for low-resource settings,” said the WHO.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/who-approves-china-s-sinopharm-covid-19-vaccine-for-emergency-use-101620409561848.html

The government has imposed an eight-day lockdown in Kerala to contain the surge. The state has reported another high recording 41,971 new Covid-19 cases with a test positivity rate (TPR) of 28.25 per cent on Saturday. Addressing the media through a virtual meet, the CM said the second wave was really challenging and the government will do everything possible to save lives. “Situation is really tough during the second wave. Though we are facing a shortage of doses we have started vaccinating people below 45 years. The government is keeping a strict watch on the oxygen situation and availability of hospital beds,” he said. In the morning he had a series of meetings with heads of various departments to spruce up the ongoing fight against the pandemic. Vijayan said during the first wave the state did a commendable job in tracing patients and quarantining them but during the second there was laxity on the part of everyone and this would have to be plugged. “Experts say in the second phase the virus strain is deadly. So we will have to take extra caution,” he said requesting people to remain at home and follow directives of the state health ministry in letter and spirit. Experts have warned recently that the double mutant variant or SARS-COV2 lineage B.1.617 has been found in Kerala. They said it was almost similar to the one reported in Maharashtra (Amaravati strain) and it was at least twice as infectious as earlier variants. Earlier the state had confirmed the presence of mutant strains from United Kingdom and South Africa. Experts have also warned that the double mutant variant is more dangerous than the UK and African variants. As Covid-19 cases surged the government imposed a complete lockdown as the weekend restrictions and curbs failed to check the rising graph. This will be extended till May 16 midnight and the government said it is likely to be extended further after gauging the situation. Around 25,000 additional policemen have been deployed to ensure adherence to lockdown norms. After testing 1.48 lakh samples 41,971 positive cases were detected with a TPR of 28.25 per cent. It also reported 64 fatalities taking the death toll to 5746. The total caseload has also risen to 4,17,101. Among those infected are 127 health workers. The growing infection rate among health workers is posing an extra burden on the overworked health system. Ernakualm district topped the infection list with 5492 cases, Thiruvananthapuram followed with 4560 and Malappuram with 4558 cases. Among the 20 worst affected districts in the country, five are in Kerala, according to Union health ministry statistics.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid19-situation-critical-says-kerala-cm-pinarayi-vijayan-as-tpr-climbs-to-2825-101620496149583.html
08-05-2021||India||'Self-inflicted national catastrophe': Cong uses Lancet report to attack BJP||The Congress on Saturday accused the Centre of abject failure in protecting the lives of people and urged it to follow the suggestions of experts by declaring a national lockdown in the wake of rising cases of the novel coronavirus infection.Congress leader Rahul Gandhi hit out at Prime Minister Narendra Modi for “not utilising the vaccination budget”."Vaccine budget- underutilized. Human life- undervalued. Because PM's ego- overinflated," he tweeted, tagging a media report which claimed that only ₹4,744 crore has been utilised from the vaccine budget of ₹35,000 crore.In another tweet in Hindi on GST on COVID-19 vaccines, Gandhi alleged, "People's lives may be lost, but PM's tax extortion should not".In yet another tweet, he said, "The Movid pandemic” and tagged a small video titled "Modi hai to mumkin hai" which showed a rising graph of COVID-19 cases and a declining graph depicting the vaccination plunge.Congress senior spokesperson Ajay Maken quoted a report from The Lancet journal which claimed that “India will see a staggering one million deaths from COVID-19 by August 1”.He said the report also said that “if that outcome were to happen, Modi government would be responsible for presiding over a self-inflicted national catastrophe”.The Congress leader further said the Indian Medical Association (IMA) and The Lancet have made several suggestions similar to those made by his party leaders."The government should not shut its eyes on the suggestions given by experts and the opposition. If such things are coming from professionals and experts, the government should listen to them."If the IMA and reputed journals like The Lancet are suggesting imposition of a national lockdown, the government should impose the lockdown, but with Nyay-like schemes providing ₹6,000 per month to the poor to tide over the crisis," he said at a virtual press conference.Maken asserted that it is the duty of the national government that people should neither die of the pandemic nor of hunger.Congress leader Jairam Ramesh also hit out at the central government over The Lancet report.“The government’s drumbeaters used editorials of the most prestigious Lancet to shower themselves with praise earlier. Now this….,” he tweeted and tagged the report.Maken said the IMA has suggested that the Union health ministry should be revamped with a new minister in place, raising health budget to 8-10 per cent of GDP and universal vaccination.He urged the Delhi government to decentralise and learn from Mumbai and Rajasthan in providing better health infrastructure, as he said the AAP dispensation failed to set up even one PSA oxygen plant in the national capital in the past year.The Congress spokesperson also welcomed the setting up of a national task force by the Supreme Court on oxygen distribution, saying the top court had to intervene after the central government "completely failed" in its duties.PTI SKC SRY||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/selfinflicted-national-catastrophe-cong-uses-lancet-report-to-attack-bjp-101620493877357.html
08-05-2021||India||As Covid cases in Maharashtra dip, state prepares paediatric task force||With daily Covid-19 infections gradually coming down in Maharashtra, the state government, according to reports, is now preparing for the third wave of the pandemic and, as the first step, setting up a paediatric task force for Covid-19 treatment of children.The government's principal scientific advisor, K Vijay Raghavan, recently said a third wave of the pandemic is inevitable, given the higher levels of the circulating virus, though he did not give any time frame. Explaining his comment, he later said that the wave is not unavoidable. If adequate precautions are taken and the virus does not get the opportunity to infect people, then there might not be any third wave. Even if it happens, it will not affect all places equally, Raghavan explained.Considering that the ongoing rage of the pandemic is the second wave, the first wave took place in India in September 2020, when daily cases breached 97,000-mark. As Maharashtra remained at the forefront of both the first and the second waves of the pandemic, the Maharashtra government is already on its toes to prepare for the third wave, which may come in around July-August, Maharashtra health minister Rajesh Tope has said.Though there is no scientific claim, many people are anticipating that the third wave may impact children. More than 1.30 lakh minors in the state have been infected by coronavirus during the second wave which began around February 15, as per official data, quoted by news agency PTI. "We will need new designs for isolation or treatment centres because generally mother has to stay with the child," Tope said"As we prepare for 3rd wave capacity building in Maharashtra, I met AMC Sanjeev Jaiswal ji to discuss the measures we've undertaken in Mumbai. I have suggested to him that we create a paediatric covid care ward anticipating the next wave and the demographic it may target," Aaditya Thackeray tweeted a few days ago.Along with paediatric covid care centre, another aspect we are now focussed on is to create a network of crèches for those parents who may have to be in covid care centres and may not have support to look after their children, that aren’t infected by covid.

Keeping in view the current unprecedented demand for the medical oxygen across the country due to Covid-19 pandemic, containers carrying LMO will be treated at par with other emergency vehicles such as ambulances for a period of two months or till further orders, NHAI said in a statement. "In order to provide uninterrupted passage for tankers and containers carrying Liquid Medical Oxygen (LMO) across national highways, the user fee for such vehicles at toll plazas has been exempted," NHAI said. Although toll plazas have nearly zero waiting time after implementation of FASTag, NHAI said it is already providing priority passage to such vehicles for quick and seamless transportation of medical oxygen. "Instructions have also been issued by NHAI to all its officials and other stakeholders to assist the government and private efforts to fight the pandemic in helping them in pro-active manner," it said. The outbreak of Covid-19 has created huge demand for LMO across the country. "During the ongoing crisis, the timely delivery of LMO to hospitals and medical centres is of paramount importance to save lives of patients critically affected by Covid-19," NHAI said adding, exemption of payment of user fee at toll plazas will ensure faster movement of medical oxygen on the national highways. India is struggling with a second wave of the pandemic with more than 4,00,000 daily new coronavirus cases being reported in the past few days, and hospitals in several states are reeling under the shortage of medical oxygen and beds.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nhai-exempts-tankers-carrying-liquid-medical-oxygen-from-toll-fee-on-highways-101620482940321.html

AIRF, since the beginning has been demanding parity between different cadres who are working 24x7 during this corona period and scarifying their lives. However, It is quite unfortunate that while other categories of front line workers viz medical staff, security forces, sanitation staff etc. are being paid ₹50 lakh as compensation but Railwaymen are being paid ₹25 lakh only."This is an absolute discrepancy and we request that it should be removed immediately by equalising the compensation of ₹50 lakh to boost the morale of Railwaymen as well as their families," Mishra said in his letter."We hope the benefits announced for other corona warriors will also be given to railwaymen. AIRF, has already raised this issue in details to the CEO/Chairman," he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rail-union-demands-parity-in-compensation-with-frontline-workers-in-case-of-death-on-duty-during-covid19-101620481414829.html

Like cigarette smoke spreading in a room, says expert||As the second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic rages across India, international health experts have warned that the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) is airborne but it does not mean that the virus is out there spreading through the air and anyone who goes outside will simply get infected by breathing.The United States Centers of Disease Control (CDC) on Friday issued a new advisory regarding the transmission of coronavirus disease (Covid-19) and highlighted that there are three primary ways in which a person can contract Covid-19. The CDC said that the virus spreads primarily by inhalation, deposition and touching. The CDC advisory says when one inhales the air carrying very small fine droplets or aerosol particles containing the virus, one gets infected.It highlights that the risk of transmission is greatest within three to six feet of an infected person as the amount of these droplets are very fine in nature. It said that these droplets spread through exhalation during activities such as quiet breathing, speaking, singing, exercise, coughing, sneezing and transmitting the infection.This means that in enclosed spaces or areas which are poorly ventilated there are increased chances of this disease spreading from one person to another. The CDC also pointed out that large droplets are not concerning as they disperse within seconds but fine droplets and aerosol particles which are formed when these droplets dry up can remain suspended for at least 30 minutes to 1 hour.Two medical health experts dealing with the Covid-19 second wave also told HT recently that being airborne does not mean that the virus is out there in the air.“Airborne does not mean it is in the air and wherever you are you can catch it. If there is Covid-19 positive person in a small room or an enclosed space which lacks ventilation and the person coughs, the aerosol remains suspended in the air for 30 minutes to 1 hour,” Dr Rommel Tickoo of Max Healthcare told HT on Friday.Another expert, Dr Ambarish Satwik, who is a vascular and endovascular surgeon at Sir Ganga Ram Hospital, said that one can imagine these aerosols as smoke cloud emanated from a person smoking. “If someone is smoking a cigarette in a corner of a large room, then you can smell the cigarette smoke standing in another corner of the room. This is how the virus is currently behaving. It is dissipating from one part of the room to another and if one person is infected in that room, it is likely that others sharing the same space will get infected if they are unmasked. Even if you enter a room where a person had smoked a cigarette an hour earlier, you still get the smell, so that is also another example of how the virus is behaving.”Both doctors also highlighted that people are still unaware of how to wear a mask properly. They also said that people are often surprised regarding how they contracted the virus. “Half the people do not know how to wear a mask, they think they have done whatever it takes but they go out for groceries or to the pharmacy, they meet people and they tend to fiddle with the mask and that is how they get it. It is not airborne to the extent that wherever you go you catch the virus,” Tickoo further added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/how-airborne-is-covid-19-like-cigarette-smoke-spreading-in-a-room-says-expert-101620476402795.html
08-05-2021||India||India surviving on system created by Nehru, Indira Gandhi: Shiv Sena editorial||In a hard-hitting editorial in its mouthpiece 'Saamana', the Shiv Sena on Saturday criticised the Modi government for "failing" to handle the Covid-19 pandemic situation of the country. At a time when India is trying to become 'Aatmanirbhar', it has to seek help from smaller countries like Nepal, Sri Lanka, the editorial said."In clear terms, India is surviving on the system created by Nehru-Gandhi. Many poor countries are offering help to India. Earlier, countries like Pakistan, Rwanda and Congo used to get help from others. But due to the wrong policies of today's rulers, India is going through that situation now," it said, as reported by news agency PTI.PM Modi speaks to Maharashtra CM Thackeray over Covid-19 situation in state"The country is presently surviving thanks to the development works, projects set up by and the confidence given by the previous governments of Pandit Nehru, (Lal Bahadur) Shastri, Indira Gandhi, Rajiv Gandhi, P V Narasimha Rao, Manmohan Singh," it said.The editorial also mentioned the government Central Vista project, the work of which is going on amid the pandemic as it has been declared an essential service. Talking about the global pandemic situation, the Sena said that the world now fears India as India has left the US and Brazil far behind. "A sensitive and a nationalist government would not have thought about the political pros and cons and set up a national panel of all main political parties to discuss ways to defeat the pandemic...The prime minister will have to do a lot of hard work and think of non-political nationalism to help the country come out of the pandemic," it said.Maharashtra has been hit the hardest in both the waves of the Covid-19 pandemic. Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday spoke to Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray and praised the state's ongoing effort to contain the spread of the virus.As the state has been the frontrunner in vaccinating the maximum number of people, chief minister Uddhav Thackeray earlier wrote to PM Modi seeking permission to set up a separate portal for vaccination like Co-Win so that the load can be shared.(With PTI inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-surviving-on-system-created-by-nehru-indira-gandhi-shiv-sena-editorial-101620479678474.html

Therefore, every officer concerned should ensure that special vigilance is kept on every village and for this, a massive Covid-19 screening campaign should be conducted,” the CM told officials at a review meeting.He said a special awareness campaign-cum-counselling of rural inhabitants should be done and for this officers of Health Department, along with accredited social health activists (ASHAs), former and present public representatives in each village have to play a key role.“Further strengthening of medical infrastructure along with ramping up Covid-19 management preparations coupled with aggressive surveillance, stringent containment, focused clinical management should also be done in every village on a priority basis," directed the chief minister.Khattar directed that about 8,000 multidisciplinary teams led by trainee doctors, including Health Department officials, ASHAs and Anganwadi workers should be constituted across the state for the door-to-door screening in villages.“If during the screening camps, any person is found having Covid-like symptoms, then the person should be advised to stay in home isolation immediately so as to prevent the possibility of the infection spread. Approximately one team per 500 households should be deployed for conducting the health screening,” said Khattar.He said while conducting the screening, the multidisciplinary teams should ensure that the patients having mild and moderate symptoms are immediately given preventive medicines.Besides, it should also be ensured that those having severe symptoms are immediately hospitalised, he added.The chief minister said since the infection is spreading fast in rural areas, screening camps focusing on “test, track and treat” should be held.Besides, the Health Department has also been directed to impart necessary training to people in villages so that they can spread the required awareness against the disease, he added.“Awareness campaigns along with proactive information education and communication (IEC) activities, especially in rural areas, should be started,” he said.The chief minister directed that the possibility of converting dharamshalas and government schools into isolation centres should be explored at the earliest.He said if the patient rush in the Covid care centres and hospital increases, then the dharamshalas and government schools having required medical facilities to treat the Covid-19 patients can be utilised.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/haryana-govt-to-launch-door-to-door-covid-19-screening-drive-for-villages-101620478981396.html
08-05-2021||India||What does CT value in RT-PCR report mean? Doctor explains||Amid the ongoing second wave of the pandemic, as states are conducting a higher number of Rt-PCR tests, people are now aware of a new term, called CT value, a score written on the RT-PCR report, if the outcome of the test is positive. According to ICMR documents, CT value is the cycle threshold value, which is "inversely proportional" to viral load, which means the lower the number higher the viral load and vice versa. But the value can differ from one kit to another and the viral load does not have much role in patient management, the ICMR has said.#कोरोना जांच में सीटी वैल्यू 28 होने का क्या अर्थ है ?#IndiaFightsCOVID19 | #Unite2FightCorona @PIB_India | @MIB_India | @PrakashJavdekar | @shashidigital pic.twitter.com/SWWaEgbocXDr Hemant Deshmukh of Mumbai's King Edward Memorial Hospital has said if the value is over 35, then it is considered a negative result and when the value is below negative, the result is considered positive. The number suggests the number of cycle after which the virus has been detected. So in general, if the CT Score is, for example, 20, it means the virus is spotted in 20 cycles, thus implying that the load is higher than a score, for example, 30.'1 CT scan is equivalent to 300 chest X-rays', Guleria warns against risk of cancer"But whatever the value is, be it 10 or 28, an infected person can spread the virus," Dr Deshmukh said.What is CT Scan score?कोविड में सीटी स्कैन को कैसे समझें ?#IndiaFightsCOVID19 | #Unite2FightCorona @PIB_India | @MIB_India | @PrakashJavdekar | @shashidigital pic.twitter.com/Ej0vTBp2AhDr Deshmukh said doctors may advise CT Scan if a patient does not get cured of fever or cough after medicine. A CT scan score of 5 out of 25 is considered normal. "If the score is more than that, then the doctor may advise to get hospitalised. But sometimes, even if a patient has a higher CT Scan score, he or she may not have any inconvenience. "Nowadays people are googling a lot and becoming doctors themselves. But regarding CT scan, one should take the doctor's advice," Dr Deshmukh said.AIIMS chief Randeep Guleria recently said Covid-19 patients should not rush for CT scan as it increases the risk of cancer. One CT scan is equivalent to 300 to 400 chest x-rays, Dr Guleria said adding that people with mild covid-19 and normal oxygen saturation should not do CT scan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/what-does-ct-value-in-rt-pcr-report-mean-doctor-explains-101620476310089.html

Many states are closing the entry of residents of other states. We have also decided to impose strict lockdown in the state from Monday. This time, the infection is spreading at a rapid pace in rural areas and among the youth.” In another tweet, he said, “To control this infection, a strict lockdown will be in force for 15 days across the state from Monday. It is the duty of all of us to uphold our civic responsibilities and fully abide by this lockdown so that Rajasthan can be saved from the pandemic.” Gehlot said Rajasthan is in a better position than other states. “If you support the government, we will be able to beat Corona as soon as possible.” On May 6, in view of a surge in Covid19 cases, the Rajasthan government announced a lockdown from May 10 till May 24, and a ban on marriages till May 31.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ashok-gehlot-calls-for-decision-on-lockdown-at-central-level-101620475028214.html

Apart from everything else, an EU-India agreement would send a powerful signal to the world in support of the benefits of international trade cooperation,” it added.Modi and Costa said a similar rationale applies to investment, and the “negotiation of an EU wide investment protection framework would provide greater stability and certainty to companies from India and EU to expand their presence in each other’s markets”.They noted that EU-India relations have always been marked by mutual support and solidarity, and this was evident during the coronavirus pandemic when both sides supported each other and the rest of the world. “India extended medical supplies to Europe earlier and now the EU has extended assistance to India as it experiences a second wave of Covid-19,” the article said.The summit will be “crucial to rebalancing relations between the EU and the Indo-Pacific”, and it is key for both sides to “reaffirm our firm belief in democracy, rule of law, tolerance and the universality and indivisibility of human rights”, the leaders wrote.“We must seize this opportunity to elevate our relationship, using the huge potential of our democratic spaces to advance trade and investment ties and to support effective multilateralism and a rules-based order,” the article said.The summit is also a chance to expand cooperation in new areas for the development of societies and economies, such as the digital transition, connectivity, mobility, health, the energy transition and climate action, it added.The EU is India’s biggest trading partner and the second-largest destination for Indian exports. Trade between the two sides increased 72% in the last decade and the EU is the leading foreign investor in India. Some 6,000 European companies are present in India, generating 1.7 million direct and five million indirect jobs.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-portuguese-counterpart-underline-significance-of-india-eu-summit-101620466447607.html

The ministry took the decision to ensure that no patient is denied adequate medical care as the nation fights a severe second wave of Covid-19. The health ministry in a statement also reiterated that admission to the patient should not refused at any count even if the patient belongs to a different city and adequate medical arrangements, such as oxygen or essential drugs, should be administered to the patient. The health ministry said that a suspect case of Covid-19 should be kept in the suspect ward of the Covid-19 Care Center (CCC), Dedicated Covid-19 Health Centre (DCHC) or Dedicated Covid-19 Hospital (DCH). It also asked hospitals to not demand valid identity card that does not belong to the city where the hospital is located for admitting the patient. "Admissions to hospital must be based on need. It should be ensured that beds are not occupied by persons who do not need hospitalization," the statement said. The statement said that these new rules are applicable to all government as well as private hospitals. "This patient-centric measure aims to ensure prompt, effective and comprehensive treatment of patients suffering from Covid-19," the statement said. The ministry has asked chief secretaries of states and Union Territories to issue necessary orders and circulars and asked them to implement the new rules within the next three days. India which is facing a severe second wave recorded more than 4 lakh cases on Saturday which pushed the case tally to 21.89 million.

The video has since attracted over 280,000 views."I saw it on my Facebook page during my lunch break after my friends shared (the clip) with me," The Straits Times quoted him as saying.On Wednesday, the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) posted on Facebook that Assurance, Care and Engagement (Ace) Group officers had tracked down the foreign worker by pinpointing the location using the video. They then handed him a token of appreciation.The Ace Group, which was set up late last year as a division under the ministry, frequently hands out such goody bags to foreign workers involved in helping others.When asked what he did with his reward, Gunasekaran said: "I shared them with my friends."He added that his mother, father and brother and relatives back home were proud of him after watching the video.While accompanying the elderly man had made the Indian national late for work, he said he would gladly do it again."Since I was young, my parents taught me to help people with disabilities. Everyone in my family is like that," he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/indian-national-wins-hearts-for-helping-visually-impaired-man-in-singapore-101620464521620.html

In his three-line tweet, he said he would continue as a soldier of the BJP to restore West Bengal's democracy. Concoctions and conjectures (of Mukul Roy attempting to come back to the Trinamool Congress) can be put to rest, he said."My fight would continue as a soldier of BJP to restore democracy in our state. I would request everyone to put the concoctions and conjectures to rest. I am resolute in my political path," Mukul Roy wrote, dousing speculations that were doing the rounds in the political circle of West Bengal after Trinamool won 213 seats in the 294-member Assembly election.Reacting to the assertion of his commitment to the party, BJP president JP Nadda said Mukul Roy's statement is an example for all BJP workers. मुकुल राय जी का यह बयान बहुत ही सराहनीय है।यह वक्तव्य सभी का मार्गदर्शन करने वाले और सभी भाजपा कार्यकर्ताओं के लिए अनुकरणीय है। https://t.co/2TdxrGucRaMamata says Centre's inactivity over past 6 months led to current Covid crisisMy fight would continue as a soldier of BJP to restore democracy in our state.

Roy who was the number 2 in the Trinamool Congress for a long time left the party in 2017 and was credited for BJP's performance in Lok Sabha Elections 2019.At Friday's meeting of the new BJP members in the Assembly, both Mukul Roy and Suvendu Adhikari were missing, though both of them were present at the Assembly as they took oath as MLAs. The speculation of Mukul Roy engaging in parleys with Trinamool leaders got triggered after Roy reportedly exchanged pleasantries with Trinamool's Subrata Bakshi. Mukul Roy, though considered a tall leader of the BJP in Bengal, has so far not commented on BJP's performance in the Assembly election.

08-05-2021||India||Covid-19: Gujarat govt urges Centre to raise oxygen allocation to state||The Gujarat government has requested the Centre to raise to 1,400 metric tonnes the allocation of medical oxygen to the state by May 12, saying that due to the shortage of the life-saving gas, it was unable to operationalise 11,500 additional beds for Covid-19 patients.It said that the Centre's current allocation of 975 metric tonnes (MT) is way below the requirements of the state."The Government of India has not increased the allocation of (medical oxygen to) Gujarat beyond 975 MT, which is creating tremendous distress to the patients seeking hospitalisation and oxygen therapy, resulting in denial of medical treatment to needy despite availability of beds and qualified personnel in hospitals," Gujarat chief secretary Anil Mukim said in a letter to Union home Secretary Ajay Kumar Bhalla.The letter written on May 6 was annexed to an affidavit that the state government filed on Friday in the Supreme Court, which was hearing a suo motu PIL on issues related to Covid-19.There is an immediate demand of 1,190 MT liquid medical oxygen in Gujarat, Mukim said.The total number of oxygen beds (in the state) have gone up from 53,913 on April 26, when the additional allocation was sought, to 57,368, due to an increase in Covid-19 cases, the letter said.Accordingly, Gujarat's requirement of medical oxygen has gone up from projected 1,250 MT (as on April 30), to 1,400 MT for today (May 6) and is likely to increase to 1,600 tons by May 15, Mukim said in the letter.Despite mobilising additional oxygen from all ASU/PSA plants, etc, the state is not able to meet the rising demand for oxygen and as a consequence, is not able to operationalise additional 11,500 beds, created with oxygen line, just for want of oxygen, he added.This is causing tremendous distress in rural areas, because now the COVID-19 cases are picking up there and yet, hospitalisation with oxygen therapy is not available resulting in long wait before the hospital admission, the letter said."Under these circumstances, I request you to immediately enhance allocation of medical liquid oxygen under central allocation to Gujarat to 1,200 MT for today (May 6) and 1,400 MT for May 12," Mukim said.Meanwhile, in the same affidavit, the state government said that it has administered 2,24,749 doses of Covid-19 vaccine to 18-44 age group till May 5, and orders have been placed for two crore doses of Covishield from Serum Institute of India in Pune, and 50 lakh doses of Covaxin from Bharat Biotech in Hyderabad on April 25 for that purpose.As far as timeline for vaccination of the 18-44 age group is concerned, it depends on the availability of the vaccines, it said.The state is maintaining continuous contact and follow-ups with the manufacturers for the early supply of vaccines, it said.For people above the age of 45, as total of 3,95,920 doses of Covishield and 2,00,490 doses of Covaxin are available, the government said.In terms of bed availability for Covid-19 patients, there were 1,05,701 beds across 2,446 institutions as on May 6, out of which 59,186 are oxygen beds and 13,733 are ICU beds. There are 6,407 ventilators in Gujarat.The number of beds was 42,000 in the first week of April, it said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid19-gujarat-govt-urges-centre-to-raise-oxygen-allocation-to-state-101620463501727.html
08-05-2021||India||DCGI gives emergency approval of DRDO-developed anti-Covid oral drug||The Institute of Nuclear Medicine and Allied Sciences (Inmas) in collaboration with Dr Reddy’s Laboratories, Hyderabad, developed an anti-Covid-19 therapeutic application of the drug 2-deoxy-D-glucose (2-DG). The third phase of the clinical trial results have shown that this molecule helps in faster recovery of hospitalised patients and reduces supplemental oxygen dependence. Higher proportion of patients treated with 2-DG showed RT-PCR negative conversion in patients infected with coronavirus.Responding to Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s call for preparedness against the pandemic, the DRDO took the initiative of developing anti-Covid therapeutic application of 2-DG. In April 2020, when the first wave of pandemic struck India, scientists at DRDO's laboratory, Inmas, conducted experiments with the help of Hyderabad-based Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology (CCMB) and found that this molecule works effectively against SARS-CoV-2 virus and inhibits the viral growth. Based on these results, Drugs Controller General of India’s (DCGI) Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation (CDSCO) permitted Phase-II clinical trial of 2-DG in Covid-19 patients in May 2020.DRDO along with its industry partner Dr Reddy’s Laboratories started the clinical trials to test the safety and efficacy of the drug in Covid-19 patients."In Phase-II trials (including dose ranging) conducted between May and October 2020, the drug was found to be safe in Covid-19 patients, and showed significant improvement in their recovery. Phase IIa was conducted in 6 hospitals and Phase IIb (dose ranging) clinical trial was conducted at 11 hospitals all over the country. Phase-II trial was conducted on 110 patients. In efficacy trends, the patients treated with 2-DG showed faster symptomatic cure than Standard of Care (SoC) on various endpoints. A significantly favourable trend (2.5 days difference) was seen in terms of the median time to achieving normalization of specific vital signs parameters when compared to SOC," a top DRDO official said on Saturday.The official further said that based on successful results, the DCGI then permitted the phase III of clinical trials in November 2020. It was conducted on 220 patients between December 2020 and March 2021 at 27 Covid-19 hospitals across Delhi, Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal, Gujarat, Rajasthan, Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu."The detailed data of phase-III clinical trial was presented to DCGI. In 2-DG arm significantly higher proportion of patients improved symptomatically and became free from supplemental oxygen dependence (42% vs 31%) by Day-3 in comparison to SOC, indicating an early relief from Oxygen therapy/dependence. The similar trend was observed in patients more than 65 years also," the DRDO official said.The DCGI had on May 1 granted permission for emergency use of the drug as adjunct therapy in moderate to severe Covid-19 patients. Being a generic molecule and analogue of glucose, it can be easily produced and made available in plenty in the country, the DRDO said.The drug comes in sachet in the form of powder which is taken orally by dissolving it in water. It accumulates in the virus-infected cells and prevents virus growth by stopping viral synthesis and energy production. The selective accumulation in virally infected cells makes this drug unique.At a time when the second wave of the coronavirus pandemic hammers the country and a large number of patients are requiring severe oxygen dependency and hospitalisation, the drug is expected to save precious lives due to the mechanism of operation of the drug in infected cells. This also reduces the hospital stay of Covid-19 patients and burden on health infrastructure of the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/dcgi-gives-emergency-approval-of-drdo-developed-anti-covid-oral-drug-101620461286695.html

The veteran leader demanded that the Centre should urgently call an all-party meeting to discuss the pandemic situation.The nation is sinking under the weight of the Modi govt’s indifference & incompetence. This is a time for us to steel ourselves & rededicate ourselves in the service of our people.- Congress President Smt. Sonia Gandhi at the Congress Parliamentary Party Meeting#COVID19India pic.twitter.com/3cJAQIuhPkWhile addressing the Congress Parliamentary Party meeting, Sonia Gandhi criticised the NDA government at the Centre and said that "India is crippled by a political leadership today that has no empathy for the people".On Friday, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi where he said that a national lockdown had become "almost inevitable as the Covid tsunami continues to ravage the country unabated." He pointed out that "allowing" the uncontrollable spread of the coronavirus would be devastating not only for India but also for the world.On Sunday, India witnessed the highest single-day spike in Covid-19 deaths at 4,187 while the new cases remained above the 400,000-mark for a third straight day at 401,078, taking the cumulative number of cases in the country 2,18,92,676.Meanwhile, speaking about Congress's performance in the assembly polls, Sonia Gandhi said it was "very disappointing" and said the party "must learn appropriate lesson" from the setback in the spirit of humility and honesty.Congress suffered humiliating defeats in Assam and could not open its account in West Bengal, where it had won over 44 seats in 2016 polls. The party could win only two seats in Puducherry where it was in power about two months back.Only in Tamil Nadu, the party was able to put up a good performance as part of the DMK-led alliance which swept power defeating the AIADMK-led alliance.The Congress-led alliance was the main challenger to the ruling BJP-led NDA in Assam and Congress-led UDF to the ruling Left Democratic Front in Kerala. While the NDA returned to power in Assam, the LDF returned to power in Kerala.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/congress-top-brass-to-meet-on-may-10-to-discuss-poll-result-covid-situation-101620457161476.html

The two officers had already recovered from Covid-19 infection and the entire delegation boarded the flight to London with negative RT-PCR report including minister Jaishankar. Even at the airport, the rapid antigen of all the delegates came negative but an RT-PCR of two officers showed positive before the G-7 meeting on May 5.While Jaishankar decided to move virtual after the positivity report, and British Prime Minister Boris Johnson personally thanked him for that, the second RT-PCR report of the two officers came negative.

08-05-2021||India||US govt doing everything it can to help India fight Covid-19: Official||The US government is making all the efforts to help India in this hour of crisis, a senior State Department official has said.In the last one week, six air shipments of vital assistance have landed in India, which is battling the second wave of the coronavirus pandemic, Senior Advisor Ervin Massinga from the Bureau of South and Central Asian Affairs said on Friday.These flights included health supplies such as oxygen concentrators, N95 masks, rapid diagnostic tests and medicines. US assistance is expected to be about USD 100 million, he said."The entire US government – from President Biden to our team at the Embassy and consulates on the ground – is doing everything we can to help India," Massinga said during an event called "Bolstering US Covid Relief Efforts in India: Perspectives from the Diaspora"."We are bringing to bear the strength, innovation, and unique capabilities of the American people to assist those suffering in India. And we recognise that the pandemic will not be over for anyone until it is over for everyone,” he said.Massinga referred to the recent remarks of US President Joe Biden when he told Prime Minister Narendra Modi that his government will do everything possible to help India at this time.Biden's discussion with Modi last week marks their fourth conversation in the administration’s first 100 days.Secretary of State Tony Blinken and other senior Department officials have also been regularly engaged with their Indian counterparts to address the most recent coronavirus wave, Massinga said."In my 26 years with the Department of State, I have never seen such an outpouring of personal and institutional generosity as we have experienced from the Americans of all backgrounds in the last month. The level of focus and dedication from private sector, civil society and community-based organisations, including contributions from Indian-Americans, has contributed to ensuring much needed supplies and resources get to those most in need,” he said.USAID Deputy Assistant Administrator for Asia Anjali Kaur said the whole-of-US government response has been immediate, targeted to India’s evolving needs and informed by nonstop consultations with their Indian counterparts and a multitude of other stakeholders.Kaur said the US has mobilised its partners in India to immediately expand existing programs to meet urgent needs."For instance, as hospitals across the country ran out of oxygen and related supplies, within days of receiving a request from the Government of India, the USAID quickly mobilised funding to purchase 1,000 oxygen concentrators. These life-saving units, with a lifespan of more than five years, will provide oxygen to hundreds of primary health care facilities,” she said."The USAID is also supporting the Government of India’s efforts to establish 150 Pressure Swing Adsorption oxygen generating plants, which will allow 150 healthcare facilities to generate their own oxygen, rather than rely on oxygen deliveries,” she addedThe USAID, she said, has received an overwhelming response from both US and Indian companies, as well as the Indian diaspora.Even individual states, such as California, have responded by partnering with USAID to facilitate a donation of life-saving oxygen supplies, Kaur said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/us-govt-doing-everything-it-can-to-help-india-fight-covid-19-official-101620439288074.html

As per the latest genome sequencing data shared by Indian labs with the global repository GISAID - B.1.617.1 and B.1.617.2 accounted for 58% of all samples submitted in the last 30 days.The B.1.617.2 is one of three lineages of the B.1.617 variant that is expanding its footprint in India, with experts fearing it may be behind the relentless surge in cases that has crushed the country’s health care system.Public Health England on Friday announced it has found B.1.617.2 to have spread in Britain in a way similar to the early days of B.1.1.7, which is now known as the UK variant.Cases of the B.1.617.2 variant increased to 520 from 202 over the last week, PHE said, mainly in London and the northwest town of Bolton, with almost half the cases related to contact with a traveller.“I think we’ve got to be very careful about that,” UK PM Boris Johnson told reporters, in reference to the variant, Reuters reported. “We’re doing a huge amount, obviously, to make sure that when we do find outbreaks of the Indian variant that we do surge testing, that we do door-to-door testing.”PHE cited evidence that it spreads more quickly than the original version of the virus and could spread as quickly as the B.1.1.7.“There is currently insufficient evidence to indicate that any of the variants recently detected in India cause more severe disease or render the vaccines currently deployed any less effective,” PHE said in a statement.According to an analysis of GISAID genome sequencing data on outbreak.info, Bihar, Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand have reported high numbers of the B.1.617.2 variant, with Bihar also reporting several samples with B.1.617.1.This analysis, to be sure, is based on the data uploaded to GISAID, and may not reflect the entire scale of the outbreak or how these variants are displacing others.The original variant first seen in India, B.1.617, was first detected in October, but PHE as well as Indian experts have categorised three different subtypes, all with slightly different mutations.Other variants of concern include variants first identified in Kent, southeast England, as well as South Africa and Brazil.The B.1.617 has also been classified as a VOC and the Union health ministry on Wednesday said the variant was found in 1,504 samples that were sequenced, compared to 1,391 samples that showed the UK variant.The fresh clues will have several implications for India: a variant that is more transmissible will require stricter curbs such as lockdowns for containment and countries are likely to keep arrivals from India suspended until the outbreak is controlled.But to understand more of how it has behaved, experts have urged Indian authorities to release details of when and where samples with the variant was found, which could help determine if it is indeed displacing other variants.Experts said the UK data confirmed the B.1.617.2 may be fitter. “The rate of growth of B.1.617.2 against B.1.1.7 seems to be similar to the rate at which B.1.1.7 replaced the previous variant. This means relative fitness of B.1.617.2 vs B.1.1.7 may be similar to the relative fitness of B.1.1.7 vs previous variants,” said Deepti Gurdasani, an epidemiologist Queen Mary University of London, in a tweet.“This is concerning because we have seen how quickly a new more transmissible variant can change the shape of the pandemic and how quickly these can spread. Currently, B.1.617.2 appears to be doubling every week, so it may become dominant in some parts of the UK in 2-4 weeks,” she added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/variant-of-concern-uk-raises-vigil-on-india-linked-mutations-101620435497724.html
08-05-2021||India||Modi govt firm to help West Bengal fight Covid-19: Health minister Harsh Vardhan to Mamata Banerjee||With West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee seeking a uniform vaccination policy for the country, Union Health Minister Harsh Vardhan on Friday assured her that the Modi government was firm in its resolve to help the state fight the Covid-19 pandemic, but also flagged more than 40 per cent positivity rate in some districts of the state.In a four-page letter addressed to her and posted on his Twitter timeline, Vardhan congratulated Banerjee for her victory in the recently held assembly elections and also asked her to focus on conducting more tests to detect infections in the state.Referring to her letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi on "further requirements for Covid-19 management in West Bengal", the minister said the Centre has been supporting each and every state "not just financially, but also through requisite diagnostics, therapeutics, medical devices and other essential materials and services".He further flagged a high positivity rate of over 40 per cent in some districts of West Bengal and asserted that testing needed to be significantly ramped up."Similarly, we will need to augment the health infrastructure in the state significantly," he wrote.The letter came on a day when the West Bengal government moved the Supreme Court seeking directions to disband Phase-III vaccine policy of the Centre and adoption of a uniform policy of procuring 100 per cent doses of Covid-19 from vaccine manufacturers for equitable distribution to all the states and Union territories for free decentralised distribution.The state government also sought setting aside the differential pricing mechanism for Covid-19 vaccines and capping the price for the vaccines at a uniform price of ₹150 per dose.The plea in the apex court followed letters written by Banerjee to Modi on various requirements listed by her for fighting the Covid-19 pandemic.Vardhan, in his letter, also said that the objective of the Covid vaccination program launched by the central government is to ensure that all citizens of the country are covered eventually, dividing them into priority age groups based on their vulnerability and mortality risk."In accordance with the demand raised by the states, the New Liberalized Pricing and Accelerated National Covid-19 Vaccination Strategy, which has just kicked off, decentralises the process and incentivises the manufacturers to produce more. Equally, it encourages off-shore vaccine manufacturers to bring their vaccines into our country, thereby increasing the overall availability of the vaccines in India," the letter stated.He said the Centre will continue to provide Covid-19 vaccine free to all the states/UTs, including West Bengal, for coverage of healthcare workers, frontline workers and persons above 45 years of age calculated on the basis of the average consumption of the state.As on date, West Bengal has been provided a total of 1,18,83,340 vaccine doses. Further 2,00,000 vaccine doses are in the pipeline for immediate supply, he said.Based on the monthly production of vaccine manufacturers and Central Drugs Laboratory cleared doses projected to be available with the vaccine manufacturers, the quantity of doses available for "other than Government of India channel" was worked out on state-wise population of 18 to 44 years pro-rata.The Union health ministry has so far provided West Bengal with 18.38 lakh N95 masks, 4.84 lakh PPE kits, 1,245 ventilators and 43.5 lakh Hydroxychloroquine tablets for management of Covid-19 pandemic, Vardhan pointed out.As many as five Pressure Swing Adsorption (PSA) plants have been sanctioned for the state, out of which, two have already been installed and made functional. Similarly, 849 D-Type and 1504 B-Type oxygen cylinders have been allocated to West Bengal. Out of this, 700 will be delivered on or before May 21. This entire support has been provided free of cost, he said.Vardhan added that as many as 94,400 vials of Remdesivir have, accordingly, been allocated to West Bengal for the period April 21 to May 9. The Centre has, in addition, delivered another 3,686 and 4,402 vials of Remdesivir in two tranches between May 4 and May 5, he said.“Meanwhile, all steps are being taken to ensure increased availability of domestic Remdesivir in the country. On the Tocilizumab front, the Union government is making all efforts for equitable availability across the country, based on the active case load in each state,” read the letter.Apart from the delivery of essential medical devices and drugs, West Bengal has been supported with a financial grant of ₹295.28 crore under the Covid-19 package, it said.Vardhan also highlighted that West Bengal has been allocated 308 MT of oxygen to meet the demand of oxygen from April 25 onwards."In this regard, we had allocated the maximum possible amount to West Bengal at the time of the issue of the aforesaid order. Once the allocations are made, states are required to lift the allocated quantities from the assigned manufacturers," he said.“… orders for oxygen cylinders have been placed for an additional 1,27,000 cylinders on April 21. The said procurement includes 54,000 jumbo cylinders (D type) as well as 73,000 regular cylinders (B type). Under this initiative, a tentative allocation for West Bengal is 849 D-Type and 1504 B-Type cylinders. Out of this, 700 cylinders will be delivered to the state on or before May 21,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/modi-govt-firm-to-help-west-bengal-fight-covid-19-health-minister-harsh-vardhan-to-mamata-banerjee-101620432008660.html

Cost of Central Vista is about ₹20,000 crore, over several years. GoI has allocated nearly twice that amount for vaccination! India’s healthcare budget for just this year was over ₹3 lakh crore. We know our priorities. There are hundreds of projects being executed by various depts. Governance hasn’t come to a standstill, unlike the Congress’s times of policy paralysis,” Puri tweeted.Also read | Consider urgent hearing of plea against Central Vista project: SC tells Delhi HCThe minister’s tweet came hours after Congress MP Rahul Gandhi criticised the Modi government for executing the project, terming it a “criminal wastage”, while asking the dispensation to focus on people’s lives during the pandemic.“Central Vista is just another ongoing project. It’s only the Congress that’s obsessed about it, nobody else. Moreover, only projects for New Parliament Building & rejuvenation of Central Vista Avenue have been awarded at an estimated cost of ₹862 crore & ₹477 crore respectively till now,” Puri added in a series of tweets.Earlier this week, the proposal for the new Vice President’s estate, and Prime Minister’s house were granted environment clearance by the environment ministry’s expert appraisal committee (EAC). The overall cost of project, which also includes a common Central Secretariat, has been estimated at ₹13,450 crore.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/opposition-discourse-against-central-vista-bizarre-says-minister-hardeep-puri-101620424662687.html
08-05-2021||India||Patent waivers alone may not lead to quick vaccine access, say experts||The waiving off of patents alone is unlikely to help improve vaccine availability anytime soon, scientists, legal experts and pharma industry executives said, pointing to the complicated technical know-how, raw materials and infrastructure required to make vaccines while ensuring they are as safe and effective as the original developer intended it to be.Several countries, including the US, France and the European Union are considering backing efforts by low and middle-income countries such as India and South Africa for a global waiver of coronavirus vaccine patents in order to boost supplies.While such a move could well be the first step in helping broaden access, patents alone do little to allow someone else to make biological therapeutics such as vaccines, unlike in the case of generic drugs, which are chemicals and can be replicated more easily with a recipe book of sorts.“Patents are a way of protection of your intellectual and commercial information, speaking from a legal point of view. But just by reading a patent, does not necessarily offer the ability to replicate the product or the process, because while a patent does share a lot of the generic information, it protects the specifics, and it is not a self-guide,” said Prabuddha Kundu, co-founder and managing director at Premas Biotech, which is working on an oral Covid-19 vaccine.To understand the challenge, consider the case of some coronavirus vaccines: AstraZeneca and J&J’s vaccines involve a bio-engineered adenovirus that expresses the Sars-Cov-2’s spike protein; Novavax’s vaccine consists directly of the spike protein that has been cultured and grown in moth cells in labs.“A chemical entity and a biological entity are very different. Even a simple protein, for example, is hundred times more complex or has more components than a drug like, say, paracetamol. There can be many ways to make paracetamol, and it would turn out to be exactly that but even if there were few ways to produce the protein, the final product varies in its final shape and form,” added Kundu, who is a biomedical engineer by training and specialises in scaling up.And for that, he added, “you must understand the process so well, that every time you carry it out, you end up with exactly the same product. In many situations in biologics, the process is the product. So when patents are filed for a product or part of the process, it is to protect the geographical rights or commercial interest but in no way are we being provided with a to -do guide for how to do it”.Legal experts in the pharma field said this constitutes know-how, which often is a trade secret. “There is a clear divide between a patent and a trade secret. The technical know-how is proprietary. TRIPS provides for protection of undisclosed information, which would not be found in patents,” said Dev Robinson, partner and head, Intellectual Property, at Shardul Amarchand Mangaldas.Also read | India to seek EU support on vaccine patent waiverTRIPS refers to the Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights agreement under the World Trade Organization (WTO), the specific framework that India and South Africa have sought waivers under – which has been backed by the United States and France as on May 6.In an interview with HT published on March 26, Cipla chairman Yusuf Hamied too called vaccines “a different ballgame”, and said producing these was different from what the company did with an HIV drug in early 2000s, when it offered it to the world at a fraction of the cost.“All drugs required for HIV-AIDS were synthetic drugs, and in the synthesis of drugs, India, even at that time, was quite proficient. But vaccines are a different ballgame. You can pick up a patent of a vaccine manufacturer, and you still won’t be able to produce,” he said.The conversation around patents has been in the spotlight as the world struggles to make access to vaccine equitable. The wealthiest 27 regions in the world account for 10.5% of the population, but 35.6% of vaccinations, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.Robinson added that securing a patent waiver in itself will be a long process and may do little to make the know-how available quickly. “How you can get private companies to part with trade secrets under changes to TRIPS agreement in the immediate future? I don’t know. The TRIPS agreement is still a treaty at the end of the day – what you have to do is get every member to agree, or at least by majority, to have it adopted.“Then each of these countries or the country of interest will have to take it back to their local legislative bodies where they will have to turn it into a municipal law, only then will it become enforceable against a private party. It doesn’t happen overnight. Historically, it has taken years to get this thing done,” he said, adding that a short term solution may “therefore lie in getting the cooperation of the private players to part with their know-how and to not assert their IPRs”.Analysts said the production of coronavirus vaccines till now has demonstrated the complicated challenges that these processes involve, and they are particularly harder for breakthrough technologies like the mRNA platform.“There is a very big difference between vaccines and medicines. For vaccines, ingredients, formula etc are very important but equally important are the production and quality setup and the personnel needed to oversee that. We have actually seen where the number of staff required for quality checks is in a 10:1 ratio because it is a biological product,” said Rasmus Bech Hansen, CEO of London-based science analytics company Airfinity.With Covid-19 vaccines, Hansen added, “you could argue that yes freeing patents would make sense but as we have seen with vaccine production, that really does not seem to be the bottleneck – it’s not so much the number of facilities but the ability for them to produce vaccines and the quality that has mattered”.A second Airfinity analyst cited some examples. “Till now, we have seen more production from fewer sites than the other way around – mostly due to difficulties in setting up. For example, AstraZeneca set up plenty of sites all around the world, some of which we haven’t seen open up yet – for example, there are sites in Australia and Europe have been behind schedule,” said Caroline Casey.Kundu agreed with the assessments. “The analysts are right in saying that not only do you need duly trained manpower who should have done this before, but you need adequate equipment, tools and critical reagents to tell, if you are on the right path or not,” he added.Kundu said that patents can also involve other patents, or a family of patents, complicating efforts to wade past licensing restrictions, as well as a principle known as freedom to operate (FTO) for any recipient of a patent to have the legitimate rights to commercialise a product that is created using a wide variety of components, that may involve other proprietary components.“That said, opening of IP can be beneficial on the long run to cater to a global crisis. The nuts and bolts have to be worked out,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/patent-waivers-alone-may-not-lead-to-quick-vaccine-access-say-experts-101620422052701.html

A total of 401,358 new infections were reported on Friday, taking the cumulative number of confirmed cases in India to 21,886,256, according to HT’s dashboard. The highest ever single-day death toll was reported in the US on January 12, when it reported 4,490 fatalities.While some of the areas that were among the first to be hit by the second wave -- such as Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Telangana and Delhi -- appear to be seeing a stabilisation in new Covid-19 cases, deaths continue to remain high.Of Friday’s 4,192 deaths, Maharashtra recorded 898, the highest among all states and Union territories, followed by Karnataka (592), Uttar Pradesh (372), Delhi (341), and Chhattisgarh (208). The 592 deaths in Karnataka were an 80% increase from Thursday’s toll of 328, the highest jump among all major states.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/daily-deaths-hit-4-000-india-3rd-to-cross-grim-landmark-101620419228246.html
08-05-2021||India||Won’t put lives at risk: SC rejects Centre plea||The Supreme Court on Friday said it “will not put the people of Karnataka in the lurch”, and turned down a plea by the central government seeking a stay on a Karnataka high court order that directed it to immediately increase the supply of medical oxygen to the state from 962 metric tonnes (MT) per day to 1,200 MT per day.Karnataka had more than 536,641 active Covid-19 cases till Friday, and its medical infrastructure has been struggling handle the spike in the ongoing second wave of infections.“It is a well-calibrated and judicious exercise of power by the high court. It is not an arbitrary order but based on adequate reasons. The high court order is a well-considered order... We will not keep the people of Karnataka in the lurch by interfering with this order,” a bench of justices Dhananjaya Y Chandrachud and MR Shah told the Central government, represented through solicitor general Tushar Mehta.Discomfited by the remarks of the bench, Mehta retorted that the Centre was willing to “walk out” of the oxygen allocation process if the high courts were willing to decide the quantity of oxygen each state should get. “We are willing to give the entire quantity of oxygen to the high courts. Let high courts distribute it. We will be out,” said the SG.Also read | SC warns of coercive action if Delhi’s O2 quota not metThe bench, however, replied: “That may not be the correct attitude. We understand the issues involved and we are constituting a committee that will go into the criteria of allocation. But that does not mean that our high courts will shut their eyes... and will not say anything even if people are suffering.”At this, Mehta sought to persuade the bench not to record statements in the court order on the quantity of oxygen demanded by the Karnataka since the Union government was going to resolve it through talks. He also urged the bench to add that the Karnataka high court order should not act as a precedent for other high courts to also start passing order on allocation of oxygen by Centre to the respective states.But the bench told Mehta that the high court order was based on the norms laid down by the Centre’s own expert committee on the requirement of oxygen on the basis of active cases and the number of beds available. “You may have difficulty in procuring the oxygen but the 1,162 MT per day is the requirement of Karnataka based on your own norms,” it told the SG.In its order, the bench recorded that while the allocation was increased to 856 MT to 965 MTs from May 5, the minimum requirement of the state, as projected by the state government on May 5 was 1162 MT per day.“The order of the High Court is based on the need to maintain at least a minimum requirement as projected by the state government until a decision on the representation is not taken. Hence, without enquiring into the wider issues sought to be raised at this stage (and keeping them open) there is no reason to entertain the special leave petition,” the order stated.Watch | ‘Covid third wave may not happen if we take strong measures’: Dr K VijayRaghavan﻿It added that the high court has furnished adequate reasons for issuing a calibrated ad-interim (temporary) direction without precluding a mutual resolution by the Centre and Karnataka government.On May 5, the high court, while hearing a public interest litigation by Mohammed Arif Jameel, recorded a statement of Karnataka’s additional chief secretary that the requirement of oxygen in the state was likely to go up to 1,792 MT by May 5, and directed the state government to submit a representation to the Centre in this regard. It further ordered that till this representation was considered, the Centre will supply 1,200 MT of oxygen per day to the state.Challenging this order before the top court, the Centre said that such a direction by the high court will “have a cascading effect and result in the total collapse of the system” in its fight against the ongoing second wave of the coronavirus disease.“I welcome the Supreme Court order and it is a good thing for Karnataka. If we get 1200 mt, then we can comfortably manage the situation,” Jagadish Shettar, Karnataka’s minister for large and medium industries said. He said that the number of cases is increasing and , we would need 1700 mt of oxygen.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/wont-put-lives-at-risk-sc-rejects-centre-plea-101620417724827.html
08-05-2021||India||Second wave spreading much faster in rural India than first||The second wave of Covid-19 in India has gained traction in the country’s vast rural hinterland, where health care infrastructure is weaker than in urban areas, at a much faster rate than it did during the first wave of the outbreak, shows data analysed by HT.During the first wave, urban areas contributed a majority of new infections in India every month for five months from March 2020 – the first month when India detected a locally transmitted case of the infection – to July 2020, before rural areas started contributing more new cases than urban areas. In the case of the second wave, which started in February, this has taken just two months.In March, rural areas, where 73% of the country’s population resides, contributed a little over a third (34.3%) of new infections compared to 48.2% contributed by urban areas, where 14% of India’s population lives (the rest came from areas with mixed urban and rural population).Also read | Third wave of Covid inevitable, says governmentIn April, rural areas contributed close to half (44.1%) of all new cases, compared to 40.8% contributed by urban areas.In the first four days of May, rural areas have contributed 1.39 times the number of new cases as urban areas. The only months in which rural areas contributed more cases than urban areas before this was last year, between August and October, and then again in December.To be sure, in terms of new cases reported per month per million population, urban areas have always stayed ahead of rural areas, and are still ahead currently. In April, urban areas reported 4.9 times the cases per million population compared to rural areas. This number for May was 3.8 until May 4. This could, however, be on account of lack of access to testing in rural areas.For the purpose of this analysis, India’s 700-plus districts have been classified into three categories on the basis of rural population share: urban districts (less than 40% rural population), rural districts (more than 60% rural population, and mixed districts (40%-60% rural population). District-level data on Covid-19 cases were compiled by How India Lives.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/second-wave-spreading-much-faster-in-rural-india-than-first-101620416984127.html
08-05-2021||India||SC warns of coercive action if Delhi’s O2 quota not met||The Supreme Court on Friday reproached the central government for not supplying 700 metric tonne (MT) of medical oxygen to Delhi every day, warning it of “coercive steps” if there is any deficit in the future.The remarks came after the Capital received 527 MT of oxygen on Thursday, lower than the 730 MT is received the day before. The city is estimated to require at least 700 MT to sustain the critical care patient load and consistently lower supplies have caused several hospitals to reduce the number of beds, officials have said.“We have been very clear that you have to give 700 MT to Delhi every day. We said it in our earlier order and also clarified this yesterday (Thursday). Don’t drive us to a situation where we have to take firm and take coercive steps,” the bench of justices Dhananjaya Y Chandrachud and MR Shah told solicitor general Tushar Mehta, who appeared for the Centre.The strictures came after senior counsel Rahul Mehra, representing the Delhi government, made an urgent mentioning before the court about shortage of oxygen supply between Thursday and Friday despite the court’s categorical directive that the city must get 700 MT every day till the order is either reviewed or modified. Mehra said Delhi received only 527 MT oxygen by Thursday midnight.The bench reminded the S-G that it was repeated several times by the court during the proceedings on Thursday that the Centre will have to keep supplying 700 MT to Delhi unless the order is modified.Also read | World’s largest cargo plane carries three oxygen plants to India from UK“Mr Solicitor, please note that when we say 700MT has to be supplied to Delhi, it does not mean it is only for one day. Tell your officers that it is not acceptable. We clarified yesterday also that till the further orders, you have to supply 700 MT. We made it very clear. Whenever the committee gives its report on allocation, we will see. But you cannot give it only one day to assuage us and say ‘chalo de diya ek din’ (we have given it one day),” it told the law officer.Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal said on Thursday that Delhi can add 9,000 to 9,500 more beds for Covid-19 patients if the Union government continues to send 700 MT of medical oxygen. In addition to the Supreme Court and the government, the Delhi high court has also asked the Union government to ensure the city gets adequate amount of medical oxygen.The bench also expressed displeasure at the Centre’s note in the court on Thursday wherein the supply of oxygen to Delhi was conditioned on availability of containers and tankers.“Yesterday when we saw your affidavit it said oxygen will be supplied but there were caveats and explanation about containers and tankers. We don’t want to get into it. We are not drivers of your containers. We will not get into it at all,” justice Chandrachud remarked.As the S-G sought to give an explanation, the court retorted that it is being made clear again that the Centre must give 700 MT oxygen to Delhi every day. “We are going to clarify this in our order again. We will see what the committee that we are going to form has to say about your allocation plan but till that time, it has to be 700 MT per day,” it added.While Delhi received 730 MT oxygen on May 5, the note submitted by the Centre in the court on Thursday also laid down a projection of oxygen supply from May 6 to May 14. The chart, reviewed by HT, shows that Delhi is expected to get 700 MT oxygen only on May 10 and May 14 whereas the quantity will be less on all other days. Moreover, the Centre has maintained that the supply is contingent on availability of containers.Watch | Covid update: Kamala Harris pledges more US aid to India; CoWIN’s 4-digit codeDuring the hearing on Thursday, the bench looked at these numbers and told the S-G that it was inclined to set up a committee which will go into the Centre’s oxygen allocation plan that needed a “revamp” for having missed the “most obvious points of considerations” regarding need of the states. It had also said that the Centre must continue supplying 700 MT oxygen to Delhi in the meantime.On May 2, the top court directed the Union government to ensure 700 MT of medical oxygen is supplied to Delhi every day. On May 5, the bench reiterated its order when the Centre approached it with a plea for suspending the contempt proceedings initiated by the Delhi high court against them over deficit in oxygen supply.The apex court had stayed the contempt proceedings, but not before clarifying that this is contingent on the Union government’s admission that the court order of May 2 required the Centre to supply 700 MT of oxygen to Delhi until further orders. It had also asked the Centre to submit a plan in the court by Thursday morning detailing how this target would be met, including logistical details, following which the note mentioned above was submitted by the S-G.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-warns-of-coercive-action-if-delhi-s-o2-quota-not-met-101620415842814.html
08-05-2021||India||Bengal poll rout divides Left Front leaders, alliance with cleric under scanner||After being completely routed in the battle between the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the Trinamool Congress (TMC) in the West Bengal polls, a section of leaders in the Communist Party of India (Marxist), or CPI(M), and its partners in the state Left Front have questioned the election strategy the Marxists followed and the alliance they formed with cleric Abbasuddin Siddiqui’s Indian Secular Front which was formed barley two months before the polls.The issues raised a storm at a closed-door meeting of the Left Front partners on Thursday when the CPI(M) was accused of thrusting its decision to have ISF as an ally on the smaller Left parties without any elaborate discussion.For the first time, the Bengal assembly has no Left and Congress MLA. This is in sharp contrast to the CPI (M)’s victory in Kerala. The CPI (M) was an ally of the Congress and the ISF and contested the polls as part of the Samyukta Morcha (united front). The only Morcha candidate to win is Nausad Siddiqui, Abbasuddin Siddiqui’s brother who contested the Bhangar seat in South 24 Parganas district.Of the 292 seats where polls were held, TMC bagged 213 while BJP won 77. Polls in the remaining two seats, where two candidates died of Covid-19, will be held later.Three senior CPI(M) leaders, who lost the polls, have questioned the alliance with ISF. They are Ashok Bhattacharya, the former urban development minister who lost the Siliguri seat, Kanti Ganguly, another former minister who lost the Raidighi seat in South 24 Parganas and Tanmoy Bhattacharya, who lost the North Dumdum seat in North 24 Parganas.“The leadership has to accept the responsibility. The alliance with the ISF must be reviewed. Did people accept it? Those who impose decisions from the top must be accountable,” said Tanmoy Bhattacharya.“The leadership has to explain the reason for our defeat,” said Ganguly.“It is evident that all Muslim votes went to the TMC. We did not get any,” Asok Bhattacharya said in Siliguri, referring to the leadership’s belief that ISF might erode the TMC’s Muslim vote bank.Even young leaders of the CPI(M) could not make it. For example, Jawaharlal Nehru University’s Left students’ union president Aishe Ghosh, a nationally known face, lost from Jamuria in West Burdwan district.Nausad Siddiqui feels that ISF should not be blamed for the defeat of the Left candidates.“We campaigned hard for candidates of all parties and poll results show that in many seats vote share of the Left nominees went up in comparison to their tally in the Lok Sabha polls in 2019. All I can say is that I will represent the Samyukta Morcha at the assembly,” he told HT on Friday.A month before the eight-phase polling began, the alliance with ISF, an unprecedented move by the Marxists, raised disturbing questions not only in the Left Front and the Congress but rattled senior members of the Siddiqui family at the famous Furfura Sharif mausoleum in Hooghly district as well. Pamphlets, asking people to vote for TMC, were distributed at Furfura Sharif. In Hooghly, the BJP faced defeat.On March 2, shortly after Abbasuddin Siddiqui appeared for the first time alongside Left and Congress leaders at the CPI(M) rally in Kolkata’s Brigade Parade Grounds, signs of discomfort appeared on several faces on the dais.A senior leader of the Left Front disclosed to HT that barely 12 hours before the rally, Forward Bloc, the party freedom fighter Subhas Chandra Bose formed in 1939 after quitting the Congress and which is a part of the Left Front, refused to attend the mega event because Siddiqui had been invited.“Naren Chatterjee, the Forward Bloc state secretary, wrote a letter to Front chairman and senior CPI(M) leader Biman Bose seeking proof of the ISF’s secular credentials. Three leaders of the Bloc took the letter to the CPI(M) office at Alimuddin Street. Bose called up Chatterjee and somehow convinced him to attend the rally,” said the Left Front leader.Leaders who attended the Left Front meeting on Thursday said Chatterjee once again raised sharp questions on the alliance and even suggested that there was no point in having the Left Front if the CPI(M) takes all decisions unilaterally. Chatterjee refused to comment.A member of the CPI(M) state committee, who did not want to be named, said there are many in his party to whom the idea of allying with a religious leader goes against the fundamentals of Marxist ideology.“In 2006 Subhas Chakraborty, one of our most popular leaders and minister was pulled up by the CPI(M) for offering prayer at the Tarapith temple in Birbhum district. He was made to explain his action,” said the CPI(M) state committee member.CPI(M) Politburo member Md Salim, who held the alliance talks with ISF, said Left leaders can say anything now as there is no restriction on talking.“One thing is for sure. We are facing the worst crisis,” said Manoj Bhattacharya, state secretary of the Revolutionary Socialist Party (RSP), a Left Front ally.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bengal-poll-rout-divides-cpi-m-left-front-leaders-alliance-with-cleric-under-scanner-101620415202682.html
08-05-2021||India||Boeing India to set up hospital with 200 oxygen beds in Bengaluru: CM Yediyurappa||BengaluruKarnataka chief minister BS Yediyurappa on Friday said that aerospace major Boeing India has come forward to set up a hospital with 200 oxygen beds in Bengaluru.In a letter addressed to Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman, the chief minister said the sudden surge in Covid-19 cases has led to an exponential demand for oxygen.“At the present growth rate, Karnataka may require 1500 MT (0xygen) by May 15 based on the consumption norms of government of India as against the allocation of 964 MT,” he said in the letter.“In this background Boeing India has come forward to set up a 200-oxygenated bed hospital at the KPCL Site in Yelahanka, Bengaluru where there is an assured oxygen supply from the KPCL gas plant. This will help us to lessen the load on the existing oxygen supplies in the state,” he wrote.The state government has been pleading with the Centre for more allocation of oxygen due to the dire situation in the state, which recorded its highest fatality rate on Friday at 1.21%.The decision comes on a day when Karnataka reported 592 Covid-related fatalities of which 346 were in Bengaluru. The fatality rate reached a high of 1.21%, according to the daily bulletin of the state health department. The state recorded 48781 new infections that takes its active case count to 536641. The positivity rate was at 30.28%, according to the bulletin. Bengaluru appears to be plateauing with infections steadily in the range of 21376 new cases that takes its active case count to 341978. The death toll in India’s IT capital rose to 7491.Karnataka got a breather after the Supreme Court on Friday turned down a plea by the central government, seeking a stay on the Karnataka high court order that directed it to immediately increase the supply of medical oxygen to the state from 962 metric tonnes (MT) per day to 1,200 MT per day.Yediyurappa also requested Boeing to set up a 250-oxygen bed hospital in Kalaburagi, one the worst affected regions outside of Bengaluru. While Bengaluru appears to be peaking with the number of cases, the spike is slowly moving to districts across the state where health infrastructure is far poorer than India’s IT capital. “The districts in the northern Karnataka, especially Bidar, Kalaburagi, Belagaum and Raichur, are also worst affected by Covid-19 pandemic and the entire region lacks in medical infrastructure facility. There it is requested that Boeing India may please be asked to set up a similar hospital with 250 oxygen beds at Kalaburagi under their CSR activities or otherwise,” he added.“Thanks @Boeing_In for coming forward to set up two 200 oxygenated bed hospitals in Karnataka for treating COVID-19 cases. Yelahanka(Bengaluru) & Kalaburgi.The latter also to serve Bidar, Belgaum & Raichur. The nodal officers appointed by Hon CM @BSYBJP would expedite the process,” Sitharaman said in a post on Twitter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/boeing-india-to-set-up-hospital-with-200-oxygen-beds-in-bengaluru-cm-yediyurappa-101620414841767.html
08-05-2021||India||Vaccination drive takes a hit in Bengaluru as stocks run dry||Bengaluru The vaccination drive, which the Karnataka government is banking on to contain the Covid-19 surge, has taken a huge setback as stocks run dry in most private hospitals and medical facilities in Bengaluru.Boards stating “No vaccination today” were seen on most private hospital gates on Friday while those visiting public medical facilities were sent back without inoculation, according to multiple persons aware of the developments.“Except Manipal and Apollo, no other private hospital has a single dose of vaccine now,” Dr Prasanna HM, the president-elect of the Private Hospitals & Nursing Homes Association (PHANA) told Hindustan Times.It comes even as the BS Yediyurappa-led government has withdrawn its earlier practice to distribute vaccines to private hospitals, asking them instead to procure on their own.“We are under tremendous pressure to give the second dose for all those who took the first dose. We are unable to answer them and request them to go to government facilities and take it,” Prasanna added.Both Manipal and Apollo hospitals, where vaccination drive continued, said they have procured stocks from manufacturers directly.Karnataka’s vaccination drive has seen a sharp decline since May 1, as per the daily bulletin of the state health department.Inaccurate reporting of vaccine data was another big challenge to gauge the actual number of inoculations in the state, experts said.According to the daily bulletin, only 62417 vaccinations were carried out in the state on Friday till 3 pm. However, senior government officials claimed the actual number was higher ,adding that the discrepancy was due to the format of reporting the numbers.Even if their version is believed, the daily vaccination numbers are far short of Yediyurappa’s aim of increasing the vaccination to 300,000 per day, as announced on 17 March.The lax in vaccination has come at a time when the caseload in Karnataka has breached all previous records. The state and its capital Bengaluru are among the worst impacted regions in the country.On Friday, Karnataka reported 48,781 new infections , taking the active caseload to 536,641. Bengaluru accounted for 21,376 new cases, taking its total active case count to 341,978. A record 592 persons succumbed to the viral disease in Karnataka, taking the toll in the state to 17,804. Bengaluru reported 346 deaths on Thursday, taking its toll due to Covid-19 to 7,149, according to the daily bulletin of the health department. Going by the daily bulletin, a total of 866,533 vaccine shots have been administered in the state from April 28 till Thursday. During the same time, there have been 421,159 new Covid-19 infections from across the state, data shows.Though Karnataka is the first state to cross the 10-million vaccination mark, a closer look of state data shows that most of them are people who received only the first dose.Out of the 10,316,686 vaccinations, 8,426,383 account for the first dose and only 1,890,303 have received both doses, according to government data.A senior government official said around 300,000 doses of vaccine were left in Karnataka and new stocks are expected at the earliest.Karnataka has ordered 10 million doses of Covishield vaccine from Pune-based Serum Institute of India (SII) at a cost of ₹400 crore, but the delivery has been delayed.While the focus remains on Bengaluru, one of the worst impacted regions in the country, the other 29 districts of Karnataka have witnessed a sharp surge of cases. According to experts, the worry is that if the health infrastructure in Bengaluru was crumbling, the situation in other districts, some of which are among the most backward in the country, is unimaginable.“We have created a lot of facilities. Last time, taluka hospitals did not have oxygen, this time we have them. District hospitals have been ramped up. Number wise oxygenated beds have been ramped up almost six times,” a senior official at the health department told Hindustan Times, requesting anonymity.P Ravi Kumar, the state’s chief secretary said that vaccine stocks come in every two days and there were no shortages.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/vaccination-drive-takes-a-hit-in-bengaluru-as-stocks-run-dry-101620414601738.html
08-05-2021||India||India to seek EU support on vaccine patent waiver||New Delhi is set to push for European Union (EU) support for a waiver of patent protections for Covid-19 vaccines during the India-EU Summit on Saturday, which is also expected to witness the launch of negotiations on three key trade-related agreements.Though the Biden administration has announced the US will back a temporary suspension of intellectual property rights for vaccines at the World Trade Organisation (WTO), the perception in New Delhi is that the EU is yet to fully throw its weight behind such a move, people familiar with developments said on condition of anonymity.The heads of state or government of all 27 members of the EU will gather in the Portuguese city of Porto for the virtual summit with Prime Minister Narendra Modi – only the second time such a gathering will be held following the EU’s meeting with US President Joe Biden in March.Till this week, the US, the EU, Canada and the UK were among the prominent holdouts to the proposal made last year by India and South Africa for relaxing the norms of the WTO Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) for Covid-19 vaccines.After the US made a U-turn, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said on Thursday the EU is ready to discuss how the US proposal for a waiver for vaccines could help achieve the objective of addressing the Covid-19 crisis in a pragmatic manner.Also read | Experts believe Covid-19 vaccine waiver won’t boost supply quickly. Here's why“The EU is still to take a position on the waiver, even though prominent members like France have backed the lifting of patents,” said one of the people cited above.“The pharmaceutical lobby in Europe is one of the strongest, probably stronger than even the automobile lobby, and always works to ensure its margins. But the ground is shrinking for the EU after the support for the Indian proposal from the US and France,” said a second person.EU officials have described the resumption of trade talks, which stalled in 2013 because of differences on issues such as market access for European products and mobility for Indian professionals, as a breakthrough and a “major step”.The two sides will also unveil a connectivity partnership based on a shared approach towards transparent initiatives that respect international standards and provide fair opportunities to Indian and European companies, senior EU officials said at a virtual briefing on Thursday. This will only be the EU’s second connectivity partnership after a similar arrangement with Japan.“We expect the leaders to endorse the launch of negotiations on three agreements – on trade, investment protection and geographical indications and this is a major step,” said an EU official, adding the move would help boost recovery from the economic fallout of the pandemic.A second EU official said the talks are expected to lead to a breakthrough towards balanced, comprehensive and mutually beneficial agreements. “After almost eight years of suspension of free trade talks, we will agree to resume these and this opens up the way to a possible free trade agreement between us,” he said.The two sides will also take steps aimed at shaping global standards for digital technologies and data management, and operationalise a joint task force on artificial intelligence (AI), the officials said.The officials described the resumption of the human rights dialogue with India after a pause of eight years as a key development in view of the EU’s commitment to human rights and equal opportunities.“We fully respect India as a secular democracy. Human rights are very much an important part of the political dialogue between the EU and India...One important message that we underlined was the important role that civil society actors and journalists play in a vibrant democracy,” the first EU official said. He acknowledged that the farmers’ protest in India had figured in recent talks between the two sides.Other issues expected to figure in the summit are cooperation on maritime security, cybersecurity and counterterrorism, enhanced collaboration to ensure a free and open Indo-Pacific, the signing of a working arrangement between Europol and its Indian counterpart to coordinate in the fight against terror and organised crime, the situation in Afghanistan and Myanmar, and efforts to revive the Iran nuclear deal.The officials said the two sides are expected to agree on cooperation on resilient medical supply chains, distribution of vaccines and active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) and preparing for future pandemics and global health emergencies, including the strengthening of the WHO.EU President Charles Michel, who has proposed an international treaty on pandemics to help strengthen the WHO, is keen to work with India in this field, the EU officials said.They added that EU member states had so far provided equipment and supplies worth 100 million euros for India’s Covid-19 response and the bloc had announced emergency support of 2.2 million euros for the WHO to help with testing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-to-seek-eu-support-on-vaccine-patent-waiver-101620414542593.html
08-05-2021||India||AIADMK meet to chose leader of opposition remains inconclusive||Chennai: On a day that MK Stalin was sworn in as chief minister, the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK) couldn’t decide on its leader of opposition as the power tussle between Edappadi Palaniswami and O Panneerselvam continued. The AIADMK’s newly elected MLAs and senior party leaders got together in their party headquarters in Chennai for more than three hours until 9pm Friday but the decision remained inconclusive. A statement from the AIADMK said that they will reconvene on May 10 under the leadership of Palaniswami and Panneerselvam. “We thought we could resolve the issues today but it will take a few days time,” said a former AIADMK minister not wishing to be named. Before the start of the meeting on Friday, supporters of both leaders got into a verbal argument over who should be leader of opposition, an important position which will decide the future of the party as well the leader’s. Inside the meeting, the legislators and leaders were expected to discuss their performance and factors that led to the loss. Since Palaniswami contested as the chief minister candidate, increased his margin of win by defeating DMK’s candidate by 92,849 votes in Edappadi constituency in Salem district and helped increase the party’s tally which performed the best in western region from where he and his former top ministers hail, he was expected to be chosen as the opposition leader. But the Panneerselvam camp is putting up a resistance.This isn’t the first time that the party is facing such a crisis. Before, outgoing chief minister Palaniswami was decided as the candidate for the top job, Pannerselvam resisted for more than two weeks before giving in and making the announcement himself in October 2020. While Palaniswami is the party’s joint co-ordinator, outgoing deputy chief minister Pannerselvam is the coordinator of the AIADMK. The dual leadership has been maintained in party administration and governance but simmering tension between the duo has come up every now and then over important decisions over position. After J Jayalalithaa’s death in December 2016, V K Sasikala briefly held the reins of the party but after her imprisonment in February 2017, Palaniswami and Panneerselvam joined hands and ousted Sasikala and her nephew TTV Dhinakaran. The latter floated AMMK with a rebel faction of Sasikala supporters with the intention of reclaiming the AIADMK. After her release, Sasikala expected her loyalists to return to her but as Palaniswami- Paneerselvam had put up a united front and solidified the party, there was no exodus. Sasikala eventually decided to step away from politics. With trouble brewing in the party now it remains to be seen how AIADMK will resolve these challenges. Meanwhile, the DMK appointed its MLA Kovai Chezhiyan as the government’s chief whip.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/aiadmk-meet-to-chose-leader-of-opposition-remains-inconclusive-101620414541731.html

We are thankful and highly appreciate the support of the United States of America for medical supply," Vardhan was quoted as saying in the statement.Detailing India’s pro-active, pre-emptive, graded approach to Covid-19 under the National Task Force, the minister briefed his counterpart on India’s response to the disease.“We have been augmenting testing infrastructure consistently with approximately 2,500 testing facilities for Covid-19 virus now as compared to just a single laboratory in January, 2020.“We have also witnessed an increase of 151 times in isolation beds and 35 times in ICU beds. Oxygen plants are being established at identified hospitals across India to ensure steady supply of medical oxygen. Further oxygen production has been ramped up to meet the demand. A unique digital platform, CoWIN 2.0, has been designed that supports the vaccination drive in India," he said.Secretary Becerra recounted the crisis in his country brought about by Covid-19 and expressed his empathy towards the suffering of Indians. He also assured of US President Joe Biden’s unwavering commitment to engage, collaborate and fight Covid-19 together, the statement added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid19-union-health-minister-harsh-vardhan-interacts-with-us-counterpart-101620413993326.html
08-05-2021||India||Vizag gas leak: A year on, villagers near the plant continue to live in fear||A year on since Visakhapatnam in Andhra Pradesh woke up to one of its worst environmental disasters – leakage of poisonous gas from a storage tank of LG Polymers Ltd, a South Korean company on the outskirts of the city, killed 12 people while nearly 500 were hospitalised – villagers settled near the plant continue to live in a state of fear.Though the plant has since been closed following orders from the Andhra Pradesh high court, residents of Venkatapuram and four other villages surrounding the plant said the horror from the tragic incident haunt them to this day.On May 7 last year, poisonous Styrene gas leaked from one of the tanks at LG Polymers Ltd due to sudden rise in temperature at the bottom of the tank at around 3.30 am. The gas slowly spread over a radius of about 3 km, affecting five villages — Venkatapuram, Venkatadri Nagar, Nandamuri Nagar, Pydimamba Colony and BC & SC Colony.Srinu Yadav, a transport worker from Venkatapuram, said the incident had created havoc in the lives of several villagers, particularly the poor and the middle class. “Many in these villages, particularly Venkatapuram, where the LG Polymers plant is located, continue to face health issues, like breathing problems, asthma, and gastrointestinal disorders,” Yadav said.The villagers recall how thanks to the timely alert from locals, the authorities of Greater Visakhapatnam Municipal Corporation and the district administration swung into action and shifted people from the affected areas with the help of police to safer areas.The Jagan Mohan Reddy government paid ex gratia of ₹1 crore each to the families of the 12 who died in the incident, besides ₹10 lakh for persons who were kept on ventilator for a long time, ₹1 lakh each to 485 people who were hospitalised with serious complications and ₹25,000 each to 99 people who were treated as outpatients. Another 19,893 people were paid ₹25,000 each towards compensation.Also read | Andhra begins enforcing partial lockdown, Telangana still waiting for nod from KCR“In the next one week, three others from the affected villages died but the authorities attributed their deaths to some other reasons. In the last one year, at least 15 people, including my father-in-law, died due to symptoms that surfaced after the Styrene gas leak. But no forensic studies were done to prove they were related to the gas leak tragedy,” Yadav said.An eight-member expert committee headed by state special chief secretary (environment and forests) Neerabh Kumar Prasad, which was constituted to probe into the mishap, came up with a series of suggestions, including periodical testing of health conditions of villagers in the area so as to monitor the short-term and long-term impact of the Styrene gas on their health.“Subsequently, a committee of health experts was appointed to regularly monitor the health of people in the affected villages, but it did not commence its work because of the Covid-19 pandemic,” K Kumara Mangalam, a local trade union leader, said.He added that the government has washed off its hands by setting up a primary health centre in a local school, but it hardly helped. “Except for an occasional visit by a junior doctor and para-medical staff, nothing much has happened. It doesn’t have any facilities, though the authorities promised to set up a hospital in the area,” Mangalam said.A study conducted in March this year by local environmentalists under Alluri Sitarama Raju Vignana Kendram on environment, health and safety of people in the villages surrounding LG Polymers, observed that the GVMC authorities were neither monitoring water bodies periodically nor getting an expert study on the water quality.“Most of the households are depending on the canned water for drinking purposes and spending between ₹300- 600 per month,” said K Eswar, another resident.An official of the GVMC, however, denied contamination of the drinking water in villages. “Scientists belonging to CSIR-National Environment Engineering Research Institute studied the water samples in and around the area and found that styrene is insoluble in water and would drain away in case of water flow. We are supplying Godavari water to local residents through pipeline,” the official said on condition of anonymity.The LG Polymers has shut its operations since the tragedy and the Korean management, with special permission from the Ministry of Shipping, shifted 13,000 tonnes of unused Styrene in two ships back to Seoul. On April 6 this year, the company got permission from the high court to move and sell leftover raw material, finished product and packaging material from the plant as it could pose danger to the public health if left unattended.The court directed that sale process be done in the supervision of a three-member committee appointed by the state government and the company deposit the sales proceeds in an account in the name of Vizag district collector.The villagers in the area are apprehensive that the LG Polymers might restart their operations once the cases pending in the high court and the National Green Tribunal were settled. “Unless the plant is completely shifted from the area, the fear of recurrence of such incidents will continue to haunt us,” said S Pydi Raju, a resident of Venkatapuram.When contacted, state industries minister Mekapati Gautam Reddy said the government has not focused on LG Polymers as of now as it was busy tackling the Covid-19 situation. “We shall take appropriate decision after discussing with the industries department authorities later,” he said..||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/vizag-gas-leak-a-year-on-villagers-near-the-plant-continue-to-live-in-fear-101620414482377.html

The 68-year-old leader, the son of former chief minister M Karunanidhi, led the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam to victory after a decade in the recently concluded assembly elections.As he took the oath,his wife Durga, and son and newly elected MLA Udhyanidhi broke down while party cadre cheered him on. The crowd was restricted due to Covid-19 curbs and Stalin had asked his followers to watch the event on television.“Congratulations to Thiru @mkstalin on being sworn-in as Tamil Nadu chief minister,” Prime Minister Narendra Modi tweeted.After reaching his office in the Secretariat at Fort St George, he signed five important orders, four of which were promised in DMK’s election manifesto.Also read | DMK's MK Stalin takes oath as Tamil Nadu's next chief ministerThe decisions included financial relief of ₹4,000 to 20.7 million ration card holders to tide over hardships faced due to the Covid-19 pandemic. The first instalment of ₹2,000 will be distributed in May and the rest will be given later. This scheme will cost the state ₹4,153 crore.The Chief Minister’s Comprehensive Health Insurance Scheme will be extended to cover treatment for Covid-19 in private hospitals for existing beneficiaries of the scheme. Travel was made free for women in state-owned buses. This will roll out from Saturday and the state will sanction ₹1,200 crore towards this scheme.Stalin also slashed the price of milk produced by state-run Aavin by ₹3 per litre. A new department will be formed to address people’s grievances within the first 100 days of the new government. The department ‘CM in your constituency’ will be headed by an IAS officer, Shilpa Prabhakar. Stalin had collected these grievances during his campaign titled ‘Stalin in your constituency’.In the previous All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam regime, the late J Jayalalithaa, who assumed office in May 2016, also signed five orders on her first day.Stalin also held a Covid-19 review meeting with all district collectors via video conference. Tamil Nadu on Friday reported 26,445 new cases and 197 new deaths. “According to experts this will increase over the next two weeks,” Stalin said in his video address. “So we have to increase bed and oxygen facilities and drugs on war footing.” He also announced setting up a 800 bed facility with oxygen in Chennai out of which 300 will be opened from May 10.Also read | TN CM-elect Stalin gets home portfolio as DMK issues list of 34 ministersExperts said Stalin aimed to start on a good note but the five orders will be a huge burden on the exchequer. “He has made generous announcements which are also election promises but it will cost the exchequer at least ₹10,000 crore,” says political analyst Maalan Narayanan. “In the present economic condition, the GDSP will come down due to Covid-19, the state’s borrowing has reached its limits, the state is also carrying the burden of public sector undertakings such as the electricity and transport corporation which isn’t making profit.”Stalin’s new teamV Irai Anbu was named the new chief secretary, replacing Rajeev Ranjan who took over in February. A seasoned IAS officer and writer, Anbu received the Si Pa Aditanar Literary Award for the year 2017 from Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Anbu’s brother is a 1995 batch IAS officer of the Gujarat cadre, V Thiruppugazh who is considered to be close to Prime Minister Modi.Thiruppugazh had served as Modi’s secretary in 2005-06 when the latter was Gujarat chief minister. He served in the Modi administration in the Centre too and was appointed as Advisor in the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA). “All officers appointed are efficient and one of the reasons for Irai Anbu’s appointment could be to have a more cordial relationship with the Prime Minister’s Office,” said Narayanan.Four senior bureaucrats were also announced as private secretaries to Stalin--T Udhayachandran as secretary 1, Dr P Umanath, is transferred from his role as managing director, Tamil Nadu Medical Services Corporation (TNMSC) and posted as secretary-2, M S Shanmugam as secretary-3 and Anu George as secretary- 4.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/stalin-era-begins-with-covid-welfare-schemes-in-focus-101620414481681.html
08-05-2021||India||Telangana govt extends night curfew; limits attendees at gatherings||Hyderabad The Telangana government on Friday extended the ongoing night curfew by another week while announcing additional restrictions on public gatherings to contain the spread of Covid-19 in the state.The move comes a day after chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao ruled out the possibility of a partial or total lockdown but said that all required measures would be adopted to contain the pandemic. The latest orders were issued by chief secretary Somesh Kumar in the evening. The night curfew – from 9 pm to 6 am – which was initially imposed on April 20 and extended twice, will now continue till May 15. “All business establishments, hotels and other offices should be closed by 8 pm. Collectors and superintendents of police, besides commissioners of police in all major cities, have been empowered to implement the night curfew,” the chief secretary saidin the order.The state government also imposed restrictions on public gatherings like marriages and similar events. Accordingly, only 100 members would be allowed to attend any such functionsunder strict compliance of Covid-19 norms. Not more than 20 people would be allowed to attend funerals. The government completely banned political meetings, rallies, sports and other entertainment programmes in view of the Covid-19 situation.On Thursday, the state government ruled out the possibility of any kind of lockdown – partial or total – citing that it would result in total collapse of the financial system of the state. Rao, who held a high-level meeting at his camp office late on Thursday, told officials that the lockdown would bring life to a standstill and would affect the livelihood of over 25-30 lakh migrant workers from other states who were working in Telangana. “Moreover, there is a bumper yield of paddy in the state and workers are busy in the procurement activity across 6,144 procurement centres in the state. There are lakhs of people involved in the process. What will happen to the workers who come from other states to work in the rice mills if a lockdown is imposed? The entire paddy purchasing process will come to a standstill if the lockdown is imposed,” he said. Rao added that a lockdown would also lead to a panic-like situation. “Hence, we are not ready for the lockdown. However, we will identify the areas where Covid-19 cases are more and declare them as micro-level containment zones and take required measures,” he explained. According to the official bulletin from the state medical and health department, the state reported 5,559 new Covid-19 infections and 41 fatalities as on Friday evening, taking the cumulative number of positive cases to 487,199 and total deaths to 2,666.

I had a cherishing milestone of my career, in the journey which began with being part of the office of Standing Counsel of ECI and progressed as one of the panel counsels of ECI (since 2013),” Ram wrote in a letter addressed to the Director (Law) of the Commission on Thursday.“However, I have found that my values are not in consonance with the current functioning of the ECI; and hence I withdraw myself from the responsibilities of its panel counsel before the Supreme Court of India,” he added.Ram, who has been on the ECI’s panel of counsels since 2013, has appeared for the poll body in various cases relating to the electoral reforms and decriminalisation of politics.He represented the poll body in 2015, when the top court ruled that legislators shall stand disqualified not only if he/she has a business contract with the government and its instrumentalities at the time of filing nomination papers, but also if he/she does so after being elected.Ram also appeared for the poll body in 2018, when the Supreme Court delivered a judgment imploring the Parliament to bring a law that bars people facing serious criminal cases from entering the political stream and “substantial efforts are undertaken to cleanse the polluted stream of politics”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ec-lawyer-quits-says-values-not-in-consonance-with-those-of-election-panel-101620414301777.html

The deceased have been identified as Mohammad Pasha (40) and A Kamalakar Chary (36). The incident happened close to the Mahabubabad railway station. The bodies have been shifted to the Mahabubabad district government hospital for post mortem, an official of the Warangal Railway Police said. According to the railway police, the two men were doing their regular duty of checking the railway tracks. They were working on track-1 when they noticed a train approaching on the track. They immediately crossed to track-2 for safety. “However, the men failed to notice that another train – Konark Superfast Express from Bhubaneshwar to Secunderabad, was approaching on the second track and even before they realised it, they were knocked down by the express train resulting in their death on the spot,” the police said. They said the victims may not have anticipated the passage of two trains on adjacent tracks almost at the same time and that led to the accident. The Warangal Railway Police registered a case and took up the investigation. The South Central Railway authorities also ordered an independent inquiry into the accident.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/2-railway-staff-killed-after-being-hit-by-speeding-train-while-on-duty-in-telangana-101620414062250.html

Mamata Banerjee took charge as West Bengal chief minister for a third time on Wednesday while M K Stalin took oath in Tamil Nadu on Friday.Also read | Five days after election results, Assam yet to get a new CMIn the Union territory of Puducherry, N Rangasamy was sworn in as the chief minister on Friday. The new government under Pinarayi Vijayan in Kerala is likely to assume office in the third week of this month.In Assam, however, the BJP leadership in Delhi is yet to decide between Sonowal and Sarma for the top post.“Government formation will happen in due course. Right now, all our focus is on controlling the spread of Covid-19 across the state and saving lives,” Sonowal said on Friday while taking stock of facilities to tackle the disease.In the polls, the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance won 75 seats in the 126-member Assembly.The BJP leadership is yet to send central observers to Assam to interact with the party’s state office-bearers and no official meeting of the 60 newly-elected members have taken place as of yet to choose the new chief minister.“The delay was initially due to the violence in West Bengal after declaration of results in which the Trinamool Congress (TMC) workers targeted our members. The prevailing Covid-19 situation in the country has also affected the decision on formation of the next government,” BJP spokesperson Rupam Goswami said.“There’s already a caretaker government in place in Assam and it is functioning well. There’s no difference within the party on the CM’s post and the same will be announced soon,” he added.The delay in government formation comes at a time when the state is witnessing a spike in Covid-19 cases. On Thursday, Assam recorded 5,626 new positive cases, which was the highest ever single-day figure in the state ever since the pandemic broke out last year. It also recorded 47 deaths on the same day.Also read | JD(U) and other Bihar parties hit rock bottom in Assam, Bengal polls“BJP got a clear and decisive mandate, but still it hasn’t been able to form a government. Especially at a time when the state is going through a difficult time, critical decisions like dates of board examinations and handling of the Covid-19 spike shouldn’t be left to an ad-hoc government,” Congress Lok Sabha MP Pradyut Bordoloi said.“At present, what was needed was an all-out effort on war footing to check the alarming surge in Covid-19 and community spread of the disease seen in tea-gardens. But the delay exposes the bankruptcy of the BJP’s decision-making process,” he added.Akhil Ranjan Dutta, professor of political science in Gauhati University, said that the BJP’s defeat in West Bengal could have played a part in delay in announcement of Assam’s next CM.“The outcome in West Bengal in a way eroded the moral authority of the BJP leadership to dictate or impose decisions in Assam. Therefore, they are taking time and indulging in negotiations as they are worried about a possible revolt,” Dutta said.“The BJP got its fourth successive poll victory in Assam in this election since the 2014 general elections. But the delay in the government formation process amounts to complete insult to the faith reposed in the party by the voters,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjpsummons-sonowal-sarma-as-uncertainty-over-assam-cmcontinues-101620413762339.html

This will help us to lessen the load on the existing oxygen supplies in the state,” he wrote.The state government has been pleading with the Centre for more allocation of oxygen due to the dire situation in Karnataka which recorded its highest fatality rate on Friday.The decision comes on a day when Karnataka reported 592 Covid-19 related fatalities of which 346 were in Bengaluru. The fatality rate touched a high of 1.21%, according to the daily bulletin of the state health department. The state recorded 48,781 new infections that take its active case count to 536,641. The positivity rate was at 30.28%, according to the bulletin. Bengaluru appears to be plateauing with infections steadily in the range of 21,376 new cases that take its active case count to 341,978. The death toll in India’s IT capital rose to 7491.Karnataka got a breather after the Supreme Court on Friday turned down a plea by the Central government, seeking a stay on the Karnataka high court order that directed it to immediately increase the supply of medical oxygen to the state from 962 metric tonnes (MT) per day to 1,200 MT per day.Yediyurappa also requested Boeing to set up a similar 250-bedded hospital with oxygen facility in Kalaburagi, one the worst affected regions outside Bengaluru. While Bengaluru appears to be peaking with the number of Covid-19 cases, the surge is slowly moving to districts across the state where health infrastructure is far poorer than India’s IT capital. “The districts in northern Karnataka especially Bidar, Kalaburagi, Belagaum, Raichur are also badly affected by the Covid-19 pandemic and the entire region lacks in medical infrastructure facility. There it is requested that Boeing India may please be asked to set up a similar hospital with 250 oxygen beds at Kalaburagi under their CSR activities or otherwise,” he added.“Thanks @Boeing_In for coming forward to set up 200 bed hospitals in Karnataka for treating COVID-19 cases. Yelahanka (Bengaluru) & Kalaburgi. The latter also to serve Bidar, Belgaum & Raichur. The nodal officers appointed by Hon CM @BSYBJP would expedite the process,” Sitharaman said in a post on Twitter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/boeing-to-set-up-200-bed-hospital-with-oxygen-facility-in-bengaluru-101620413102402.html
08-05-2021||India||Knew lives were at stake: Officer who helped avert tragedy at Mumbai airport||“For some reason, I kept watching the plane as it was speeding on the runway,” recalled Ravi Kanth Avala, a Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) head constable who averted a major tragedy by spotting a technical malfunction in an air ambulance, at the Nagpur airport late on Thursday.The plane carrying a total of five people, including a patient and a doctor, belly-landed under full emergency protocols at the Mumbai airport on Thursday night without any casualties.The air ambulance--a chartered flight with registration VT-JIL--took off from Bagdogra for Mumbai with five people on board, but had a stopover at Nagpur for re-fuelling around 2.30 am.Avala was deployed at the watchtower near the runway of the Nagpur airport. Around 5.50pm, when the Beechcraft King Air C90 plane was taking off, Avala noticed that its rear wheel “fell off in the air”. “The moment it took off, the rear left wheel of the plane broke and got separated. The speed of the aircraft was such that the detached wheel went rolling at least half a kilometre ahead, towards the left of the runway, before it came to halt. The plane, however, took off, unaffected,” said Avala.Sensing the gravity of the incident, the 48-year-old head constable immediately rushed towards the runway, barely 300 metres from watchtower number 12, and alerted the Nagpur SOCC (security operational control centre), which in turn reported the matter to the air traffic control (ATC).Also read | Air ambulance lands on belly in Mumbai as wheel falls off in Nagpur“I went to the spot where the wheel fell. Since it was a charter jet, I was sure it would land somewhere within 2-3 hours maximum. I also knew that such planes have a capacity of 7-8 passengers and therefore lives are at stake. At that time I didn’t know that it’s an air ambulance carrying a Covid-19 patient. Thinking that it can lead to a fatal accident upon landing, I immediately reported the matter to my superiors who further alerted the authorities concerned,” Avala said. “The Nagpur ATC quickly informed the pilot of the aircraft and arrangements were made at Mumbai airport for safe landing,” the Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) said in a statement. The plane landed on a foamed runway at the Mumbai’s Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj International Airport at about 9:09 pm on Thursday and rescue authorities evacuated those on board.“Had head constable Avala not shown alertness, a major tragedy could have occurred during the landing of the aircraft..,” the CISF statement said.On Friday, the CISF announced a cash reward of ₹10,000, the top force honour of a DG commendation disc and certificate for Avala.Avala said he feels fortunate to have saved a tragedy from unfolding. “My seniors and colleagues appreciate my quick reaction. My alertness and promptness was lauded. My family members, my wife and children are also proud of me,” said Avala, who has been posted at Nagpur airport since 2017.Meanwhile, senior officials at the Airport Authority of India said that after learning about absence of rear left wheel, the pilot requested the ATC to get in touch with the aircraft type’s (C-90) expert from the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) to figure out the best possible procedure to be followed in the situation.“The checklist with the pilot did not state his course of action needed, in case one of the rear wheels went missing,” claimed an AAI official. “Though the pilot had communicated to go for belly landing, he shared a contact of an expert for C-90 aircraft and asked the on-duty controllers to reconfirm the course of action needed,” the officer added. It was then that the air traffic controllers (ATCos) got in touch with two experts from the DGCA to get their views. The experts agreed and asked the ATCos to go ahead with the belly landing.Mohan Ranganathan, aviation safety expert and former instructor pilot of Boeing 737 said, “Absence of standard operating procedure on partial landing gear failure, is a very serious lapse on the DGCA’s part.”DGCA director general Arun Kumar said that investigation will reveal the facts. “We would not like to speculate,” he added.The Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau (AAIB) however confirmed that they have taken over the investigation. “The AAIB is conducting an investigation as per Aircraft (Investigation of Accidents and Incidents) Rules, 2017 into the causes of the occurrence,” read AAIB’s reply to the email sent by the paper.An Airports Authority of India official said the aircraft luckily had enough fuel to stay in the air while the authorities and the pilot prepped for a belly landing. “This gave us a good time to consider all possibilities and take a call,” the official who was on duty on Thursday evening said.AAI officials said that the Nagpur ATC informed the Mumbai ATC about the plane’s missing wheel around 6.45pm.“The pilot was unaware of the situation until the Mumbai ATC got in touch with Capt Kesari Singh to inform him about it. However, none of us knew which wheel of the aircraft was detached,” said the AAI official quoted earlier.Capt Singh suggested ‘low pass’ over the runway to identify which wheel had fallen off, a reference to the aircraft flying at a height of 50m over the runway. “The pilot was cleared to conduct the ‘low pass’ immediately at around 6.45pm when the aircraft was 200Nm away from Mumbai,” said a controller at Mumbai.The low pass, carried out at around 7.30pm, led the Mumbai ATC and fire department officials to figure that the aircraft’s rear left wheel was missing.A Delhi-based AAI official explained that the absence of either of the two rear wheels is riskier than any issue with the nose wheel. “This is because the two rear wheels come in contact with the runway first, followed by the nose wheel.”“ATCos were asked to go ahead with belly landing after which the airport operator was contacted and asked to prepare for foam-based landing. Arranging for foam and making it available at the touchdown point of runway 27 took some time,” said a senior AAI official in Mumbai.“At first, when the arrangement of foaming the runway was taking time, we were even thinking on the lines of sending the aircraft back to Nagpur, however, by then the airport operator confirmed that foam was being arranged,” the official added.The aircraft touched down safely at 9.09pm after which the fire department officials took over and handled the situation so that the aircraft did not catch fire. Though the aircraft suffered substantial damage, there were no injuries. The mid-aged male patient, who was one of the passengers was being treated for Covid-19, was rushed to Nanavati hospital. A hospital official said the patient is on oxygen support, but he is conscious and stable.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/knew-lives-were-at-stake-officer-who-helped-avert-tragedy-at-mumbai-airport-101620412801437.html
08-05-2021||India||Sonia, Rahul attack Centre, say it failed people||Congress president Sonia Gandhi on Friday demanded an all-party meeting on the coronavirus disease pandemic, accusing Prime Minister Narendra Modi of failing the people of India and announced that the Congress’ organization would enhance its relief activities, even as party leader Rahul Gandhi wrote to the Prime Minister that the Centre’s failures at managing the pandemic’s second wave have made another “devastating national lockdown almost inevitable.”In the first Congress Parliamentary Party meeting after the recent assembly elections where the party was decimated everywhere except in Tamil Nadu where it was the junior partner in the winning alliance, Sonia Gandhi said that a Congress Working Committee meeting will soon be called to review the results. “But it goes without saying that we as a party collective must draw appropriate lessons from this setback in a spirit of humility and honesty.” She congratulated Trinamool Congress chief Mamata Banerjee, DMK chief M.K. Stalin and the Left parties for their “handsome victories” in West Bengal, Tamil Nadu and Kerala and said, “Most unfortunately, our own performance in all the states was very disappointing and if I may say, unexpectedly so.”The Congress failed to win Assam, Kerala and Puducherry, and drew a blank in West Bengal .Underlining that the fighting Covid is not “a “Government versus Us” battle but a “Us versus Corona” battle,” she demanded that the PM should call an all-party meeting as “we have to fight this battle together as a nation.”Also read | Central Vista project a criminal wastage, says Rahul Gandhi“Let us be absolutely clear – the system hasn’t failed. The Modi government has been unable to constructively channelize India’s many strengths and resources. I say this categorically -- India is crippled by a political leadership today that has no empathy for the people. The Modi Government has failed the people of our country,” Sonia Gandhi said in the CPP meeting.The Congress president accused Modi of abdicating a government’s fundamental responsibilities and duties towards the people and argued that the Centre had “refused to strengthen the supply-chains for oxygen, medicine, and ventilators” and “failed to place” sufficient orders for vaccines and “Instead, it consciously chose to allocate thousands of crores for non-essential projects that have nothing to do with the peoples’ well-being.” The last was a reference to the Central Vista projects.Rahul Gandhi’s letter cautioned against the “uncontrollable spread” of this virus. He offered four suggestions to slow its spread: track the virus and its mutations, dynamically assess the efficacy of all vaccines against mutations, rapidly vaccinate India’s entire population, and remain “transparent and keep the rest of the world informed about our findings.”Rahul Gandhi also demanded financial, food and transportation support “to prevent a repeat of the manifold suffering caused by last year’s lockdown.”“I am aware that you are concerned about the economic impact of a lockdown. Inside and outside India, the human cost of allowing this virus to continue its march unimpeded will result in many more tragic consequences for our people than any purely economic calculations your advisors are suggesting,” his letter reasoned.In the meeting, Abhishek Manu Singhvi gave suggestions such as the party should set up a fund by imposing a uniform “Congress Covid Charge” on all its members and the money can be used for medical activities such as buying oxygen cylinders and medicines. He also suggested creation of an IT portal and aid for poor people. Leaders such as DK Suresh, Nasir Hussain, Saptagiri Ulaka and Ripun Bora described the prevailing Covid situation in their areas.Several leaders praised Rahul Gandhi, who didn’t speak at all. Francisco Sardinha said he had tried to open the eyes of Modi but it fell on deaf ears. Punjab MP Jasbir Singh Gill tried to raise the election issue, but Sonia Gandhi told him that the CWC would discuss it separately.Sonia also maintained that the vaccination policy will exclude millions backward people as well as the poor and the marginalized. Claiming that “the nation is sinking under the weight of the Modi government’s indifference and incompetence” she added that the Congress would “enhance and streamline” its relief efforts and that “efforts must be made to organize ambulances, temporary beds, oxygen concentrators and necessary medicines.”The work being done by the Youth Congress, which has run a more effective helpline that some states and Union Territories, also came in for praise from the party president.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sonia-rahul-attack-centre-say-it-failed-people-101620412681362.html
08-05-2021||India||Centre asks states to prioritise beneficiaries of 2nd vaccine dose||The Union government has directed states to prioritise beneficiaries due for their second Coronavirus disease (Covid-19) vaccine dose, amidst reports of difficulties faced by those unable to schedule a session for a second dose -- the result of a supply crunch.“Utilise supplies of vaccines through government of India channel in 70:30 ratio for the second dose and first dose respectively. Regular review of coverage of Covid-19 vaccination drive to be undertaken to formulate and implement strategy for such prioritization,” said Arti Ahuja, additional secretary, health, in the customary Covid briefing.Vaccine doses provided through the government of India channel are to be used exclusively for those above the age of 45 years and health care and front line workers. In addition, states have started sourcing their own supplies to vaccinate those between the ages of 18 and 45 years. But over the past few days, there have been several reports of people not being able to schedule their second doses -- recommended between 6 and 8 weeks in the case of the Covishield vaccine and 4 and 6 weeks in the case of Covaxin.Interestingly, the guidance came even as there has been talk of the government extending the gap between doses to 12 weeks in the case of Covishield -- the vaccine administered to over 90% of Indians -- so as to maximise the number of people who receive at least one dose, an immediate priority to crush the ongoing second wave of the pandemic which has seen the last 2 million cases added in just six days. Also read | Covid-19: Centre issues SoP to vaccinate beggars, prison inmates without IDsResearch has show that the efficacy of the AstraZeneca/Oxford vaccine -- developed in India as Covishield by Serum Institute of India -- is the highest when there is a 12 week gap between doses.Interestingly, days after a similar briefing in which the focus was on the inevitability of a third wave, officials said in Friday’s briefing that India could avoid one.“If we take strong measures, the third wave may not happen in all the places or indeed anywhere at all. It depends much on how effectively the guidance is implemented at the local level, in the states, in districts and the cities everywhere,” said Prof K VijayRaghavan, principal scientific advisor, in the briefing.For the past week, according to the HT dashboard, India has reported an average of 389,044 cases and 3,775 deaths a day. On Friday, the country reported 401,358 cases and 4192 deaths.At least 12 states currently have at least 100,000 active Covid-19 cases. The disease positivity rate in some states such as Goa is nearing 50%. Four states have a positivity rate of 30% and above. At least 24 states and UTs currently have a positivity rate of 15% and above; nine states and UTs are reporting between 5 and 15%; and only three states and UTs have less than 5% positivity rate.A total of 167 million vaccine doses have been administered across the country . This includes 34 million fully vaccinated people and 99 million who have received one dose. Of this, only 1.181 million of those between the ages of 18-44 have been vaccinated since the third phase of the vaccine drive began on May 1.“Everyone should get vaccinated when they can; it will help in dealing with subsequent waves,” said Dr Giridhara R Babu, head, epidemiology, Indian Institute of Public Health.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-asks-states-to-prioritise-beneficiaries-of-2nd-vaccine-dose-101620412561367.html
08-05-2021||India||O2 crisis persists across India, 3 states write to Centre on quota||The pan-India medical oxygen shortage was under focus again on Friday with two states, West Bengal and Rajasthan, asking the Centre to increase their quotas, and the Supreme Court refusing to intervene in a Karnataka high court order increasing the allocation of the medical essential for the state.Tamil Nadu asked the Centre to restore its quota. On May 1 and May 2, in a meeting with Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade, it was agreed that the state will be re-allotted 476 MT of oxygen as opposed to 220 MT but Centre hasn’t issued orders yet.Some other states, however, said that supply improved over the past week due to higher allocations and improvements in the supply chain -- issues that led to several high courts passing directives over the past fortnight as hospitals were struggling to treat patients for want of oxygen in the middle of a deadly second Covid-19 wave.On Friday, West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, her third letter in three days, requesting that 550 MT of medical oxygen be supplied to the state every day to manage the health care emergency. “Any allocation of medical oxygen less than the requested amount (550 MT) will not only adversely affect the supply of medical oxygen but may also result in loss of lives of the patients in the state,” she wrote.On Friday, West Bengal reported 19, 216 new Covid-19 cases. The daily Covid death count in the state has shot up 20 times from six on February 26, when the assembly elections were announced, to 117 on May 6.On May 5, Banerjee wrote to Modi and said the demand of medical oxygen in the state had nearly doubled from 220 MT to 400 MT. On Friday, she said that the demand further shot up to 470 MT in the last 24 hours, and was expected to touch 550 MT in another week.“However instead of allocating the same as per the requirement of West Bengal, the Centre has increased allocation of medical oxygen to other states from the total production in West Bengal,” she wrote. Bengal’s allocation was fixed at 308 MT since May 4.The Rajasthan government on Friday claimed that the oxygen supply to the state worsened since the Centre on May 4 decided to provide supply to the state from Jamnagar in Gujarat instead from Panipat in Haryana.Also read | SC warns of coercive action if Delhi’s O2 quota not met“The oxygen supply from Jamnagar would take more time as compared to Panipat, which is comparatively closer to Jaipur. Apart from the factor of distance, the non-availability of tankers is another challenge to get oxygen from Jamnagar,” Rajasthan health minister Raghu Sharma said.The Centre last Friday allotted an 100 MT oxygen to Rajasthan from Odisha and West Bengal, rasing its total allocation to 270 MT, but the state government said it could not get oxygen due to the lack of tankers.The state has 35 oxygen tankers, and will require 25 more tankers for smooth supply, a health official said. He added that the state has around 200,000 active cases, and daily demand of oxygen hit 550 MT. The state health department has said that the demand is set to increase to 705 MT by May 10 and 795 MT by May 15 based on current trends.“Against the demand of 615MT of oxygen, the GoI is providing 270 MT, that too 100 MT from Bhiwadi; 70 MT from Jamnagar; 40 MT from Burnpur in West Bengal and 60MT from Kalinganagar in Orissa. Transporting oxygen from these places will take 10 days. Our officials are coordinating with railways and air force to speed up the process,” he said.Till Thursday, Rajasthan reported 5,182 deaths and 702,568 coronavirus cases.Tamil Nadu chief minister MK Stalin on Friday wrote to Modi asking to restore oxygen diverted to other states as the state could face oxygen shortage from Saturday.Stalin said the current consumption was 440 MT which would increase to 840 MT in the next two weeks. Tamil Nadu on Friday reported 26,445 new cases, almost double the daily cases on May 1.Also read | World’s largest cargo plane carries three oxygen plants to India from UKOther states such as Odisha, Chhattisgarh and Andhra Pradesh claimed that they were not facing any shortage of oxygen despite increase in cases as allocation has increased.Odisha’s director health services Bijay Mohapatra said no hospital in the state reported any shortage of oxygen even though daily Covid cases rose to 9,889 on Friday.Chhattisgarh health minister T S Singhdeo said that the state has ramped up oxygen supply from local industrial units and there was ample supply in hospitals and for patients in home isolation.“The demand for oxygen has also flattened in the state in the last three days and we have enough oxygen for time being,” he said. An official of the Andhra Pradesh health department said the state is not facing any oxygen shortage and was exporting oxygen to other states such as Maharashtra.Hospitals in Patna continue to face a crisis, forcing some to reduce oxygen pressure to patients and refuse fresh patients.Ruban Hospital, accredited to the National Accreditation Board for Hospitals and Healthcare Providers (NABH), had to curtail admission of new Covid-19 patients. “Our oxygen requirement is 600 cylinders (1 cylinder is 340 litres) per day, but we are able to get a maximum of 400-450 cylinders only in a day,” said a spokesperson of Ruban hospital.The Centre has allocated Bihar a daily quota of 214 MT, but the state was able to lift only 167 MT because of logistical issues.Madhya Pradesh received 524 MT oxygen on Friday from different sources but the crisis persisted in private hospitals.“It is easy for big and renowned hospitals to get oxygen...but small hospitals have to struggle daily We queue up at refilling centres for 6-12 hours daily,” said a doctor of Bhopal based hospital, who didn’t wish to be named.State minister Vishwas Sarang said, “We are putting our best efforts to fulfil the requirement...are setting up oxygen generation plant in every district.”Indian Railways delivered 2,960 MT of liquid oxygen to states since April 19 in 185 tankers. Of this, 174 MT has been offloaded in Maharashtra, 729 MT in Uttar Pradesh, 249 MT in Madhya Pradesh, 305 MT in Haryana, 123 MT in Telangana, and 1,334 MT in Delhi, according to the Railways ministry.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/o2-crisis-persists-across-india-3-states-write-to-centre-on-quota-101620412321396.html

The vaccine maker has not been able to supply vials in time due to a surge in demand," the minister said.Altogether, 2,25,387 people have been inoculated in the state so far, and 47,778 of them received both doses of the vaccine till Friday.The health minister said 15 oxygen concentrators and cylinders each have arrived in the state from Taiwan on Friday.Besides, 60 oxygen concentrators were provided to the state by the Centre, he said.Taking to Twitter, Chief Minister Zoramthanga said, "ThankYouTawian for your continued generosity providing us much needed oxygen concentrators & cylinders.

08-05-2021||India||Vanraj Bhatia, musician whose jingles were the soundtrack of ’80s, '90s, dies||Cable television was yet to arrive, and Doordarshan ruled. Through much of the 1980s, home entertainment meant watching Sunday feature films or teleserials, interspersed with a series of 30- or 60-second ads. It was in these bursts that most of India encountered Vanraj Bhatia’s genius.The music director, who died on Friday aged 93, had already made a mark in Shyam Benegal’s films. Most notable were his songs Mero Gaam Katha Parey in Manthan (1976), Tumhare Bin Jee Na Lage in Bhumika (1977) and Kya Hai Tera Gham Bata in Kalyug (1981). In fact, Mero Gaam… was even used to advertise Amul milk in 1976.The 1980s saw Bhatia return in a big way to jingles, where he had begun his career, and to television serials. In switching between parallel cinema, advertising and TV programmes, he became one of the men who gave us the soundtrack of the 1980s.In an interview with this writer, Bhatia once said, “In jingles, you get only 10 or 15 seconds to make an impact musically, unlike film songs which are three of four minutes long.” His most impactful jingle was perhaps the one he composed for the Liril ad, created by Lintas chief Alyque Padamsee with executive Neena Merchant. Featuring model Karen Lunel under a waterfall, its theme music was the still-used-in-snatches “La lalalalala” tune. It was made up of less than 20 notes, but it was fresh, youthful, and it still takes you straight back to the ’80s when you hear it.The other big name composing jingles at the time was Louis Banks, who began with the Four Square cigarette commercial and later tasted huge success with his Hamara Bajaj and Cadbury’s tunes. These short films were initially made for viewing in cinema halls, but with many people buying colour TV sets after the 1982 Asian Games, the focus shifted to the small screen. Bhatia was quick to adapt, and composed successful jingles for Dulux, Tata Salt and Garden Vareli, the last of which was composed in Raag Desh.Simultaneously, with Doordarshan looking for more content, many music directors got opportunities. Bhatia composed for Shridhar Kshirsagar’s Khandaan and Benegal’s travel-based series Yatra. In Govind Nihalani’s Tamas, set during Partition, the theme music has the chanting of “O rabba”. Bhatia recalled, “I received a National Award for it. I did everything except the gurdwara song. In fact, it was jury head Salil Chowdhury who insisted I should get the award when most other jury members felt I shouldn’t be given one because it was a television score.”In Benegal’s historical series Bharat Ek Khoj, based on Jawaharlal Nehru’s book The Discovery of India, he used a hymn from the Rig Veda. It was well-received, and it spurred his interest in spiritual music. He later recorded albums based on the Upanishads and the Bhagavad Gita.Bhatia’s last major project was the opera Agni Varsha, based on a Girish Karnad play. “That was always a dream project, and when I stopped all other projects, I would spend three hours a day on the opera. It required a completely different approach,” he said.The composer was ailing for three years, and was undergoing financial difficulties. Musicians and well-wishers came out in support to help fund his medical treatment. He passed away at his residence in Mumbai, leaving behind a legacy of music that was pure, enriching and memorable.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/vanraj-bhatia-musician-whose-jingles-were-the-soundtrack-of-the-80s-and-90s-dies-at-93-101620411481321.html
08-05-2021||India||Consider urgent hearing of plea against Central Vista project: SC tells Delhi HC||The Supreme Court on Friday observed that the Covid-19 situation is “very serious”, as it requested the Delhi high court to consider hearing urgently a plea that has sought suspension of the ongoing construction activity in some stretches of the Central Vista area of New Delhi due to spurt in Covid-19 cases.Taking note of the fact the high court had given a long adjournment, the bench of justices Vineet Saran and Dinesh Maheshwari observed that it would not be proper to issue any directive to another constitutional court to hear the case on an earlier date but it was certain that the chief justice of the high court will consider the request for an urgent hearing for the plea.“Since the matter is pending before the high court and the appeal is against the order of adjournment, we are not inclined to enter into the merits of the case. In the given circumstance, we request Shri Sidharth Luthra (petitioner’s lawyer) or any other counsel to make request before the chief justice of high court on Monday to take up the matter as urgently as possible,” said the court order. It added: “We hope and trust that high court shall consider the prayer for early hearing.”Also Read | 20 heritage jamun trees may be uprooted in Central Vista revampThe Central government’s over ₹15,000 crore redevelopment plan for the historically significant Central Vista area of New Delhi envisages a new Parliament, Central Secretariat and union ministries’ offices.Petitioners Anya Malhotra and Sohail Hashmi had filed a petition before the high court, questioning the urgency in carrying on with the construction activity on three stretches of the Central Vista area during the subsistence of this peak phase of the pandemic in the capital when oxygen is in short supply and the healthcare system has collapsed.On May 4, a Delhi high court bench led by chief justice DN Patel adjourned the matter to May 17, saying he needed some time to read the Supreme Court judgment of January 5 giving a clearance to the Central Vista Avenue Redevelopment Project. Petitioners challenged this order of long adjournment before the top court in an appeal, drawn by advocate Ketaki Goswami.Arguing for the appeal, senior advocate Luthra began by saying the petitioners were not at all challenging the project after the Supreme Court’s nod to it but the public health emergency has prompted them to seek a temporary suspension of the work for stretches where labourers’ lives were in peril and the construction activity could turn out to be a super-spreader.“Between April and May, the positivity rate in Delhi has gone up from 2% to around 30%. Deaths have gone up many times. This is a matter that needs urgent consideration. We are concerned about 3.5 km stretch. We are in a stage where health infrastructure has completely broken down. People cannot get beds and deaths are going up,” submitted Luthra.The counsel pointed out that the plea was confined to stopping work which entailed construction activity on Rajpath and the surrounding lawns from India Gate to Rashtrapati Bhawan since there were no on-site accommodation facilities on these stretches and the workers were instead being ferried in buses every day.“My concern is that we are facing a humanitarian crisis of the greatest magnitude. No adverse consequences will happen if this is adjourned by three or four weeks. The ongoing construction activity have the potential of being a super spreader event since labourers travel from and back to their families from different parts of Delhi. The situation is already very alarming,” said Luthra.The bench replied: “We are well conscious of the situation. We are not making any observations because some other bench of this court is already hearing these matters...But the fact that you can see that we are wearing masks even inside our homes is a sign of how serious the situation is.”Solicitor general Tushar Mehta opposed the plea, raising doubts over the bona fide of the petitioners but the court said that all this could be argued before the high court.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/consider-urgent-hearing-of-plea-against-central-vista-project-sc-tells-delhi-hc-101620388499612.html
08-05-2021||Today's||The present and future of Mamata Banerjee||Mamata Banerjee’s political victory in the West Bengal elections is remarkably impressive. Here was a chief minister (CM) who successfully defied two-term anti-incumbency — and while there have been other CMs who have successfully returned to power for a third time (Narendra Modi is a prime example), Banerjee was facing the most formidable challenger in India’s political theatre. She had suffered a setback in the Lok Sabha elections of 2019, and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), with its well-oiled machine and drive, was out to wrest power. Yet, Banerjee succeeded through a mix of four elements — sub-nationalism, politics of welfare and gender, minority consolidation, and robust organisational strength. The Bengal win has now prompted observers to suggest that Banerjee may well be the glue of possible opposition unity against Prime Minister Narendra Modi in 2024, and that there is a Bengal model to be deployed to challenge the BJP’s might. Many, dissatisfied with the centralising impulses of the central government, are banking on this hope. But as Banerjee contemplates the possibilities of 2024, she has to make a set of choices. And it is these choices which will determine her political future, the political future of Bengal, and potentially the future of national politics.The fundamental question for Banerjee is this — does she want to remain focused on Bengal and are her aspirations limited to retaining power in Kolkata’s Nabanna, or does she want to build a national alternative, assume leadership of such an alternative, and, therefore, aim straight for Delhi’s 7, Lok Kalyan Marg? If Banerjee decides to focus only on her state — and there are precedents of CMs who have done so despite electoral success; her neighbour Naveen Patnaik is an example — she will have to focus on a set of priorities. In terms of policy, this involves battling the second wave of Covid-19; tackling the economic distress that will only grow due to the pandemic; restoring a degree of communal harmony in a state that has been battered by the most polarising election campaign in recent history; and working with the Centre on a range of issues, particularly state finances. In terms of politics, this involves dealing with a strong and belligerent opposition in the assembly, and pushing back against the rise of the BJP (for there will be elections again, from the local to the national, where the BJP will remain a formidable force). And ideally, Banerjee should focus on creating a new political culture where Trinamool Congress (TMC) cadres are not engaged in the kind of coercion and violence that was visible during and after the election results — she may have won this time, but the reason that the BJP grew was because of resentment against local TMC units. Unfortunately, politicians often see this form of organisational strength as a source of power, and whether she lets her democratic instinct prevail over undemocratic (and unacceptable) short cuts is to be seen. Taking the state route will give Banerjee an opportunity to consolidate power in Bengal, sort out her internal line of succession (her nephew, Abhishek Banerjee, is already the second-most powerful person in the party and is widely seen as the heir apparent, in a sign that yet another Indian party is falling to the seduction of dynastic politics), establish a bigger presence in Parliament in 2024 with a sole focus on championing Bengal’s interests, and return to power — yet again — in 2026. The disadvantage is that she will remain just another CM — a powerful CM of a powerful state — but a CM nonetheless, and the one thing Indian politicians can’t be faulted for is lack of ambition. It also means less political and policy space within the state, for the national hegemon will constantly be on the lookout to weaken Banerjee. And so, for Banerjee, while continuing to use this period to consolidate her local strength, there is an equally tempting alternative. If she calculates that state politics and national politics cannot be divorced; that there is a political possibility of challenging the BJP (the national political mood is undergoing a shift, given the Centre’s mismanagement of Covid-19, though its electoral implications are less than clear); and that there is a leadership vacuum and only she has the stature among all regional leaders to emerge as a candidate of an alternative front to take on Modi, Banerjee may well take the plunge. But this brings its own set of political challenges and choices. For one, Banerjee will need an entirely new vocabulary and what worked in Bengal will not work nationally. Take all the four elements of her success. She can’t play the Bengali sub-nationalism card while seeking votes from the rest of country (remember how Modi switched from the Gujarati asmita narrative as his national ambitions grew). She cannot depend on welfare — for nationally, the BJP is now seen as a party of welfare and her state-level achievements are not enough to ignite excitement nationally. Minority consolidation is a tricky route — you rely on that and run the risk of majoritarian consolidation, which the BJP is adept at exploiting. And in any case, minority votes will be fragmented across non-BJP forces, depending on who is strong in which region. And the TMC does not have the organisational strength elsewhere in the country (remember, Modi had both the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh and BJP machinery to help him catapult from the state to the national stage). This means that all that Banerjee can realistically aim for is a stellar performance in her own state in 2024. This also means she will have to rely on friendly and aligned parties in the rest of the country. This brings its own set of two choices. One, Banerjee and the Congress have to decide on their relationship. Rahul Gandhi was happy to sit out the Bengal election, knowing well that the Congress had little chance and his politics was better served by a BJP defeat, irrespective of who was the victor. This will, however, not happen nationally. Remember, the Congress still commands the votes of over 120 million Indians — it will not give way to another party easily. For Banerjee, to reconcile her leadership ambitions with the Congress’s sense of self won’t be easy. The second is working with other regional forces. Some leaders may support her ambitions — Arvind Kejriwal is an example. Some leaders will work with Banerjee, but have their own ambitions — for instance, Sharad Pawar. And then there will be others who would rather live with a BJP government at the Centre than allow some of their other competitors to have a chance at power if they don’t get the crown. All of this will shape the question of leadership within the opposition in the run-up to the 2024 battle.But either way, the Bengal election has opened up possibilities. Banerjee’s political choices and how she navigates the national and the local will be a significant variable in national politics.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/the-present-and-future-of-mamata-banerjee-101620479353195.html
08-05-2021||Today's||Soli Sorabjee: The bridge-builder||I remember Soli Sorabjee’s birthday as if it was yesterday. It was his 91st, but this one was special. Last year, because of the pandemic, he couldn’t celebrate his 90th. In 2021, he was determined to make up. Soli was seated in the centre of the room. He had on a beige jacket and a beaming smile. When I went up to wish him, he did what he always does, pull my leg and laugh at my response.“I’ve been watching your interviews and you’re going to get yourself into trouble with the government”. He grinned from ear to ear. In fact, his eyes twinkled. “But don’t worry. I’ve told you I’ll get you out of jail. So carry on making life difficult for them!”Soli thought of me as a pugilist rather than a journalist. He knew I enjoy tripping up people. I think he liked seeing them fall! He never actually said so but he would often call to comment on the denouement and chortle.However, there was an occasion when initially I was certain Soli was out to arrange an incident in his own drawing room. It was June 2019, the year before the pandemic. He invited me to dinner and asked me to come early. “I’d like a little word before the others come,” he said and laughed.Soli made me sit beside him when I arrived. “I’ve got two of your best friends coming this evening”. The look in his eyes seemed to suggest mischief. “Can you guess who they are?”I couldn’t and he wouldn’t tell me either. But I didn’t have long to wait. Soon, law minister Ravi Shankar Prasad and textiles minister Smriti Irani walked in. Frankly, this wasn’t what I expected. I could tell the two ministers were equally taken back. There weren’t many others. Three, maybe four. So it didn’t take them long to register my presence. When they did, their smiles froze. Meanwhile, I glanced at Soli. He was, of course, grinning, He was enjoying the situation he had so artfully, if secretively, crafted.Actually, it turned out to be a rather pleasant evening. The ministers and I were on our best behaviour. Initially, we didn’t speak to each other but when we sat down for dinner, the atmosphere relaxed. Soli kept a scrumptious table and the delicious flavours of his food must have relaxed the mood.Soli waited for the evening to end before saying anything but then he whispered: “Did you enjoy meeting your friends?” I assumed this was his normal teasing. It took a couple of phone calls in the days that followed to realise he was, in fact, trying to repair relations between the government and me. He was creating an opportunity where that might happen.“I thought you were committed to getting me out of jail,” I ribbed when he explained his strategy. “Have you changed your mind?” “Not at all”, he said. “But I thought it might be better if you don’t go there to start with!”The subject didn’t come up again till Soli’s comments on his birthday. Both he and I knew there was little prospect of this or any other government sending me to jail. But it’s comforting to be told by one of the country’s foremost lawyers he’d bail me out. In fact, Soli said it so often I suspect — no, I’m sure — there was a message in the humour. He wasn’t the sort who repeated his jokes again and again. The Soli I will always remember was a steadfast champion of human rights who would not hesitate to tell governments they are wrong. But he never did it hurtfully. Yet, his politeness revealed a steely resolve far stronger than any message conveyed with belligerence and shrillness. Perhaps that also explains the dinner in 2019. It might just have been his way of warning people Karan is a friend.Thank you, Soli. I never said that properly whilst you were alive.Karan Thapar is the author of Devil’s Advocate: The Untold Story The views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/soli-sorabjee-the-bridgebuilder-101620479289624.html
08-05-2021||Today's||Poll results show the power of federalism||In my last column, I warned that the results of the West Bengal elections could further undermine India’s federalism and take the country one step closer to becoming a one-party democracy. Mamata Banerjee’s sweeping victory has shown that even an election-winning machine as well-resourced and as successful nationally as the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) could not resist Bengali federalism. The results also show that federalism could be the way for the Opposition to challenge the BJP nationally.The BJP charged into Bengal promising that it would guarantee the right to shout Jai Shri Ram, a right Bengalis already had and didn’t particularly want to exercise. Their deity is the goddess Durga. Their language, of which they are proud, is Bengali, yet the BJP built its campaign around Hindi-speaking outsiders. Bengalis were not swayed by the fact that the star speakers were the prime minister (PM), the home minister and the BJP president. Bengalis barely starred in the campaign. Aggressive Hindutva thwarted the BJP’s efforts to divide the Muslim vote. And women were shocked at the way even the PM derided Banerjee.For the BJP, the lesson of the election — taken with the results from Kerala and Tamil Nadu — is that India, by its nature, is a federal nation. Its nationalism has to rejoice in its diversity rather than try to bind the nation together in an unnatural uniformity. The Congress’s failure to recognise India’s federal nature is the main reason for its humiliating position. Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury, the party leader in the Lok Sabha, and the man who had the misfortune to head the Congress campaign in Bengal, has asked, “We have been decimated by Mamata Banerjee regionally and by Modiji nationally, so where do we go now?” If, as is all too likely, the party reacts to this disaster in the same manner as it has reacted to disasters since 2014, it will once again go nowhere.For 50 years, the Congress has suffered from a top-down structure which denies its state leaders the freedom to put down their own roots and establish their independence. The structure has been made even more stifling by the absolutism of the Nehru-Gandhi family. The answer to Chowdhury’s question is that the Congress should go on to become a federal party with strong, independent-minded chief ministers. If that were to happen, then there might be a great homecoming of former Congressmen and women who left the party after falling out with the Gandhis. Is it beyond the bounds of possibility that this homecoming could include former Congress leader, Mamata Banerjee? Her triumph has revived talk of a national opposition front. The Janata Party was a hurriedly cobbled together union of six parties which defeated Indira Gandhi. Although the party collapsed amid unseemly brawling over leadership, the Janata government had its achievements. The administration, derailed by the arbitrary interference of Sanjay Gandhi, was put back on the rails and legislation was passed to ensure that there could never be another Emergency of the same nature. The mistake the Janata leaders made was to merge six separate parties into one party. If they had formed a federation, it might well have been flexible enough to survive its full term.If opposition parties now formed a federation, there would be rivalries over the leadership. But if there was agreement that the PM was only to be the first among equals, and would not have the exalted status of that office, it would be easier for leaders of different parties to work together. So where does Banerjee go now? She has said her top priority is the pandemic, and that is as it should be. If she does get involved in national politics, she should never neglect her roots, or forget that a large number of Bengalis did vote for the BJP.The views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/poll-results-show-the-power-of-federalism-101620479232556.html
08-05-2021||Today's||The story of Sikhism, suffering and service||This year marks the 400th birth anniversary of Guru Tegh Bahadur Ji, the ninth Sikh Guru, whose supreme sacrifice for the rights of adherents of another faith has no parallel in history. Indeed, for many, he was the initiator of the idea of human rights and the right of people to follow their own religious beliefs.During his life, he displayed exemplary courage as a warrior along with the art of skilled negotiations, helping iron out differences among warring rajas in North India and Assam. He was also an avid follower of music, composing ragas and bani for the Guru Granth Sahib, the holy book of the Sikhs. Guru Tegh Bahadur Ji was martyred on November 11, 1675, in Delhi’s Chandni Chowk, on the orders of Aurangzeb. Gurudwara Sis Ganj stands at that spot.Immediately after the martyrdom, a huge storm engulfed the area, allowing an ardent disciple to take his body to his home near Raisina village, in what is today New Delhi, and cremate it by burning his own house. Gurudwara Rakab Ganj stands at that site today. The head was spirited to Anandpur Sahib by another disciple and cremated with honours by his son, who thereafter became the 10th Guru taking the name, Guru Gobind Singh Ji. He also decreed that after him, Sikhs would only follow the Guru Granth Sahib as their Guru.Gurudwara Rakab Ganj is just a stone’s throw from another historic Sikh gurudwara in Delhi — Gurudwara Bangla Sahib and, in today’s time of the Covid-19 pandemic, it is worth recalling its connection with the alleviation of suffering.Guru Tegh Bahadur Ji was the youngest son of the sixth Sikh Guru, Guru Hargobind Ji. The Guruship, however, passed from Guru Hargobind Ji to his grandson, Guru Har Rai Ji, who initiated the concept of Miri and Piri (temporal power and spiritual authority — symbolised by the two swords) in Sikhism and built the Akal Takht at the Durbar Sahib complex (Golden Temple) in Amritsar.On the demise of Guru Har Rai Ji, the Guruship passed to his younger son, Guru Harkrishen Ji, who was only five years old at that time. A possible reason was that the elder son of Guru Har Rai Ji had betrayed the faith to the Mughal emperor and was excommunicated.Guru Harkrishen Ji, the eighth Sikh Guru, was invited to Delhi by the Mughal court a few years later and stayed at the bungla (bungalow) of Raja Jai Singh. This is where Gurudwara Bangla Sahib stands today. During his sojourn in Delhi in 1664, the city saw a tremendous outbreak of smallpox and cholera with death all around. At the tender age of seven, Guru Harkrishen Ji, setting aside prevalent prejudices in society, stepped out and offered solace and comfort to all and allowed everyone to use the well in his bungalow to draw water. He contracted smallpox and died even before he could attain the age of eight, laying the foundation of service (sewa) by the Sikhs. Even today, thousands visit Gurudwara Bangla Sahib daily and carry home the Amrit as a cure for disease and suffering in their families. On his death bed, Guru Harkrishen Ji intimated that the next Guru would be found in the village of Baba Bakala in Punjab. And it turned out to be Guru Tegh Bahadur Ji, the youngest son of Guru Har Gobind ji, who was, in fact, in terms of the family relationship, the grandfather of Guru Harkrishen Ji. The tradition of sewa, now ingrained in the Sikh faith, has been visible with the Sikh community doing everything within its capabilities in providing langar (hot food sewa) to all, without discrimination, through the pandemic. And this beautiful Sikh tradition has also been carried forward by the Sikh community all over the world. In Delhi, now, with its dire need for oxygen, gurudwaras have stepped up to even provide oxygen langars — helping thousands daily. Many have wondered how it is the Sikh community which is often the first to mobilise to serve in times of need — the answer lies in the nature of the faith and the teachings of the Gurus. And in Delhi, this history of service goes back close to four centuries.
