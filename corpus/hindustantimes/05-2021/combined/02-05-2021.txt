02-05-2021||Mumbai||Online learning will have impact on students’ future, planning essential: Experts||At a zilla parishad school in Palghar, nearly 30% students have not been able to attend classes since the school moved online in March 2020. Lack of access to technology, poor connectivity and the trauma induced by pandemic-related pressures such as job losses, has meant that many students have remained in schools only on paper. “While the pandemic has left no scope for physical classes, in an area like this, it is a distant dream to see all students online. We have taken all efforts to ensure that their learning doesn’t stop. We call them on their phones, make routine visits to their homes, distribute physical worksheets and a lot more. So, we can say that we are teaching. But how much the students are learning, we really need to assess,” said the principal of the school on the condition of anonymity. As schools, colleges and universities in the state continue to remain online for over a year now, experts now worry about the future repercussions of this shift. While education boards and governments across the country cancelled exams, moved everything online and tried to tweak their teaching-learning process this year, many say that a more long-term solution is needed to plan for the coming years. Many suggest reworking the syllabus, slowing down the teaching-learning process to meet the needs of students and teachers, planning realistically for exams among other things. Francis Joseph, a city-based educationist and the co-founder of SLN Global Network said education boards need to start planning for the next year or two from now as the pandemic has had a huge impact on learning over the last one year. “Boards, schools and everyone needs to realise that this year has been exceptional. Both students and schools had to face a lot of uncertainties and have managed to somewhat sail through. However, there is a learning loss that has been caused during this time. Hence, boards need to slow down a bit, assess what needs to be done to tweak the syllabus a little while working around the challenges with schools,” he added. With rising cases and the resultant lockdown, the Maharashtra government had to cancel its Class 10 SSC exams this year. Other boards such as CBSE, ICSE, IGCSE and IB also took the same call. Experts said a similar decision might have to be taken again in the coming months and years because one cannot predict how the pandemic pans out later. “We need to prepare for the worst. This year, we only did firefighting. We cancelled exams, we moved schools online because it was the need of the hour. But now that we know this can be our state even in the coming years, we need to prepare ourselves better. Schools need to be taught to assess student performance throughout the year, colleges need to be equipped to move their theory and praxis based teaching online and make it more effective,” said Shubhada Mhatre, a civic body teacher in the city. While educational institutes are coming up with the short term and long term plans to address for the coming year, lack of clarity from the governments is turning out to be a hurdle in the process. For instance, in Maharashtra, school and college closures are extended by a few months now and then. In the month of November 2020, when Covid-19 cases in the state had substantially reduced, institutes were asked to ready for a physical reopening. While some schools and junior colleges in Maharashtra could open, many others in cities such as Pune and Mumbai could not. Even the ones that opened in the various districts across the state had to close again as cases rose in April 2021. Institutes said the government can now come up with a slightly longer strategy to indicate in advance whether learning will be online during the coming months. “A lot of investment is required to set up the infrastructure for online learning. During the first wave, we had all our basics in place with a smooth transition from offline to online. While we were planning to invest in more advanced technologies, however, institutes were asked to prepare for a physical reopening. And now we are back to our emphasis on the online mode. Even private institutes which are ready to invest will be able to plan better if the government comes up with a slightly longer plan,” said Hrridaysh Deshpande vice-chancellor DY Patil Group. At this point, most prominent boards are yet to lay down a formal strategy to address concerns around learning losses in the coming months. While the Maharashtra state board did release a set of guidelines for mitigating learning losses in February 2021, the specific details about what schools need to do to assess learning outcomes are yet to be released. “Right now, teaching has sadly remained a formality. We don’t know if the children have learnt what is taught and fear a lot of challenges in the coming years,” said a teacher from a suburban school.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/online-learning-will-have-impact-on-students-future-planning-essential-experts-101619979417695.html

The gram panchayat has decided to pay for testing, hospitalisation, treatment and medicines of Covid-19 patients from the village. The administration has asked the families to send bill receipts to them which will be reimbursed. The panchayat said the initiative is to stand strong by the villagers to encourage people to get tested to ensure timely treatment to avoid fatalities.Khativali village in Shahapur taluka, Thane has a population of around 6,000 villagers; around 45% of them are tribals. There is only one Covid treatment centre in Shahapur taluka and it is 8kms away from the village. If the centre gets full, villagers do not have any other option but to get admitted in a private hospital, but as they could not pay such a huge amount they would avoid going there. Therefore, this administration has assured to pay the hospital bills. There are 6,660 cases of Covid-19 reported in Shahapur Taluka of which 241 are currently active. Around 170 people have died due to the infection. Devidas Jadhav, 43, member of Khativali gram panchayat, said, “Since last year, most of our villagers have lost their jobs. We completely banned the entry of outsiders, and still some people got infected. Twelve of our villagers succumbed to Covid in the first wave. Since the past one month, two to three villagers are testing positive every day. They had gone out mostly to look for jobs. They or their families do not have the proper resources to get tested or treated. So we have decided to help them for the same.”The panchayat also provides ration to the villagers who need them. Gajanan Shinde, a villager, said, “This announcement has provided relief to us as most of us have earned very little in the past one year, and we are using the same for daily groceries. To arrange money for treatment is really a task but now we are little relaxed.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/gram-panchayat-in-shahapur-to-pay-for-covid-19-treatment-of-every-villager-101619979418278.html
02-05-2021||Mumbai||SpiceJet air crew starts online petition against management over pay cut||A day after low-cost carrier SpiceJet deducted up to 50% salary for April for all its employees, citing the second wave of Covid-19 as reason, its air crew on Sunday started an online petition against the management. The online petition stated that despite risking their lives and doing their duties, the employees are underpaid and that some who worked full-time have received very small amounts as their salary. The airline has, however, stated that part of the salary was deferred and will be paid to the employees later. Airline sources said ground staff, cabin crew, commercial staff and pilots were paid only 10% to 50% of their April salary.The petition read, “We all who file this petition want to make a change in how an airline company in India sees their employees...as per the latest Covid-19 survey from Indian Central government, people aged less than 35 years (75% of Covid cases) are most like to get infected with this deadly virus. No matter what survey says or news channel telecasts, we (cabin crew) risked our life to go on-board. We quarantined ourselves, we followed guidelines, we took care of customers on-board...why wouldn’t we speak for ourselves now?... All employees of SpicJet received their salary with massive 50% deduction. Some employees who worked full-time received only ₹12,000…”The cabin crew said that the salary cuts by the airline were mentally affecting them.SpiceJet spokesperson said the airline chairman and managing director Ajay Singh has decided to forgo his entire salary and that the airline is ensuring that most of their colleagues, including those in the lowest pay grade, are not affected at all by this deferment and will be paid salaries in full. “The deadly Covid-19 second wave has resulted in the country’s worst-ever crisis with the aviation sector again bearing the biggest brunt. Unfortunately, we have been forced to implement certain tough measures to secure the long-term interest of the SpiceJet family. There will be no salary cut for any employee. However, under these extreme and unavoidable circumstances we are enduring, we are forced to implement a graded salary deferment for some of our employees. This is only a temporary measure and the deferred salary amount will be paid by the company in full once the condition improves,” the airline spokesperson added.In an internal communication to its pilots on Saturday, the airline said the domestic passenger traffic across all airlines, which had peaked at more than 300,000 passengers on a daily basis in mid-February, has now drastically dropped to less than 130,000 passengers per day. “..The salary deferment (of between 10% and 50%) in the higher pay grades is a temporary measure to survive this economic crisis and the deferred salaries will be paid by the company once the conditions improve,” read the internal mail.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/spicejet-air-crew-starts-online-petition-against-management-over-pay-cut-101619979357658.html

02-05-2021||Other||Pharma firms must supply Remdesivir vials to Maharashtra on time: Bombay HC||Taking note of chaos prevailing due to multiple procurement methods of Remdesivir vials, the Nagpur bench of Bombay high court (HC) on Sunday directed the chief secretary of Maharashtra to act immediately and remove the confusion leading to delay in getting the life-saving drug for Covid-19, from seven manufacturers. The HC also directed the chief secretary to immediately go for centralised procurement and distribute the drug in a fair and equitable manner to all the districts, consistent with the order of the Centre.Taking pharmaceutical companies to task for their failure to adhere to the supply schedule, the HC made it clear that all the seven manufacturers of Remdesivir shall supply vials to the state as per the allotment guidelines, and only after the quota allotted to them is fulfilled, they can distribute remaining vials to private parties. In case of any violation, the FDA has been directed to prosecute such an erring pharma company for violating directions of the court and for jeopardising precious human life.All pharma companies have been directed to submit their daily production figures of Remdesivir and life-saving drugs to tackle Covid to the FDA commissioner and upload on their website. Any violation will attract criminal prosecution, the high court warned.The HC also expressed unhappiness over curtailment in state quota by Centre for the next nine days and asked the Centre to consider its decision. As per the latest order issued by the Union health ministry, Maharashtra will cumulatively get 809,500 vials up to May 9 which includes the earlier 4.35 lakh vials. The HC noted that such reduction is not consistent with a reduction in the number of active cases in the state which still has the highest number of active patients in the country.Hours before Nagpur bench of Bombay HC began its emergent hearing on Sunday afternoon for non-compliance of its order to supply 20,000 Remdesivir vials to Nagpur, Akola and Bhandara districts, the state government quietly dispatched 19,128 vials while by Sunday afternoon another trench of 960 vials was received.The FDA commissioner Parimal Singh and Nodal Officer Vijay Waghmare informed a division bench consisting of Justice Sunil Shukre and Justice Avinash Gharote about this development during the special hearing. Since Nagpur has not received a single vial in the last two days so also districts of Bhandara and Akola, forcing the high court to release 15,000 vials for Nagpur, 2,000 for Bhandara and 3,000 vials for Akola as interim relief without disturbing the regular quota. But till Saturday night there was no word about Remdesivir allotment, after which Amicus Curiae Shreerang Bhandarkar moved an application seeking urgent hearing and action for breach of the order.The machinery swung into action and before the hearing commenced informed the HC about the receipt of 19,128 vials received for three districts and allotment of 960 more vials by Sunday evening.The HC made it clear that state FDA must ensure supply of allotted quantity as well quantity not supplied during last 10 days to all districts every day and procure it from pharma companies while casting duty on companies to adhere to supply schedule given to them or else coercive action will be ordered against them for any deliberate default.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/pharma-firms-must-supply-remdesivir-vials-to-maharashtra-on-time-bombay-hc-101619979057752.html
02-05-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra sees slight dip in cases, positivity rate up||Maharashtra witnessed a drop in the Covid-19 cases on Sunday to 56,647 from over 60,000 cases in the preceding six days. The state reported a further drop in weekly cases, establishing the government’s claim of stabilisation of the cases. The state tally stands at 4,722,401 and the death toll at 70,284 after the addition of 669 fresh deaths.The curve of the Covid-19 cases in the state appears to be stabilising as the daily average of cases dropped to 61,053 in the last one week from April 26 to May 2 by reporting 427,374 new cases.The previous week, April 19-April 25, reported a total of 460,689 new Covid-19 cases with a daily average of 65,812 cases per day. According to the state authorities, the lowering of figures has helped in reducing the load on the health infrastructure like hospital beds, oxygen cylinders, ventilators as well as various medicines which were scarce for the last couple of week. Dr Tatyarao Lahane, director, Directorate of Medical Education and Research (DMER) said that cases have come down this week. “We have seen the new cases stabilising in 19 districts across the state. The numbers will come down further in the next 15 days. The stabilisation will be replicated across the other districts too in the coming days,” he added.“This trend has reduced the load on our medical infrastructure also. There is no problem now with the oxygen supply and people are the hospital beds are available to patients,” said Lahane. In the last few weeks, due to a surge in Covid-19 cases and the number of deaths was due to a shortage of beds, oxygen cylinders and ventilators as well as medicines like Remdesivir. State authorities have projected that as many as 28 districts will fall short of the required isolation beds, 25 in oxygen beds, 18 in intensive care units (ICU) beds by May 11 if the number of active cases rose as per the prediction. As many as 13 districts will face shortage of ventilators if the active cases rose. Meanwhile, Mumbai on Sunday reported 3,629 new Covid-19 cases, and 79 deaths, taking the tally to 655,997, and the toll to 13,294. There are 61,436 active Covid-19 cases in the city. In the last 24 hours, Mumbai has conducted 28,636 tests. The daily positivity rate for Sunday is 12.67%. So far, Mumbai has conducted 5,490,241 tests, with an average positivity rate of 11.9%. On Sunday, 5,542 Covid patients recovered and were discharged. The present recovery rate is 89%. Mumbai’s doubling rate has now increased to 103 days, from as low as 45 days reported in the first two weeks of April. The overall growth rate of Covid-19 cases in the city is 0.66%.Dr Amin Kaba, who is associated with several hospitals, said, “In urban pockets, we have sufficient infrastructure, but this is not the case with rural areas where even basic medical care is very hard to find.” He said there is an acute shortage of medical professionals which has contributed to the rise. “We have noticed that by the time the patient is shifted to a far-flung urban centre, he has lost precious time. This needs to be rectified,” said Kaba. The state has currently 6,68,353 active Covid-19 patients in which Pune leads the tally with 1,09,254 cases followed by 72,503 cases. Similarly, the state has recorded 70,284 deaths of which 13,294 deaths followed by 9,709 in Pune. There were 2,57,470 tests conducted in the last 24 hours in the state with a positivity rate of 22%.

02-05-2021||Pune||BJP defeats MVA candidate to snatch seat from NCP in Pandharpur-Mangalwedha bypoll||Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)’s Samadhan Autade defeated his rival candidate and Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) nominee backed by Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) Bhagirath Bhalke in a closely contested bypoll for Pandharpur-Mangalwedha seat in Maharashtra’s Solapur district. Bhalke’s defeat dealt a major setback to Maha Vikas Aghadi government, especially the NCP, as the seat was represented by party legislator Bharat Bhalke whose demise due to post-Covid-19 complications in November last year necessitated polls here. The NCP chose Bharat’s son Bhagirath Bhalke against local businessman Autade, factoring sympathy wave in view of sitting legislator’s demise even as voters preferred otherwise. Autade was polled 1,09,450 votes compared to 1,05,717 votes to Bhalke at the end of counting, which saw neck-and-neck fight between the two contestants. While Autade won the polls, margin remained slender till 38th round when BJP candidate was declared winner by a difference of 3,733 votes. Political observers said that the victory for BJP in bypoll is a major boost for the party as its nominee defeated candidate who had backing of three parties – NCP, Congress and Shiv Sena. “Despite NCP, Congress and Shiv Sena coming together, these parties could not ensure victory for Bhalke in first directly fought battle after MVA came to power in 2019. This will be projected by BJP that it can defeat MVA even if three parties jointly field a candidate,” said Abhay Deshpande, political observer. From NCP, deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar had personally anchored the election for party, right from selecting the candidate to campaigning here for a week in a row. “The entire MVA government was against me. However, voters of Pandharpur - Mangalwedha sided with me while Prashant Paricharak and other BJP leaders took every possible effort to make this victory possible,” said Autade after the results were declared. Leader of opposition and former CM Devendra Fadnavis while congratulating Autade, said, “Pandharpur voters showed the mirror to MVA and its misgovernance of one and half years. Despite using all its might, MVA nominee lost elections.” Earlier in 2019, Autade had fought assembly polls and garnered over 54,000 votes as an independent candidate. During this election, Autade was extended all possible support by BJP leader and its legislator in the Maharashtra Legislative Council (MLC) Prashant Paricharak. Prashant’s uncle Sudhakar Paricharak, who died of Covid in August last year helped BJP through sympathy vote. Shiv Sena spokesperson Sanjay Raut said Pandharpur result is unlikely to have an impact on state politics. “It is true that we should have won this bypoll when all three parties had come together. However, local factors seem to have influenced the outcome,” said Raut. Besides issue of pending water pipeline project for Mangalwedha, the dues not paid to cane farmers by Bhalke controlled sugar factory went against the NCP candidate. Congress leader Satej Patil said, “Multiple factors may have contributed to the loss of MVA candidate. I don’t think we fielded a wrong candidate but there may have been some laxity in taking all elements along.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/bjp-defeats-mva-candidate-to-snatch-seat-from-ncp-in-pandharpur-mangalwedha-bypoll-101619972397560.html
02-05-2021||Pune||Pune police question women who received funds meant for sex workers||Two days after the Pune district collector Rajesh Deshmukh initiated a probe in the misappropriation of funds meant for sex workers, the Pune police have begun questioning women who received the money. Besides Annabhau Sathe Nagar, Tarawade vasti, Mohammadwadi, the police have now found that some women living in Dattawadi slums have received ₹15,000 in their accounts. This was brought to their notice by Nitin Waghmare, founder Akhil Bharatiya Bahujan Sena. The amount which was released by the Maharashtra government as financial aid to be paid to sex workers as part of an amount of ₹7.94 crore, it was deposited into the bank accounts of maids and waste pickers living in Annabhau Sathe Nagar, Tarawade vasti, Mohammadwadi and now according to police, in women in Dattawadi Slums. “We are still following up on the information received and in the process of interviewing the women who received the money. So far, we have interviewed 10 women but yet to get to the culprits,” said police inspector K Indulkar of Dattawadi police station. Meanwhile, the women in Mohammadwadi are feeling embarrassed and undignified for being recognized as sex workers. “I never realized what I was getting into when I signed on the form that the woman gave me,” said Lata Yedke, who is afraid of breaking this news to her husband who is away in the village. “I work hard as a maid and when these women approached us saying that the government and foreigners together have started a scheme for poor women, I thought this could help me get out of the rented place we have, but instead it has embarrassed me. I would not even like to touch this money and I want to return it at the earliest,” she added. Gangubai Gaikwad who was made aware that the funds were meant for the sex workers, said, “I am glad I did not receive the money. I was upset earlier when few of the women in my Vasti got it but now I don’t want it at all.” Vijaya Kundale, recalls a woman sitting with a neighbour and all of them filling up forms, so when approached, she too filled up the form. “I was told that by giving my ration card copy, aadhar card and bank details, I was going to get money from government. I lost my work during Covid last year, so I thought this was good, but now, it has become shameful and feel undignified to be even part of this scheme.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/pune-police-question-women-who-received-funds-meant-for-sex-workers-101619972337444.html

02-05-2021||Pune||In a first, uGMRT reveals patchy environment of a rare cosmic explosion||The scientists from the National Centre for Radio Astrophysics (NCRA) of the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research (NCRA-TIFR) Pune used the upgraded Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (uGMRT) to determine that AT 2018 cow, the first of a newly discovered class of cosmic explosions has an extremely patchy environment. This is the first observational evidence of inhomogeneous emission from an FBOT. The origins of FBOTs are still under debate, but proposed models include explosion of a massive star, collision of an accreting neutron star and a star, merger of two white dwarfs. The FBOT AT2018cow was discovered on June 16, 2018. At a distance of about 215 million lightyears, the ‘cow’ showed luminosities much greater than that of normal supernovae. Prof Poonam Chandra from NCRA-TIFR and Dr AJ Nayana, a former Ph.D. student of Prof Chandra both carried out radio observations of AT 2018cow with the uGMRT to determine the properties of its extended environment and emission region. “Our study has tremendously benefited by the unique low-frequency capabilities of the uGMRT. The uGMRT observations of the ‘cow’ played a unique role in finding the non-uniform density around this explosion. Our work provides the first observational evidence of inhomogeneous emission from an FBOT. The density of the material around this explosion falls drastically around 0.1 light-year from the transient. This indicates that the progenitor star of AT2018cow was shedding mass much faster towards its end of life.” said Nayana. AT 2018cow is also unusual in that it has been observable in the radio for a very long time. The longer one can observe the post explosion emission, the more distance the material that was ejected during the explosion has travelled. This allows one to study the large-scale environment of the source. Both Dr Nayana and Prof Chandra have been observing the ‘cow’ for two years with the uGMRT to understand its properties. “This is the first FBOT seen for this long at low radio frequencies and the uGMRT data gave crucial information about the environment of this transient. This is the beauty of low-frequency radio observations. One gets to trace the footprints of the progenitor system much before it exploded. It is interesting that the material from the explosion is moving with speed greater than 20 per cent speed of light even after ∼ 257 days post-explosion, without any deceleration.” said Prof Chandra.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/in-a-first-ugmrt-reveals-patchy-environment-of-a-rare-cosmic-explosion-101619972157480.html

This means a reduction of 60,500 vials of Remdesivir for Maharashtra," the judges said.The bench observed that such a reduction in the allocation of Remdesivir vials to Maharashtra is not consistent with the number of active cases in the state."On April 30, the number of active cases in Maharashtra was 6,72,000 while the same is 6,64,000 as of May 1, which means active cases reduced hardly by about 1.2 per cent, whereas the reduction in the allocation of vials to Maharashtra for the aforesaid period is by 14.5 per cent."This mismatch needs to be reconsidered and removed by the Central government,"the bench said.The high court also said that the Additional Solicitor General of India Ulhas Aurangabadkar would take instructions from the Union government on this issue and apprise the bench.In the same vein, the bench asked the Centre to reconsider its decision regarding the state-wise allocation of Remdesivir for the aforesaid period of ten days (from May 1 to 9) and increase the quota for Maharashtra to make it consistent with the reduced number of active cases.Maharashtra FDA Commissioner Parimal Singh submitted in the HC that they will issue new orders ensuring that the districts affected by Remdesivir shortage will get the supply and the backlog is cleared.Singh told the HC the FDA will meet representatives of pharma companies and ensure they follow the directions at the district level.The bench directed that no pharmaceutical company, which is duty-bound to supply Remdesivir vials as per the Centre's orders dated April 24 and May 1 to different states and Maharashtra, shall supply the drug to private purchasers unless the daily quota of the supply allocated to each of these companies is fulfilled."Only after that and in case of any remaining balance of Remdesivir vials, the pharma company concerned shall supply the vials to private purchasers till the fulfilment of orders received by them," the bench said.The bench directed the health secretary of Maharashtra and state FDA commissioner to ensure that these directions are followed by pharmaceutical companies concerned.The HC also directed the pharma firms to send their daily production figures to the state FDA commissioner and also upload them on respective websites.The bench warned of strict legal action for violation of its orders.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/increase-allocation-of-remdesivir-to-maharashtra-hc-tells-centre-101619967709712.html

The attack happened around 8:30am near Bopdev ghat in Kondhwa area of Pune. The arrested man was identified as Dinesh Shirpat Dhumak (39), a resident of Bavdhangaon in Pune who repairs water-filter for a living. A local court has remanded the man to two days in police custody. “She works as a housemaid and due to Covid regulations; she had started living in the building where she works. She had come to visit. The people from nearby area heard her screaming and informed the police,” said police sub inspector Vaishali Gapat of Kondhwa police station who is investigating the case. Dhumak picked up the woman on his motorbike and took her to the spot near Bopdev ghat where he stopped his bike and asked her to show where her workplace was. When the woman refused to reveal where she went to work, Dhumak allegedly said to the woman that he wanted to see her face and asked her to take her mask off. As the woman took her mask off, he retrieved the bottle he was carrying and flung the liquid at her, aiming for her face. However, as the woman ducked the liquid landed on her left eye and left hand.

Senior police inspector Meghshyam Dange of Kothrud police station received a call at 8:30am from Krushna Hospital that the hospital was left with oxygen supply that could last only for 30-40 minutes, according to a statement issued by Kothrud police station. The hospital was not able to source oxygen and had no place to shift the 20 patients on oxygen support. “After receiving the call, senior police inspector Meghshyam Dange sent officials of Kothrud police station to the hospital and arranged for four jumbo cylinders from two nearby hospitals -Suryaprabha Hospital and Sahyadri Hospital,” read the statement. However, those four jumbo cylinders were not going to last for long for the patients on ventilator as well as oxygen support. The gravity of the situation was relayed to Pournima Gaikwad, deputy commissioner of police, Zone-3 and Gajanan Tompe, assistant commissioner of police. The senior officers rallied local police station officials and Special police officers (SPOs) who arranged for a dura cylinder from Shivajinagar and got a crane as well as a vehicle to carry it to Kothrud. The police escorted the dura cylinder to Krushna hospital in time to save the patients from shortage of oxygen.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/kothrud-hospital-runs-out-of-oxygen-police-avert-tragedy-101619967777302.html

Former employee union leader and chairman of Jammu and Kashmir Civil Society Forum (JKCSF), Abdul Qayoom Wani expressed resentment over the dismissal calling it a jab on the employees’ integrity.“The dismissal of Idrees Ahmad, teacher of a Kupwara school, and other two employees came as a strange shiver to the whole Kashmir society under the shade of Article 311 and neglecting all other disciplinary service rules that govern the employees’ performance and conduct of his service career,” Wani said.“This type of dismissal from government service remains ambiguous until facts are made public and/or subjected to the judicial system for legal proceedings,” he said.The JKCSF has demanded that the decision must be revoked and reviewed judiciously under the service norms so that justice can prevail.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/in-a-first-kashmir-teacher-dismissed-in-interest-of-security-of-state-101619966578163.html

02-05-2021||Dehradun||Salt bypoll: BJP’s Mahesh Jeena wins election, defeats Cong’s Ganga Pancholi||Bharatiya Janata Party’s Mahesh Jeena won the Salt bypoll in Uttarakhand, defeating Congress’s Ganga Pancholi, with over 4,600 votes, as per the statistics. Jeena bagged 21,874 votes while his rival from Congress got 17,177 votes. The rest of the five candidates could register less than 1,000 votes. The number of people who opted for NOTA (None of the Above) was 721, while the number of rejected votes was 63, said district administration officials. Devendra Bhasin, state BJP spokesperson, said victory in Salt shows people in the state continue to repose their trust in the BJP and its working. “This is very clear now that in the elections next year, people will again vote for the BJP. This win would be a tribute to Jeena as his brother will now carry forward his dreams of development in the area. He has fought for the development of Salt and people never forgot that Congress tried various tricks in its bag to mislead people. People of Salt constituency have given a befitting reply to them,” he said. Suryakant Dhasmana, state Congress vice president said the party lost the elections as the BJP played the ‘sympathy card’. “Their campaigning was not focussed on the main issues faced by the people of the state. They just focussed on the sympathy factor. Otherwise, tell in which area of the state is the youth happy with the state government? The youth wants employment, relief from the price hike, better health infrastructure. Where is all that? People are dying because it is not there”, he said. The by-election for Salt constituency in Uttarakhand’s Almora district, which has 96,241 voters - 49,193 make and 47,048 female voters, was held on April 17. The constituency was lying vacant after BJP MLA Surendra Singh Jeena succumbed to Covid-19 last November, necessitating fresh elections. The BJP fielded Jeena’s elder brother Mahesh Jeena as its candidate, while from Congress’ side Ganga Pancholi was given a ticket. Pancholi stood against Surendra Singh Jeena in the 2017 state assembly polls but lost by about 3,000 votes. As a litmus test ahead of the assembly elections in the state next year, both parties tried hard to woo the voters with senior party leaders from both parties holding poll rallies in support of their respective candidates. During the campaigning, the BJP focussed on its achievements, development plank, good work done by their deceased legislator and the promise that if their candidate is elected, they will redress all the issues faced by the people of the area. Congress focussed on highlighting that BJP made tall promises of development and employment to the public of the state during the poll campaigning in 2017, but failed on every aspect of development in the last four years of its rule. Congress tried to make unemployment its main election issue. MM Semwal, political expert and professor of political science at Garhwal Central University, Srinagar, Pauri Garhwal, said results of this bypoll have hinted at the public mood for the next assembly polls. “It was also the first test for both CM Tirath Singh Rawat and BJP state president Madan Kaushik who have been newly appointed. And this results will force Congress to evaluate itself for the next year,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/dehradun-news/salt-bypoll-bjp-s-mahesh-jeena-wins-election-defeats-cong-s-ganga-pancholi-101619965978233.html
02-05-2021||Lucknow||Bahraich man, friends gift oxygen generator machine to medical college||A 40-year-old businessman and his friends pooled in money to buy an oxygen generator machine and gifted it to the government medical college in Bahraich, enabling Covid-19 positive patients with fluctuating SPO2 (oxygen saturation) levels to visit the Level-1 Covid care facility there to get relief.Sarwar Ali, who took the initiative and emerged as an “oxygen man” for the residents of Bahraich battling the second wave of Covid-19, said he was shocked by the death of kin, friends and neighbours.“Daily, I received information about the death of Covid-19 patients after the second wave hit the district. In a majority of the cases, the patients’ family members said that the deaths were due to a drop in oxygen level or the unavailability of oxygen support in hospitals,” he said.“Experts and doctors told me if the oxygen supply was not boosted in hospitals or oxygen support was not provided to patients immediately, more people will fall prey to SARS-CoV-2,” he said.“I discussed the issue with my friends and whether anything could be done to make oxygen available to patients in dire need of it. We searched the Internet for oxygen supply, air separator plants and other oxygen manufacturing machines. We decided to gift an oxygen machine to the government hospital where a majority of the poor patients are admitted,” said Ali who has done Masters in Computer Application (MCA) from Lucknow University and belongs to Bahraich.“We zeroed in on an oxygen generator machine manufactured by a South Korean company. We contacted the company’s agent in Gurugram (Haryana). He told us the machine will cost ₹20 lakh. With the contribution of friends, we pooled in ₹16 lakh. We contacted the company agent again and urged him to cut the price on humanitarian grounds. To our surprise, he agreed. The money was transferred into the company’s account on April 15,” he said.Now, the task was to transport the machine from Gurugram to Bahraich immediately, he said.“We informed district magistrate Shambhu Kumar about our endeavour. He assured all help and deputed the joint magistrate to accomplish the task. Within four days, the machine was transported to Bahraich. The company’s engineer was called from Ambedkar Nagar to install the plant on the state medical college premises. On April 23, the oxygen generator was operational, providing oxygen to the supply line of Covid wards. It has the capacity of producing 64,800 litres of oxygen in 24 hours. A large number of patients are surviving on this oxygen support,” he said.The district magistrate said the initiative taken by Ali and his friends was laudable. He said, “Other people should also come forward to help people in distress.”Sarwar said Uttar Pradesh and the rest of the country were facing an unprecedented crisis due to Covid-19.“It’s impossible for the government to provide health facilities and services to all patients. People, particularly those who have money, should assist the government and the poor in fighting the pandemic,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/bahraich-man-friends-gift-oxygen-generator-machine-to-medical-college-101619964957191.html

Their kin alleged that the deaths were caused due to shortage of oxygen, a claim strongly denied by the administration as well as the hospital management. Financial commissioner, health and medical education department, Atal Dulloo appointed divisional commissioner, Jammu Dr Raghav Langer, as the inquiry officer and asked him to probe the circumstances leading to the deaths at the hospital. Consequently, Langer constituted a three-member committee, comprising director health services (Jammu), director industries and commerce (Jammu), and superintendent engineer, mechanical engineering department, Jammu, the officials said. One among them is also a member of a panel constituted last month to ensure an adequate and timely supply of medical oxygen to hospitals. The three-member committee was formed to assist the inquiry officer during the proceedings of the probe, they said. Following the death of the four patients, their family members created a ruckus and accused hospital management of negligence that led to the death of their loved ones.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/govt-orders-probe-forms-3-member-panel-after-4-covid-19-patients-die-at-jammu-hospital-101619963817742.html

Our country is suffering from oxygen and vaccine shortage. In such a condition, it is important to check the spread of Covid-19,” said Mahipal Singh Yadav, a farmer and social activist, who set up the steam facility. Yadav said, “I too wanted to do something for society at this juncture so I decided to develop the community steaming facility free of cost to help people.” 45-year-old Yadav calls his facility “Bhaap Ka Langar”. He set up the facility with 200 litres capacity barrel, an oven and an LPG gas cylinder on a handcart. He boils the water to generate steam which is then let out through a plastic pipe. Yadav said, “Since taking steam is very beneficial in cold and cough, it helps in checking the spread of Covid-19. I am providing this service for two hours every morning and evening”. He parks his steam facility on a handcart near a private bus station on Haldwani road from 8 to 10 in the morning and 4 to 6 in the evening. His motto is to provide steam to daily wagers and other factory labourers and agricultural field workers on their way to work and on their way back home. “It is not certain how long the ‘Bhaap Ka Langar’ will run but I will try to keep it running till the second wave of Covid-19 ends,” Yadav added. Sony Nagi, another social activist from Bazpur said, “Everybody knows how important taking steam is for health. Yadav’s ‘Bhaap Ka Langar’ is playing an important role in maintaining people’s health.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/dehradun-news/uttarakhand-man-starts-bhaap-ka-langar-to-help-people-amid-covid-19-surge-101619959377661.html

With this initiative, the state will be well equipped in oxygen generation with nine plants in all.These dedicated plants will be established at identified government hospitals in district headquarters across various states/UTs. The procurement will be done through the health ministry.Chief Minister Conrad Sangma, while thanking Prime Minister Narendra Modi, said, “The allocation of funds to install 551 PSA #Oxygen Generation Plants in public health facilities across the country through #PMCares is a propitious decision to curb the oxygen crisis & help those in need especially during these times.

In the process, many cops have succumbed to the virus. But now, Delhi Police has set up three special Covid Care Centres, one each in Shahdara, Rohini and Dwarka, for its personnel and their families. “These centres come as a relief since they are dedicated to our needs,” says Sudesh, wife of Delhi Police constable Bijender Deswal, adding, “My husband became Covid positive last year. Though he didn’t have to get hospitalised, but we were very worried. Today, there are so many police officers whose families or they themselves are battling Covid-19. So the initiative to open these Covid centres comes as a blessing because we can be now assured that incase we get infected, we will be taken care of!” “These facilities have been made for immediate relief of patients before they find admission in the hospital. While Shahdara and Rohini are operational, Dwarka PTS will also soon be operational,” says Chinmoy Biswal, DCP Crime and PRO, Delhi Police. He adds that “Delhi Police resources will cater to the facility and provide medicines, an ambulance for emergencies, and a police team under an Inspector, which will look after the facility and coordination in each place.”At Shahdara Covid Care Centre — the biggest of the three — R Sathiyasundaram, DCP Shahdara, informs that 16 police personnel and their family members are quarantined at present. He adds, “We have a capacity of 78 beds, including 30 oxygen beds. We have one doctor and one nurse from Guru Teg Bahadur Hospital, who are working round the clock, along with four more medical personnel. A special corona kit is also being made available to the personnel getting admitted, which includes essentials such as sanitisers, handwash, masks, slippers and other toiletries. We are trying to ensure that the health parameters of people who are Covid positive can be stabilised before hospitalisation.” Collaborating on this project with Delhi Police, is a Delhi-based non-profit organisation, Sewa Bharati, to provide oxygen cylinders to these Covid Care Centres. Hemant Kumar, vice-president of the organisation, says, “Delhi Police is doing immense amount of work to ensure law and order in the city while also providing basic necessities to the people. We had a dialysis centre where we had certain oxygen cylinders that had been donated to us; we are now providing these to Delhi Police’s Covid Care Centres, as well as other underprivileged patients around the Capital.

Most searched for information available online related to investing and trading. It was a strange coincidence that when the wheels of the economy had stopped moving, the stock markets were going through the roof. The common man could not understand this irony and many thought it was just a bubble created by some crazy investors.However, one year down the line, it has now been established with data and statistics that even during the harshest lockdown, common people overcame the “market-fear” and were willing to invest money and trade online. One such trend has also been highlighted by subscription-based online financial education platform LearnApp.com.The online education start-up founded by Prateek Singh has seen a huge surge in first-time investors who have subscribed to learn about trading and investing. 0.15 million Puneites registered for a variety of courses in the one year of the pandemic, 2020-21, on the platform. This is 2x higher than the subscribers from Mumbai. Their data also reveals that 8 per cent of these subscribers are women, aged between 25-34 years of age. While the world was crippled with financial insecurities, first-time investors from Pune saw this as an opportunity to learn something new and grow.In the beginning...Singh says, “In the summer of 2007, I had my first tryst with the whole concept of trading. My father opened a Demat account for me, and my first trade was in a company called Milk Food. That was followed by the global market crash of 2008 and from there on, it took me about six years to achieve profitability consistently. Ideally, it shouldn’t have taken that long, but the reality was there weren’t any resources to learn from for a new market participant. I had to make those mistakes and learn from them.”“Not only was I passionate about trading, but I also wanted to build a platform where people can learn from my experience. I founded a start-up called Market Scientist in 2014, with the idea of creating videos and blogs teaching personal finance, business, investing and trading. There were a bunch of people who thought videos will never work. As an entrepreneur, I wanted to build something and measure the results with real users, rather than spend my time listening to opinions. I moved on from Market Scientist and decided to launch LearnApp in 2018 with Ankush Oberoi, Swati Sharma and Sohail Alam.”Lockdown experienceWhen the lockdown was announced, people had more time since they were working from home, and at the same time, there was a lot of activity in the stock market as well. Says Singh, “This is where we saw two changes in customer behaviour - first, online became an acceptable mode of learning; second, online webinars became an extended form of learning. We were already leaders in the financial space and with the help of these two, we were able to reach more people.”“In the initial days of the lockdown we saw a spike in users, but the same users didn’t stay with us by end of April. To be honest, until last year there were several small issues that needed to be fixed because of which we saw lower completion rates. We had to fix that, and the only way we could that was by speaking to each of our users by taking their feedback and iterating each of our courses. It took us a while to fix these bugs, but as soon as they were fixed, our completion rates went from less than 30 per cent to over 50 per cent.”Explaining further, he says, “Our yearly subscription model also helped increase the completion rate and acquire new subscribers during the lockdown. Users had more time to explore the platform and they began to love the content we were creating, giving us a great completion rate. Many new users who were looking forward to learning about markets reached out to LearnApp and took their first online course with us.”Taking care of his team was also a priority for Singh. He said, “The environment in March 2020 was uncertain and a lot of businesses were shutting down. To make sure our teammates do not have to worry about their jobs we started paying salaries two days early and offered micro-loans if someone needed help in their family. This really helped build trust and remove uncertainties that they may have had about their future. In the end, it is the team and the consumers, and catering to them is what kept the business afloat even in the worst of the crisis.”Millenial Money: a global trendAccording to the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) data, new dematerialised or demat account additions rose to an all-time high of 10.7 million between April 2020 and April 2021. This is an increase of 2x in new demat accounts opened in FY20-21. Interestingly, not only has there been a surge in the first-time users, global data trends have also shown that in the post pandemic world, younger or millennial investors in India have started opening demat accounts to start trading, in sync with the global trend.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/startup-mantra-punekars-stock-up-on-share-market-lessons-101619952057704.html

He is one of five powerful “Jarkiholi brothers” who wield significant influence over the border district and its politics.Belagavi bypoll was necessitated after the death of four-time parliamentarian Suresh Angadi in September last year.Two of Satish’s brothers, Ramesh and Balachandra, are legislators with the BJP.If the trends hold, the defeat would deal a big blow to Karnataka chief minister BS Yediyurappa and is likely to open the floodgates of dissent that has been simmering for some time within his government and party.The Congress, if trends continue, appear to have wrested control of Maski assembly constituency with the imminent defeat of Pratapgouda Patil, one of the 17 legislators who defected to the BJP and helped Yediyurappa to power in 2019. Patil has 24,516 votes as against Basanagouda Turvihal of the Congress who has stormed away with 39,790 votes so far.“It appears that there is an anti-wave against me. I don’t know why since I had done enough developmental work for this constituency,” Patil told reporters in Raichur.A defeat for Patil would go against CM Yediyurappa, who benefitted from the former’s defection, as the latter had assured to reward the turncoats for their favour.Patil had won three times on a Congress ticket before he defected in 2019. However, he had won by just 213 votes in 2018 against Turvihal, who had then contested on a BJP ticket. The candidates switched parties this time around.The only reason for BJP and Yediyurappa to cheer came from Basavakalyana where its candidate Sharanu Salagar was leading with 15,052 votes against Congress’ Mala B Narayanarao who secured 7,900 votes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/satish-jarkiholi-makes-strong-gains-against-bjp-s-mala-suresh-angadi-in-belagavi-bypolls-101619948156958.html

The injuries on his body indicated he had been beaten mercilessly before being shot dead. Both his hands were also tied to each other, said a doctor at [the district hospital?], where Oraon’s body was taken for post-mortem.“The angry crowd didn’t allow the doctors to conduct post-mortem and forcibly took the body away,” a senior doctor, who didn’t wish to be named, said.Oraon, who unsuccessfully contested from Katihar’s reserved Manihari seat in last year’s assembly elections, was abducted last Thursday very close to his house following which his abductors demanded ₹10 lakh in ransom.While his sister Seema Devi filed a missing report at Khazanchi Hat police station, Oraon’s family also paid the ransom to kidnappers feeling it was likely to safeguard against any threat to his life.“Despite the family paying the ransom of ₹10 lakh, the leader was killed,” said a person close to the family.“Oraon was killed due to a land dispute,” said LJP state general secretary, Shankar Jha, demanding immediate arrest of the culprits.Station house officer of Khazanchi Hat police station Sunil Kumar Mandal claimed they had carried out raids and the murder case will soon be resolved.Three persons including a woman were earlier detained in the case. Police claimed recovery of Oraon’s body was done on the basis of information received from these detainees. “Further probe is underway,” police said.A police officer aware of the developments in the case claimed that the current investigation was driven by two possible motives including land dispute.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/abducted-ljp-leader-found-murdered-in-bihar-violent-protests-break-out-101619946297072.html

He told me my video has hurt religious feelings and I have no right to mock religion. I felt he was right so I apologised and withdrew the video," Kaushal said."I had no intention of hurting anybody's religious feelings. The video had a message against infanticide in the end," the comedian added.A Hind Rakshak spokesperson said Kaushal withdrew the video about Navratri after the organisation issued him a "first and last warning".It was on Eklavya Singh's complaint that Faruqui and some others were arrested in January for a stand-up act at a cafe in Indore.Faruqui was released a month later after the Supreme Court gave him bail.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bhopal-news/mp-comedian-withdraws-video-after-objection-from-outfit-of-bjp-mla-s-son-101619942470901.html

The commission said candidates and their supporters were allowed at the centres only after showing negative Covid-19 reports amid some reports of flouting of the norms. Those, who have had both Covid-19 vaccine shots, were also being allowed.“The results of the village pradhans [heads] election will start coming in from late Sunday night. The results of kshetra [regional] panchayat and zila [district] panchayat members may be available only on May 3 [Monday],” said an SEC official, who did not wish to be named. He said counting started simultaneously in all 75 districts for 58,176 posts of gram pradhan (village heads), 7,32,485 village ward members, and 75,852 kshetra panchayat members along with 3,051 zila panchayat members.“The counting will continue till the last result comes,” he said, adding that the first results may start trickling in from Sunday night.More than 1.2 million candidates were in the fray. As many as 45,00,00 of them tried their luck for the posts of gram pradhans.The guidelines issued by state election commissioner Manoj Kumar on Friday for the counting mandated the setting up of health desks across all the centres. They also directed the availability of medicines and deployment of doctors there. “Anyone showing symptoms like cold, and fever was being denied entry.

Officials said district magistrates have been empowered to take action against those found violating protocols.Earlier, officials held a meeting with heads of different employee associations ahead of the counting to assure them that all Covid protocols would be followed. The aim of the meeting was to build confidence among government teachers and other staff engaged in counting. Dinesh Chandra Sharma, the president of a teachers’ union, said they will abide by the Supreme Court order and take part in counting. “However, if the teachers felt that the Covid protocols were not followed, they will boycott counting.”On Saturday, the Supreme Court refused to stay the counting of votes after taking note of the SEC’s assurance that Covid-19 protocols would be followed across all the counting centres.The court on Friday sought a response from the state government and the SEC on a plea seeking a direction for adherence to Covid-19 protocols during the counting of votes for the four-phase elections that concluded on April 29.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/counting-starts-for-up-panchayat-polls-first-results-by-tonight-101619940476293.html

02-05-2021||Gurugram||Wanted gangster Sube Singh arrested at IGI Airport||The Haryana Police Special Task Force (STF) on Saturday said they arrested wanted gangster Sube Singh Gujjar, 32, from the Indira Gandhi International (IGI) Airport, Delhi. Gujjar allegedly used to be the right-hand man of another gangster Kaushal. However, after a financial dispute, they parted ways and Gujjar allegedly started targeting Kaushal’s extortion racket. He allegedly took over Kaushal’s gang after he was arrested. Gujjar was wanted in more than 100 criminal cases, including murder, attempt to murder and extortion in Gurugram, Delhi and Rewari. The police had declared a reward of ₹7.60 lakh for information that led to Singh’s arrest. STF deputy inspector-general Satheesh Balan said Gujjar was arrested after he exited the airport.“We had been monitoring him for the last many months. He was shifting his hideouts from one place to another-- in Chennai, Alwar in Rajasthan, Patna in Bihar and Visakhapatnam. Whe had been close to arresting him too but he evaded us. We got to know Gujjar would be arriving from Goa and a team was sent to arrest him outside the airport,” said Balan. STF inspector Varun Dhaiya said that Gujjar had changed his look and lost weight making it difficult to identify him. “It was a big challenge to get a hold of him. We managed to follow him outside the airport and caught hold of him before he could board a cab. He was alone and had ₹3,000 on him,” he said. Sube was declared a proclaimed offender by a district court in April 2018. Singh’s properties comprise two plots, one of 1.3 acres in Bar Gujjar village near Manesar and another of 0.8 acres in Manesar industrial area, both properties were auctioned but police could not find any buyers.In 2019 and 2021, the district administration tried to auction the properties twice. Officials said Gujjar lived in Nepal for over 18 months after he went absconding from Gurugram in 2016 and was running operations from there. He is involved in more than 100 cases of extortions, kidnapping, murder and attempt to murder and is mostly involved in collecting money from traders, jewelers, sweet shop owners, bakery owners and prominent transporters and industrialists, who are scared of complaining to the police. The police added that this month, Gujjar was planning to shift to another place in Rajasthan but he was arrested. Dahiya said Gujjar had shifted eight locations in Goa in the last five months since December 2021 and he never lived in any hotel as he was finding it difficult to make ends meet. “He was initially living in an apartment near north goa, where he lived for nearly two months. Later, he shifted to South Goa and Panjim. His wife also stayed him for a few months but we are yet to verify her whereabouts,” he said. The police said Gujjar did not even trust his friends with his location and never disclosed it to anyone except two of his associates who lived with him in Goa. He had last changed his location on Thursday to come to Delhi to collect money from his associates. According to the police, there are numerous cases of murder, extortion, blackmail and threat calls, made through international numbers, against Gujjar; he has more than 200 cases registered against him in Haryana. Police said Gujjar used internet-based calling to ensure his whereabouts could not be traced. He used voice over internet protocol (VoIP) to make extortion and threatening calls. He was using virtual numbers, i.e., a number without a directly associated line, to make the businessmen feel that they are getting calls from outside India.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/wanted-gangster-sube-singh-arrested-at-igi-airport-101619927696322.html
02-05-2021||Gurugram||Eight patients die in a private hospital due to oxygen shortage||Eight critical Covid-19 patients died at a private hospital in Sector 56 on Friday after the hospital ran out of oxygen. Relatives of the dead assaulted doctors and hospital staff alleging negligence. Doctors at Kirti Hospital, which has 50 beds for Covid patients, said those who died there were between 40 and 75 years of age. On Saturday, the hospital asked families of all patients to take them elsewhere as it struggled to find oxygen. By evening, the hospital shut its operations. Assistant commissioner of police (Sadar) Aman Yadav said the violence in the hospital occurred at around 11 pm following which a team was dispatched to control the situation. He said that the people had vandalised the hospital. “We organised three oxygen cylinders with the help of Red Cross and the municipal commissioner to save lives of the patients there,” he said adding that 18 more were arranged soon. Although doctors and hospital staff suffered injuries during the attack, no case was registered against anyone, said police. “The doctors failed to provide proper treatment to my brother-in-law and he died due to shortage of oxygen supply,” said a Delhi resident who requested anonymity. The hospital said they had made many attempts at procuring oxygen. “Since (Friday) morning I was informing the municipal corporation of Gurugram [MCG] commissioner (about the oxygen situation), but he ignored my messages and did not respond to my calls either. I had even informed the deputy commissioner but to no avail. I was begging and pleading before all officials to help but no one landed a helping hand and we lost eight patients,” said Dr Swati Rathore, director of Kriti Hospital. Rathore said she had requested families to shift their patients on Friday itself after they failed to get the oxygen but there were no beds available anywhere. “Their oxygen saturation level had reached 65 [safe limit is >95%] and there was no other way to save them except by giving oxygen. We had sent our vehicles to get oxygen refilled but despite waiting for more than 12 hours we did not get a single cylinder. We need at least 60 oxygen cylinders per day but we are hardly getting 10,” she said. “My patients died and the administration should be held responsible as they did not support us.”Yash Garg, deputy commissioner of Gurugram denied the Rathore’s allegations. “I was not aware of the oxygen status of the hospital nor did the concerned doctors inform me. I received a message at 3 am on Saturday following which I had sent 20 oxygen cylinders,” he said. Garg said he will get an inquiry initiated into the incident. MCG commissioner Vinay Pratap Singh did not respond to the calls and messages. Nandkishore Deoli, whose brother-in-law was admitted in the hospital, said that they were on their way to Dehradun to admit him in a private hospital there. “For the past four days we were in panic as everyday was a challenge to get oxygen. We survived because we had an oxygen cylinder and refilled it on our own. There is no infrastructure and facilities for the patient, we could not leave him there to die,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/eight-patients-die-in-a-private-hospital-due-to-oxygen-shortage-101619927456292.html
02-05-2021||Delhi||Phase 3 of Covid-19 vaccination drive starts at 5 centres in Delhi||The third phase of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) immunisation drive began in the city with at least four private hospitals and a government clinic vaccinating people between the ages of 18 and 44 years.“Today it is more of a symbolic launch of the drive as vaccination has been started only at one centre for those between 18-44 years. We have already received 4.5 lakh doses from the manufacturers and now we are distributing them in all districts. From May 3, we will start the vaccination drive on a large scale in Delhi,” said Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal, who also visited the clinic in northwest Delhi’s Saraswati Vihar where the government kicked off the immunisation drive phase three.So far, Delhi has received 150,000 doses of Covaxin and 300,000 doses of Covishield, as per documents seen by HT.The drive began across four centres of Max hospital - at Shalimar Bagh, Patparganj, Panchsheel Park and BLK hospital in Rajinder Place, which also comes under the same management. “People came in large numbers for the vaccination drive on Saturday,” said an official from Max hospital.Apollo hospitals, which had earlier said that it will begin the vaccination drive on Saturday, was yet to begin immunisations at the hospital. “Our teams are working to add the hospital to the CoWIN platform. The drive will likely begin from May 3 or 4,” the hospital said. Slots for vaccination at Fortis hospital was shown to be available on Sunday on the government’s CoWIN platform.As many as 45,353 jabs were administered over the last 24 hours in Delhi, according to the daily health bulletin.As per documents seen by HT, which was reported on Saturday, vaccination of those aged 18-44 will begin at 100 schools, and not government hospitals, with each institute hosting five session sites. Each site will be given 150 doses, suggesting a total capacity of 75,000 doses per day. The documents further state that the government plans to increase the number of schools to 274 -- one in each ward of Delhi -- by May 7.With 17 schools/educational institutes as centres and 85 session sites, the West district will have the highest number of vaccination points. The number of centres in this district will be increased to 46 from May 7.Even as private hospitals remained in the dark about whether they will get doses from the Delhi government, some private hospitals handling Covid-19 patients received an order stating that their staff will be deployed in nearby schools for the immunisation drive.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/phase-3-of-covid-19-vaccination-drive-starts-at-5-centres-in-delhi-101619911805618.html
02-05-2021||Chandigarh||10,000 challaned in April for Covid violations in Chandigarh||The residents’ defiance of Covid-19 protocols of social distancing and wearing masks has yielded the police department ₹1.23 crore from fine collection so far this year.Since January, 20,802 residents have been challaned. A major chunk of these challans, however, were issued in April itself: till April 28, 10,843 challans have been issued and ₹60.94 lakh collected as fine, the highest monthly figures since June 2020, when the drive was started.Between June 2020 and December 2020, the police had collected ₹1.01 crore through 18,954 challans issued for various violations.Intensifying the drive, the traffic wing of the Chandigarh Police in March this year had also started issuing challans to people for not wearing masks after the central government had raised concerns over the increasing number of Covid-19 cases in the city.Consequently, in addition to the personnel posted at police stations on general duty and PCR vehicles, sub-inspector (SI) rank officers of the traffic police were also authorised to challan people not wearing face masks.‘Colonies, markets problem areas’“Colonies and markets are places of primary concern as people tend to ignore the rules more. Roping in market associations and resident welfare associations will definitely make an impact,” said Kuldeep Singh Chahal, the senior superintendent of police.He added, “People have now started adhering to the safety protocols, but still not wearing masks properly. Anyone wearing the mask improperly by not covering their noses and mouths completely is being checked.”Recently during the hearing of a suo motu plea initiated by the Punjab and Haryana high court, Chandigarh assured the court that people not covering their mouths or noses properly with face masks would be treated at par with those not wearing masks at all, and liable to the same punitive action.As per the data provided by the police, maximum challans were issued for violating social distancing in various markets. Since January this year, the police have challaned 13,546 people for not maintaining social distancing, 4,337 for not wearing masks and 2,509 for spitting in public places.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/10000-challaned-in-april-for-covid-violations-in-chandigarh-101619909036125.html

The positivity rate, in a matter of concern, has remained above the 30% mark for 12 days now. Experts recommend a positivity rate below 5%, for an infection to be considered under control in a region.Essential activities, including the sale and supply of food items, groceries, medicines, etc, are allowed during lockdown. There will be no restrictions on the movement of health care workers, frontline workers, government staff, judicial officials, journalists and those seeking medical attention. Services provided by self-employed persons such as plumbers, electricians and those engaged in repairing of water purifiers; courier services; shops that sell educational books for students; and those selling electric fans are also allowed with a valid e-pass for movement.In the last one week, Delhi has recorded at least 25,000 cases daily and a positivity rate of over 30%. Saturday’s numbers took the city’s total tally to 11,74,552 and death toll to 16,559.Meanwhile, the Delhi government on Saturday launched a portal — delhifightscorona.in/donate — for people around the world to donate funds or medical equipment. “Indian citizens and the diaspora have always been at the forefront of helping governments deal with calamities in the country.

02-05-2021||Chandigarh||Panjab University defers polling of all constituencies of senate||Panjab University on Saturday decided to postpone the polling dates of all the constituencies of the senate, the apex governing body of the varsity.“Considering all aspects, it becomes infeasible to hold the senate elections on the dates already notified, hence the competent authority has decided to postpone the elections of all the constituencies for the time being,” read the order issued by PU registrar on Saturday.The varsity has said that the new polling schedule will be issued separately after taking into account the latest Covid guidelines of all concerned states—Punjab, Haryana, Uttarakhand, Delhi, Himachal Pradesh and Rajasthan.The development comes a day after the varsity postponed the May 3 (Monday) elections after the Punjab government advised it keeping in view the pandemic.Last month, the Himachal Pradesh government also withdrew the permission given to the varsity to set up polling booths in the state for the registered graduate constituency.The polls for the election of six members to the PU senate from the constituencies of faculties were earlier scheduled to be held on April 26, but these were later postponed to May 19.HC had pulled up PU V-C for delay in pollsThe polling schedule was issued by PU last month after the high court had pulled up vice-chancellor Raj Kumar for the delay, asking the varsity to conduct the polls within two months.Ex-senator Navdeep Goyal, who is contesting from faculties, said, “Keeping in view the present circumstances, it is a wise decision taken by the university.”“We understand the sensitivity of the situation and nothing is more important than human life. We hope that elections will be held as soon as the situation allows, unlike last year when the elections were postponed arbitrarily and without any justification,” added another ex-senator, Ashok Goyal.The senate is a 91-member apex governing body of PU in which 47 members are elected from various constituencies. The four-year term of the last senate had ended on October 31, 2020. While the elections were scheduled to start in August last year, these were postponed twice by V-C Raj Kumar due to the pandemic. The varsity is presently functioning without a governing body.The term of the syndicate, too, had ended on December 31 last year, followed by those of the faculty deans on January 31 without selection of their successors.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/panjab-university-defers-polling-of-all-constituencies-of-senate-101619903275163.html
02-05-2021||Chandigarh||Dusty winds cause Chandigarh’s air quality to drop||Even as traffic remained minimal on roads due to the weekend curfew, the city’s air quality deteriorated from satisfactory to moderate category following dusty winds on Saturday evening.Recorded at 94 (satisfactory) at the monitoring station in Sector 25 at 6pm on Friday, the Air Quality Index (AQI) went up to 186 (moderate) at 6pm on Saturday. An AQI between zero and 50 is considered good, and between 51 and 100 satisfactory, which may cause breathing discomfort among sensitive people. Between 100 and 200, the AQI is considered moderate, and can trouble people with asthma, lungs and heart diseases.“The AQI shot up on Saturday due to dry winds with lots of dust. This is temporary and it will return to below 100 in a day or two,” said Debendra Dalai, member secretary of the Chandigarh Pollution Control Committee.Rain expected on MondayWhile a western disturbance was active in the region till Saturday, the India Meteorological Department has predicted clear skies in the city on Sunday. But on Monday, there is a chance of light rain up to 20mm owing to another western disturbance. Thereafter, Tuesday will remain cloudy.Following the windy weather, Saturday’s maximum temperature dropped from 39.8°C on Friday to 37°C, which was normal. However, due to the cloudy skies, the minimum temperature went up from 22.2°C to 25.3°C, four notches above normal. In the next three days, highs and lows of 36°C and 25°C are expected.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/dusty-winds-cause-chandigarh-s-air-quality-to-drop-101619903215841.html
02-05-2021||Delhi||Hospitals sound alarm again with oxygen perilously short||The oxygen crisis in the national capital worsened on Saturday, with hospitals across the city sounding the alarm as their stocks ran low, on a day when at least 12 people died at Batra Hospital after an 80-minute disruption in oxygen supply.Saturday’s crisis was largely due to another shortfall in Delhi’s supplies, with the Capital once again not receiving its allocated quota of medical oxygen. Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on the day said Delhi received only 312MT out of its allocated share of 490MT on Friday. This shortfall, he said, has held up the state’s plan to increase the number of beds for Covid-19 patients.Among the hospitals that ran perilously short of oxygen on Saturday were the state government-run Guru Teg Bahadur and Rajiv Gandhi hospitals. Officials said the two received emergency supplies in the “nick of time.”“We had all our faculty members and resident doctors lined up to give oxygen to patients using small cylinders and even manually in case the hospital ran out. The tanker arrived just in time,” said a senior doctor from GTB Hospital.Click here for complete coverage of Covid-19A doctor from Rajiv Gandhi hospital, which is treating 350 patients on critical care beds, said, “We only have ICU beds in the hospital. If the oxygen were to run out, we would not have been able to save all the patients. We have a hand-to-mouth situation with oxygen every day.”Though the hospital has been allocated nearly 13MT of oxygen a day, officials said it doesn’t receive that amount.Oxygen quotas have been “rationed” due to supply shortages, said several hospitals.“The biggest bottleneck is that Delhi requires 700MT of oxygen daily but was allocated 490MT, which never comes. Our requirement (depending on the number of ICU and non-ICU beds) was assessed to be 6.5MT but we were allocated only 4.9MT because of this shortage. In the meantime, because we have more patients, our needs have gone up to 7MT. We can’t refuse patients crying out for help,” said Dr Sudhanshu Bankata, executive director, Batra Hospital.With the government maintaining a reserve of 11MT to resolve crises in hospitals, and allocating 16.8MT for refilling cylinders for hospitals, ambulances, and individuals, the quota of the hospitals had to be reduced further by 7MT, as per an April 29 order on oxygen quotas.Dr CM Bhagat, medical director of Bhagat Chandra hospital in Palam, said, “I am managing with just 50% of the quota. The refiller I have been linked to caters to other hospitals, which need 19MT oxygen. But the firm gets just 8.5MT of supply.” The hospital ran out of oxygen on Saturday evening and managed patients with low-pressure oxygen from a small oxygen generation plant it has. The hospital had to remove two patients from high-flow oxygen systems and manually pump air for five patients on ventilator support.“We have assigned 3 D-type cylinders from Mayapuri Response Point to the hospital. Officials of Bhagat Chandra Hospital are rushing to collect it,” tweeted Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leader Raghav Chadha.Meanwhile, Sant Parmanand hospital said constantly changing linkages to refillers also posed a problem. “We have to run from one refilling station to another. We need more cylinders as several beds have been added to increase capacity for Covid-19 patients. It is the government’s responsibility to ensure that oxygen reaches us.”Kejriwal said the shortage has resulted in hospitals across the city sending out SOS calls again. “As against 976 MT needed by Delhi, if only 312MT is being provided, how are things supposed to work out?” he said.“It is only because of lack of oxygen that patients are having to wait for hours or even days outside hospitals or other Covid care facilities... If we get our full quantum of oxygen today, at least 9,000 oxygenated beds will be ready in Delhi within 24 hours,” he said on Saturday.Meanwhile, in another order, the state asked retailers and districts to ensure that procurement or refilling of oxygen cylinders by individuals is allowed only after checking their ID, the patient’s ID as well as production of a doctor’s prescription prescribing medical oxygen to the Covid-19 patient.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/hospitals-sound-alarm-again-with-oxygen-perilously-short-101619901555318.html

Since April 1, the district has admitted a total of 40,849 students in its government primary, middle, high and senior secondary schools. The maximum enrollments were seen in Class 10 with 2, 585 students followed by Class 5 with 2, 336 new students. This data was shared by the state education department during a virtual meeting with the district education officials and nodal officials appointed for enhancing enrolment in the state. As per the education department, teachers left no stone unturned to convince parents to send their wards to government schools. From going door-to-door to organising nukkad nataks, the teachers adopted novel methods to maximise enrolments. Special focus was laid on highlighting the facilities available at these government schools, besides the achievements of its existing students.At Government Senior Secondary School, Sekhewal, where 300 of the total 317 new students enrolled this year are from private schools, principal Naresh Kumar said the recent renovations at the school made a lot of difference. “Our school now has a new block with 10 classrooms. We organised special school visits for parents and showed them the latest additions to our facilities. We have comfortable benches for students, projectors in all rooms and many other facilities at par with private schools,” he said. At Government Senior Secondary School, Basti Jodhewal, 340 of the 357 new students are from private schools. The school’s strength has gone up to 1, 891 from 1, 534 last year. School staffers show the wayAs per the education department officials, around 206 teaching and non-teaching employees have led by personal example and got their own children admitted to government schools. The department has decided to reward them for their initiative.Pandemic effectTeachers say many students also shifted from private schools due to the financial troubles their families are facing due to the pandemic. Government schools offer free education up to Class-8 and charge a nominal fee from senior class students. ‘Will continue efforts’District education officer, secondary, Lakhvir Singh, said, “School principals and teachers have come up with innovative ways such as using the public address system and holding nukkad nattaks to make people aware of the improvement in school infrastructure and the quality of education offered in government schools. Principals have been instructed to provide textbooks to the newly enrolled students at the earliest.”Former district education officer, elementary, Rajinder Kaur, and DEO Jaswinder Kaur, said, “Our district has achieved this feat due to the hard work and team spirit of all officials, teachers and principals. We will continue with our efforts.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/ludhiana-tops-state-in-enrolling-private-schools-kids-to-govt-facilities-101619901895073.html
02-05-2021||Chandigarh||In April, 16 healthcare workers contracted Covid daily at Chandigarh PGIMER||As many as 500 health workers at the Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research contracted Covid-19 in April – working out to 16 people a day, putting tremendous pressure on the already hard-pressed workforce. A total of 1,720 health workers of the institute, including doctors, nurses and sanitary staff, have been infected since the pandemic broke out in March last year, with April accounting for around 30% of that number amid the unprecedented spike in cases.Institute’s doctors say not all cases came from staff working in the Covid-19 wards, where proper safety protocol is followed. But, often they cannot take adequate precautions due to the heavy rush in the emergency block. “Almost all hospitals in the vicinity have restricted their emergency services, diverting a huge patient load to our institute. Amid this crisis, it’s not humanly possible to take all precautions, as the staff’s priority is to save lives. Yet, irrespective of all protocols, there is a huge chance of getting infected in the hospital set-up,” said Dr Ashok Kumar, official spokesperson and professor at the hospital’s administration department.According to Dr GD Puri, head of Covid management committee at PGIMER, on most days, staff was working almost 15 hours to provide care to the Covid patients. The surging cases are not only pushing the under-training doctors into extra shifts, but also impacting their training and practice, as more workforce is being diverted to Covid duties. “The case surge has burdened not only the medicine and anaesthesia specialities, which mainly deal with Covid care, but also other specialities not routinely involved in it. This has hampered training of resident doctors,” said Dr Uttam Thakur, president of Resident Doctors Association at PGIMER. While the Government Medical College and Hospital, Sector 32, does not maintain a record of its staff testing positive, around 40 workers at Government Multi-Specialty Hospital, Sector 16, are currently in isolation. “Our focus is to provide psychological support to the positive staff. If a worker tests positive, it impacts the morale of their colleagues as well,” said Dr VK Nagpal, joint director, UT health department. More nursing posts soughtOverburdened nurses have written to the UT administrator for more posts to deal with the deadly Covid wave. “AIIMS, New Delhi, has around 2,350 beds and 5,800 nurses, whereas PGIMER has 1,948 beds, but only 2,572 nurses. This is taking a heavy toll on us,” stated Satyaveer Dagur, general secretary of hospital’s Nursing Welfare Association in a letter to the UT administrator, seeking 1,500 more nursing posts from the central government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/in-april-16-healthcare-workers-contracted-covid-daily-at-chandigarh-pgimer-101619901656550.html

The victim, identified as Amandeep Singh of Giaspura, a student of Class 11, was out for a walk with his friend on Thursday morning when the incident took place. His friend, Sunil Singh, said three bike-borne men waylaid them and tried to snatch Amandeep’s phone. “He resisted and tried to run away but the trio chased him on their bike and stabbed him in a bid to snatch the phone,” said Sunil. As the teen lay on the road bleeding profusely, another morning walker, Nanhi Bano, came forward to help and wrapped her dupatta around Amandeep’s waist to stop the bleeding. Sunil, meanwhile, rang up Amandeep’s parents who reached the spot and rushed him to Dayanand Medical College and Hospital. The teen was then referred to Rajindra Hospital, Patiala, where he succumbed to his injuries on Saturday after fighting for life for two days. Following his death, the family lodged a police complaint. Cops are scanning the closed-circuit television (CCTV) cameras in the area to trace the accused. Daba station house officer (SHO), sub-inspector Manjinder Kaur said the entire incident was captured on CCTV, but the miscreants’ faces were not visible. Police are now trying to read the number plate on their bike. The victim’s father Mukesh Kumar said he could not inform the police right after the incident as he was caught up with his son’s treatment. Police have registered a case under Section 302 (murder) of the Indian Penal Code against the unidentified miscreants. Confusion over jurisdiction between three police stations After being informed about the incident, police from three police stations – including Daba, Division number 6 and Sahnewal reached the spot. Cops of all three police stations claimed that the area where the boy was assaulted does not fall within their jurisdiction. Later, the Daba police lodged an FIR and initiated an investigation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/teen-succumbs-to-stab-wounds-inflicted-by-mobile-snatchers-101619900875047.html

A number of government centres had to stop the drive on Saturday afternoon as these ran out of the vaccine stock. Residents were asked to return and inquire again on Sunday. In all, 13, 085 eligible residents got jabbed on Saturday while 53,4,027 residents have been vaccinated in the district till now.As per the health department officials, they are left with only around 2, 200 doses of vaccine for Sunday and there is no certainty over the arrival of fresh stock. While the plans to vaccinate residents above the age of 18 have already been delayed due to shortage of vaccine doses, the administration is also struggling to meet the requirements for residents aged above 45. The vaccination drive will not take place in rural areas and sub-divisions, and will only be carried out at limited sites in the city areas on Sunday. Earlier on April 27 too, the department had run out of stock and only 2, 949 people got the jab against the daily target of vaccinating 18,000 residents. Due to shortage of both the vaccines, only the second dose of Covaxin will be administered at four government centres on Sunday, while Covishield will be administered at nine sites. Some of the vaccination sites for Sunday include Civil Hospital, civil surgeon’s office complex, Mother Child Hospital near Vardhman mills, Model Gram dispensary near old Krishna Mandir, urban primary health centres in Dugri and Jawaddi, Haibowal dispensary, among other points.Before the shortage disrupted operations, the district health department had been conducting the vaccination drive in over 300 government/centres/sites in the district. The shortage had forced the health department to suspend the supply of vaccines to private hospitals in mid-April. Residents visiting the government centres for vaccination have also been facing a harrowing time. Sumita, a resident of Model Town, said, “I went to inquire about the vaccination at Model Town dispensary for my father around 2:30pm on Saturday but the staff said they ran out of stock around 1:30pm. They asked us to come on Sunday. The administration has been encouraging residents to get vaccinated, but they have failed to make the required arrangements.”District immunisation officer Dr Puneet Juneja said, “The supply of vaccine was not received on Saturday. We have around 2, 200 doses for Sunday and are in contact with the state government for supply, but there is no certainty as of now.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/ludhiana-left-with-just-2-200-doses-for-sunday-uncertainty-over-arrival-of-fresh-stock-101619900515451.html

Active cases climbed from 1,034 on April 1 to 2,655 on April 30 while the recovery rate dropped from 90% to 86%.The positivity rate touched 25% to 30% on some days, which was the highest-ever in the district. Authorities also doubled the number of tests conducted in April.On whether any relief is in sight, an expert in the field, who did not wish to be named, said, “Cases are likely to continue to rise and fatalities will also be reported in May. There might be some respite by the end of the month. However, it is too early to comment.” Deputy commissioner Mukesh Kumar Ahuja has constituted a committee, which will monitor and supervise the system and check macro-containment zones.

That does not seem to be happening. People who require oxygen support should leave in eight to 10 days subject to the condition of the individual patient, unless the disease worsens,” it said adding “however, it appears that there is choking of beds.Senior advocate Rahul Mehra, appearing for the Delhi government, told the court that the government had issued an order to all the hospitals on the procedure to be followed for the discharge of the patients. However, the same is not being followed.He said he could not initiate action or raise this point because he does not have the data.“Our order is not being followed... We should have data because people are under fear...,” argued Mehra. The court noted that while 10% people fall severely ill after getting infected with the virus, only 1% is likely to require greater attention and ICU admission. It said that it isn’t clear as to whether the transition of patients from the ICU to oxygenated beds and further is taking place.The court asked the hospitals to give the data to the amicus curiae who would analyse it further and assist the court on May 6, the next date of hearing. It also asked the Delhi government to update its portal on the number of admissions and discharges every day without fail.It also said that the portal displaying the availability of beds should be updated by bifurcating the beds in the categories of oxygenated and ICU beds, with or without ventilators.The court was hearing a plea by lawyer-petitioner Rakesh Malhotra, who along with several hospitals, had sought directions to the Centre and the Delhi government for better facilities and continuous supply of oxygen in the hospitals and nursing homes of the city. During the proceedings, the bench also sought to know as to why the Delhi government was resisting the help from the Army when the situation had gone out of hand.“Do we say that you don’t want to? The Army has their own machinery, it works at its own level. They are also importing things from Germany.. They will help and take responsibility....Because looking at the past 10 days, we don’t know if (900+MT) would fructify,” said the bench adding “the augmentation could be a collaborative effort with the army so that resources are not wasted”. Mehra said the city government is not resisting the army aid and it is being considered at the highest level. The query was posed by the bench after senior advocate Krishnan Venugopal told the court that the Army can be brought to help the Capital amid the Covid-19 crisis.The bench also said that there is a need for the hospitals to set up their own oxygen plants after several of them came running in SOS conditions, citing shortage of oxygen. It said that even though none had contemplated such a situation, there is a need to have oxygen plants with the hospitals. The suggestion ensued after S Bankata, executive director of Batra Hospital, informed the court that his hospital had run out of oxygen supply for one and half hours and there has been loss of lives.“This is a lesson to be learnt that hospitals should set up their own oxygen plants. We know that everyone wants to keep their profits high, but these are essentials. Maybe you can have 10 rooms less but this is irresponsible,” the court said.Mehra also contended that there is leakage in the tankers being given by INOX, which could lead to loss of lives. However, advocate Aseem Chaturvedi, appearing for INOX, said that they do not have any more tankers.Mehra also informed the court that one Gandhi Hospital on Friday made a false statement about not receiving a single oxygen cylinder for the last 48 hours, despite getting one too many.The hospital’s owner submitted that there was some miscommunication between the management and their lawyer and that there was no intention to make a false statement. The court warned that such false claims shall not be made in future.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/high-court-orders-hospitals-in-delhi-to-submit-details-of-all-admissions-discharges-after-april-1-101619900394447.html

02-05-2021||Other||Delhi Police helpline to now address cheating, harassment complaints||New Delhi: Taking cognisance of media reports and social media posts claiming that ambulance service providers are overcharging and cheating in the name of providing oxygen cylinders and life-saving drugs for treating Covid-19, the Delhi Police on Saturday said the Covid helpline launched by them a fortnight ago will now address calls and complaints regarding all such illegal activities.The city police have already registered two cases of overcharging by ambulance drivers. In one such case registered at Sarita Vihar police station in southeast district, a person was arrested and his ambulance seized on Saturday for allegedly charging ₹8,500, nearly ten times more than the actual rate, for shifting a patient to Holy Family hospital from Apollo hospital -- a distance of 3.5kms. Another case was registered at Sonia Vihar police station in northeast Delhi after a receipt of ₹10,000 charged by an ambulance service provider for a 4km journey was widely circulated on social media, said police. The Delhi Police helpline 011-23469900, which has 10 lines to facilitate the movement of people falling in the exempted categories and resolve issues related to issuance of e-passes, receives more than 500 calls every day.From Saturday onwards, it will also be responding to calls related to ambulances overcharging Covid patients or their relatives, harassment at cremation grounds and frauds offering help in getting beds in hospitals or Covid treatment, providing oxygen cylinders and life-saving injections such as remdesivir. People can also call on the helpline to report about other malpractices by unscrupulous elements. “Victims and informants can also call on the helpline to report about fake medicines and injections that are being sold to needy people as authentic life-saving drugs. Besides, complaints can also be made on black marketing and hoarding of oxygen cylinders, essential medicines, and equipment used in Covid treatment,” said spokesperson for Delhi Police Chinmoy Biswal.About the cheating case registered at at Sarita Vihar police station, deputy commissioner of police (southeast) R P Meena said on April 30, a man named Irshad filed a complaint and alleged that ambulance driver Pramod Kumar (30) was demanding ₹8,500 for shifting his relative, who contracted Covid-19, to Holy Family hospital from Apollo hospital.“A decoy customer contacted the driver for shifting a patient within a range of 5km, for which Kumar demanded ₹9,500. After bargaining, he agreed at ₹8,500. He was immediately arrested for extortion and cheating and his ambulance was also seized,” said the DCP adding that Kumar confessed that he wanted to make quick money by cashing in on the existing Covid-19 crisis. In the second case in which the police are yet to make any arrest, a case of extortion was registered after a man, identified as Satish, informed Sonia Vihar police on April 30 that he came across a tweet about a private ambulance service charging ₹10,000 for a 4km journey. DCP (northeast) Sanjay Kumar Sain said that to verify the allegation, Satish contacted the ambulance service and requested for an ambulance to shift a patient from Sonia Vihar to Rajiv Gandhi Super Specialty hospital. “The person whom Satish contacted demanded ₹15,000. Thus, the allegations mentioned in the tweet turned out to be true. Satish approached police and provided a print of the tweet that he came across on Twitter,” said the DCP. “We registered a case on Satish’s complaint. The person who demanded an exorbitant rate for providing an ambulance was identified as Devender from Bhalswa Dairy. In view of prevailing situation and in public interest, the ambulance has not been seized but its photograph has been taken as a record,” he said. Police have also seized the bill book containing the original receipt, a copy of which was widely circulated on social media.With regard to black-marketing of remdesivir and overcharging by ambulances, Delhi chief minister Kejriwal responded, “I just want to say that had we received the oxygen supply and were able to create beds, then an official system could have been prepared. One could also have received the medicines prescribed by the doctors there.” “Now, anyone is laying their hands on whatever they are getting in front of them…The enforcement and police teams as well as teams of the Delhi Government are catching hold of all those engaged in black marketing. The only way to tackle this is by increasing the number of beds on a large scale, in particular, the oxygen beds,” said the chief minister. He added, “Whoever is falling ill due to Covid-19 needs oxygen in the first place… As soon as the oxygen levels of a patient reach 88-89 and oxygen is immediately provided to them, their lives can be saved. But people are unable to get oxygen.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/delhi-police-helpline-to-now-address-cheating-harassment-complaints-101619899194406.html

Now, I will never get another opportunity to meet the legal luminary who passed away on April 30. It was a painful parting as the former attorney general of India had been a father figure for two decades. Sorabjee was a distinguished authority on law, an erudite and apolitical scholar with encyclopedic knowledge, a prolific writer, jazz lover, ardent protector of freedom of speech, the protagonist in the fight for personal liberty and a human rights watchdog. He had a keen interest in poetry, literature and architecture as well.Brimming with instant wit and humour, Sorabjee lived life to the fullest. He was a gifted mimic and loved receiving gifts. Age for him was just a number and nothing dampened his exuberant spirit. He was always game for a chat, case discussion, legal analysis, joke, or serious debate. Sorabjee never slowed down.Never deterred dissent As a lawyer, I share treasured memories with him from international conferences across the globe, court appearances, events at the India International Centre, book releases, discussions, seminars, fiery debates and creative writing. No subject belied him. Be it a street in Perth, a conference hall in London, a hotel lobby in Hong Kong, or in a bookshop on the Gold Coast, lively discussions ensued in the middle of nowhere. He respected all views and opinions and never deterred dissent.We published nine books with his blessing, the last of which was released on August 29 virtually. He was always encouraging and happily provided a foreword, preface, or speech during the book release. He never missed an event, and his wheelchair was no deterrent.

He was fair to opponents, respectful to judges, and polite and gentle in courts.

Deputy commissioner B Srinivasan said on Saturday the facility is likely to be functional within three weeks. “Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) will construct the temporary structure near Raman village. A team of doctors and paramedic staff will be supported by the Indian army. We are working to make the project operational soon,” said the DC. HPCL-Mittal group managed-Guru Gobind Singh Refinery has committed to providing land and basic facilities for the hospital near its plant, about 45 km from Bathinda city. When functional, it will be the largest state-managed medical facility for coronavirus patients in southern Punjab. “As per the plan, the upcoming facility will be equipped to treat Covid patients in need of oxygen support. The location has been identified near Raman to have a sufficient supply of oxygen from the refinery. It may be expanded if the need arises in the future,” added the DC. Official sources at the refinery said work to augment industrial oxygen-producing facility at the plant into medical-grade gas is underway on priority. Following a spurt in infections in the last month, Bathinda is now rated among the six worst-hit districts of Punjab. With 653 new cases reported on Saturday, the number of active Covid cases has reached 5,141. As many as 13 Covid-related deaths were reported on Saturday. In the second half of April, 6,969 new cases and 101 deaths were reported. Similarly, other districts of the region also witnessed a sharp surge in Covid cases in the past one month with Bathinda leading among seven districts of the south Malwa belt. Finance minister Manpreet Badal on Saturday took stock of preparedness in government and private hospitals of Bathinda district. He assured hospital managements and patients to provide oxygen and other medical support to the Covid care institutes. Meanwhile, the local administration on Saturday directed 26 private hospitals to prepare 664 additional beds exclusively for Covid patients. The official spokesperson of the administration said 512 beds will be kept for patients needing oxygen support whereas the hospitals will reserve 152 for critically ill patients requiring ventilator support.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/100bed-makeshift-covid-hospital-to-come-up-in-bathinda-in-3-weeks-101619898956156.html

The recovery was around 130 kg and 75 kg for the corresponding periods of 2020 and 2019, respectively.Officials of the BSF say prolonged foggy season was the main reason behind the increase in attempts to push drugs into India. “This year, the fog engulfed the border areas till March end anti-national elements across the border took advantage of it. Also, the water level of the rivers and their tributaries along the border remained high this year, paving the way for the smugglers to push in contrabands into the Indian territory,” said a senior BSF official, who didn’t wish to be named.He said, “Our troops remained extra vigilant and most of attempts were thwarted. We were also successful in catching a Pakistani smuggler.” On April 8, a Pakistani national, who was trying to push in a heroin consignment into the Indian territory near Khemkaran border in Tarn Taran district, was apprehended. With the arrest of Ajmad Ali (19) of Lahore, the BSF had also seized 21-kg heroin and two smart phones from the area. Same day, a Pakistani smuggler was neutralised by the BSF near border outpost (BoP) Kakkar in Amritsar district. From the spot, 22-kg heroin and two AK-47 rifles were also recovered. During these operations, the BSF had also identified two Indian smugglers, including one Jagdish Singh Bhura, who lives in Belgium and has been involved in many terror activities in India.A senior Punjab Police official said, “Besides breaking the supply chain of the drugs in the state, our personnel have been ensuring to attach the assets of the drug smugglers. Due to the increased vigil and strictness of the Punjab Police, there has been a huge shortage of the drugs. Seeing the supply chain broken, desperate Pakistani smugglers leaving no stone unturned to push in more contraband into India. However, with the help of the BSF officials, we have strengthened our second line of defence along the border, and every suspect is monitored.”The seizure of the BSF is different from the recoveries by the Punjab Police. The 22-kg heroin that was seized near the Kakkar BoP was in the kitty of the Punjab Police as the operation was on the basis of Amritsar-rural police’s input.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/bsf-seized-205kg-heroin-this-year-highest-for-same-period-in-5-years-101619898597417.html
02-05-2021||Chandigarh||Wild Buzz: Love, upside down||At Shanti Kunj Park in Chandigarh’s Sector 16, walkers cannot help but be dazzled by colonies of the Indian flying fox or the Indian fruit bat hanging from large trees in dozens. They make one hell of an unending racket during the day. These large bats can be seen flying in waves over the Rose Garden at dusk like endless formations of bomber aircrafts reducing Berlin to rubble during the hellish nights of the World War II. A voracious fruit eater that forages on guava, mango and litchi orchards located in the countryside adjuncts of the tricity, these bats also help themselves to an assortment of fruit to be found in bungalows’ gardens in the heart of the spaced out urban habitation.It is currently breeding season for this mammal and a female will deliver but one pup after an evolved, expressive and vigorous sexual session with the dominant male. Dominant males establish sexual privileges over a harem of 8-15 females and engage in vicious territorial fights to ward off sniffing Don Juans. The sexual habits of bats have been recorded by field scientists as inclusive of a male performing cunnilingus on the female and the latter reciprocating with fellatio while copulation is underway. Male bats are recorded as grooming their sexual organ before copulation.All these practises serve to lengthen the period of copulation between these fox-like mammals endowed with boundless promiscuity and libido. Couple that with known longevity, a bat in captivity survived nearly 32 years. For all the seeming upside-down discomfort of their existence, it is evident bats have done exceedingly well in their romps among tree rooftops!The tricity region sports an abundance of bat colonies because of the presence of mature trees (especially of the ficus preferred by these creatures), wild and cultivated fruit trees and a chain of check dams, including Sukhna Lake, that serve as perennial water sources for bats to skim over, quench their thirst and regulate body temperature. They can fly long distances to forage at night: a study in Brazil recorded fruit bats flying 200km to find their favourite food! A grace in Sukhna air While veering towards the regulator-end, walkers at the Sukhna Lake may have noticed the most graceful of bird flights, as if they were sailing and bobbing in the infernal air. Migratory whiskered terns are white birds adorned with a black mask, grey-black underparts and they undertake regular forays over gently rippling waters and dripping labourers pruning lotus weed tops. They stage an appearance at the Sukhna in April and May. The march of summer has bestowed upon this species a tuxedoed breeding plumage — splashes and enclaves of black or grey that offset the bird’s predominantly white colouration of winter gone by. Terns prefer the Sukhna in large numbers during those summers when it is drying up as they rest and roost on mudflats and silted isles. As the lake is currently brimming with water, only a dozen terns have arrived and they have colonised two small pieces of driftwood near the regulator-end. The terns don’t let any other avian species sit there though among themselves they regularly quarrel and jostle for space. They throw hoarse abuses and threats at each other while grabbing balcony seats in the driftwood’s limited capacity hall! I leave it to the inimitable descriptions of bird behaviour penned by Dr Salim Ali to capture the essence of Sukhna’s endearing winged tourist: “Flies gracefully back and forth over a marsh, bill and eye directed intently below for signs of life. Plunges into water for fish or stoops on insects or crabs on the ground and bears them away in its stride. Although possessing webbed feet, terns hardly ever alight on water....When not hunting they rest on a rock or mudbank on their ridiculously short legs.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/wild-buzz-love-upside-down-101619898475618.html

But with small eateries remaining shut due to the pandemic and the restrictions, people from all walks of life avail this service,” he said.He said people also support him in his endeavour and donate rice and pulses so that he continues to serve the needy.Recalling an incident, Kapoor said a beggar, who used to get food from him, had given him a bag containing some clothes saying that they should be given to some needy people after his death.“I took the bag home. After his death, when I opened it, I found that he had kept ₹25,000 cash inside along with the clothes, which he had not mentioned earlier,” he said.Kapoor says he has been running this service in memory of Guru Nanak, the founder of Sikhism, who he says had visited Nagpur in 1512 and provided langar service to the local tribals.He says that he dreams to run the ‘langar sewa’ for the needy 24x7.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/sikh-man-provides-langar-on-wheels-to-needy-during-pandemic-in-nagpur-101619898415736.html

However, the government has not responded to date despite a reminder letter on April 8. “It is therefore requested that the matter be expedited, and an action taken report be furnished within seven days positively. It is requested that till the case is decided by the commission, status quo of the case may be maintained,” the letter reads. In its April 8 letter the state was told that a complaint had been received on non-implementation of reservation in promotions in the case of SC employees working in courts, including judicial officers and the commission has decided to investigate it. The commission had sought a response from the government, which reportedly wasn’t done.Between March 22 and April 8, the government has notified promotions of 20 judicial officers to state superior judicial services and 40 odd more judicial officers were given promotions on April 7. Punjab Scheduled Castes and Backward Classes (Reservation in Services) Act, 2006, provides for reservation in promotion for SC category employees — 14 per cent in the case of Group ‘A’ and Group ‘B’, and 20 per cent in the case of Group ‘C’ and Group ‘D’ services. Vijay Pal Singh Mattu, a Amritsar based complainant lawyer, who had approached the commission in March, says, “even as the law was passed in 2006, it was never implemented, in the case of judicial services and for other court employees.” The communication from the commission says it has taken a serious view of the state government not replying to its communication. The chief secretary should take notice of the case and in case commission does not receive reply from the chief secretary within the stipulated time, the commission may exercise the powers of civil courts and issue summons for appearance in person or by representative before it, the communication says, seeking response within seven days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/national-commission-seeks-report-on-quota-in-promotion-to-judicial-officers-in-punjab-101619898295201.html

Big Outcry, No Outcome.” He shared another video clip of the chief minister’s recent interview to a web channel in which he said the law would take its own course and that he could not interfere in the probe by the special investigation team.In another tweet, the MLA from Amritsar East said it was not acceptable to blame the Punjab and Haryana high court verdict quashing the probe report by the Punjab Police’s special investigation team into police opening fire at people protesting the desecration of a religious text in Faridkot in 2015.“People of Punjab did not elect the high court judge. Blaming the verdict for what is the failure of the executive authority will not be accepted. My stand yesterday, today and tomorrow - Justice for Punjab’s Soul...

02-05-2021||Chandigarh||Guest column: The gem that is literature in the age of gists||“You don’t know what the Inshorts app is?” my brother asked me, incredulously. “No,” I replied gingerly, “What is it about?”“It is a phone app for daily world news, summarised in all of 60 words. Please don’t tell me you are reading entire newspapers!” he exclaimed, in the same cynical tone. “I try to”, I said, guilty as charged. The application may be an efficient way to quickly catch up on news, but whatever happened to reading the good old newspaper cover to cover, paired with a cup of chai?Admittedly, news on the move is a good idea in today’s busy times, but this brutal massacre of long texts and lengthy books has left me a tad heartbroken. There is a growing demand for quick, short and concise reads. However, I feel that literature should not be subjected to a massacre of any kind!This textual annihilation and stagnation of literature reminds one of the profound words of the erstwhile king of short stories Sadat Hassan Manto. The power of an atom was not discovered, it was always there. If an atom is misused or unused, the power of the atom cannot be called weak or dead. Similarly, Manto has likened the atom to literature. Literature has an “innate vitality”. If one does not read it, the gem is still there — powerful and enlightening on its own. If society moves away from literature and books, it by no means indicates the enfeeblement of literature, but points towards the enfeeblement and stagnation of society itself. Manto could not have been more right about it.Simply sharing the gist of a classical piece of writing will be as bland as sharing the binary outcome of a cricket match, without having watched it! In an age of information galore, attention spans are narrowing. We prefer gists. Long texts are becoming repulsive. Also, there is so much that demands our attention now! Charles Dickens’ Great Expectations is fighting a losing battle against the millennial expectations.Some of us have a natural affinity towards books. However, reading does not always come naturally to us. At times, it needs to be gently introduced, just like a slice of say, orange fruit. The moment you bite into its citrus flesh, there is a burst of flavour. It takes a moment to relish its refreshing tang. It is only then that one begins to savour it, and proceeds to peeling it further, revelling in its juicy goodness. Books, for some of us, may feel like drudgery, a monumental project. However, when words begin to paint a picture before our eyes, and whisk us to lands afar, books become blissful haulage. When words strung together form magical sentences which suddenly resonate, they become one’s companions. On days when nothing seems right, books envelope, and provide a refuge like none other.Literature has something to offer to each one of us. There is war and history for my father. There are never enough self-help books for my sister-in-law. There is fantasy fiction for my daughter. There is coming-of-age literature for me. There is political history for my spouse, who is slowly moving from audio to paper. He has tasted the orange for sure!Last week, on April 23, we observed the World Book Day. Let’s give the truncated reading apps a rest, and pick up a newspaper, or even better, a book. Whether or not you are a reader, literature just awaits to be unbosomed.(The writer is a Chandigarh-based contributor) seeratsandhu25@yahoo.com||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/guest-column-the-gem-that-is-literature-in-the-age-of-gists-101619897696427.html

Reviewing the Covid-19 situation of 11 districts, Sidhu said people have misconception that they are suffering from the seasonal viral and typhoid, but when they reach hospital due to breathing complications, they are diagnosed with Covid-19. Expressing concern, he instructed civil surgeons to intensify the screening drive in villages as 58% of deaths have been registered in rural areas. The minister said that considering the high case fatality rate (CFR) in the state, there is also need to keep close watch on the functioning of private clinics/RMPs in villages. He said senior medical officers must ensure Covid testing of every single symptomatic persons who are getting treatment from such clinics. If any private health facility has not shared the information concerning the symptomatic persons on routine basis, they must be booked under the Epidemic Diseases Act for violating Government‘s guidelines, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ramp-up-screening-of-symptomatic-patients-punjab-health-minister-101619897695050.html

A spokesperson of the taxation commissioner’s office said that the previous highest monthly revenue from GST was ₹1,216 crores in July 2019. GST revenue in April 2020, when the covid-19 outbreak had led to the first lockdown was a meagre ₹156 crore. The spokesperson added that in April 2019 (a normal year), the GST revenue was ₹1,088 crore and compared to this, Punjab has seen a growth of 36% with sectors like telecom, iron and steel, electronic goods, cement, petroleum products (which attract the GST) making important contribution to the revenue earned for the particular month. In addition to GST, Punjab also collects revenue from Value Added Tax (VAT) and Central Sales Tax (CST), with major contributors under this head being alcohol for human consumption and five petroleum products which are outside the ambit of GST.

The family members were seen weeping inconsolably at the hospital, which is located in the Sidhra area.Those who lost their lives are Irshad Ahmad Hamal, Haider Ali, Manjeet Singh and Bitta Kumari Kher.Though the J&K government denied the allegations, ASCOMS principal Dr Pawan Malhotra admitted that the hospital faced some hiccups in oxygen supply on Saturday morning, but denied any shortage.“There was shortage of cylinders this morning. We had informed the government and it intervened. , We had tried to procure them last night. Our requirement is 350 cylinders per day and yesterday, we had 294,” said Dr Malhotra.“We had apprised the government of the status of oxygen at the hospital on Friday itself. For the last three days, we have not been admitting Covid patients as we were not being able to cope with the load. But, those who had already been hospitalised, were being taken care of,” he said.Dr Malhotra said that the kin of all four deceased were apprised of the serious condition of the patients and that they may not survive. “We have 32 more patients on oxygen support. The hospital has not taken in any new patients for the last three days. We had given admitted patients the option to take voluntary discharge, if they wish to,” he added.Dr Malhotra said that Kher and Haider Ali had tested Covid negative, but their lungs had suffered extensive damage. “Their lungs were not functioning independently. Hamal and Manjeet Singh were Covid positive and they too, could not survive,” he added.However, the families of the deceased patients outrightly denied the claims of the principal and said that the hospital kept them in dark about the status of oxygen supply. They also accused doctors and nursing staff at the Covid ward of negligence.One of the protesting relatives said that their family member was undergoing treatment at the hospital for the last 17 days, but died due to non-availability of oxygen.Meanwhile, the Jammu and Kashmir administration on Saturday clarified that no patient has died due to shortage of oxygen supply at ASCOM hospital, as the supply is being replenished regularly, as per requirement raised.“Four deaths reported in Batra hospital Jammu today (Saturday) occurred because of routine medical reasons, not because of shortage of oxygen,” said a statement of the administration on its Twitter handle.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/four-covid-patients-die-at-jammu-s-batra-hospital-kin-allege-oxygen-crunch-101619896677926.html

Of this, 999 (67.3%) had co-morbidities, while 425 (32.7%) were non comorbid.The most common comorbidities among the deceased include diabetes mellitus in 499 cases (49.9%), hypertension in 459 (45.9%), chronic kidney disease in 111 (11.1%) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in 84 (8.4%). Those who lost their lives to the disease include 970 (65.4%) males and 514 (34.6%) females. The data also reveals that 90% of those who died were in the age group of 45 and above.Out of 362 Covid deaths in the state from April 14 to 30, 67 people had received the first dose of the vaccine while only two of those who died had received the second dose.Both the cases were reported from Kangra district and the duration between getting the second dose and deaths were four and 16 days, respectively. Thus, in both these cases, the deceased had succumbed to the disease before development of effective immunity, a press communiqué by the health department states.Meanwhile, a government spokesperson said that since more than 90% of those who have contracted the disease are in home isolation, it is important to have adequate knowledge of self-care procedures.He said proning was one such technique which is extremely beneficial for patients with breathing difficulty, especially during home isolation. It improves ventilation and keeps the breathing easy, he added. Regular monitoring of SpO2, along with other vitals like temperature, blood pressure and blood sugar, is important during home isolation, he added.“Proning is required only when the patient faces breathing difficulty and SpO2 dips below 94,” the spokesperson said.“Avoid proning for an hour after meals. Another alternative for patients under home isolation is regular alterations in lying position. This helps improve ventilation status and blood oxygen levels,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/over-67-patients-who-succumbed-to-covid-in-himachal-had-co-morbidities-health-dept-data-101619896676673.html
02-05-2021||Chandigarh||Grim milestones: J&K sees steepest rise in Covid cases in April||More than 45,123 Covid cases were reported from Jammu and Kashmir in April, the highest since the outbreak of the pandemic in March last year. The month also saw 289 deaths in both regions of the UT.In March, J&K had recorded 4,519 infections and 37 deaths. April saw an almost eight-fold increase in cases and 7.8 times more deaths, compared to last month. This has forced officials to devise a new strategy to curb the spread of the disease.The number of active cases also rose exponentially and reached 28,359 by April 30, officials said. Most of these were added after February 9, when the UT had the lowest active case tally of 593.As many as 1,45,441 people have recovered so far, taking the recovery rate to 83.54 %. In the first fortnight of February, the recovery rate was 98%.From an all- time low of 43 cases on February 8, the surge became pronounced by mid-March. The spike got steeper in April, with over 1,200 to 2,000 fresh infections being reported daily since mid-April. On April 30, 3,532 cases were recorded, which the highest single-day spike.Dr Javaid Malik, professor and head of department of chest medicine at SKIMS Medical College, Bemina, said that the cases are rising as the virus is mutating . “This is happening across the country and J&K is no different,” he said. He added that the cases will rise for some more time, before it starts declining again.“It will also depend on whether people follow SoPs and lockdown protocols. If the cases continue to rise, then the government should go for an extended lockdown,” Malik added.Following the surge, hospitals in J&K have started adding more beds and oxygen plants, as the officials apprehend more cases could come in coming days.Earlier, Sher-i-Kashmir Institute of Medical Sciences (SKIMS) in Srinagar, which is the Valley’s largest tertiary care hospital, and other medical colleges, decided to stop all non-emergency surgeries and admissions to cater to the increasing rush of Covid patients. Even the routine OPDs were shut down and the administration began online consultation for patients.Dr Salim Khan, professor and head of community medicine at Government Medical College, Srinagar, said that the cases have gone up due to high rate of transmission. “Compared to last year, transmission rate is high this time. The lockdown can help flatten the curve, or else there will be huge transmission among the population.”In March, the UT had recorded 4,519 Covid-19 infections, 1,935 in February and 3,535 in January. As many as 37 people succumbed to the virus in March, 21 in February and 53 in January.The peak of the first Covid wave was in September last year, when the UT had witnessed 37, 372 cases and 478 death.Choudhary Mohammad Yasin, mission director of National Rural Health Mission (NRHM), J&K, said that officials are working overtime to control the disease. “Hopefully, things will get better in the next few weeks,” he said.Many people, however, blame the government for throwing gardens open to the public, especially Tulip Garden, which sees a huge rush of locals and tourists. Many say this is one of the reasons for the rise in cases in Kashmir. “The government did take some decisions in haste, especially holding Tulip festival in the middle of the pandemic, when cases were on rise across the country. So, that’s one of the reasons for spike in cases,” said Dr Seema, a resident of uptown Srinagar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/grim-milestones-j-k-sees-steepest-rise-in-covid-cases-in-april-101619896674718.html

NIA contended that the report cannot be taken into consideration at this stage for quashing of the case against him. In an affidavit in reply to Wilson’s petition, the federal agency said that the report does not form part of the charge sheets which are filed by the respondent (NIA) and Pune Police. “It is settled position of law that documents which are not part of the charge sheet cannot be relied by the petitioner, and as such, there is no question of looking into the report of M/s. Arsenal Consultancy, and as such, the entire contention of the petitioner deserves to be rejected as the same are based on the report which does not find place in the present charge sheet,” the affidavit stated. NIA maintained that if at all the report can be considered, it can be done only during trial. “If at all the petitioner wants to rely upon the same [Arsenal report], the only avenue available to him is at the time of leading evidence. The petitioner can very well lead evidence in respect of the same and then prove their case [without admitting that the said case is genuine],” the affidavit stated. Wilson has moved HC in February for quashing of the case against him on the basis of the Arsenal report, which stated that the computer system of the accused was attacked with a malware and the attacker monitored the system for a period of about 22 months, starting from June 22, 2016. The attacker, according to the Arsenal report, had created a hidden folder on Wilson’s laptop on November 3, 2016, and last modified it on April 16, 2018. The pen-drive and other external devices connected to the laptop were also compromised and the malware had synchronised the same. On the basis of the report, commissioned by the American Bar Association, Wilson claimed that the attacker had control over the computer and used virtual proxy server (VPS), making it difficult to identify the exact internet protocol and identity of the attacker who had allegedly planted a letter on the laptop, which was being relied by NIA to build a case under provisions of the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act. Wilson has not only prayed that the FIR and charge sheet filed against him and other co-accused be quashed, but also sought an order to set up a special investigation team (SIT) headed by a retired Supreme Court or high court judge to conduct a forensic analysis of the of the electronic evidence, claimed to have been collected by police against them, and to compensate them for their wrongful detention in the case. NIA has denied the allegation that Wilson was falsely implicated in the case “by planting of false evidence” on his laptop. “There is no question of accepting the contention of the petitioner regarding planting of false evidence or fabricating of the evidence,” stated the affidavit. “Going by the case of the petitioner himself that the alleged attack had taken place even before the FIR (first information report) was lodged, it is for the petitioner to explain as to how this attack has taken place when the device was in his control. As such, the petitioner cannot blame some other person, leave aside independent agencies like the present respondent,” it the affidavit added. Wilson and others have been arrested in connection with the offence registered by Vishrambaug police station in Pune on January 8, 2018, on the basis of a complaint lodged by a local builder, Tushar Damgude. The builder had alleged that members of banned outfit Communist Party of India (Maoist) and Kabir Kala Manch spread hatred through provocative songs, plays and speeches during the Elgar Parishad conclave held at Shaniwar Wada on December 31, 2017. The provocation led to the violence at Bhima Koregaon in Pune district, Damgude had alleged.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/elgar-parishad-report-citing-proof-was-planted-can-t-be-considered-now-says-nia-101619896554342.html

The murder case was also transferred to the federal agency on March 24 and Vaze was named the main accused in both the cases.According to NIA, Mane has played a role in Hiran murder case. He was present at the criminal intelligence unit of the Mumbai crime branch on March 2 and 3, when Vaze purportedly tried to convince Hiran to take the blame for placing the explosives-laden SUV near Antilia.NIA officers claimed that Vaze had assured the trader that he will get him out on bail in a few days. The plan to eliminate Hiran was allegedly hatched after he refused to take the blame and get arrested in the case.NIA has also claimed that it was Mane who had made the last call to the victim around 8.30pm on March 4, and had drawn him out of his Thane home on the pretext of a meeting along Ghodbunder Road. The next day, Hiran’s body was found in a creek at Retibunder near Mumbra, Thane, with six handkerchiefs stuffed in his mouth and his face covered by a scarf.While seeking an extension for Mane’s custody, NIA had on April 28 informed the special court that on March 4, Mane had picked up Vaze from Kalwa railway station, and later, the duo had picked up Hiran in a four-wheeler. Mane then snatched Hiran’s phone and dropped him along Ghodbunder Road with Vaze.It is, however, not yet clear as to who killed the Thane trader or how he was killed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/mumbai-cop-sunil-mane-remanded-in-judicial-custody-in-mansukh-hiran-murder-probe-101619896434334.html
02-05-2021||Mumbai||1,004 in 18-44 age group get the shot in Mumbai||A total of 1,004 citizens in the 18-44 age group were vaccinated in Mumbai, the first day of the third phase of the Covid-19 inoculation drive, according to state health department data.According to Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) officials, 2,500 people in the 18-44 age group will be vaccinated on Sunday. The 2,500 slots were open for booking from 7pm and were filled by 8pm, said the officials. Vaccination for the 45+ age group stays suspended owing to shortage of doses and will resume only after getting vaccines from the Central government, confirmed the officials. Late on Friday, the BMC had announced it would open five centres from Saturday for the 18-44 age group with limited doses (all Covishield) available, even as the ongoing vaccination drive for those above 45 years was suspended for three days in Mumbai due to inadequate supply. The 1,004 doses were made available to the BMC by state government. Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray had on Friday announced that vaccination for the 18-44 age group will begin from May 1, as scheduled, but with limited slots due to scarcity of doses and it would be gradually increased after the state government manages to procure more doses. In Mumbai alone, the BMC has an estimated 9 million people between the ages of 18 and 44, who would need vaccination through public and private vaccination centres. Expectedly, people were keen to get themselves vaccinated as early as possible. According to BMC officials, within 90 minutes after its announcement on Friday night, all slots were booked. The five centres where vaccination began at 1pm are Nair Hospital, Rajawadi Hospital in Ghatkopar, Cooper Hospital in Vile Parle, SevenHills Hospital in Andheri, and the BKC’s jumbo facility. Each centre vaccinated 200 beneficiaries each. Vaccination in the 18-44 age group is being done only at these five centres due to shortage of doses, BMC said in a statement on Saturday. The statement said, “BMC is making all arrangements to vaccinate maximum beneficiaries.” According to BMC officials, vaccination for 18-44 years of age group will be done only on basis of appointment through the Centre’s Cowin portal, and no walk-in vaccination will be conducted. The vaccination duration will be from 1pm to 6pm. Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner, BMC, said, “We will start vaccination for 45+ age group only after getting at least 100,000 vaccine doses. On the other hand, the vaccination for 18-44 age group for now will continue with the available vaccine stock.” According to BMC officials, it has around 19,000 doses of Covidshield in its stock for vaccinating 18-44 age group, and this will be used for vaccinating on an appointment basis only. 43-year-old Ajay Maurya, an IT professional from Kandivli who took the vaccine at Cooper Hospita,l said, “I came to know last night at around 11.30 pm that vaccination is going to start from tomorrow, and this is when I started to try for getting an appointment. I was continuously trying to get appointment for two hours after which I got one at around 1.45 am. My experience was very good, and the arrangements were very good at Cooper Hospital as people are allowed only with appointments.” Maurya added, “There was not much rush as compared to the rush there for 45+ age group vaccination. There were around 50 people in the queue, which is bearable. I along with my wife both got vaccinated. I wanted to get the vaccine since I wish to start going to my office soon. I know the vaccine will not be 100% helpful, but it will at least protect me from getting severely infected, and hence I feel all should get the vaccine.” Another, 34-year-old Ambika Poojary, a teacher, received the jab at Rajawadi Hospital on Saturday. Poojary, a resident of Sion, said, “Though my work is going to be online for next few months I was waiting to get vaccinated since long. This was one of the reasons I stayed up and booked my appointment at around 2.15am.” Poojary added, “My experience at the vaccination centre was good and we reached the centre at 7.45am, considering my husband had got a slot of 10am, that was cancelled later. There was a long queue for the vaccination, but I feel the overall experience was good, and I have not experienced any complications post vaccination. I also urge all citizens who are eligible to go and get vaccinated.” While all appointments got booked within hours after giving appointments was started, several citizens took to social media expressing their displeasure over not being able to book appointment for vaccine. A user, Sanjay P, said: “Unable to see any vaccination slots in Mumbai, for all other cities like Pune, Nagpur, slots are available. Not sure what’s the problem with Cowin app for only Mumbai city specifically.” Another Twitter user Gunjan Lahiri said, “Why are the vaccination centres not being updated on the app? I heard there are five sites in Mumbai that are vaccinating the 18+ but when you search, it says “no vaccination centres available for booking.” However, BMC officials said today was a token start of the vaccination drive. It will start in full fledged manner once adequate stock arrives. Meanwhile, Mumbai mayor Kishori Pednekar told reporters on Saturday morning that citizens should not rush to the vaccination centres unless they have been given a slot. “If you have registered but have not received a message, don’t go to the centre and crowd for no reason,” she said. The civic body has also appealed to citizens to wear double masks if they are going for vaccination. 22 year old Andheri resident, Priyanka Minda who got vaccinated at BKC said, “My experience with getting an appointment and getting vaccinated both was very smooth. I managed to get the appointment within five minutes and also during vaccination there was no queue or crowding. It was done with proper Covid protocols and social distancing.” Minda added, “The reason for taking it on the first day is because earlier when vaccination started for 45+ age group, there was no rush earlier, and later everyone started flocking. I wanted to avoid getting vaccinated in rush and so opted for it. Today or tomorrow everyone has to get vaccinated.” Another 34-year-old Andheri resident Pankaj Ahuja said, “My work nature is such that I have to meet a lot of people and hence it is better I take the vaccine soonest. We have been doing testing, tracing and treating since a year now and it cannot be the solution ultimately we all should get vaccinated. My experience at Cooper Hospital was very good and there was not much crowding too A 22-year- old Andheri resident, Priyanka Minda, who got vaccinated at BKC, said, “My experience with getting an appointment and getting vaccinated both was very smooth. I managed to get the appointment within five minutes and also during vaccination there was no queue or crowding. It was done with proper Covid protocols and social distancing.” Minda added, “The reason for taking it on the first day is because earlier when vaccination started for 45+ age group, there was no rush earlier, and later everyone started flocking. I wanted to avoid getting vaccinated during the rush and so opted for it. Today or tomorrow, everyone has to get vaccinated.” Another 34-year-old Andheri resident, Pankaj Ahuja, said, “My work nature is such that I have to meet a lot of people and hence it is better I take the vaccine as soon as possible. We have been doing testing, tracing and treating since a year now and it cannot be the solution. Ultimately we all should get vaccinated. My experience at Cooper Hospital was very good and there was not much crowding too.” Meanwhile, vaccination for 45 years and above could not be held across the state for the second day as the state is yet to get supply of vaccine doses from the Centre. In a release issued by the ministry of health and family welfare informed on Saturday that they have allocated around 2,327,510 doses for the first fortnight of this month.“We have received the allocation letter from the Centre but don’t know when we are going to receive the stock, said a senior official privy to the development.“No centre across the state has the stock and thus the drive could not be conducted on Saturday. We are waiting for the supply and will resume the drive in no time,” health minister Rajesh Tope told HT.(with inputs from Faisal Malik)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/1004-in-18-44-age-group-get-the-shot-in-mumbai-101619895654198.html

Police said the accused were allegedly selling each injection for ₹35,000.Deputy commissioner of police (Shahdara) R Sathiyasundaram said the accused, Anshuman (31) and Kartik (24), told police that they had allegedly procured the fake remdesivir injections from two persons, Akarshan from Noida and Anil from Delhi’s Laxmi Nagar. Police are on the lookout for the latter two suspects.According to the DCP, the accused allegedly procured each injection for around ₹9,000 and had already sold more than eight such fake medicines in Paschim Vihar, north Delhi and Rohini over the past few days.Around a fortnight ago, companies that manufacture remdesivir injections had lowered the price of the injections on the government’s request. As per the revised rates, the injection is available at price range of ₹899 to ₹3,490. However, as the demand for the injections soared due to the steep rise in Covid cases, people began hoarding remdesivir, leading to an acute shortage of the injections in the market. Currently, black marketeers are selling the injections to desperate Covid patients and their relatives for prices ranging from ₹25,000 to ₹40,000, senior police officers said.The Shahdara district police on Friday received information that Anshuman would come near Cross River Mall near Anand Vihar around 8 pm to deliver injections to a customer. Accordingly, a trap was laid and Anshuman was caught with an associate Kartik after they arrived in a Honda City car, said DCP Sathiyasundaram.“Anshuman was carrying 10 remdesivir injections in a polybag while Kartik had seven. After verification, all the injections were found fake as the company’s name mentioned on the vials does not exist,” said the DCP, adding that they were now looking for Anil and Akarshan.The crime branch had recently busted a syndicate manufacturing fake remdesivir vials in a factory in Uttarahand’s Kotdwar and selling them in black market through agents. Seven people, including the owner of the factory, were arrested between April 23 and April 29 from Delhi and Haridwar and a total of 198 fake remdesivir vials were seized from them.Police are currently probing if the fake medicines recovered on Friday are from the same manufacturing unit in Uttarakhand or are part of another syndicate.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/two-arrested-for-black-marketing-remdesivir-17-vials-recovered-101619895594230.html

Police said the incident happened around 4 am when the errant driver was returning home from a private hospital in Gurugram where his wife, a Covid patient, is undergoing treatment. He was arrested from the spot, police said.The constable, identified by his first name Munshilal, was checking and prosecuting lockdown violators while on night picket duty. The constable was sitting on a chair when the Honda CRV car hit him and dragged him along the pavement and the road for nearly 40 metres. The car also damaged a temporary tent set up on the pavement for the police personnel on duty at the check post, senior police officers said.The driver, identified as Samit Yadav from Munirka, allegedly told police that he was tired and had dozed off while the vehicle neared the check post. Since he was returning from a Covid hospital, police officers made him wear a PPE kit before taking him to the Vasant Vihar police station and isolating him in the premises.Deputy commissioner of police (southwest) Ingit Pratap Singh said that the mishap came to light around 4 am when the police control room received a call that constable Munshilal was hit by a vehicle at the Al-Kauser police picket, following which a team from the Vasant Vihar police station was sent there.“A white Honda CRV had badly damaged the picket, the tent erected for police staff and a motorcycle belonging to Munshilal, who was also dragged by the vehicle for 30-40 metres on the road by the vehicle. Munshilal was rushed to AIIMS Trauma Centre, where he died during treatment,” DCP Singh said.A case was registered under Indian Penal Code sections 279 (rash driving or riding in a public way) and 304A (causing death by negligence) and Yadav was arrested. His car was impounded.Police said that Munshilal was posted at the Vasant Vihar police station since August 2020. He is survived by his wife and three children, who are all married. The family originally hail from Alwar in Rajasthan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/constable-on-picket-duty-crushed-to-death-after-techie-dozes-off-at-wheel-101619895534650.html
02-05-2021||Delhi||Delhi HC tells Centre to ensure Delhi gets its oxygen quota||Anguished at the death of eight Covid-19 patients — four more deaths were reported later— at Batra Hospital in the city, the Delhi high court on Saturday gave the Centre a midnight deadline to ensure the allocation of 490 metric tonnes of medical oxygen reaches the Capital. Failing this, the court said it will initiate contempt action against the central government officials concerned.“Water has gone above the head. Now we mean business. Enough is enough…Do you mean we will shut our eyes to people dying in Delhi?,” a bench of justices Vipin Sanghi and Rekha Palli said when the Centre’s counsel said the issue of oxygen crisis is also being heard before the Supreme Court, which will make its order public next Saturday.“We direct the central government to ensure Delhi receives its allocated supply of 490MT positively today [Saturday], by whatever means. Considering the fact that Delhi is not an industrial state, and does not have cryogenic tankers of its own, which can be requisitioned under the Disaster Management Act – like other States have done, it falls upon the central government to arrange the tankers as well...,” observed the bench.The bench also asked the Centre to ensure they make cryogenic tankers available for the city, while noting that Delhi has not received the 490MT of oxygen that it has been allocated even once. It directed two central officers to be present on Monday, when the matter will be heard next, if the orders are not complied with.It also declined the Centre’s request to defer the order till Monday for half-an-hour. “We have passed an order. You comply with that. That’s the end of it,” the court remarked.The directions came after Sudhanshu Bankata, executive director of Batra Hospital, told the court that his facility ran out of oxygen for one-and-a-half hours on Saturday. He said a doctor was among the eight Covid-19 patients who died due to oxygen shortage. He said that as the court heard the case, time was running out for other critically ill patients at the hospital.During the proceedings, the court was also informed by senior advocate Rahul Mehra, who appeared for the Delhi government, about an SOS message from Vijay Bidhuri, a city officer, which read that the city’s oxygen reserves were exhausted.In the message, which Mehra read aloud during the proceedings, Bidhuri said there was minimal supply from two firms — Linde and Air Liquide — on Saturday. Mehra said somebody needs to pull up the suppliers, alleging that they are diverting supply “under pressure.”“My officers will have a nervous breakdown. Our tankers are not given priority and they keep on standing for hours and hours. We need to know what is going on behind the scenes. You are actually killing patients by not giving it,” he said.He also informed the court that the city on Friday received only 312MT of oxygen, as against the Centre’s 490MT allocation.Advocate Amit Mahajan, the standing counsel for the central government, said, “Whatever is coming is good enough”. The bench, however, slammed this response. “We will not hear that what is coming is good enough. [Solicitor General Tushar] Mehta had said it, and we rejected it. This is not enough”.Mehra said the Delhi government can add more beds for Covid-19 patients, for which it will need 956MT oxygen.The court asked Mahajan to look into the matter and said, “Sort this out. Inform your officers that Linde is not supplying.” When Mahajan said Linde has to explain, the court said, “But you made the allocation. It falls on you. You have to do it now.”The court also asked the Centre why four cryogenic tankers that were meant for Delhi, but have been held up by the Rajasthan government, not been released despite the court’s earlier orders. It directed the Centre to take necessary steps to fulfil the assurance from S-G Mehta on April 26 that the tankers will be released.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/hc-tells-centre-to-ensure-delhi-gets-its-oxygen-quota-101619895474221.html
02-05-2021||Mumbai||Vax drive for 18-44 age group begins in 27 districts in Maharashtra||Maharashtra government on Saturday kicked off its vaccination drive for the 18-44 age group on a limited scale due to a shortage of vaccine. It was a symbolic start as it coincided with the formation of the state in 1960 on May 1, which is observed as Maharashtra Day. The vaccination drive was launched in 27 districts across the state. Rest nine districts will start from Sunday.The state vaccinated a total of 11,492 beneficiaries till 6pm at 132 centres, officials said. All vaccination centres were run by the state government or municipal bodies and vaccination were free.In Mumbai, 1,004 doses were administered at five vaccination centres.The nine districts where the drive could not be started are — Raigad, Ratnagiri, Sundhudurg, Osmanabad, Akola, Washim, Wardha, Chandrapur and Gondia.The state government has planned to cover seven days with over 300,000 doses. It has directed district administrations to open a maximum of five centres and vaccinate a limited number of beneficiaries daily so that a week can be covered and the next stock can be arranged by that time to continue the drive.The drive was started after the Serum Institute of India (SII) provided a stock of 300,000 Covishield vaccine doses on Friday. The state is looking to get more stock from SII as it has assured to provide a stock of around 1.4 million doses this month. Similarly, Bharat Biotech has assured to supply 400,000 doses of Covaxin for May, officials said.Expanding the nationwide drive, the Centre threw open vaccination for all adults from May 1, asking the states to inoculate the 18-44 age group by procuring doses from the open market.Around 60 million population of Maharashtra comes under the age group of 18-44 that will require 120 million doses to get them immunized from the virus. The state has already declared to provide free doses of the vaccine for all adults up to 44 years of age at government-run centres. It will cost the state exchequer ₹6,500 crore. The decision was taken in the state cabinet meeting held on Wednesday.On Friday, chief minister Uddhav Thackeray announced starting the drive from May 1. He was keen on launching it considering the foundation of the state.“We had issued a purchase order for 300,000 doses for Covishield to SII against which the stock was received on Friday. It was distributed among all the districts to launch the drive. The firm has provided the stock for ₹300 per dose and the state has spent ₹9 crore for it,” said a senior official, requesting anonymity.State health minister Rajesh Tope said that they have received around 300,000 doses with the help of which the drive was started at limited centres across all the districts of the state. “We have directed the district administration to ensure the stock will last for seven days. To ensure this, we have divided all the 36 districts into three categories based on their population — major, medium and small. The districts coming under the major category were given 20,000 doses, medium — 7,500 doses and the districts that came under the small category were provided stock of 5,000 doses. The local administration has been asked to open a maximum of five centres where the drive should be conducted,” he said.However, the state is not aware when they are going to get another stock of doses either by SII or Bharat Biotech. “We have yet to receive any communication either from SII or Bharat Biotech on when they are going to send the next stock,” the official said.On Friday, Tope has said SII has informed them that they can provide 1,400,000 -1,500,000 doses in May whereas Bharat Biotech has assured to provide between 400,000 and 450,000 doses in the next month. “Together, we are expecting to get around 1.8 million doses in May based on which the state can start the drive at limited centres in each district,” the health minister said.On Saturday, the health minister also said that their discussion with other manufacturers is also going on. “The stock of Sputnik doses arrived in the country and we are in talks with them for supply. We are also exploring options for importing other vaccines such as Johnson and Johnson and Zydus Cadila,” he apprised.Meanwhile, people reached vaccination centres in large numbers to get vaccinated which led to crowding at many places across the state including Mumbai. At Ratnagiri, people gathered outside the vaccination centre early morning at 5, only to return without being vaccinated as the drive could not be started due to technical reasons, the officials said.Deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar said that the chief minister has spoken with Prime Minister Narendra Modi about importing the vaccine. “We are not dependent only on Covishield and have booked the stock with Covaxin. We also want to import Johnson and Johnson and Pfizer. CM Thackeray has spoken with the PM and is waiting for his approval. If the Centre allows us to import then things will become smooth,” Pawar told reporters in Pune.He also criticized the Centre for importing vaccine doses to many countries saying that the country may have not been facing a shortage of Covid vaccine if it was not exported to other countries. “There was no need to send the vaccine doses manufactured in the country in the beginning. If that stock of vaccine doses was provided to the people in the country then we may have avoided the shortage of vaccine doses the entire country is reeling with at present,” he slammed.Of the total 11,942 beneficiaries, maximum 1,316 beneficiaries were inoculated in Pune, while 1,004 people were immunised in Mumbai. Parbhani too vaccinated 846 beneficiaries, stated a release issued by the state health department.Meanwhile, vaccination for 45 years and above could not be held across the state for the second day as the state is yet to get supply of vaccine doses from the Centre. In a release issued by the ministry of health and family welfare informed on Saturday that they have allocated around 2,327,510 doses for the first fortnight of this month.“We have received the allocation letter from the Centre but don’t know when we are going to receive the stock, said a senior official privy to the development.“No centre across the state has the stock and thus the drive could not be conducted on Saturday. We are waiting for the supply and will resume the drive in no time,” Tope told HT.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/vax-drive-for-18-44-age-group-begins-in-27-districts-in-maharashtra-101619892233928.html
02-05-2021||Delhi||Senior doctor among 12 dead after Delhi's Batra hospital runs out of oxygen||Twelve Covid patients including a senior doctor admitted to the intensive care unit of south Delhi’s Batra hospital died on Saturday due to an 80-minute disruption in oxygen supply, a top official of the hospital said, underlining that the next 24-48 hours are critical for some more patients whose condition deteriorated due to the disruption.Eight patients including senior consultant Dr RK Himthani (head of the hospital’s gastroenterology department died within minutes of the hospital running out of cylinders. Dr Sudhanshu Bankata, executive director of the hospital, had then expressed fears that the death toll could increase.“And, it (deaths) is not going to stop at eight. Once the patient’s condition deteriorates then you cannot salvage that patient. There is a ripple effect, there would be many who must have destabilised by now and the number of deaths will certainly go up,” said Dr Bankata said.By Saturday evening, Dr Bankata confirmed four more deaths and cautioned that some more patients were still critical.For some other patients, he said, the next 24-48 hours are going to be critical.“We have lost lives,” the hospital’s executive director had informed the Delhi high court a few hours earlier when it was hearing petitions on shortage of oxygen supply in the national capital.The judge said the issue should have been raised with Rahul Mehra, who is representing the Delhi government in the high court, before the proceedings began. The court also said that the hospital should learn a lesson and maybe set up its own oxygen plants.According to the hospital, it had raised an alarm with all the government-appointed officials at 7 am after not receiving its allocated liquid medical oxygen. Despite this, the hospital did not receive its oxygen supply and completely ran out of liquid oxygen at 12:15 pm on Saturday.“We have been allocated less quantity of oxygen than is needed, so we are constantly running around to get oxygen every day. We have also been linked to two suppliers both of whom do not deliver the oxygen on time. And, the Delhi government tanker that was on SOS duty reached the hospital only at 1:35 pm despite having been informed at 7 am,” said Dr Bankata.The hospital has currently received 1,000 litres of oxygen from the Delhi government’s SOS tanker, “which is only going to last for another 1.5 hours,” said Dr Bankata.Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal described the news of more patients dying due to shortage of oxygen as “very painful”.“These lives could have been saved by giving oxygen on time,” he said in a tweet, reiterating his government’s demand for medical oxygen.“Delhi should get its quota of oxygen. We can’t see our people dying like this any more. Delhi needs 976 MT of oxygen and yesterday received only 312 MT. How will Delhi breathe with inadequate oxygen”.On Friday, the Supreme Court had asked the Centre to consider increasing Delhi’s medical oxygen quota from the current 490MT and ensure that supply reaches the Capital. The allotted 490MT, the bench said, has not reached the Capital even once because of logistical constraints.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/senior-doctor-among-8-dead-after-delhi-s-batra-hospital-runs-out-of-oxygen-101619863793181.html
02-05-2021||Delhi||Delhi can add 650 critical care beds if oxygen assured at three govt hospitals||The number of critical care beds in Delhi can go up by at least 650 if the Capital is able to assure a steady supply of oxygen at just three government hospitals — GTB hospital, Rajiv Gandhi Superspeciality hospital and AIIMS. This will be in addition to the 1,200 makeshift ICU beds that the government plans to set up, even as Delhi continues to report over 20,000 new coronavirus cases each day.The uncertainty over oxygen has also forced several hospitals to restrict new admissions, which will also ease up once the supply is restored.The critical care beds include ICUs, high dependency units (also seen as step-down ICUs) and high flow oxygen beds.Delhi has added 116 ICU beds since Thursday, taking the total number of ICU beds to 5,020. However, only 44 were vacant on Friday night -- the highest since April 18 -- as per the government’s Delhi Corona app.The biggest Delhi government-run hospital in trans-Yamuna region, GTB, had to reduce the number of beds allocated for Covid-19 from over 900 to 700 last week because of the oxygen crisis. “No hospital is designed to support critical patients on more than 90% of its beds; we are only admitting critical patients. So, we had to reduce the number of beds as our oxygen plant was running at full capacity. Yesterday, the hospital almost ran out of oxygen at night. We had to stop new admissions,” said a senior doctor from the hospital.The hospital authorities said it can restore over 200 beds if they receive regular supply and additional staff. The Delhi government has allowed all its hospitals to hire doctors, nurses, and other staff, including those who have retired, to take care of critically ill patients. “There is hardly any trained staff left in Delhi; but we are trying to do whatever we can,” the doctor said.Another Delhi government hospital in the same area, Rajiv Gandhi Superspeciality hospital, had to reduce the number of beds from 550 to 350 due to the uncertainty in oxygen supply. “We have just 100 doctors but we have previously run 550 beds with critical patients and we can do it again if we are assured supply of oxygen,” said a senior doctor at the hospital.At AIIMS, the plan to convert non-Covid beds for the treatment of the viral infection has slowed down because of the uncertainty in oxygen supply.“The number of non-Covid-19 patient coming in to the hospital has reduced drastically. So, we are trying to convert 200 to 250 beds into Covid wards. The availability of the oxygen is a big hindrance,” said a senior administrator from the hospital.The Centre has allocated 490 MT of oxygen to Delhi, which has been demanding 700 MTDr Narin Sehgal, Delhi secretary of Association of Healthcare Providers (India) and medical director of Sehgal Neo hospital, said, “SOS calls are being raised by one hospital or the other every 30 minutes across Delhi... People are dying and you don’t give them oxygen?”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-can-add-650-critical-care-beds-if-o2-assured-at-three-govt-hospitals-101619819855657.html
02-05-2021||World||US travel ban strategy doesn’t make sense, ex-FDA chief says||The travel bans imposed by the U.S. on countries including India, China and the U.K. lack a clear sense of purpose and don’t make sense, said former FDA commissioner Scott Gottlieb.“I’m not sure what we are hoping to accomplish. If the goal is to try to prevent the introduction of virus into the U.S., there’s plenty of virus here,” Gottlieb said on CBS’s “Face the Nation” on Sunday.Responding to the U.S. ban on most travel from India, due to go into effect on Tuesday, he said, “If the goal is to try to prevent the introduction of a new variant 617 that’s circling India, I assure you it’s here already.”“These travel restrictions could serve a purpose but we need to be clear about what that purpose is,” Gottlieb added. “Right now we still have restrictions in place against travel from China and the U.K. that doesn’t make a lot of sense.”Coronavirus variants “aren’t just cropping up in one market and migrating around the world. They’re cropping up simultaneously in every market,” he said.President Joe Biden announced a new travel ban on visitors from India beginning May 4, as the country struggles to combat the worst surge of coronavirus cases in the world. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended the ban, which won’t apply to U.S. citizens or permanent residents.Biden has also continued the restrictions of travel to the U.S. from the U.K., China and other areas, imposed by the Trump administration, even though the virus situation has changed since last year, and vaccinations are moving ahead.There has been signs of relaxation. Last week the U.S. eased travel restrictions for students from China and other countries to facilitate their return to U.S. campuses in the fall.The European Union is set to open its doors this summer to U.S. tourists who’ve been fully vaccinated against Covid-19, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said last week. However, the U.S. State Department maintains its “Do Not Travel” advisories for about 80% of the world’s nations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-travel-ban-strategy-doesn-t-make-sense-ex-fda-chief-says-101619975021902.html

This could lead rather quickly to efforts within Congress to pressure the State Department to designate Pakistan a state sponsor of terror," he said."Diplomats and the State Department's internal Pakistan lobby may dismiss such a notion, but a combination of Pakistani triumphalism amidst the backdrop of US withdrawal and any subsequent Taliban atrocities will ignite public opinion and lead American politicians to take symbolic action. Pakistan should be prepared to join a club putting them alongside Iran, Syria, and North Korea," he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-withdrawal-from-afghanistan-could-lead-to-designating-pak-as-terror-sponsor-american-scholar-101619972846771.html
02-05-2021||World||US denies Iran's claims of prisoner, cash swap; UK downplays||The United States on Sunday immediately denied a report by Iran's state-run television broadcaster that deals had been reached between the Islamic Republic, Washington and the United Kingdom that would see prisoners swapped and Tehran receive billions of dollars.The announcement by state television, relying on an unnamed source, comes amid a wider power struggle between hard-liners and the relatively moderate government of Iranian President Hassan Rouhani. That conflict only has grown sharper as Iran approaches its June 18 presidential election.The broadcaster long controlled by hard-liners has aired similarly anonymously sourced reports contradicting diplomats in Vienna trying to negotiate a return to its nuclear deal with world powers.It wasn't immediately clear if Sunday's report represented another means to disrupt negotiations by Rouhani officials or sabotage any potential negotiations with the West over frozen funds and prisoner exchanges.The official quoted by Iranian state TV said a deal made between the U.S. and Tehran involved a prisoner swap in exchange for the release of $7 billion in frozen Iranian funds.“The Americans accepted to pay $7 billion and swap four Iranians who were active in bypassing sanctions for four American spies who have served part of their sentences,” state TV said, quoting the official in an on-screen crawl. It did not name the Iranians that Tehran sought to be freed.U.S. State Department spokesman Ned Price immediately denied the Iranian state TV report.“Reports that a prisoner swap deal has been reached are not true," Price said. "As we have said, we always raise the cases of Americans detained or missing in Iran. We will not stop until we are able to reunite them with their families.”Price did not elaborate. But Biden’s chief of staff Ron Klain told CBS’ “Face the Nation” that “unfortunately that report is untrue. There is no agreement to release these four Americans.”“We’re working very hard to get them released,” Klain said. "We raise this with Iran and our interlocutors all the time but so far there’s no agreement.”Tehran holds four known Americans now in prison. They include Baquer and Siamak Namazi, environmentalist Morad Tahbaz and Iranian-American businessman Emad Shargi.State TV also quoted the official as saying a deal had been reached for the United Kingdom to pay 400 million pounds to see the release of British-Iranian woman Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe.British officials downplayed the report. The Foreign Office said that the country continues “to explore options to resolve this 40-year old case and we will not comment further as legal discussions are ongoing.’’Last week, Zaghari-Ratcliffe was sentenced to an additional year in prison, her lawyer said, on charges of spreading “propaganda against the system” for participating in a protest in front of the Iranian Embassy in London in 2009.That came after she completed a five-year prison sentence in the Islamic Republic after being convicted of plotting the overthrow of Iran’s government, a charge that she, her supporters and rights groups deny.While employed at the Thomson Reuters Foundation, the charitable arm of the news agency, she was taken into custody at the Tehran airport in April 2016 as she was returning home to Britain after visiting family.Richard Ratcliffe, the husband of Zaghari-Ratcliffe, told The Associated Press he was not aware of any swap in the works."We haven’t heard anything," he said. “Of course we probably wouldn’t, but my instinct is to be skeptical at present.”Earlier Sunday, U.K. Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab told the BBC that he believed Zaghari-Ratcliffe was being held “unlawfully” by Iran.“I think she’s been treated in the most abusive, tortuous way,” Raab said. “I think it amounts to torture the way she’s been treated and there is a very clear, unequivocal obligation on the Iranians to release her and all of those who are being held as leverage immediately and without condition.”Last week, Cabinet spokesman Ali Rabiei hinted that a prisoner swap between Iran and the U.S. may be in the works, saying the idea “has always been on the agenda” and noting the judiciary has confirmed its “readiness.” His remarks followed that of the Foreign Ministry spokesman who suggested Tehran hopes to swing a major prisoner swap as part of ongoing negotiations in Vienna. A similar swap accompanied the 2015 nuclear deal with world powersTehran is now negotiating with world powers over both it and the U.S. returning to its 2015 nuclear deal, which saw it limit its uranium enrichment in exchange for the lifting of economic sanctions.As the negotiations continue, Iranian negotiators there have offered encouraging comments, while state TV quoted anonymous sources striking maximalist positions. That even saw Abbas Araghchi, the Iranian deputy foreign minister leading the talks, offer a rebuke on Twitter last week to Iranian state television's English-language arm, Press TV.“I don’t know who the ‘informed source’ of Press TV in Vienna is, but s/he is certainly not ‘informed,'” Araghchi wrote.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-denies-iran-s-claims-of-prisoner-cash-swap-uk-downplays-101619969076793.html
02-05-2021||World||Trump-backed candidate heads to runoff in Texas special congressional election||A Texas Republican backed by former President Donald Trump has advanced to a runoff election to fill a U.S. House of Representatives vacancy left by the death of her husband, while Democrats appeared in danger of being shut out of the contest.Susan Wright, whose husband Ron Wright in February became the first sitting member of Congress to die of Covid-19, was the top vote-getter on Saturday in a crowded field of 23 candidates vying to represent the state's 6th Congressional District.Wright appeared likely to face another Republican in the expected runoff in the Dallas-Fort Worth suburbs, a longtime Republican-held district.Democrats had hoped to pick up the seat to expand their slim House majority.Wright received 19.2% of the vote, followed by former military fighter pilot Jake Ellzey, another Republican, who drew 13.8%, according to the Texas secretary of state's office. Just 354 votes and less than half a percentage point separated Ellzey from Democrat Jana Lynne Sanchez, who was in third place with 13.4%."Democrats have come a long way toward competing in Texas, but tonight shows we still have a long way to go," Sanchez, the granddaughter of Mexican immigrants, wrote on Twitter.A runoff between the top two vote-getters is required since no candidate received a majority in the first round. A runoff date has not yet been set.In a bizarre twist on election eve, Wright's campaign asked federal law enforcement authorities to look into reports of robocalls falsely alleging she had murdered her husband.The election was the first test of the Texas electorate since President Joe Biden's 2020 election victory. Trump defeated Biden in Texas, a state where Democrats hope to make inroads.The outcome could deprive Democrats of their best shot at winning a Republican-held House seat in several special elections scheduled for this year to replace House members who have either died or taken posts in Biden's administration.The national Democratic Party did not back any candidate in the contest, although Democrats have made gains in the north Texas district in recent years. Trump won the district by 3 percentage points last year."Democrats didn't get their people out there, and then to the extent to which they did ... they split up a lot of the Democratic votes," said Mark Jones, a Rice University political science professor.Jones said Trump's endorsement, coming just a few days before the election, appeared to have helped Wright.There were 10 Democrats in the race, as well as 11 Republicans, an independent and a Libertarian. Every seat in the House counts, as Democrats currently have a narrow six-seat majority and will be battling to keep control of both chambers of Congress in the 2022 mid-term elections.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trumpbacked-candidate-heads-to-runoff-in-texas-special-congressional-election-101619962795599.html

However, a leftist march of 8,000 people through the city's Neukoelln and Kreuzberg neighborhood, which has seen clashes in past decades, turned violent. Protesters threw bottles and rocks at officers, and burned garbage cans and wooden pallets in the streets.“Violence against police officers and a blind, destructive rage has nothing to do with political protest,” Berlin state interior minister Andreas Geisel said.Geisel condemned the throwing of bottles and rocks, the burning barricades on the streets and especially the violence toward police.“The high number of injured officer leaves me stunned. I wish all of those who were injured in the line of duty a quick recovery,” he said.There's a nightly curfew in most parts of Germany because of the high number of coronavirus infections, but political protests and religious gatherings are exempt from the curfew.In France, May Day marches in Paris and the southern city of Lyon were also marred by scattered violence, with riot officers targeted by small groups of violent demonstrators who tossed projectiles and trash bins. Police made 56 arrests — 46 of them in Paris, the Interior Ministry said Sunday. It said six officers suffered injuries, three of them in Paris.The CGT labor union that organized the main Paris march said violent demonstrators also targeted its marchers at the end of the rally, showering them with projectiles, blows and homophobic, sexist and racist insults. The union said 21 of its participants were injured, four seriously.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/over-90-german-police-injured-in-may-day-riots-101619969031895.html

Raab told Sky News that he recently spoke to external affairs minister S Jaishankar and assured him help in whatever way possible. He stressed that the UK was “doing everything that our Indian friends need in their hour of need.”The ministry of health and family welfare on Sunday morning said that 3,92,488 new Covid-19 cases and 3,689 related deaths were reported in the last 24 hours. The huge spike in Covid-19 cases has overwhelmed India’s health care infrastructure and a shortage of oxygen and other medical supplies have been reported from multiple states."I recently spoke to foreign minister Jaishankar, my opposite number there, and we said that we’ll do whatever we can, whatever they ask for,” the UK foreign secretary said."I do think it's important with these emergency packages, you listen very carefully to the Indian authorities and see that we're giving them what they need,” he added.Also Read | UK in last lap in fight against Covid-19, says foreign secretary RaabRaab’s assurance comes days after UK health secretary Matt Hancock said Britain had no excess vaccine doses to donate. However, the foreign secretary didn’t explicitly address the speculation surrounding vaccine donation. Raab said that the UK has provided oxygen concentrators, ventilators, and it will be sending another package of a “thousand ventilators very shortly.”“We have also looked at these oxygen generators like mini factories and that's the thing they need right now and I've been in regular contact with foreign minister Jaishankar and I'll be seeing him tomorrow as well,” Raab added.In another TV appearance on BBC, the Conservative leader said India had not requested vaccines from the UK and he would not speculate on a “hypothetical scenario”. While 65% of all adults in the UK have received at least one dose of vaccine against coronavirus disease (Covid-19), India has administered one dose of vaccine to only 9% of its population, according to the data shared by respective governments.“We obviously want to cooperate very closely together. Right throughout this crisis we’ve said we need to keep supply chains, particularly critical supply chains, open, and we ought to resolve these kinds of issues through collaboration, and that is certainly what we’re doing with the Indians,” Raab told BBC.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uks-raab-assures-india-help-with-whatever-they-ask-for-amid-covid-19-crisis-101619966487635.html

All public health efforts will continue in order to break the chain of infection and ensure public safety," Adham said.He did not say when the variant was detected.Malaysia, which is facing a surge in COVID-19 cases, on Wednesday banned flights to and from India and prohibited travellers from any Indian destination from entering the country to prevent the spread of the new variant.India is battling a devastating second wave of the coronavirus that has overwhelmed hospitals, morgues and crematoriums.Malaysia in February launched a nationwide COVID-19 vaccination programme, aiming to inoculate 80% of its 32 million people within a year.The Southeast Asian country reported 3,418 new coronavirus cases on Sunday, bringing its total number of infections to 415,012 cases, including more than 1,500 deaths.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/malaysia-reports-first-case-of-india-s-covid-19-variant-101619947426995.html
02-05-2021||World||UK in last lap in fight against Covid-19, says foreign secretary Raab||The UK is very close to turning the corner in its fight against the coronavirus pandemic and it is important to remain careful in the last lap of the process, UK Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said on Sunday.The senior Cabinet minister was defending the government’s roadmap out of the lockdown, which is now set to ease further on May 17 when greater indoor interactions are expected to be allowed, with June 21 set as the date for a near complete end to lockdown rules.Some groups and businesses such as restaurants have called for a quicker lifting of restrictions."I know that people are hankering to go a bit faster but actually we feel vindicated at taking steady steps out of the lockdown is the smart way to go,” Raab told ‘Sky News’.“We're very close now to really turning the corner and I think we still need to be careful to go as I said we don't want to see the gains lost and the sacrifices that have been made undone. By the time we get to June 21 almost all social restrictions will be lifted, so there's only a little bit more time to go but it's right we do that in a careful way,” the minister said."I do think we just need to make sure that in the last lap, if you like, that we are careful and we don't lose the gains we've made,” he said.The minister also indicated that the government is looking at certain social distancing and other safeguards that would still be needed after June 21.“We want to get to a position, at the end of June, where we can get life back as close to normal as possible, but they’ll still need to be some safeguards in place,” he said.According to some plans in the works, daily lateral flow tests could be used as an alternative to isolation for those who have been in contact with someone who tests positive for the coronavirus.Currently, these people must quarantine for 10 days but a trial in England will see daily lateral flow tests given to as many as 40,000 people. Participants in the trial will be sent a week's worth of tests and will be able to go about normal life as long as their daily results are negative.The trial could provide evidence that would reduce the length of time contacts of positive cases need to isolate."This new pilot could help shift the dial in our favour by offering a viable alternative to self-isolation for people who are contacts of positive Covid-19 cases, and one that would allow people to carry on going to work and living their lives," said UK Health Secretary Matt Hancock.The trial will begin on May 9 and close contacts of people with Covid-19 will be contacted by phone and sent seven days of the tests if they decide to participate in the study.They will have to test themselves every morning for seven days and, as long as they test negative and do not have symptoms, they will be exempt from the home isolation rule."This study will help to determine whether we can deploy daily testing for contacts to potentially reduce the need for self-isolation, while still ensuring that chains of transmission are stopped," said Professor Isabel Oliver, who is leading the study as Public Health England's national infection service director."Contacts of cases are at higher risk of infection so testing them is a very effective way of preventing further spread," Oliver said.Meanwhile, ‘The Sunday Times’ reported that health officials are drawing up plans to offer the Pfizer vaccine to secondary school pupils from September.A document seen by the newspaper said children over the age of 12 could be offered a single dose when the new school year begins.The move will depend on advice from the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI), which has so far focussed on advice only for adults aged 18 and over. The government target is to cover all over-18s with at least one dose of a Covid-19 vaccine by July-end.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-in-last-lap-in-fight-against-covid-19-says-foreign-secretary-raab-101619957001602.html

Pichai told CNN that it has been “heartening” to see the kind of attention people at the highest levels in the United States have been giving to the health crisis unfolding in India and other countries.“The situation there is dire and it has been heartbreaking to see.

02-05-2021||World||Celebrity politicians test voter interest in post-Trump era||From Ronald Reagan and Arnold Schwarzenegger to Al Franken and Donald Trump, there’s a rich history of celebrities trying out new careers in politics.The list could soon grow.In California, former Olympian Caitlyn Jenner is running for governor. In Texas, Oscar-winning actor Matthew McConaughey is generating buzz as a potential candidate for governor. In New York City, Andrew Yang, a businessman who gained fame during his quixotic 2020 presidential run, is a leading contender for the Democratic mayoral nomination.Each has the type of name recognition that other political newcomers would envy. But as they consider running some of the nation's largest and most complicated governments in the country, their lack of experience in public office could be a vulnerability. That's especially true after the tumult of the Trump era, when the reality television star-turned-president often spent more time raging about his media coverage than managing the federal bureaucracy.“I do think it definitely makes it slightly harder," said Daniel Ketchell, who was chief of staff to Schwarzenegger, the bodybuilder-turned-Hollywood star who won a California recall election in 2003 and became a two-term governor. “I think people are looking at you and that narrative of: We just elected an outsider celebrity and it didn’t work out for the country, we didn’t get much done for the country, we all were stressed out all the time.”Jenner, a gold medal-winning decathlete and transgender rights activists perhaps best known for being part of the Kardashian family, launched her campaign last week challenging Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom in his likely recall race. Bolstered by her 3.5 million Twitter followers and nearly 11 million on Instagram, the Jenner campaign believes that name recognition — will make her a strong competitor in a race they see as a referendum on Newsom's leadership.But Rob Stutzman, a GOP consultant in the state who advised Schwarzenegger’s winning recall campaign, said there are key differences between Jenner and Schwarzenegger, who was then arguably the biggest movie star in the world.“There’s famous and then there’s Arnold Schwarzenegger famous,” he said, rejecting the idea that Trump had turned voters against celebrities."People will say they don’t like celebrity candidates until there’s a celebrity candidate they like,” he said. “A lot of Democrats hated Donald Trump, but they might be pretty enthralled with Matthew McConaughey. ... It’s still about winning and likability.”Much else is also different this time around.California has grown even more Democratic over the past 20 years, making it harder for a Republican, especially one who openly backed Trump, to gain traction.Schwarzenegger, strategists note, was already well known in the state as a champion of after-school programs, and had a history of civic engagement, having served as chair of President George H.W. Bush's Council on Physical Fitness and Sports. It also didn't hurt that he was married to Maria Shriver, a member of the Kennedy family dynasty.Reagan was also well versed in politics before running a campaign of his own by virtue of leading the Screen Actors Guild.While Jenner has advocated for transgender people since coming out in 2015 and experience in the business world, it is unclear where she stands on a slew of other policy questions. Indeed, her current website offers only a vague 68-word statement, along with a fundraising portal and online store selling stemless wine glasses and yard signs. (Her campaign says policy plans are coming soon.)She has already faced backlash after mistakenly suggesting in a tweet that district attorneys in the state were appointed, not elected. (She later said she knew that was the case.)“Also, do you know how a bill becomes a law?” quipped Rep. Ted Lieu, D-Calif., offering a link to the famous “Schoolhouse Rock” animation. “Do you know what ‘veto’ means? Or ‘budget’?”Celebrities-turned-politicians have long recognized the extra work they must do to counteract a dearth of governing experience. When Schwarzenegger ran, aides created what they called “Schwarzenegger University” to get up to speed on issues.Franken, the “Saturday Night Live” star who later became a Democratic senator from Minnesota, largely avoided the national press during his first years in office as he tried to redefine himself as a serious lawmaker. Jesse Ventura, the professional wrestler who became Minnesota's governor, surrounded himself with experienced aides.“No question that there was, I think, a preconceived notion that he might have some trouble engaging others to his administration," John Wodele, who served as Ventura’s spokesman in office. “However, the actions that he took right after the election to bring people into his administration with experience and knowledge and impeccable reputations quickly dispelled that.”Wodele added: "I think coming out of the wrestling environment and celerity, a lot of people misjudged him in terms of his intellect. He was underestimated in terms of his ability to understand and reason."In New York, Yang has ridden his losing presidential bid to a leading slot in the crowded mayoral race, which some of his rivals have sought to turn against him. In his first ad of the race, City Comptroller Scott Stringer, who has faced calls to drop out after a former volunteer accused him of sexual misconduct, stressed his experience in an implicit slap at Yang. “He’s not a celebrity. He doesn’t govern by Tweet or TikTok," the Stringer ad began.Yang's campaign manager, Chris Coffey, rejected the characterization of the candidate as a celebrity, comparing Yang instead with Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the Democratic congresswoman from New York who has become a household name because of her progressive politics.“There's a pretty big difference between starting a reality show and starting a political movement based on raising people out of poverty and giving people cash," Coffey said of Yang.But star power, argued Democratic strategist Hank Sheinkopf, is what voters want.“We live in a culture of gossip and entertainment. That’s how Trump became president. That’s one of the reasons why Yang is at the front of the pack," said Democratic strategist Hank Sheinkopf. He said that with New York having gone through so much during the pandemic, many voters may simply long for a smiling face and a cheerleader.“The city, like other cities, is in the dumps,” Sheinkopf said. “With his celebrity, he's interesting."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/celebrity-politicians-test-voter-interest-in-post-trump-era-101619957000899.html

02-05-2021||World||China's carrier group conducts exercises in South China Sea||China’s Shandong aircraft carrier group has recently conducted routine annual exercises in the South China Sea, the People’s Liberation Army said Sunday, after Beijing criticized the U.S. for sending Navy ships into the strategic area.The Chinese Defense Ministry last week urged the U.S. to restrain its front-line forces in the air and seas near China. U.S. reconnaissance aircraft and warships have become more active around China since President Biden took office, it said.The South China Sea is particularly contentious because China's smaller neighbors also have competing claims to one of the world's busiest sea lanes, which Beijing claims virtually in its entirety. China has constructed several man-made islands in the disputed waters in what the U.S. says is a move to militarize the area.Navy spokesperson Gao Xiucheng said in a statement that the exercises were completely legitimate and part of safeguarding national sovereignty, security and development interests, as well as maintaining regional peace and stability.“We hope the outside world will view it in an objective and rational way. In the future, the Chinese navy will continue to hold similar exercises as planned,” said Gao.The Shandong is the second Chinese aircraft carrier to enter service after the Liaoning, which was originally purchased as a hulk from Ukraine and entirely refurbished.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinas-carrier-group-conducts-exercises-in-south-china-sea-101619947557938.html

There were no immediate reports of casualties there.The protests are only one of the problems the generals have brought on with their Feb. 1 ouster of the elected government led by Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi.Wars with ethnic minority insurgents in remote frontier regions in the north and east have intensified significantly over the past three months, displacing tens of thousands of civilians, according to U.N. estimates.In some places, civilians with crude weapons have battled security forces while in central areas military and government facilities that have been secure for generations have been hit by rocket attacks and a wave of small, unexplained blasts.EXPLOSIONSThe state-run broadcaster in its main Saturday evening news bulletin gave details of at least 11 explosions over the previous 36 hours, mostly in the main city of Yangon. It reported some damage but no casualties.There have been no claims of responsibility."Some rioters who do not want stability of the state have been throwing and planting handmade bombs at government buildings and on public roads," the state broadcaster said.Khit Thit media reported a blast outside a police barracks in Yangon early on Sunday. Vehicles were ablaze it said, but it gave no information on any casualties.Later, it reported another blast in the city. A news portal in Shan State reported a blast outside the home of a prominent businessman.The Assistance Association for Political Prisoners advocacy group says security forces have killed at least 759 protesters since the coup. Reuters is unable to confirm the toll.The military, which ruled for almost 50 years until launching a tentative reform process a decade ago, acknowledged in mid-April the death of 248 protesters, saying they were killed after they initiated violence.Several members of the security forces have been killed in the protests, the military says.The protests and a parallel civil disobedience campaign of strikes have crippled the economy and raised the prospects of hunger for the poor, aid agencies have warned.The U.N. Development Programme warned last week that the impact of the pandemic and the political crisis could see as many as 25 million people slide into poverty by 2022.The military said it had to seize power because its complaints of fraud in a November election won by Suu Kyi's party were not addressed by an election commission that deemed the vote fair.Suu Kyi, 75, has been detained since the coup along with many other members of her party.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/big-myanmar-protests-aim-to-shake-the-world-five-killed-reports-101619947478799.html
02-05-2021||World||Chinese Communist party wing mocks India’s Covid crisis on social media||A social media post by a powerful wing of the Communist Party of China (CPC) had ridiculed the Covid-19 humanitarian crisis unfolding in India, comparing the lighting of funeral pyres at an Indian crematorium with the launch of a Chinese rocket last week. The post has now been deleted.The Commission for Political and Legal Affairs (CPLA) of the CPC’s central committee published a collage of two images on its Weibo account on Saturday, showing the Chinese rocket launch and the lighting of a pyre in India, side by side.The caption to the collage reads something along the lines of - “When China sets things on fire vs. when India does it”.The Weibo post, which has been taken off, was made a day after Chinese President Xi Jinping told Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi that he was concerned about the pandemic situation in India, and had conveyed his condolences.The CPLA is a powerful organ in the CPC structure and oversees police officers, prosecutors and courts.It is currently headed by Guo Shengkun, a member of the political bureau of the CPC’s central committee – two of the top decision-making wings in China.London-based journalist and researcher Mengyu Dong, who tweeted the collage, wrote: “Someone apparently thought it was a good idea to make fun of the latest Covid-19 outbreak in India? An acct (account) affiliated with CCP Central Political and Legal Affairs Commission posted this on Weibo. Caption: When China sets things on fire vs when India does it.”China Digital Times, which tracks China’s online world, reported: “Official accounts such as the Chinese Police Online and the Tianjin Municipal People’s Procuratorate have posted a picture on several platforms mocking India’s fight against the epidemic: ‘China’s Fire Shine Mountain, India’s Fire Shine Mountain.’” Responding to a question from HT on the issue – which many Chinese citizens called “insensitive” – the Chinese foreign ministry said the post could not be found on Weibo.“Regarding the relevant picture mentioned in your question, we currently cannot find it on the relevant Weibo account. It is hoped that the Indian side will pay attention to the Chinese government and mainstream public opinion supporting India’s stance in fighting the epidemic,” the Chinese foreign ministry told HT in a statement.“What we want to emphasise is that China has been paying close attention to the development of the epidemic situation in India… China is doing its utmost to support India in fighting the new round of the epidemic,” the ministry said.“In the next few days, more anti-epidemic resources will continue to be sent to India to support India’s anti-epidemic efforts. Many donations and purchases in this area are carried out through unofficial channels. This is enough to show that the Chinese government and all sectors of society are expressing their support for India’s fight against the epidemic with practical actions.”Chinese official media, too, has a history of mocking Indians during times of bilateral tension.During the Doklam standoff near the Sikkim border in 2017, news agency Xinhua had released a video with racist overtones that had mocked and parodied Indians.The video in English ran a little more than three minutes and was titled “7 Sins of India: It’s time for India to confess its seven sins”.It featured a man with a turban and a fake beard - an apparent attempt at mocking at an Indian Sikh person - speaking in English in the way in which Indians are perceived to speak the language.Last Thursday, China sent to space a key module for its permanent space station, which it plans to complete by 2022 as part of its ambitious space programme.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinese-communist-party-wing-mocks-india-s-covid-crisis-on-social-media-101619947677206.html
02-05-2021||World||ISS astronauts splash down off Florida on SpaceX craft||A SpaceX Crew Dragon capsule carrying four astronauts back to Earth splashed down off Florida early Sunday, a NASA livestream showed.The crew reported they were feeling well after their arrival back on Earth following a nearly six-month mission aboard the International Space Station, NASA said.The capsule splashed down at 2:56 am (0656 GMT) in the dark in the Gulf of Mexico off Panama City after a six-and-a-half hour flight from the ISS, night-vision images relayed by NASA's WB-57 high-altitude research aircraft showed.Teams aboard the Go Navigator recovery ship retrieved the capsule and hoisted it on to the deck about half an hour later. It was the first nighttime splashdown for NASA since the crew of Apollo 8 arrived in the Pacific Ocean on December 27, 1968.Commander Michael Hopkins was the first to emerge after the hatch was opened, doing a little jig as he set foot on deck, followed shortly after by fellow NASA astronaut Victor Glover."On behalf of Crew-1 and our families, we just want to say thank you ... It's amazing what can be accomplished when people come together. Y'all are changing the world. Congratulations. It's great to be back," Hopkins said in a NASA tweet.NASA astronaut Shannon Walker and Japan's Soichi Noguchi were the other two aboard.The four went to space last November as the crew on the first fully operational mission to the ISS aboard a vehicle made by Elon Musk's SpaceX, which has become NASA's favored commercial transportation partner.The four crew will now be taken out of the spacecraft and receive medical checks before being flown by helicopter to Pensacola to board a plane for Houston to be reunited with their friends and family, NASA said.Seven astronauts remained on the ISS including a new crew of four who arrived on a different SpaceX craft last week."Thanks for your hospitality," Hopkins said earlier as the capsule undocked from the space station for its return journey. "We'll see you back on Earth."Prior to that, two American astronauts made a test mission to the ISS in May and stayed for two months.That was the first launch to the ISS from US soil since the end of the Space Shuttle program in 2011. It was also the first crewed mission run by a private company, as opposed to NASA.Until then US astronauts had caught rides to the ISS aboard Russian spacecraft.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/iss-astronauts-splash-down-off-florida-on-spacex-craft-101619945054779.html

They have said that supporting the TRIPs waiver would help everyone and the current flexibilities in TRIPs are ill-suited to a global crisis.On Saturday, 108 members of the House of Representatives sent a letter to President Biden saying unless countries co-operate and share medical technology, there will not be a sufficient supply of vaccines, diagnostics and treatments. The letter has been signed by Pramila Jayapal, Raja Krishnamoorthi, Ro Khanna, Karen Bass, Brad Sherman and others.A targeted, time-limited waiver would help to flatten the curve and also help restore America's leadership in public health on the global stage.Meanwhile, India and South Africa are preparing for a fresh push at the WTO for the waiver, people familiar with developments said on condition of anonymity on Saturday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/democrat-senators-write-to-biden-supporting-india-s-trips-waiver-proposal-101619931010503.html

Tribe spokeswoman Bobbi Webster said “individuals” had been shot, but she didn't have information on how many or their conditions.Attorney General Josh Kaul tweeted shortly before 10 p.m. that the scene “is contained. There is no longer a threat to the community.” He gave no other details and an agency spokeswoman didn't immediately respond to a message.Green Bay police and the Brown County Sheriff's Office told The Associated Press they had no details on the casino incident.Jawad Yatim, a witness, said at least two people were shot.“I know for sure two, because it happened right next to us, literally right next to us,” Yatim said. “But he was shooting pretty aggressively in the building, so I wouldn't doubt him hitting other people.”Yatim said the shooting began in a casino restaurant.“We got the hell out of there, thank God we're OK, but obviously we wish the best for everybody who's been shot,” he said.Webster said the casino is connected to a large hotel and conference center, the Radisson, also owned by the Oneida Nation.Gambler Max Westphal said he was standing outside after being evacuated for what he thought was a minor issue.“All of a sudden we hear a massive flurry of gunshots — 20 to 30 gunshots for sure,” Westphal told WBAY-TV. “We took off running towards the highway ... There had to have been 50 cop cars that came by on the highway. It was honestly insane.”Gov. Tony Evers issued a statement late Saturday saying he was “devastated” to hear about the shooting, but gave no details.“While we are waiting for more information, we hope and pray those who were injured will recover and are grateful for the first responders who quickly responded to the situation.”The Oneida tribe’s reservation lies on the west side of the Green Bay area.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/shooting-at-wisconsin-casino-witness-says-at-least-2-hit-101619929960725.html
02-05-2021||World||Kabul on high alert as US extends deadline for removing troops from Afghanistan||Kabul security was ramped up on Saturday as the city braced for reaction from the insurgent Taliban as US troops still present under President Joe Biden's orders, beyond the May 1 withdrawal deadline agreed in 2020 with the Trump administration.An increased military presence and security at checkpoints were visible in the Afghan capital, and a security source said the city had been placed on "high alert". Military patrols and security were being increased in main cities around the country, the source said.Under the Trump administration's February 2020 deal with the Taliban, foreign forces were to withdraw from the country by May 1 while the Taliban held off on attacking foreign troops and bases. But President Biden announced last month after reviewing the situation that forces would stay in the country for months beyond May, withdrawing by Sept. 11.Violence against Afghans has escalated starkly in recent weeks, with more than a hundred Afghan security force personnel killed. On the eve of the previously agreed withdrawal deadline, a huge blast in eastern Logar killed dozens as they broke their fast during the holy Islamic month of Ramadan. It was not clear who was behind the attack.The Taliban responded to the Biden administration's move with fiery rhetoric and threatened consequences, boycotting a crucial conference in Turkey scheduled for last month that had been planned to help jumpstart stalling Afghan peace talks in Doha.Since then contacts have been maintained, official and Taliban sources say, in an effort to try to get the Taliban back to negotiating table and agree to the extended foreign troop presence.As of Saturday it was unclear whether concrete progress had been made and there had been no announcement on an extension.THREATS SERIOUSTaliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid said on Twitter on Saturday that the passing deadline meant "this violation in principle has opened the way for (Taliban fighters) to take every counter-action it deems appropriate against the occupying forces."But he added that fighters were waiting on the decision of Taliban leadership.Earlier in the week Mujahid told Reuters conversations were continuing."Discussions between the US and Taliban and ... within the Taliban's leadership are under way whether to extend that or not," he said.Washington has also warned that if foreign forces were attacked while carrying out the withdrawal they would defend themselves "with all the tools at our disposal".Experts said the Taliban threats should be taken seriously, but a number of factors meant that full-scale attacks against foreign targets could be averted, as the Taliban continued negotiations."We can't rule out attacks," said Michael Kugelman, deputy director of the Asia Programme at the Woodrow Wilson Center in Washington. "That said, the Taliban is less likely to attack foreign forces now that it knows there is a specific date when they will be leaving."NEGOTIATIONS ONGOINGIn the lead up to May, sources said there was a flurry of meetings negotiations continued with the Taliban to try to get them to agree to a deadline extension.The U.S. special envoy for Afghanistan, Zalmay Khalilzad, had met with the Taliban's head of political office, Mullah Baradar, in Doha, a Taliban spokesman said on Friday.Also on Friday, the eve of the May 1 deadline, envoys from Russia, China, Pakistan and the United States held meetings with Taliban officials and Afghan government negotiators in the Qatari capital. The Taliban said they discussed the peace process and their request that Taliban leaders be removed from sanctions lists.Sources also said that a delegation of Taliban political leaders had been in Pakistan's capital Islamabad this week.Two Taliban sources and one official source said negotiations had revolved around the proposed deadline extension in exchange for the United States not getting involved in Afghan military operations against the Taliban; getting the Taliban to commit to re-joining the Turkey conference if they were provided with an agenda on what would be discussed there; and possibly declaring a ceasefire over the upcoming Eid holiday.Pakistan's foreign office did not immediately respond to request for comment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/kabul-on-high-alert-as-us-extends-deadline-for-removing-troops-from-afghanistan-101619925087050.html
02-05-2021||World||North Korea says Biden policy shows US intent on being hostile, vows response||Recent comments from US President Joe Biden and members of his administration show he is intent on maintaining a hostile policy toward North Korea that will require a corresponding response from Pyongyang, North Korean officials said on Sunday.The officials' comments came in a series of statements carried on state news agency KCNA, after the White House on Friday said US officials had completed a months-long review of North Korean policy.In one statement, a Foreign Ministry spokesman accused Washington of insulting the dignity of the country's supreme leadership by criticizing North Korea's human rights situation.The human rights criticism is a provocation that shows the United States is "girding itself up for an all-out showdown" with North Korea, and will be answered accordingly, the unnamed spokesman said.In a separate statement, Kwon Jong Gun, director general of the Department of U.S. Affairs of the Foreign Ministry, cited Biden's first policy speech to Congress on Wednesday, where the new president said nuclear programs in North Korea and Iran posed threats that would be addressed through "diplomacy and stern deterrence."Kwon said it is illogical and an encroachment upon North Korea's right to self-defence for the United States to call its defensive deterrence a threat.Biden's speech was "intolerable" and "a big blunder," Kwon said."His statement clearly reflects his intent to keep enforcing the hostile policy toward the DPRK as it had been done by the U.S. for over half a century," he said, using the initials for North Korea's official name.'NEGATIVE RESPONSES'The North Korean statements appear to echo comments by the ministry in March saying relations with the United States would be shaped by the "principle of power for power and goodwill for goodwill," said Jenny Town, director of the U.S.-based 38 North program, which tracks North Korea."So for the U.S. to keep emphasizing the threat, it keeps focus on the negative aspects of the relationship and will elicit negative responses," she said.Town noted that while one statement alluded to the policy review, the North Korean commentary seemed more focused on the Biden administration's talk of threats.Talks aimed at persuading Pyongyang to surrender its nuclear weapons program have been stalled since a series of summits between Biden's predecessor, President Donald Trump, and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un failed to result in a deal.Under the policy review announced on Friday, Biden has settled on a new approach to pressuring North Korea that will explore using diplomacy to break the stalemate but not seek a grand bargain with Kim, the White House said.The White House and State Department did not immediately comment on the latest North Korean statements.In Sunday's statement, Kwon said U.S. talk of diplomacy is aimed at covering up its hostile acts, and its deterrence is just a means for posing nuclear threats to North Korea.Now that Biden's policy has become clear, North Korea "will be compelled to press for corresponding measures, and with time the U.S. will find itself in a very grave situation," he concluded.In a third statement, Kim Yo Jong, a senior official in the government and sister of leader Kim Jong Un, sharply criticized South Korea for failing to stop defector activists from launching anti-North Korea leaflets.An activist group in South Korea said on Friday it had released balloons into North Korea carrying dollar bills and leaflets denouncing the government in Pyongyang, defying a recently imposed law banning such releases after complaints by the North."We regard the manoeuvres committed by the human wastes in the south as a serious provocation against our state and will look into corresponding action," Kim Yo Jong said.Last year, North Korea blew up an inter-Korean liaison office in Kaesong, North Korea, after Kim Yo Jong led a campaign of criticism over the leaflet launches.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/north-korea-says-biden-policy-shows-us-intent-on-being-hostile-vows-response-101619917243549.html
02-05-2021||World||SpaceX capsule departs International Space Station with 4 astronauts, heads home||A SpaceX capsule carrying four astronauts departed the International Space Station late Saturday, aiming for a rare nighttime splashdown to end the company’s second crew flight.It would be the first US splashdown in darkness since Apollo 8′s crew returned from the moon in 1968.The National Aeronautics and Space Administration's (NASA) Mike Hopkins, Victor Glover and Shannon Walker, and Japan’s Soichi Noguchi, headed home in the same Dragon capsule that delivered them to the space station last November. The ride back was expected to take just 6 1/2 hours.“Thanks for your hospitality,” Hopkins radioed as the capsule undocked 260 miles (420 kilometers) above Mali.SpaceX targeted a splashdown around 3 am Sunday in the Gulf of Mexico off the coast of Panama City, Florida. Despite the early hour, the Coast Guard deployed extra patrols — and spotlights — to keep any night-owl sightseers away. The capsule of the first SpaceX crew was surrounded by pleasure boaters last summer, posing a safety risk.Hopkins, the spacecraft commander, rocketed into orbit with his crew on Nov. 15 from NASA’s Kennedy Space Center. Their replacements arrived a week ago aboard their own Dragon capsule — the same one that launched SpaceX’s first crew last spring.The four should have been back by now, but high offshore wind kept them at the space station a few extra days. SpaceX and NASA determined the best weather would be before dawn.The delays allowed Glover to celebrate his 45th birthday in space Friday.“Gratitude, wonder, connection. I’m full of and motivated by these feelings on my birthday, as my first mission to space comes to an end,” Glover tweeted.Saturday night’s undocking left seven astronauts at the space station: three Americans, two Russians, one Japanese and one French.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/spacex-capsule-departs-international-space-station-with-4-astronauts-heads-home-101619916929281.html
02-05-2021||World||US formally begins withdrawing troops from Afghanistan after 20 years||Kabul security was ramped up on Saturday as the city braced for reaction from the Taliban with the final phase of ending America’s “forever war” in Afghanistan after 20 years formally began on Saturday: the withdrawal of the last US and Nato troops by the end of summer.US officials on the ground say the withdrawal is already a work in progress - and May 1 is just a continuation - but Washington has made an issue of the date because it is a deadline agreed with the Taliban in 2020 to complete the pullout. The skies above Kabul and nearby Bagram airbase were buzzing with more US helicopter activity than usual as the pullout gears up, following the start on Thursday of a concurrent Nato withdrawal.Afghan security forces were on high alert for any possible Taliban attacks on retreating American troops. The US military said an airfield in the southern province of Kandahar where it has a base “received ineffective indirect fire” on Saturday afternoon that caused no damages.“The Americans will formally begin their withdrawal from Afghanistan starting May 1 and the Taliban might increase the violence,” acting interior minister Hayatullah Hayat told top police commanders, according to an audio clip given to reporters.Afghan acting defence minister Zia Yasin said US and allied troops will be leaving their bases and will gather at Bagram, the biggest American base in Afghanistan. From there “they will go to their respective countries”, Yasin told reporters.The prospect of an end to the US presence after 20 years comes despite fighting raging across the countryside in the absence of a peace deal. A stark reminder of what remains came late on Friday with a car bomb in Pul-e-Alam, south of the capital, killing at least 24 people and wounding 110 more.US President Joe Biden is determined to end what he called “the forever war”, announcing last month that the withdrawal of the remaining 2,500 American forces would be complete by the 20th anniversary of the September 11 attacks.“A horrific attack 20 years ago... cannot explain why we should remain there in 2021,” he said.The Taliban said the US troop withdrawal was to be completed by May 1 as agreed in last year’s accord with Washington, and warned it was a “clear violation” that the troops were not fully out. Since the US withdrawal deal was struck the Taliban have not directly engaged foreign troops, but have mercilessly attacked government forces in the countryside and waged a terror campaign in urban areas.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-formally-begins-withdrawing-troops-from-afghanistan-after-20-years-101619904125426.html

The fresh proposal is expected to be presented to the WTO sometime in the next two weeks, they added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/108-us-congress-members-urge-biden-to-support-india-s-africa-on-trips-waiver-101619890854518.html

In the order, released late on Sunday night, the bench of Justices DY Chandrachud, L Nageswara Rao and Ravindra Bharat ordered the Centre to create a buffer stock of oxygen along with all states from where oxygen can be used if the regular supply chain is disrupted due to any reason.The order was reserved on April 30, when the apex court raised several questions regarding the Centre's handling of the Covid-19 pandemic."We direct the Central Government in collaboration with the states to prepare a buffer stock of oxygen to be used for emergency purposes to ensure supply lines continue to function even in unforeseen circumstances. The location of the emergency stocks shall be decentralised so as to be immediately available if the normal supply chain is disrupted to any hospital for any reason. The emergency stocks shall be created within the next four days. The replenishment of the emergency stocks will also be monitored on a real-time basis through the virtual control room in active consultation with each state/UT," notes the Supreme Court order.During the hearing on April 30, the Supreme Court also asked the Centre whether there is any national policy on hospital admission. In its order issued on Sunday, the Apex Court asked the Centre to formulate a national policy on hospital admission, which has to be followed by state governments."Till the formulation of such a policy by the Central Government, no patient shall be denied hospitalization or essential drugs in any State/UT for lack of local residential proof of that State/UT or even in the absence of identity proof," reads the order.On Saturday, around 12 people, including a doctor, died at a private hospital in Delhi after the hospital ran out of oxygen. With the number of Covid-19 infections rising, the demand for oxygen has sharply gone up. But the situation in the Capital is particularly more precarious.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/supreme-court-gives-two-days-to-centre-to-rectify-delhi-oxygen-issue-101619975765181.html
02-05-2021||India||Assembly poll results vindicate stand of agitating farmers: Samyukta Kisan Morcha||Elated by the trends in assembly election results which showed BJP set to lose in West Bengal, Kerala and Tamil Nadu, the Samyukta Kisan Morcha (SKM), an umbrella body of agitating farmer unions, on Sunday said their campaign asking voters to "punish" the party stands vindicated.SKM members, who were seen distributing sweets to protestors camping at the Singhu Border, congratulated the people of West Bengal and other states for paying heed to their appeal. Farmers protesting the three central farm laws had campaigned against the BJP in Assam, West Bengal, Puducherry, Tamil Nadu and Kerala."Our campaign with state assembly voters asking them to punish BJP stands vindicated. BJP's efforts not to make citizens' livelihoods issues, such as the anti-farmer central agri laws and the anti-worker labour codes, as poll plank has clearly failed."We now appeal to farmers from all over India to strengthen their resistance and join the movement in greater numbers. This movement will continue to spread the democratic values that our Constitution espouses and will further strengthen itself till our demands are fulfilled," read a statement from the SKM.Thousands of farmers, mostly from Punjab, Haryana and western Uttar Pradesh, have been camping at three Delhi border points -- Singhu, Tikri and Ghazipur -- for over four months, demanding a repeal of the three agri reform laws enacted by the Centre in September last year.Clarifying that the ongoing farmers' agitation won't end until their demands are met, the farmers' union said it is time that the BJP listens to people's mandate in different states, which includes the sentiment of farmers, and immediately repeal the three agricultural laws and give legal guarantee to procurement at minimum support price."The government, instead of making peasants and workers their enemies, should fight against the corona pandemic and the livelihood and economic crises in the country," it added.The Centre says the new farm laws will free farmers from middlemen, giving them more options to sell their crops.The protesting farmers, however, say the laws would pave the way for eliminating the safety cushion of MSP and do away with the "mandi" (wholesale market) system, leaving them at the mercy of big corporates.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/assembly-poll-results-vindicate-stand-of-agitating-farmers-samyukta-kisan-morcha-101619974912112.html

02-05-2021||India||In Assam, CAA failed to hurt BJP, Cong did not benefit by opposing it||When anti-Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) protests rocked Assam in December 2019 and five people were killed in police firing, it appeared the issue could damage the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led coalition’s hopes of retaining power in the state. The results of the assembly elections on Sunday belied the dent the issue was expected to cause to the party’s base in the state. The BJP is set to form the government for the second consecutive time in Assam. It had won two seats till 6:30 pm and was leading in 54 out of the total 126 seats. Its allies, Asom Gana Parishad, and United People’s Party, Liberal, were ahead on 11 and eight seats. Assam Jatiya Parishad (AJP) and Raijor Dal, the two parties formed as an outcome of the anti-CAA protests, managed to win only one seat.The Congress took a strong anti-CAA stance and promised it will not implement the legislation in Assam if it came to power. It was part of the party’s five guarantees to the voters. The Congress was leading on 28 seats and its ally All India United Democratic Front on 14 and Bodoland People’s Front in 2.The BJP appeared to be in a dilemma regarding the CAA and the National Register of Citizens (NRC) in Assam and West Bengal, where the Trinamool Congress (TMC) is set to sweep back to power. It said the CAA cannot be changed through state legislation and did not commit to its implementation in Assam. In Bengal, the BJP said it will implement the CAA if it comes to power there. The implementation of the CAA in Assam would mean automatic citizenship for non-Muslims from Bangladesh, who came after the 1971 war, without going through the tedious NRC process.In 2019, the Parliament passed the legislation providing automatic citizenship for non-Muslims from Bangladesh, Pakistan, and Afghanistan, who came to India before December 31, 2014. The Assam Accord provides citizenship to migrants after March 25, 1971, as the cut-off date. The difference in the time frame triggered apprehension about a fresh influx of undocumented Bangladeshis into Assam. The Centre is yet to notify the rules to implement the amended law. In March, a Parliamentary committee gave the home ministry another six months to notify the rules.The updated NRC in Assam was released in August 2019 and excluded 1.9 of the nearly 33 million people, who applied to be included in it. The BJP has rejected the list calling it faulty. It has maintained many genuine citizens got left out while illegal foreigners got included. In its manifesto for this election, BJP committed to preparing a corrected NRC to protect genuine citizens and detect undocumented infiltrators to protect Assam’s civilisation.BJP leader Pabitra Margherita said the CAA did not have any impact on the polls. “Our party’s stand on the issue has always been clear that we support the legislation. On the other hand, the Congress, AJP, and Raijor Dal tried to mislead the public by giving the impression that 19 million people from Bangladesh would swarm into Assam if CAA was implemented. The voters did not fall for that lie.”Congress leader Bobbeeta Sharma insisted the CAA definitely was an issue. “We believe those who are concerned about Assam still oppose it tooth and nail. In this election, there were three parties that had an anti-CAA stance. We need to get the detailed results to see if the AJP or Raijor Dal took away a portion of the anti-CAA votes.”Click here for complete coverage of Assam assembly electionKaustabh Deka, a professor of political science at the Dibrugarh University, said the BJP has been able to successfully stop the resentment against the CAA. “The party kept the debates during election campaign outside the CAA ambit.”Akhil Ranjan Dutta, who teaches political science at the Gauhati University, said Covid-19 became the oxygen for the BJP as it was gasping for breath around the end of 2019 because of the protests against CAA and resentment against the governments in the state and Centre.Deka said the lockdown imposed because of Covid19 was able to break down the momentum of CAA protests and it benefitted the BJP.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-assam-caa-failed-to-hurt-bjp-cong-did-not-benefit-by-opposing-it-101619959557699.html

West Bengal was not the only project that Prashant's team was working on this time. He was the political strategist for DMK's MK Stalin, who too witnessed a big win."I have had enough. I have been doing this for 8-9 years. It's a tough job. I want to do something else in life. I don't have to do this all my life and I have been saying this in every conversation I am having with people," he said."Beyond this, there are very able people in I-PAC who run the show and I get credit for their work. It is now time for them to take over," Prashant said.On joining politics, he said, "I am just saying that I don't want to do what I am doing right now. It is time for my colleagues in I-PAC to take over". On not ruling out politics, he said, "I am not ruling in or out anything."He also said this "announcement" won't be a shocker for his colleagues at IPAC as they have spent enough time with him to know what he wants to do in life.For all the hype AMPLIFIED by a section of supportive media, in reality BJP will struggle to CROSS DOUBLE DIGITS in #WestBengal PS: Please save this tweet and if BJP does any better I must quit this space!Soon after his announcement, an old tweet of Prashant went viral. In December 2020, he had said that if BJP performs any better in West Bengal than his prediction, then he will quit. And what was his prediction? BJP will struggle to cross double digits, the poll strategist had said.In 2013, Prashant Kishor formed Citizens or Accountable Governance (CAG), as part of his campaign for Narendra Modi for the 2014 Lok Sabha elections. Before that, he worked as Modi's strategist in Gujarat in 2011. After Modi's win in 2014, Prashant Kishor worked as a strategist for the Congress, JD (U), AAP, Shiv Sena, Trinamool and DMK. And CAG became I-PAC, Indian Political Action Committee.In 2018, Prashant Kumar joined JD(U) but had a fallout with Nitish Kumar over the Citizenship Amendment Act. In 2020, he was expelled from the party.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/prashant-kishor-wants-to-quit-poll-strategising-says-have-had-enough-101619952642419.html

It is submitted that while prioritising vaccination the first priority was towards health workers.“It is submitted that projected mid-year population for 2021 for the age group of 18 to 45 years is about 59 crore. To vaccinate this target, a total of 122 crore doses of Covid-19 vaccine would be required (which factors in some vaccine wastage which is inevitable),” the Centre said.Stating that the central government has already taken proactive steps for procurement of other vaccines apart from Covishield and Covaxin, the Centre told the apex court that it has fast tracked the emergency approvals for foreign produced Covid-19 Vaccines that have been granted approval in other countries.The government told the court that it has already granted license to Sputnik V vaccine for restricted use in emergency situation (emergency use authorization granted by European Union Agency) based on data from studies/clinical trials in Russia and other countries coupled with data from Phase II/III trials conducted in India by Dr. Reddy's Laboratories.“It is submitted that as per estimates the availability of locally manufactured Sputnik V vaccine will start from July onwards. It is expected that locally manufactured Sputnik V vaccine will be available to the extent of 8 million and 16 million doses (for 4 million and 8 million individuals) for the months of July and August 2021 respectively.“It is further submitted that the Union of India has been in constant touch with Pfizer, Moderna and J&J since mid- 2020 with the objective of encouraging these companies to develop/ supply/manufacture their respective vaccine through their local partners in India,” the Centre said.The top court on April 22 took note of the pandemic situation due to sudden surge in Covid-19 cases and said it expected the Centre to come out with a “national plan” to deal with the distribution of essential services and supplies, including oxygen and drugs.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/122-crore-covid-19-vaccine-doses-needed-to-inoculate-59-crore-people-in-18-45-age-group-centre-tells-sc-101619946809366.html

Their impact,in combination with strong easterly winds, is likely to cause isolated thunderstorms over the region.Rain or thundershowers occurred at some places over northwest India except east Uttar Pradesh where it was dry. Thunderstorms also occurred at isolated places over Jammu and Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan on Saturday and Sunday. Hailstorm occurred at isolated places over Uttarakhand (Mussoorie) and dust storms occurred at some places over west Rajasthan.“We are not expecting heat wave or very high temperatures over northwest India during the next 4-5 days. This is because of strong easterly winds which will cause isolated thunderstorm activity and the sky will remain overcast in many areas. Intense thunderstorm activity is expected in east, northeast and peninsular India during the next few days,” explained RK Jenamani, senior scientist, national weather forecasting centre.A cyclonic circulation is lying over northwest Madhya Pradesh and neighbourhood and a trough (line of low pressure) is running from the circulation to Manipur.

02-05-2021||India||Taiwan, Uzbekistan send support for India’s Covid-19 response||Taiwan on Sunday delivered a support package, including 150 oxygen concentrators, for India’s response to a devastating second wave of Coronavirus infections and said it would provide more aid soon. The aid reflects the growing engagement between India and Taiwan, especially against the backdrop of the standoff with China on the Line of Actual Control (LAC) and China’s aggressive actions across the region, including repeated violations of Taiwan’s airspace. The Taipei Economic and Cultural Center (TECC), Taiwan’s representative office in New Delhi, said in a statement the critical medical supplies were delivered to “express strong friendship with India in its fight against a new wave” of the pandemic. The first batch includes 150 oxygen concentrators and 500 oxygen cylinders, and more batches of medical equipment will be airlifted to India soon, TECC said. Also Read | In touch with foreign embassies, responding to their medical demands: MEA“While the contribution is modest, we hope that it will bring comfort and relief to the patients in need and ease the burden on the healthcare workers who are working tirelessly to fight the pandemic,” the statement said. “Taiwan is committed to providing necessary assistance to the people of India in time of need,” it added. TECC reaffirmed the friendly bilateral relations between Taiwan and India, and said: “Taiwan’s deployment of medical supplies is testament to the close collaboration and partnership across multiple agencies on both sides. It also reflects the robust relief efforts and contributions made by the government and people of Taiwan to bring humanitarian relief to India.” On April 27, Taiwan’s President Tsai Ing-wen had conveyed her solidarity with India and expressed concern about the situation in the country as it logged record-breaking daily surges of infection for consecutive days. “On behalf of all #Taiwanese people, I would like to express my serious concern over the rapid spread of COVID-19 in #India. Taiwan stands with India in this difficult time, & we are ready to provide help,” she tweeted. Several other smaller countries have pitched in to support India’s fight against the second wave of infections, which last week crossed the 400,000-mark for the first time. Some have said they were responding to the assistance provided by New Delhi last year. Uzbekistan, which benefited from India’s assistance during the first wave of the pandemic last year and received 660,000 doses of Indian-made Covid-19 vaccine in March, delivered a support package comprising 100 oxygen concentrators, doses of the antiviral drug Remdesivir and other medicines early on Sunday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/taiwan-uzbekistan-send-support-for-india-s-covid-19-response-101619945937995.html
02-05-2021||India||Losing parents to Covid, many children stare at uncertain future||A 14-year-old boy was left alone at home for hours with the bodies of his parents as they succumbed to Covid-19 this month in north Delhi before he could gather himself and rush to a relative’s house to inform them about the deaths. “He could barely talk...he was silent for a minute... He kept calling his parents,” said a member of the non-governmental organisation (NGO) working for such children.The boy’s mother, who was in her late 30s first developed Covid-19 symptoms, before he and his 41-year-old father contracted the disease. A doctor prescribed some drugs and the family managed to get an oxygen cylinder, but the couple succumbed to the disease at home.Like the boy’s parents, a significant proportion of people, who have died as the second Covid-19 wave has overwhelmed India’s health system, are in their 30s and 40s. In many cases, children of people in this age group have lost both parents.Delhi Commission for Protection of Child Rights (DCPCR ) chairperson Anurag Kundu said they have received many SOSs about children left alone as their parents were hospitalised or have lost whole of their immediate families. “At times, there is no one to even offer them food,” said Kundu.Also Read | In touch with foreign embassies, responding to their medical demands: MEAA DCPCR volunteer, who did not wish to be named, said the NGO put them into touch with the family taking care of the 14-year-old boy. “We helped them connect with various child welfare committees to find this boy a better home. The family was very cooperative and had even taken him twice to a child psychologist for counselling. A woman in that family has been taking care of all his nutrition and medicines since he is still Covid-19 positive.”The family has refused any institutional support and initially set up a fundraiser to pay for the debt the boy’s parents incurred for their medical expenses. “Over ₹two lakh was raised in a day and all the debts of his parents were cleared...” the volunteer said. He added some of the boy’s close relatives live abroad. “...they [the family he is living with] have even started the legal proceedings to adopt him.”Kundu said in many other cases, one parent of children is hospitalised while the other has passed away. He added in most cases, relatives have come forward and taken care of such children. Kundu said at least in two cases, children were left to fend for themselves. “We have shifted them to a shelter home in Delhi until we find some accepting family to take care of them and contribute to making their life better.”Kundu said people are always willing to accept such children. “Even our preference for a child is a domestic setup rather than any institutional care but there is a legal process for adoption.” He added they need to undertake thorough background checks of families, who come forward to adopt such children.Sonal Kapoor Singh, the founder of an NGO working for children at risk or having experienced traumatic events, said the last few months have been disastrous. “We have been working to help children in 40 slums for 10 years to help them recuperate from various traumas. The last few months have been very disturbing. Excluding children, who have lost both parents to Covid, there are cases where the condition of children is worse than those orphaned by the pandemic.”Singh said they have received complaints about children being deserted by their fathers after their mothers died of Covid-19. “In many cases, young girls have been forced to do hard labour for lesser wages as both their parents have died of Covid-19.” Singh added there are also cases of girls in these slums, who were sexually assaulted by their fathers rendered jobless by Covid-19, as they are home throughout the day while mothers are out busy working.Also Read | Covid-19: Israel bans travel to India, 6 other countriesBachpan Bachao Andolan, a child rights organisation run by Nobel laureate Kailash Satyarthi, said they have received over 200 SOS calls from across India in just two days about children losing the whole of their immediate families. “There are calls from Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Delhi and many other states where there is no one to take the care of these children. For now, we are trying to send teams with food...” said Paroma Bhattacharya, a representative of the organisation. “In many cases, we are helping the government in shifting these children to shelter homes for now.”Joshita Nag, a social worker from Kolkata, said she has come across many WhatsApp forwards requesting people to take custody of children whose parents have died. “It is not just illegal but horrible for the existence of these children.” She added it could lead to trafficking in the name of help. “Some people are doing a greater damage,” Nag said. She appealed to people to immediately contact child rights protection panels in such cases.An 18-year-old, who identified himself with his second name Upadhyay, said they face a double whammy after losing their father for the want of medical care outside a Delhi hospital. “My mother got better with that injection [remdesivir]. Father died as he developed pneumonia.” He said his father was a businessman. “We had a small manufacturing plant... after taking a loan. Soon after the first wave of Covid-19 began, our business failed. Even our labourers left, and we could not pay the loan instalments to the bank. The bank officials since then have been harassing us and now after my father has passed away, I do not know what is going to happen. They apparently might take away our house. It is distressing, the virus first snatched our father and now might even make us homeless.”In a tweet, Union women and child development minister Smriti Irani on Saturday said the government has been reaching out to the states and sought the protection of the children who lost parents to Covid-19. She added the ministry appealed to states to enable Child Welfare Committees to actively monitor the well-being of these children.HT reached out to the officials of the ministry for fresh comments over the issue but there was no response despite repeated calls.Bhavna Barmi, a child psychologist at Delhi’s Fortis Hospital, said it is very important that while taking custody of such children, the caretakers do not allow their minds to recount what has happened to them. “The first thing is that no one should offer condolences to such children as doing so recreates the whole scenario of grief in the child and expose him or her to trauma again,” said Barmi. “We should rather try to extend our nurturance to them by normalising their daily routine as it was earlier and try to make their emotions more relevant as they were with their parents.” Barmi said once the trauma slowly fades away, a sense of optimism should be imparted in them by allowing them to do healthy activities that they show interest in. “This shall allow them to happily pursue their goals in life ahead.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/losing-parents-to-covid-many-children-stare-at-uncertain-future-101619942516937.html
02-05-2021||India||In touch with foreign embassies, responding to their medical demands: MEA||The Ministry of External Affairs on Sunday said it is in continuous touch with all foreign embassies in India and responding to their medical demands, especially those related to Covid-19.MEA Spokesperson Arindam Bagchi said the response to medical demands of the embassies included facilitating treatment in hospital even as he urged all not to hoard essential supplies including oxygen.Earlier, External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar hit out at Congress leader Jairam Ramesh after he said on Twitter that the youth wing of the Congress was attending to SOS calls from foreign embassies and wondered whether the MEA was "sleeping".Ramesh also shared a video posted on Twitter by Indian Youth Congress national president Srinivas B V that showed a mini pickup van entering the embassy of the Philippines in Delhi, carrying oxygen cylinders."MEA checked with the Philippines Embassy. This was an unsolicited supply as they had no Covid cases. Clearly for cheap publicity by you know who. Giving away cylinders like this when there are people in desperate need of oxygen is simply appalling," Jaishankar tweeted."Jairamji, MEA never sleeps; our people know across the world. MEA also never fakes; we know who does," he said in another tweet.Srinivas tweeted the video with a caption "#SOSIYC members at Embassy of the Philippines in New Delhi."In his comments, Ramesh complimented the Indian Youth Congress."While I thank @IYC for its stellar efforts, as an Indian citizen I'm stunned that the youth wing of the opposition party is attending to SOS calls from foreign embassies. Is the MEA sleeping @DrSJaishankar?," he tweeted.In his statement, Bagchi said the MEA is responding to the medical demands by the foreign missions."The chief of protocol and heads of divisions are in continuous touch with all high commissions/embassies and MEA is responding to their medical demands, especially those related to Covid. This includes facilitating their hospital treatment," he said."Given the pandemic situation, all are urged not to hoard essential supplies, including oxygen," Bagchi said, responding to media queries.Hospitals across the national capital are reeling under a severe shortage of medical oxygen due to the massive surge in Covid-19 cases.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-touch-with-foreign-embassies-responding-to-their-medical-demands-mea-101619941482911.html

The incident comes at a time when the Covid-19 vaccination drive is struggling to pick up pace due to a shortage in supply of vaccines.The driver of the truck had gone missing but the vaccine was found to be safe inside the refrigerator, found to be in working condition, said Vipul Shrivastava, superintendent of police (SP), Narsinghpur.“The truck with Tamil Nadu registration number was going to Karnal in Haryana from Hyderabad. A few people on Friday informed us that a truck was left abandoned in the Kareli area of the district. Police reached the spot and checked the papers to find bills worth ₹8 crore of Covaxin,” said the police officer.Shrivastava said the truck was owned by a transport company in Gurgaon, which when contacted said the driver, Vikas Mishra, was not reachable for the past 12 hours. Cyber police tracked down the driver’s mobile number near a Dhaba in Narsinghpur. “While the mobile phone was found in nearby bushes, the driver was nowhere to be found,” he added.Later, the transport company sent another driver to Narsinghpur to take the truck to Karnal. The truck left for its destination on Friday night while the police continued to investigate the driver’s disappearance.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/240-lakh-doses-of-covaxin-found-in-an-abandoned-truck-in-mp-101619941796935.html
02-05-2021||India||Swadeshi Jagran Manch demands regulatory clearance for local production of Sputnik||Swadeshi Jagran Manch (SJM), an offshoot of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), has urged the Centre to provide regulatory clearance for the local production of the Russian Sputnik V vaccine and impose a ceiling of prices on Covid-19 medicines and vaccines taking into account the cost of production-based formula. It cited the surge in Covid cases and called for an urgent need to have medicines and vaccines available at affordable prices.As the vaccination has been opened up for everyone over 18, the SJM has underlined the need for more production. “In the case of vaccines, the country needs nearly 195 crore of doses to cover at least 70% of the population. This cannot be fulfilled by the two companies alone. There is an urgent need to bring more manufactures to start the production. To facilitate the technology transfer, the government has to take measures to overcome the intellectual property barriers including patent and trade secrets,” said SJM’s national co-convenor, Ashwani Mahajan.Also Read | First batch of Sputnik V vaccine arrives in Hyderabad“...the local production of remdesivir and favirapvir is taking place, the available quantity is highly inadequate to meet the increasing demand due to the severity of the problem. Another important medicine to treat COVID 19 patients with a deadly ‘cytokine storm’ is tocilizumab, which is not produced in India. The import of this medicine is highly inadequate to meet the requirements.” Amid the high demand for antiviral remdesivir and the exorbitant prices being quoted, the SJM, which has been at the forefront of the campaign for indigenous production, pointed out that despite the voluntary price reduction, it still costs between ₹899 and ₹3,490 per vial. “Reports in this regard state the cost of the full course of remedsivir including reasonable profit is around USD 9 i.e. around ₹666. On the other hand, the cost of tocilizumab is ₹40,000 per vial. Under the present scenario the general public is reeling under the corporate greed, which needs to be curbed at any cost,” Mahajan said.The SJM has asked the government to use the public health safeguards in the Patents Act and permit more companies to produce these medicines.The SJM also slammed Bill Gates for his statement that vaccine formula should not be shared with India and other countries. “This is nothing but yet another manifestation of corporate greed to profit from the worst pandemic of the century. There is an urgent need to invoke measures like the ceiling of the prices of these medicines. The prices of vaccines announced by both companies for the state government procurement and private hospitals are exorbitant and affect the acceleration of vaccination in the country,” Mahajan said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/swadeshi-jagran-manch-demands-regulatory-clearance-for-local-production-of-sputnik-101619941136996.html
02-05-2021||India||France sends oxygen generator plants to back India’s Covid response||A special cargo flight from France flew in 28 tonnes of medical equipment on Sunday to back India’s Covid-19 response, including eight high capacity oxygen generator plants to be deployed in hospitals in Delhi, Haryana and Telangana. This is the first phase of the solidarity mission launched by President Emmanuel Macron to support India as part of the European Union’s coordinated response to the Covid-19 crisis.“The oxygen plants will be delivered to eight Indian hospitals, six in Delhi, one in Haryana and one in Telangana, based on needs as identified by the Indian authorities,” said a statement issued by the French embassy late on Saturday.It could not immediately be ascertained which hospitals in Delhi were getting the oxygen plants. The French support is meant not only to provide immediate medical relief from a crippling shortage of oxygen but also to boost India’s “strategic autonomy in healthcare” since each of the eight plants can supply a 250-bed hospital non-stop for a dozen years. Also Watch | ‘Covid aid to India largest package sent by France to any country’: French EnvoyThis provides enhanced resilience to peaks in oxygen demand and savings of up to ₹15 crore a year while eliminating safety issues related to liquid oxygen storage, the French embassy said. The oxygen plants, sourced from the French company Novair, produce medical oxygen from ambient air to supply a hospital’s oxygen system or fill cylinders at a rate of 20,000 litres an hour.“Mission accomplie! 1st phase of [France’s] solidarity mission landed this morning with 28 tons of ready-to-use support incl. 8 oxygen plants. More to come soon as we continue to stand together in this fight,” French ambassador Emmanuel Lenain tweeted. Besides the oxygen plants, the flight carried 28 ventilators and 200 electric syringe pumps to be distributed to several hospitals to enhance their ICU capacities. The supplies brought in on the flight were worth more than ₹17 crore. The equipment was handed over by the French side to the Indian government through the Indian Red Cross Society.People familiar with developments said on condition of anonymity that the Indian side had identified the hospitals where the oxygen plants will be installed, in line with medical requirements and priority, to ensure that they can be utilised at the earliest.“This will bring much needed relief in many key hospitals,” said one of the people cited above. The French embassy’s statement also quoted Lenain as saying: “We stand by India in these difficult times, just as India has always stood by France. In spring 2020, when French hospitals were facing acute shortages, India provided lifesaving help through the export of critical medical drugs. The French people have not forgotten.” The special cargo flight was chartered free of charge by the French shipping group CMA CGM, and many other French firms with a presence in India pooled their resources with the French government for the solidarity mission. A second delivery of oxygen generators and medical equipment from France is underway, and French company Air Liquide will begin shipping several hundred tonnes of oxygen through a dedicated logistical bridge organised by the French and Indian governments and implemented with the Indian military.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/france-sends-oxygen-generator-plants-to-back-india-s-covid-response-101619940897117.html

I wonder on what basis some people are saying that Amit Shah will now concentrate on dislodging the Maharashtra government. They will either woo ruling party legislators on basis of their money power or impose Presidential rule citing our failure to tackle the virus,” he wrote.“If Covid-19 is the reason, then we have to accept the fact that the Central government has no moral right to continue in office. At a time when there is a shortage of medicines and oxygen and more than 5,000 people are dying, how come they can think of indulging in such political play? In order to win one state [West Bengal], these people have put the entire country at risk, and this has been acknowledged by the Supreme Court. The Madras High Court has squarely blamed the Election Commission for this situation.”There was no immediate response from the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).The Trinamool Congress appeared to be heading for a third consecutive term in West Bengal even as the BJP was likely to post its best result in the state, initial trends in the counting of votes showed on Sunday morning.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/shiv-sena-taunts-bjp-saying-bengal-results-may-have-impact-on-central-govt-101619940237585.html

It was later deposited at the EVM warehouse adjacent to the office of the deputy commissioner, said Dahal.“The contesting candidates were satisfied that the EVM was a reserved EVM and no votes were polled therein. The machine was later taken to the EVM warehouse and kept under safe custody,” said Dahal.Counting of votes for Assam’s 126 assembly seats began on Sunday morning in the backdrop of exit poll predictions of a victory for the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) led alliance in the state. Only one exit poll has predicted a close contest between the BJP-led front and the Congress-led opposition alliance.The BJP is in alliance with Asom Gana Parishad (AGP) and United People’s Party Liberal (UPPL), while the Congress is leading a 10-party alliance including All India United Democratic Front (AIUDF) and Bodoland Peoples’ Party (BPF) as its major partners.On April 1, unrest was reported in nearby Karimganj district after an EVM, being carried to the strong room after polling in Ratabari seat, was found in a private vehicle owned by the wife of sitting BJP MLA from neighbouring Patharkandi seat, Krishnendu Paul.Though the EVM was found intact, EC suspended four poll officials for dereliction of duty and a re-poll was conducted at a polling station at Ratabari.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mystery-of-unused-evm-found-at-assam-counting-centre-resolved-by-ec-101619926796299.html

02-05-2021||India||Assam assembly elections 2021: Counting begins in shadow of Covid-19 crisis||Counting of votes for Assam’s 126 assembly seats, contested by 946 candidates, has begun amid a nationwide crisis triggered by the second wave of Covid-19. Most exit polls have predicted a victory for the ruling party, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) led alliance, in the state.BJP fought the elections in alliance with Asom Gana Parishad (AGP) and United People’s Party Liberal (UPPL), while the Congress-led 10-party alliance includes All India United Democratic Front (AIUDF) and Bodoland Peoples’ Party (BPF).Besides the two main fronts, another front comprising two new regional parties, Assam Jatiya Parishad and Raijor Dal, was also in the fray. Chief electoral officer Nitin Khade said the number of counting halls has been increased to 331, compared to 143 set up during 2016 polls, to ensure social distancing and other Covid-19 related standard operating procedures. 279 of these centres will handle electronic voting machines (EVM) and 52 will count postal ballots. “Strong security measures have been made to ensure smooth conduct of the Counting process. The linkage between [the] Strong Room and [the] Counting Hall will be maintained with strict security to avoid any untoward situation. There will be three tiers of security in respect of the counting venues,” Khade said in a statement. Khade added that the counting process was expected to take longer this time due to additional measures including greater number of EVMs and postal ballots used to help contain the spread of Covid-19.In 2016, there were a total of 29,173 postal votes for the entire state whereas, this time, the figure has increased by 414% to 150,033. In 2016, BJP won 60 seats to form the party’s first government in Assam with the support of AGP (14) and the BPF (12). Congress won only 26 seats and the AIUDF won 13. According to the India Today exit poll, BJP-led alliance was likely to win 75-85 seats and the front led by the Congress was likely to win 40-50 seats. News24-Chanakya predicted 70 seats to the front led by the BJP and 56 to the Congress-led alliance. The Republic-CNX poll predicted 74-84 seats for the BJP and 40-50 for the Congress, while the Times Now poll gave 72 seats to the BJP and 53 to the Congress. The ABP-CVoter poll predicted a close contest with 58-71 seats to the BJP-led alliance and 53-66 to the Congress-led front. The BJP maintains that it will win at least 85 seats, based on its own survey. The Congress has dismissed the exit polls as “biased” and “manipulated”, adding the party will form the next government in the state.In a statement issued late on Saturday evening, the Congress said it won’t send spokespersons to TV studios for debates related to election results due to the current Covid-19 crisis. However, the party said its spokespersons will be available to answer queries over phone.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/assam-assembly-elections-2021-counting-begins-in-shadow-of-covid-19-crisis-101619925176240.html

02-05-2021||India||Parliament panel meetings stalled amid Covid-19 spike||The recess between Parliament sessions is usually a hectic period for Indian parliamentary committees to hold meetings, summon witnesses or ready reports. But not this year.As the national capital and large parts of the country reel under renewed waves of Covid-19, many house committees had to cancel their meetings and no new meetings are planned.Parliament could work for only 34 days since the pandemic hit the country in March last year. The winter session had to be cancelled while three others were cut short. Now with the House panels’ work coming to a halt, Parliament’s potential and performance has been severely restricted amid the second wave of Covid-19 that so far has been the deadliest.The Labour panel, led by Bhartruhari Mahtab, planned to meet on April 23 to discuss cotton plantations and scheduled a study tour in April. “We had to cancel both. In my panel, at least 15-16 members are in the National Capital Region or Uttar Pradesh and can travel by road to any panel meeting. But some of them were reluctant to come for meetings,” said Mahtab.A meeting of the agriculture committee was similarly cancelled, said officials. Another meeting of the IT panel, led by Congress leader Shashi Tharoor, had to be cancelled. Usually, three to four meetings of various parliamentary committees are scheduled in a week. Now, the schedule in the portal of both Houses is blank.On Saturday, the chart for booking committee rooms for Rajya Sabha panels showed that not a single room has been booked for May, indicating that panel members are possibly waiting for the Covid-19 wave to subside before deciding to meet.Officials said while the situation is preventing some lawmakers in other states from travelling to Delhi, many parliamentary officials are working from home. “So, even if a panel wants to meet, proper arrangements for that meeting may be a challenge,” said a senior official.Karti Chidambaram, a member of the IT panel, said, “It’s very unfortunate that no meetings are taking place. We repeatedly requested Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla and Rajya Sabha chairman Venkaiah Naidu to allow online meetings. If the PM can hold cabinet meetings online, why can’t Parliament committees meet digitally?”Officials said so far, no proposal to allow digital meetings has been taken up at the top level. “But if the situation continues, authorities might have to consider allowing digital meetings of standing committees,” said a second official||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/2nd-wave-of-covid-holds-up-parliamentary-panel-meets-101619895534077.html

Two nurses were also killed in the incident.At least 27 patients were undergoing treatment in the ICU of Patel Welfare Hospital and nearly 60 other patients were admitted in other wards when the fire erupted at midnight, police said.The hospital is located on Bharuch-Jambusar highway, nearly 200 km from Ahmedabad.While the exact cause of the fire is yet to be ascertained, fire department officials suspect a leak in an oxygen cylinder may have led to the fire.The fire was controlled within an hour and around 50 patients were shifted to nearby hospitals, officials said.Officials in the fire department said that the building where the blaze erupted did not possess a no objection certificate (NOC) for fire safety.“The hospital has two buildings. While the one where the incident occurred, did not have an NOC, another building had the document,” Bharuch regional fire officer Deepak Makhija told reporters.Offering his condolences to the kin of the deceased, Gujarat chief minister Vijay Rupani announced an ex-gratia of Rs.4 lakh to the families of each of the deceased.“I express my condolences to those who lost their lives in the fire at Bharuch hospital. The state government will provide assistance of ₹4 lakh to the families of each of the victims of the accident,” the chief minister said. The state government has ordered a judicial inquiry into the incident.Two IAS officers, additional chief secretary (ACS), labour and employment, Vipul Mitra, and commissioner, municipalities administration, Raj Kumar Beniwal, were directed to probe the incident. The two have already left for Bharuch.Earlier on March 26, four patients died while shifting after a fire broke out at a hospital in Surat.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/17-covid-patients-two-nurses-killed-in-fire-at-gujarat-hospital-101619893434586.html
02-05-2021||India||EC moves top court after HC says poll body was responsible for Covid surge||The Election Commission of India has moved the Supreme Court against Madras high court’s recent observations that the poll body was singularly responsible for the devastating second wave of Covid-19 in the country and that its officials should probably be tried on murder charges for allowing political parties to hold massive rallies without following norms.The Supreme Court will hear EC’s petition on Monday.The poll body approached the Supreme Court after it failed to secure a favourable order from the high court. On Friday, the high court refused to entertain EC’s application in this regard, saying that any such request will have to wait “in the light of the immediate measures that have to be put in place”.On April 26, the Madras high court made the scathing remarks against the EC during a hearing on a writ petition filed by Tamil Nadu transport minister MR Vijayabhaskar seeking a direction for safety measures and fairness during counting in Karur constituency from where he is contesting. “You are the only institution that is singularly responsible for the situation today...No action against political parties taking rallies despite court orders. Your election commission officials should be put up on murder charges probably,” the high court observed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ec-moves-top-court-after-hc-says-poll-body-was-responsible-for-covid-surge-101619893313924.html

The vaccine’s arrival is expected to boost India’s efforts to ramp up vaccination of its citizens even as limited supplies hit the third phase of the inoculation drive that started on May 1.“We are pleased to announce that the first consignment of 150,000 doses of the Sputnik V vaccine has landed in Hyderabad from Russia.

02-05-2021||India||US exempts students, journalists from travel restrictions to India||he United States government has exempted students, academics, journalists and some individuals from the restrictions imposed on travel from India for an indefinite period from May 4.A statement from the US state department on Friday said that the exemptions were made by secretary of state Antony Blinken by extending the National Interest Exceptions already in place for travel from Brazil, China, Iran and South Africa. “In keeping with the Department of State’s commitment to facilitate legitimate travel to the United States, Secretary Blinken decided today to apply the same set of National Interest Exceptions to India that he had previously applied to all other regional travel restrictions currently in effect as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic,” the state department said.The Biden administration announced restrictions on travel from India earlier on Friday attributing the move to the “extraordinarily high Covid-19 caseloads and multiple variants circulating in India”.The travel restrictions have been imposed in the wake of US assistance to India to tackle the current wave of the pandemic which is expected to peak mid-May, with the Institute of Health Metrics and Evaluation of the University of Washington projecting over 960,000 deaths by August. India recorded 392,497 new cases and added 3,667 deaths on Saturday, taking its cumulative tally to 19,555,440 and toll to 215,522.Calling the situation in India “very, very serious”, Gayle Smith, the state department coordinator of US global effort on Covid-19, said, “India is reporting an increasing number of cases almost every day. And the crisis has not peaked yet. The way this happens in a surge is there’s a lag time between when people are infected, when they become sick, and when they may need care.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/us-exempts-students-journalists-from-travel-restrictions-to-india-101619893193950.html
02-05-2021||India||Shortage hits Phase 3 of Covid-19 vaccination drive||The third phase of the country’s vaccination drive witnessed a slow start on Saturday as several states complained of an acute shortage of vaccines for the people in the 18 to 44 age group, with many of them still to procure stocks directly from manufacturers to widen the country’s immunisation drive amid a raging second wave of infections.Only a few states including Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh began the drive in the districts with high caseloads. Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal said large-scale inoculation of people in the 18-44 age group will begin in the national capital only from Monday.In order to ramp up the vaccination drive, the government on April 19 announced a “liberalised and accelerated” phase 3 of vaccinations for people in the 18-44 age group to begin from May 1. As part of its guidelines for the third phase, the Centre allowed states to directly procure vaccines from manufacturers, including the two domestic producers -- Serum Institute of India and Bharat Biotech.While SII is manufacturing the Covishield vaccine, Bharat Biotech is producing the indigenously developed Covaxin. Both are double-dose vaccines.While most states have placed orders for the vaccines, officials in several states have complained of delays in supply.Click here for full coverage on coronavirusOfficials in Maharashtra said that the state government plans to administer nearly 350,000 doses over the next week. The state has set up only five vaccination centres in each district so that government gets time to arrange for more vaccines.State health minister Rajesh Tope said: “We have received around 350,000 doses and are expecting another stock of 1.3 million to 1.4 million stock for this month based on which we have started our vaccination for all adults up to 44 years of age.”In Mumbai, the vaccination drive started at five centres, with the limit of beneficiaries at one centre at 200.In Uttar Pradesh, chief minister Yogi Adityanath launched the vaccination drive at the Avantibai hospital in Lucknow. Officials said that a state plane was sent to Hyderabad to procure Covaxin doses from Bharat Biotech International Limited.The drive began in seven districts -- Lucknow, Kanpur, Prayagraj, Meerut, Gorakhpur, Bareilly, and Varanasi -- that have reported high caseloads. “Here, the active cases are high. Hence, we begin from these districts and more districts will get the benefit later,” said additional chief secretary (health) Amit Mohan Prasad on Friday.Other states such as Haryana, Punjab, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Kerala and Karnataka, did not begin the vaccination drive owing to non-availability of vaccines.The Madhya Pradesh government hopes to begin vaccinating the people over 18 years of age from May 3, state health minister Prabhuram Chaudhary said. “MP requires 3.4 crore vaccines for the people of 18 to 44 years of age group. Initially, we have placed an order of 45 lakh vaccines, which is likely to be received by May 2,” Chaudhary said.Haryana additional chief secretary (health) Rajeev Arora said that the state government has placed an order of 6.6 million vaccine doses which they plan to allot in a phased manner.Meanwhile in Bihar, the state health society’s executive director Manoj Kumar said that Pune-based SII has refused to provide a bulk supply of 10 million doses. “Instead, the institute wanted the state government to place [an order of] its monthly requirement. We are sorting out the issues,” he said.In Tamil Nadu, officials said an order for 15 million doses was placed on April 28 but they were unsure when the stock would arrive. “The issue is the same (by when vaccines could be provided) for everyone, we are looking to settle it. It will be tricky to say when we can start at this point,” said TS Selvavinayagam, director, directorate of public health and preventive medicine.Citing a shortage of vaccines, the Kerala government has decided to prioritise the second doses of beneficiaries until it receives a fresh supply.“We have asked for 50 lakh doses but got less than 10 lakh. Our priority is to give second dose to maximum people. We will start for young age group as and when we get enough jabs,” said state health minister KK Shailaja. The Kerala government has decided to buy at least 10 million doses (7 million Covishield and 3 million Covaxin) from manufacturers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/shortage-hits-phase-3-of-vaccination-drive-101619893133991.html
02-05-2021||India||CBSE releases marking scheme for Class 10 students, results likely on June 20||The Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) on Saturday announced that Class 10 students will be marked on the basis of internal tests and assessments held throughout the year, days after it announced the cancellation of the board exams in view of the Covid-19 surge across the country. The results are likely to be announced on June 20, the board added.Usually, out of 100 marks for each subject, 20 marks are for internal assessments, which have already been tabulated by schools as per the existing policy, and the remaining 80 are for the year-end board examinations. The board has now announced that this 80-mark component will be calculated on the basis of different internal exams held during the year.The board has also certified the weightage that is to be given to each of these tests. For instance, period or unit test will have 10 marks, half-yearly or mid-term exams will be of 30 marks, whereas pre-board exams will be of 40 marks.CBSE Controller of Examination Sanyam Bhardwaj also directed composition of a ‘Result Committee’ in each school comprising of the school principal, five teachers from the school, and two external teachers from a neighbouring school.If schools have conducted more than one of the above mentioned tests, the result committee can decide the weightage of each test.“If any candidate has not appeared in any of the assessments conducted by the school, the school may conduct an offline/online or a telephonic one on one assessment and record documentary evidences to certify the recommendations,” Bhardwaj said. Since all schools will have a different question paper, the board has asked them to “internally moderate the marks to account for the school level variations by using a reliable reference standard.”Schools have said that they would be analyzing the circular in the coming days and work on it. Tania Joshi, principal of The Indian School, said that the board had laid out clear instructions with “well-defined” parameters which will help schools.“Including external teachers in result committee is a good step towards ensuring transparency. It will be a little cumbersome to manage everything including moderation and tabulation of marks. So we will hold a meeting among us to decide how to go about it. We will also be holding sessions with parents for their queries on the matter,” she said.For government schools, however, the notification comes with a concern due to the ongoing lockdown and rising cases.“The notification has come at critical juncture because cases are rising along with fatalities among teachers as well as their families. The board has asked us to form the result committee by May 5 and finalise the rationalize document by May 10. How can we do so with the ongoing lockdown and the fear of the disease with a shortage of beds and oxygen? CBSE should delay the process by a month,” said Awadhesh Kumar Kha, principal of Sarvodaya co-ed Vidyalaya in Rohini Sector 8, who lost a teacher to Covid on Saturday.Class 10 student Sudhanshu Poddar, who studies at a government school in Rohini, said, "We would have performed better in the board exams because students always take those more seriously than the internal exams.

Within the country, it carried out 158 sorties, airlifting 109 containers with a capacity of 2,271 MT,” it said.Defence public sector undertakings are procuring 28 oxygen generating plants and other medical equipment worth ₹40 crore under their corporate social responsibility scheme to support several hospitals.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/600-doctors-of-forces-set-to-join-covid-fight-101619892833980.html
02-05-2021||India||Under pressure from powerful to give jabs: Adar Poonawalla||Serum Institute of India (SII) CEO Adar Poonawalla said on Saturday that he was under immense pressure to deliver Covid vaccines fast and even faced threatening calls from powerful people as the second wave of the pandemic rages through the country, indicating that his company would start producing doses outside the country as well.The pressure was what led him to fly to London to be with his wife and children, Poonawalla, 40, told British newspaper The Times in an interview. “I’m staying here (in London) for an extended time because I don’t want to go back to that situation. Everything falls on my shoulders but I can’t do it alone... I don’t want to be in a situation where you are just trying to do your job, and just because you can’t supply the needs of X, Y or Z you really don’t want to guess what they are going to do,” he was quoted as saying by The Times.“The level of expectation and aggression is really unprecedented. It’s overwhelming. Everyone feels they should get the vaccine. They can’t understand why anyone else should get it before them,” he added.The calls come from powerful people demanding instant supplies of Covishield, he said. “‘Threats’ is an understatement.”The businessman was provided “Y” category security by the government earlier this week in view of the threat perception to him. “Y” category security entails a posse of at least four armed commandos to guard the protected person all the time.Poonawalla indicated that the move to London was linked to business plans to expand vaccine manufacturing to countries outside India, including the UK.“There’s going to be an announcement in the next few days,” he said, when asked about Britain as one of the production bases outside India.The SII has been exporting Covishield to 68 nations, though the focus has now firmly shifted back to India given the enormity of the outbreak in recent weeks. “We’re really gasping for all the help we can get,” Poonawalla said. “I don’t think even God could have forecast it was going to get this bad,” he said. On a question as to who was to blame, Poonawalla said, “If I give you the right answer, or any answer, my head would be chopped off... I can’t comment on the elections or Kumbh Mela. It’s too sensitive.”(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/under-pressure-from-powerful-to-give-jabs-siichief-101619892774497.html

Besides, no victory rally will be permitted throughout the state of Uttar Pradesh after the results are announced or during the counting process is in progress. This assurance is placed on record,” noted the court.“The state election commission has also agreed to notify the names of persons who will be in charge of the concerned counting centres and who will be made accountable for any lapse regarding compliance of the guidelines and the assurances recorded herein, at the given centres,” underlined the bench.It added that CCTV recordings at the designated counting areas and centres will be done and will be duly preserved till further directive of the Allahabad high court, where a related matter is pending.The court also made it mandatory for everyone entering the counting centres to produce negative Covid-19 test reports.During the proceedings, advocate Shoeb Alam, representing the petitioner, had produced a chart by UP Prathamik Shikshak Sangh, claiming more than 700 teachers lost their lives after they contracted Covid-19 during election service.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/uppanchayat-elections-sc-allows-counting-of-votes-after-poll-panel-s-assurance-101619892773985.html
02-05-2021||India||Nirav Modi moves UK high court against his extradition||Fugitive businessman Nirav Modi has approached the UK high court, seeking permission to appeal against his extradition to India, people familiar with the matter said on Saturday.The people cited above said that Nirav Modi filed his initial grounds to seek permission for his appeal on April 28 -- the last day of the 14-day deadline from the home secretary’s approval to the extradition.A Westminster Magistrate Court in London ordered his extradition on February 25. The extradition was approved by the UK home secretary Priti Patel on April 15.The people cited above said that Nirav Modi has challenged both the Westminster court order as well as Patel’s decision.The UK high court will first decide whether to allow his appeal or not. “If allowed, Nirav Modi will file perfected grounds challenging the extradition and a proper bench will hear the arguments. However, this will take six months to a year,” said an officer familiar with the appeals procedure in the UK.His counsel Zulfiquar Memon denied a comment on Saturday.Ordering his extradition, Westminster district judge Sam Goozee said Nirav Modi has a case to answer in India as he is alleged to have, along with his brother Nehal Modi and others, defrauded the Punjab National Bank, laundered the money taken from it and conspired to destroy evidence and intimidate witnesses. The court also dismissed Nirav Modi’s contention that he won’t get a fair trial in India and that he was being targeted due to political reasons.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nirav-modi-moves-uk-high-court-against-his-extradition-101619892713899.html

No action against political parties taking rallies despite court orders. Your election commission officials should be put up on murder charges probably,” the High Court had observed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/election-commission-moves-supreme-court-against-madras-hc-remarks-101619889234290.html
02-05-2021||India||Gangster-politician Shahabuddin shifted from Tihar jail, dies in Delhi hospital of Covid-19||Gangster-politician Mohammad Shahabuddin who tested positive for Covid-19 nearly 10 days ago died in a Delhi hospital on Saturday, according to officials at Tihar prison where the former Rashtriya Janata Dal lawmaker had spent the last four years on orders of the Supreme Court.Tihar prison officials had shifted 53-year-old Shahabuddin to Deen Dayal Upadhyay hospital on April 21 after his condition deteriorated. The four-time parliamentarian from Bihar’s Siwan tested positive for the disease on April 20.This is the fifth death in five days of a Tihar prisoner due to the disease that has overwhelmed the health system in many parts of the country including national capital Delhi.Shahabuddin was brought to Tihar prison in February 2017 on the Supreme Court’s order on petitions by Siwan-based businessman Chandrakeshwar Prasad, whose three sons were killed in two incidents. Two of them were drenched in acid before they were killed. Asha Ranjan, the wife of journalist Rajdeo Ranjan who was murdered in Siwan, also pleaded that they would never get a fair trial as long as Shahabuddin was in a Bihar jail.In 2017 when the Supreme Court heard the case, he had 45 criminal cases against him.At Tihar prison, Shahabuddin was only one of the three prisoners who did not share space with other prisoners and are lodged in the most secure part of the jail. The other two are underworld gangster Chhota Rajan and Delhi gangster Neeraj Bawana.Prison officers suspect Shahabuddin may have been infected with the virus through an asymptomatic jail officer.The death of four prisoners prompted Tihar Jail authorities on Thursday to ask the Delhi government to release prisoners under “emergency parole” help decongest the overcrowded prison.Tihar, the country’s largest prison complex with over 20,000 prisoners, has over 260 prisoners and 115 jail officers who have tested positive, up from just 19 infected prisoners just four weeks back.A petition that seeks parole for prisoners in the three city jails if they face charges of non-heinous offences is also pending in the Delhi high court. Last week, a bench of chief justice DN Patel and justice Jasmeet Singh asked the central and state government to respond to this request by May 4.Last year, nearly 6,000 prisoners were released on special parole and bail to decongest the jail when the pandemic first started spreading in March. With cases declining after the third wave of the infection in October-November, the Delhi high court in December ordered the prisoners to surrender in a phased manner between February and March.Until February, the prison population was less than 13,000. However, with over 6,000 inmates back in jail, the total number of inmates went beyond 20,500, twice the jail’s capacity of 10026. Officials said it is the highest population of inmates in the jail till date.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/gangsterpolitician-shahabuddin-shifted-from-tihar-jail-dies-in-delhi-hospital-101619861932878.html
02-05-2021||India||For India, Chinese firms to deliver 40,000 oxygen generators||Chinese companies are working around-the-clock to meet the demand of 40,000 oxygen generators from India, ambassador Sun Weidong has said, adding many organisations are using private channels to extend help to India.“As far as I know, Chinese companies have been accelerating production of at least 40,000 oxygen generators - orders placed by the Indian side, and they are working around the clock to deliver them as soon as possible. Many Chinese firms and private organisations are also using their own channels to provide various [forms of] help to India,” Sun, the Chinese ambassador to India, told Global Times, in an interview.In April, China supplied more than 5,000 ventilators, 21,569 oxygen generators, over 21 million masks and around 3,800 tons of medicine to India, Sun said, citing the statistics of the General Administration of Customs of China.On Friday, President Xi Jinping sent a message of condolence to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, saying as a close neighbour and partner, China understands the challenges India is facing and is ready to provide support and assistance to the best of its ability.Soon after on Friday, Chinese official media said state councilor and foreign minister Wang Yi had a telephone conversation with external affairs minister, S Jaishankar, saying China is very concerned about the new round of Covid-19 surge in India.Wang added China is willing to take the following measures according to India’s needs: “First, China will continue to encourage and support Chinese enterprises to speed up production and provide anti-epidemic materials to India. Second, facilitate customs clearance and transportation of anti-epidemic materials purchased by the Indian side. Third we will organise video exchanges between health and epidemic prevention experts of the two countries to share experience and effective measures in fighting the epidemic.”The Chinese minister said China supports India’s efforts and will ensure that all the required materials “flow to Indian entities without any delay”.Chinese companies will be supported to deliver the materials, and airports, customs and airlines will be instructed to smoothly facilitate the movement of goods, he said.Jaishankar appreciated Xi’s message of condolence to Modi, thanking the Chinese side for showing goodwill and unity, and for providing strong support for the Indian side in purchasing anti-epidemic supplies.Jaishankar said Indian entities were commercially procuring products and raw materials required for the Covid-19 response from suppliers in China. Jaishankar said “this process would be facilitated if various transport corridors and cargo flights remained open and the necessary logistics support [was] ensured expeditiously,” according to a statement from the external affairs ministry.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/for-india-chinese-firms-to-deliver-40-000-oxygen-generators-101619860192783.html
02-05-2021||Today's||The five lessons from five assembly polls||Election results in India are often considered indicative of future politics. But, not this time, as it hides, more than it reveals. This is because there is no national mood connecting the results of elections to the assemblies of four states and one Union Territory. It can be, more precisely, viewed as a state-by-state verdict. In three states (Assam, West Bengal, and Kerala), incumbents returned with emphatic victories, and in two states, incumbents lost (Tamil Nadu and Puducherry). Neither the victory nor losses of the incumbents can be attributed to the governance factor alone. What, then, are the key messages from the results?First, it would be a mistake to read the results as a verdict against the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led Centre owing to its failure in handling the Covid-19 crisis. Polling in states, other than Bengal, were over before the situation turned from bad to worse. And the scale of the Trinamool Congress (TMC)’s victory in Bengal suggests that the party was ahead even in the first five phases when normal campaigning took place. The BJP may well pay a political price in the future as the Covid-19 crisis continues to unfold. But a lot will depend on popular perceptions of how different parties responded in a time of crisis. Either way, this election was not a referendum on Covid-19 management. Second, while the BJP may take solace in the fact that, despite a tough contest, it retained Assam and will form a coalition government in Puducherry, it knows that its performance in West Bengal is below its conservative calculation of crossing the 100-seat mark. The collapse of the Left-Congress-Indian Secular Front coalition helped the TMC improve its previous record, but the fact that the BJP lost a chunk of its 2019 vote share should be a major cause of concern. This also, once again, exposes the limits of the BJP’s strategy of over-relying on Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s charisma, without presenting a credible state-level face, and expecting it to overcome the organisational ground game, especially in a state where you have an opponent such as Mamata Banerjee. Her personal popularity, much like Modi, is greater than her party. And, she excels in situations when pushed against the wall. Despite making a formidable entry into Bengal, the loss is going to pinch the BJP for some time, as this was not just an election but an emotional project for the party. Victory in Bengal would have given the BJP a huge ideological boost and narrative advantage till 2024.Third, the results may have masked the kind of polarising energies that have been unleashed in Assam and Bengal by both sides. India’s eastern frontier, by and large, had remained devoid of communal campaigns. However, the rhetoric used in this campaign, the alliances that were forged, and the social coalitions that were created in this election, will have far-reaching effects. The BJP did everything to inject religious polarisation into the DNA of Bengal’s political culture, and Banerjee ensured that even the most dormant identity markers in state politics were made salient. In Assam too, the communal polarisation has become stark. Fourth, the existential crisis has deepened for the Congress and the Nehru-Gandhi family. The party lost Puducherry even before the elections were announced, performed poorly West Bengal, couldn’t make a comeback in Assam and Kerala, and is only a junior partner in the winning alliance in Tamil Nadu. The Congress, in its desperation, allied with the All India United Democratic Front (AUDF) in Assam and seems to have revived a party that was in decline. This will affect the Congress’s strength in Assam in the future. Similarly, the Congress had high odds of winning Kerala. After all, the party had won 19 of 20 seats during the Lok Sabha elections in Kerala and Rahul Gandhi (who is an MP from the state) along with Priyanka Vadra campaigned hard. Yet, the party’s vote and seat tally seem to suggest that the Gandhi family has limited pull among India’s southern voters too. Party rebels may put aside their differences in the party’s presidential elections to be held soon, and continue to rally behind the family — but for how long? Fifth, the Left, which failed miserably in Bengal, managed to beat the pattern of an incumbent not returning to power in Kerala. This is likely to ensure that the Kerala faction will now emerge dominant within the Left, which has been dominated by the Bengal faction ever since EMS Namboodiripad’s era of the 1960s. Similarly, the results from Tamil Nadu indicate that the state will continue to revolve around two Dravidian poles, with limited space for other players.What all of this means is that nationally, the BJP will continue to remain the dominant player. The fulcrum of politics in states too will now have the BJP (and its allies) on one side and the principal state-level competitor (which could be the Congress in few states but will be primarily regional forces in most states). Banerjee, after this impressive performance, may be considered by the media as the face of the non-BJP opposition nationally, but it remains to be seen whether other players will easily privilege her with this position.In the normal course, such high-profile state elections can be relied upon to glean the contours of the emerging national picture. In this instance, however, the forces shaping national politics have been lurking in the backdrop. Every party can rejoice in its share of victories, but the furnace that will shape the future of Indian politics is the humanitarian crisis brought on by the Covid pandemic. The second wave has opened up this furnace, which has the potential to re-mould political equations, but its ultimate political fallout will depend on the response of different political parties in the coming months.

02-05-2021||Today's||The Bengal model to counter the BJP||The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) brought all of its political, financial and institutional might to bear in a bid to win the election in West Bengal. Virtually every other party in India would have folded under the pressure, but not the Trinamool Congress (TMC). Things looked grim for the TMC after the BJP surged to win 18 out of 42 seats in West Bengal during the 2019 Lok Sabha election. For many analysts, the BJP takeover of West Bengal in the 2021 state election was a fait accompli. The BJP had made its presence felt, its brand of Hindu-Muslim polarisation had proven effective in getting votes, and the backing of the Centre and its various instruments made it almost unbeatable.But the TMC turned the tables in the 2021 election, winning a massive 214 seats (out of a total of 292 contested seats) in the state to 76 seats for the BJP (with a 10 percentage point victory margin). How did the TMC do it? Fundamentally, the BJP knew it would have to win 60-65% of the Hindu vote in a state in which about 30% of the electorate is from the Muslim community. The TMC had to develop a narrative to counter the extraordinary Hindu-Muslim polarisation that was coming its way. With a campaign built around the popularity of Mamata Banerjee, the TMC sought to reduce the polarisation through the politics of gender and welfare.Banerjee’s TMC has assiduously built a base of support through a series of welfare schemes around educating girls and making sure there is no underage marriage, in addition to other targeted schemes on issues such as health care. In most of these schemes, the daughter or female head of household is a key beneficiary — which has built a strong base of support for the TMC among the state’s women voters. Furthermore, the quantum of targeted benefits has made Banerjee widely seen as the primary provider for the poor. This solid base of support among the poor and among women largely neutralised the BJP’s attempts at Hindu-Muslim polarisation.This is similar to the pattern of political support that many analysts believe Prime Minister (PM) Narendra Modi has benefited from. Highly popular targeted schemes, such as those around gas cylinders, and the advertising around them, have been a key electoral tool for the BJP — in building an aura around the PM. This has been crucial for the BJP to develop a broad coalition of support from female voters and the poor. What the West Bengal election shows is that charismatic regional leaders, who have the capacity to deliver significant targeted benefits, may plausibly use a similar strategy to win over voters.More worrying for the BJP is the fact that TMC’s strategy did not seem to be a case of “Bengali exceptionalism”. With a growing farmers’ movement in north India, and seething anger at the government’s feckless handling of the second wave of the coronavirus pandemic, there is growing frustration at the Centre’s ability to care for the needy. Even in Bengal, we heard complaints about the BJP being a party built around crony capitalism that is out of touch with the common person. The BJP has shown that its brand of politics is almost unassailable when competing against caste-based parties or other parties that indulge in a certain kind of identity-based politics. But the TMC’s triumph shows the BJP is susceptible to a politics built around economic class and gender.The politics of gender observed in this election is more important. It was about more than targeted benefits. It was also about the visuals of women displaying political power, from all-women’s rallies to making explicit demands on the system. This generated a political cost to the hyper-masculine and misogynistic comments attributed to some senior BJP leaders. When political interest is often caricatured by religion and caste, the politics of gender brings to the fore new demands and expectations that must be met by political actors. And it can plausibly change the ugly rhetoric that has characterised Indian politics over the past few years.Banerjee, with this landslide victory, immediately becomes the most important Opposition leader in India. She has shown that it is possible to construct an alternative “progressive” narrative that can take the BJP’s politics of Hindu nationalism head-on. Moreover, her reputation as a fearless street fighter will no doubt win her a large share of admirers.As our polity returns from election mode to the ugly realities of an India suffering a humanitarian tragedy of epic proportions, our national politics is being remade. While the BJP still has to be seen as the favourite to win the national election in 2024, make no mistake, this victory shows that the BJP can be beaten even when it unleashes its full might. Will the West Bengal state election serve as the launch pad for a credible challenge to the BJP? As they say, khela hobe (the game is on).

02-05-2021||Editorials||The return of federalism||With the Trinamool Congress (TMC) winning West Bengal for a third time, the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) returning to power in Tamil Nadu after a decade, the Left Democratic Front (LDF) breaking a four-decade-old electoral pattern to retain power in Kerala, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) retaining Assam, and the National Democratic Alliance coming to power in Puducherry for the first time, there is a mandate both for continuity and change in the different regions that went to polls. But the results will also have an impact on national politics in five different ways. One, there will be a restoration of a degree of balance in Indian federalism — which is good — and greater tension between the Centre and states, which needs careful management. In recent years, espec-ially after the BJP’s 2019 win, there has been a perception of the Centre undermining the powers of the states. The fact that three important states, Bengal, Tamil Nadu and Kerala, will be governed by parties which are politically and ideologically opposed to the BJP means that there will be a greater assertion of federal rights. The Centre has a choice — it can either double down or continue with its curr-ent approach where the BJP’s political aims often supersede the principle of cooperative federalism or it can be more collaborative. The states have a choice too — they can either become more confrontational for the sake of it or adopt a strong but constructive approach. Harmony would be a wiser course of action for both. Second, the BJP has undoubtedly faced a setback, at a time when its political capital is diminishing due to the Centre’s handling of the Covid-19 crisis. The BJP may want to satisfy itself with the definitely credible improvement in its performance in Bengal — but it fought to win, and that did not happen. It may satisfy itself with the fact that it had limited stakes in Tamil Nadu — but it did invest in its alliance with the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK), and this did not work. It will have to reconcile to the fact that the party is not in power in any of India’s big metros — Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai, Kolkata — which may have implications for its future electoral strength, though it must be underlined that national and state elections have shown different patterns. Three, the balance of power in the Opposition has decisively shifted from the Congress to regional parties. The Congress lost Assam despite the fact that the BJP was on the defensive on its citizenship agenda; it lost Kerala despite the fact that Rahul Gandhi is a parliamentarian from the state and it was the party’s turn to win; it is but a minor partner of the DMK in Tamil Nadu; it is almost decimated in Bengal; and it even managed to lose Puducherry. On the other hand, strong regional forces such as the TMC, the DMK and the Left (which is clearly a regional force now, not national) have done well. This will have implications for any understanding within the Opposition for the 2024 polls. Four, the election has shown both the possibilities and limits of religious polarisation. In Bengal, the BJP fought on the agenda of “appeasement” — a code to suggest that the TMC was partial to Muslims and that Hindus should, therefore, consolidate to defeat the incumbent. It was believed that the Citizenship (Amendment) Act was introduced by the BJP-led government to win over Hindu votes in Bengal. But the results show that its attempt at polarisation not only failed but may have boomeranged — the fear that the BJP would come to power resulted in Muslim consolidation behind the TMC, but the fear of TMC’s return was clearly not deeply felt among Hindus for them to consolidate behind the BJP. In Assam, however, the party succeeded with its explicitly polarising agenda — where the traditional insider-versus-outsider ethnic debate was converted to a Hindu-versus-Muslim religious debate. The politics of religion will persist but these results hold lessons. And finally, the elections have shown the importance of the politics of governance and welfare. Ms Banerjee’s women-centric schemes, the BJP’s strong welfare push in Assam, and the Left’s handling of both public health and natural disasters helped. This is indeed a continuation of the lesson from Narendra Modi’s own win in 2019, where welfare played an important role. It is now time for all the new governments to focus on Covid-19. Swear in the new chief ministers immediately, don’t fight over cabinet berths, and work on beating back the second wave.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/the-return-of-federalism-101619971318016.html
